abundances, carbon on HD 209458b is sequestered primarily as carbon monoxide
(CO) and methane (CH4). The relative mole fractions of CO(g) and CH4(g) in
chemical equilibrium are expected to vary greatly according to variations in
local temperature and pressure. We show, however, that in the p = 1--1000 mbar
range, chemical equilibrium does not hold. To explore disequilibrium effects,
we couple the chemical kinetics of CO and CH4 to a three-dimensional numerical
model of HD 209458b's atmospheric circulation. These simulations show that
vigorous dynamics caused by uneven heating of this tidally locked planet
homogenize the CO and CH4 concentrations at p < 1 bar, even in the presence of
lateral temperature variations of ~500--1000 K. In the 1--1000 mbar pressure
range, we find that over 98% of the carbon is in CO. This is true even in cool
regions where CH4 is much more stable thermodynamically. Our work shows
furthermore that planets 300--500 K cooler than HD 209458b can also have
abundant CO in their upper layers due to disequilibrium effects. We demonstrate
several interesting observational consequences of these results.

Lindblad resonance. This is relevant to the case of superhumps in SU Ursae
Majoris cataclysmic variables and other systems, where it is thought that this
resonance leads to growth of eccentricity and a modulation in the light curve
due to the interaction of a precessing eccentric disc with tidal stresses. A
single differential equation is formulated which describes the propagation,
resonant excitation and viscous damping of eccentricity. The theory is first
worked out in the simple case of a narrow ring and leads to the conclusion that
the eccentricity distribution is locally suppressed by the presence of the
resonance, creating a dip in the eccentricity at the resonant radius.
Application of this theory to the superhump case confirms this conclusion and
produces a more accurate expression for the precession rate of the disc than
has been previously accomplished with simple dynamical estimates.

such accretion events has become a very active field of astrophysical research.
The identification of a stellar ring-like structure in Monoceros, spanning more
than 100 degrees (Newberg et al. 2002), and the detection of an overdensity of
stars in the direction of the constellation of Canis Major (CMa, Martin et al.
2004), apparently associated to the ring, has led to the widespread belief that
a second galaxy being cannibalised by the Milky Way had been found. In this
scenario, the overdensity would be the remaining core of the disrupted galaxy
and the ring would be the tidal debris left behind. However, unlike the
Sagittarius dwarf, which is well below the Galactic plane and whose orbit, and
thus tidal tail, is nearly perpendicular to the plane of the Milky Way, the
putative CMa galaxy and ring are nearly co-planar with the Galactic disk. This
severely complicates the interpretation of observations. In this letter, we
show that our new description of the Milky Way leads to a completely different
picture. We argue that the Norma-Cygnus spiral arm defines a distant stellar
ring crossing Monoceros and the overdensity is simply a projection effect of
looking along the nearby local arm. Our perspective sheds new light on a very
poorly known region, the third Galactic quadrant (3GQ), where CMa is located.

seen roughly edge-on, leading to obscuration of the central radiation source
and a silicate absorption feature near 10 micron. While most of the current
torus models distribute the dust smoothly, there is growing evidence that the
dust must be arranged in clouds. We describe a new method for modeling near-
and mid-infrared emission of 3-dimensional clumpy tori using Monte Carlo
simulations. We calculate the radiation fields of individual clouds at various
distances from the AGN and distribute these clouds within the torus region. The
properties of the individual clouds and their distribution within the torus are
determined from a theoretical approach of self-gravitating clouds close to the
shear limit in a gravitational potential. We demonstrate that clumpiness in AGN
tori can overcome the problem of over-pronounced silicate features. Finally, we
present model calculations for the prototypical Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068 and
compare them to recent high-resolution measurements. Our model is able to
reproduce both the SED and the interferometric observations of NGC 1068 in the

stress that additional, lower-luminosity AGN are expected to be present in the

X-ray luminosities are too high for their X-ray emission to be due to
populations of low-mass X-ray binaries or hot, gaseous halos. We attribute the
significant difference in visible and X-ray AGN identification to dilution of
low-luminosity AGN spectral signatures by host galaxy starlight and/or
obscuration of accretion onto the central, supermassive black hole.

prompt and the afterglow emission could be observed simultaneously and in their
entirety by the three Swift instruments. Indeed, Swift-BAT triggered on a
precursor ~570s before the main burst peak, and this allowed Swift to repoint
the narrow field instruments to the burst position ~350s before the main burst
occurred. GRB 060124 also triggered Konus-Wind, which observed the prompt
emission in a harder gamma-ray band (up to 2MeV). Thanks to these exceptional
circumstances, the temporal and spectral properties of the prompt emission can
be studied in the optical, X-ray and gamma-ray ranges. While the X-ray emission
(0.2-10keV) clearly tracks the gamma-ray burst, the optical component follows a
different pattern, likely indicating a different origin, possibly the onset of
external shocks. The prompt GRB spectrum shows significant spectral evolution,
with both the peak energy and the spectral index varying. As observed in
several long GRBs, significant lags are measured between the hard- and
low-energy components, showing that this behaviour extends over 3 decades in
energy. The GRB peaks are also much broader at soft energies. This is related
to the temporal evolution of the spectrum, and can be accounted for by assuming
that the electron spectral index softened with time. The burst energy
(E_iso~5x10^{53} erg) and average peak energy (E_p~300keV) make GRB 060124
consistent with the Amati relation. The X-ray afterglow is characterized by a
decay which presents a break at t_b~10^5s.

resolution, high signal-to-noise observations warrant spectral modeling which
both accounts for relativistic effects, and treats the physics of radiative
transfer in detail. In Davis et al. (2005) we presented spectral models which
accounted for non-LTE effects, Compton scattering, and the opacities due to
ions of abundant metals. Using a modification of this method, we have tabulated
spectra for black hole masses typical of Galactic binaries. We make them
publicly available for spectral fitting as an Xspec model. These models
represent the most complete realization of standard accretion disk theory to

a slightly narrower distribution as reported by Astier et al. in 2005, match
the predictions of the plasma-redshift cosmology. The standard deviation of the
SNLS-magnitude from the predicted curve is only about 0.14. The data indicate
that there is no cosmic time dilation. The big-bang cosmology therefore appears
false. The plasma redshift, which follows from exact evaluation of photons
interaction with hot sparse electron plasma, leads to a quasi-static, infinite,
and everlasting universe. It does not need big bang, dark energy, or dark
matter for describing the observations. It predicts intrinsic redshifts of
galaxies consistent with what is observed. The Hubble constant that best fits
the SNLS data is about 63 km per sec per Mpc. This corresponds to an average
electron density of about 0.0002 per cubic centimeter in intergalactic space.
This density together with the plasma redshift heating to an average plasma
temperature in intergalactic space of about 3 million K explains the observed

  the Reionization of Cosmic Hydrogen","19 pages, 9 figures. Submitted to ApJ",,"10.1086/511948",,"astro-ph",,"  Population-III (Pop-III) starformation (SF) is thought to be quenched when
the metallicity of the star-forming gas reaches a critical level. At high z,
when the general intergalactic medium (IGM) was enriched with metals, the
fraction of primordial gas already collapsed in minihalos was significantly
larger than the fraction of primordial gas that had already been involved in
Pop-III SF. We argue that this minihalo gas remained largely in a metal-free
state, until these minihalos merged into large systems and formed stars. As a
result, the era of Pop-III SF was significantly prolonged, leading to an
integrated Pop-III SF an order of magnitude larger than expected for an abrupt
transition redshift. The contribution of Pop-III SF to the reionization of
hydrogen could have been significant until z~10 and may have extended to z~6.
Our modeling allows for gradual enrichment of the IGM, feedback from
photo-ionization and screening of reionization by minihalos. Nevertheless,
extended Pop-III SF can result in complex, multi-peaked reionization histories.
The contribution of Pop-III stars to reionization will be tested by the
three-year WMAP results: (1) if Pop-III stars do not contribute to
reionization, tau_es<0.05-0.06 and a rapid reionization at z~6 is expected; (2)
if the product of star formation efficiency and escape fraction for Pop-III
stars is significantly larger than for Pop-II stars, then a maximum tau_es=0.21
is achievable; (3) in a scenario where the product of star formation efficiency
and escape fraction for Pop-III stars is comparable to that for Pop-II stars,
tau_es=0.09-0.12 would be observed, with reionization histories characterized
by an extended ionization plateau from z=7-12. This result holds regardless of
the redshift where the IGM becomes enriched with metals.

  to be a 2-zone satellite with a rock-graphite core and water ice mantle. New

  the first dedicated radio science flypast of Titan on 27 February 2006.
  Cassini should discover mass anomalies in the upper mantle of Titan that
  correspond with the burial sites of ~ 2 former native moons of Saturn",,,,"astro-ph",,"  I report the results of a new set of calculations for the gravitational
contraction of the proto-solar cloud to quantify the idea that Titan may be a
captured moon of Saturn (Prentice 1981, 1984). It is proposed that Titan
initially condensed as a secondary embryo in the same proto-solar gas ring from
which the central solid core and gaseous envelope of Saturn were acquired. At
the orbit of Saturn, the bulk chemical constituents of the condensate are rock
(mass fraction 0.494), water ice (0.474), and graphite (0.032). The mean
density is 1523 kg/m^3. Structural models for a frozen Titan yield a mean
density of 2095 kg/m^3 (chemically homogeneous case) and 1904 kg/m^3 (fully
differentiated 2-zone case). The agreement to one percent of the latter value
with the observed mean density suggests that Titan is indeed a fully
differentiated satellite. The value of C/MR^2 for this model is 0.316. It is
predicted that Titan has no internal ocean or induced magnetic field but it may
possess a small native dipole field of magnitude 2 x 10^11 Tesla m^3 due to
thermoremanent magnetization fed by the ancient magnetic field of Saturn.
Capture of Titan was achieved by gas drag at the edge of the proto-Saturnian
envelope at a time when that cloud had a radius close to the present orbital
size of Titan. Collisional drag was also probably an important agent in
securing the capture of Titan. Perhaps Hyperion is the shattered remnant of a
pre-existing native moon of Saturn that was destroyed on the arrival of Titan.
Titan should thus have much the same appearance as Triton, being nearly smooth,
crater-free and streaked with elemental carbon (Prentice 2004a).

metallic plates at zero and non-zero temperatures, we present the study of
microscopic models to determine the large-distance asymptotic force in the
high-temperature regime. Casimir's conducting plates are modelized by plasmas
of interacting charges at temperature T. The charges are either classical, or
quantum-mechanical and coupled to a (classical) radiation field. In these
models, the force obtained is twice weaker than that arising from standard
treatments neglecting the microscopic charge fluctutations inside the bodies.
The enforcement of inert boundary conditions on the field in the usual
calculations turns out to be inadequate in this regime.
  Other aspects of dispersion forces are also reviewed. The status of
(non-retarded) van der Waals-London forces in a dilute medium of non-zero
temperature and density is investigated. In a proper scaling regime called the
atomic limit (high dilution and low temperature), one is able to give the exact
large-distance atomic correlations up to exponentially small terms as T->0.
  Retarded van der Waals forces and forces between dielectric bodies are also
reviewed.
  Finally, the Casimir effect in critical phenomena is addressed by considering
the free Bose gas. It is shown that the grand-canonical potential of the gas in
a slab at the critical value of the chemical potential has finite size
corrections of the standard Casimir type. They can be attributed to the
existence of long-range order generated by gapless excitations in the phase
with broken continuous symmetry.

Gluonic fluctuations induce a strong first-order phase transition, in contrast
to electronic superconductors where this transition is weakly first order. The
critical temperature for this transition is larger than the one corresponding
to the diquark pairing instability. The physical reason is that the gluonic
Meissner masses suppress long-wavelength fluctuations as compared to the normal
conducting phase where gluons are massless, which stabilizes the
superconducting phase. In weak coupling, we analytically compute the
temperatures associated with the limits of metastability of the normal and
superconducting phases, as well as the latent heat associated with the
first-order phase transition. We then extrapolate our results to intermediate

conserved quantities of the solutions of third order Lovelock gravity with zero
curvature boundary at constant $t$ and $r$. Then, we compute the charged
rotating solutions of this theory in $n+1$ dimensions with a complete set of
allowed rotation parameters. These charged rotating solutions present black
hole solutions with two inner and outer event horizons, extreme black holes or
naked singularities provided the parameters of the solutions are chosen
suitable. We compute temperature, entropy, charge, electric potential, mass and
angular momenta of the black hole solutions, and find that these quantities
satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. We find a Smarr-type formula and
perform a stability analysis by computing the heat capacity and the determinant
of Hessian matrix of mass with respect to its thermodynamic variables in both
the canonical and the grand-canonical ensembles, and show that the system is
thermally stable. This is commensurate with the fact that there is no
Hawking-Page phase transition for black objects with zero curvature horizon.

respective limits. From the solutions of self-consistency condition represented
by the extrema of free energy of the system, it is found that a part of

implies that the extension of ansatz works as a device to distinguish the
stable solutions from the unstable ones. It is also found that there is a
non-trivial accumulation of extrema including the SO(4)-preserving solution,
which may lead to the formation of plateau.

a proof of the equivalence of these three forms using q-series methods combined

the observation that the graded parafermion theory -- which is equivalent to
the coset osp(1,2)_k/ u(1) -- can be factored as (osp(1,2)_k/ su(2)_k) x
(su(2)_k/ u(1)), with the two cosets on the right equivalent to the minimal

under constant relative enstrophy - for a coupled barotropic flow - rotating
solid sphere system is introduced with the following consequences. In
particular, angular momentum is transfered between the fluid and the solid
sphere through a modelled torque mechanism. The fluid's angular momentum is
therefore not fixed but only bounded by the relative enstrophy, as is required
of any model that supports super-rotation.
  The main results are: At any rate of spin $\Omega $ and relative enstrophy,
the unique global energy maximizer for fixed relative enstrophy corresponds to
solid-body super-rotation; the counter-rotating solid-body flow state is a
constrained energy minimum provided the relative enstrophy is small enough,
otherwise, it is a saddle point.
  For all energy below a threshold value which depends on the relative
enstrophy and solid spin $\Omega $, the constrained energy extremals consist of
only minimizers and saddles in the form of counter-rotating states$.$ Only when
the energy exceeds this threshold value can pro-rotating states arise as global
maximizers.
  Unlike the standard barotropic vorticity model which conserves angular
momentum of the fluid, the counter-rotating state is rigorously shown to be
nonlinearly stable only when it is a local constrained minima. The global
constrained maximizer corresponding to super-rotation is always nonlinearly
stable.

optimal control problem is formulated, where the control corresponds to
scheduling and routing, and the cost is a cumulative discounted functional of
the system's state. We examine two versions of the problem: ``nonpreemptive,''
where service is uninterruptible, and ``preemptive,'' where service to a
customer can be interrupted and then resumed, possibly at a different station.
We study the problem in the asymptotic heavy traffic regime proposed by Halfin
and Whitt, in which the arrival rates and the number of servers at each station
grow without bound. The two versions of the problem are not, in general,
asymptotically equivalent in this regime, with the preemptive version showing
an asymptotic behavior that is, in a sense, much simpler. Under appropriate
assumptions on the structure of the system we show: (i) The value function for
the preemptive problem converges to $V$, the value of a related diffusion
control problem. (ii) The two versions of the problem are asymptotically
equivalent, and in particular nonpreemptive policies can be constructed that
asymptotically achieve the value $V$. The construction of these policies is
based on a Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation associated with $V$.

use two Euler schemes with steps $\delta$ and $\delta^{\beta},0<\beta<1$. This
leads to an algorithm which, for a given level of the statistical error, has a
complexity significantly lower than the complexity of the standard Monte Carlo
method. We analyze the asymptotic error of this algorithm in the context of
general (possibly degenerate) diffusions. In order to find the optimal $\beta$
(which turns out to be $\beta=1/2$), we establish a central limit type theorem,
based on a result of Jacod and Protter for the asymptotic distribution of the
error in the Euler scheme. We test our method on various examples. In

as a by-product, an explicit expansion of the discretization error.

data have been performed in a finite nucleus framework. They led to the
extraction of G_n/G_p values in agreement with pure theoretical estimates, thus
providing an evidence for the solution of a longstanding puzzle. Here we
present an alternative approach to the problem, based on a nuclear matter
formalism extended to finite nuclei via the local density approximation. The
work is motivated by the exigence to make the determination of G_n/G_p from
data less model dependent. One-meson-exchange potentials are used for
describing both the one- and two-nucleon induced decays, Lambda N -> n N and
Lambda N N -> n N N. For the latter, treated within a microscopic approach, the
channels Lambda n n -> n n n and Lambda p p -> n p p are included in addition
to the mode Lambda n p -> n n p already considered, in a phenomenological way,
in previous studies. The propagation of the final nucleons in the residual
nucleus is simulated by an intranuclear cascade code. We evaluate single and
double coincidence nucleon spectra for the non-mesonic decay of C-12-Lambda.
Through the comparison of our predictions with KEK coincidence data we
determine G_n/G_p=0.43 \pm 0.10 for this hypernucleus, confirming previous

received increased attention recently, one of the earliest examples has been
almost totally neglected the alignment of particles relative to the beam axis,
as opposed to about the beam axis. However, since the alignment torques
determine how particles align in a trap, they are directly relevant to
practical applications. Lysozyme crystals are an ideal model system to study
factors determining the orientation of nonspherical birefringent particles in a
trap. Both their size and their aspect ratio can be controlled by the growth
parameters, and their regular shape makes computational modeling feasible. We
show that both external shape and internal birefringence anisotropy contribute
to the alignment torque. Three-dimensionally trapped elongated objects either
align with their long axis parallel or perpendicular to the beam axis depending
on their size. The shape-dependent torque can exceed the torque due to
birefringence, and can align negative uniaxial particles with their optic axis
parallel to the electric field, allowing an application of optical torque about
the beam axis.

the definition of a set of Systematic and Approximately Separable and Modular

branched molecules, and the imposition of constraints on the most rapidly
oscillating degrees of freedom. All these tools are used to study the effects
of constraints in the Conformational Equilibrium Distribution (CED) of the

measure the conformational dependence of the correcting terms to the naive CED

These terms are related to mass-metric tensors determinants and also occur in
the Fixman's compensating potential. We show that some of the corrections are
non-negligible if one is interested in the whole Ramachandran space. On the
other hand, if only the energetically lower region, containing the principal
secondary structure elements, is assumed to be relevant, then, all correcting
terms may be neglected up to peptides of considerable length. This is the first
time, as far as we know, that the analysis of the conformational dependence of
these correcting terms is performed in a relevant biomolecule with a realistic

growth drives the invasive advance of a favorable mutation. We model a
two-allele competition where recurrent mutation introduces a genotype with a
rate of local propagation exceeding the resident's rate. We capture
ecologically important properties of the rare invader's stochastic dynamics by
assuming discrete individuals and neighborhood interactions. To understand how
individual-level processes may govern population patterns, we invoke the
physical theory for nucleation of spatial systems. Nucleation theory
discriminates between single-cluster and multi-cluster dynamics. A sufficiently
low mutation rate, or a sufficiently small environment, generates
single-cluster dynamics, an inherently stochastic process; a favorable mutation
advances only if the invader cluster reaches a critical radius. For this mode
of invasion we identify the probability distribution of waiting times until the
favored allele advances to competitive dominance, and we ask how the critical
cluster size varies as propagation or mortality rates vary. Increasing the
mutation rate or system size generates multi-cluster invasion, where spatial
averaging produces nearly deterministic global dynamics. For this process, an
analytical approximation from nucleation theory, called Avrami's Law, describes
the time-dependent behavior of the genotype densities with remarkable accuracy.
