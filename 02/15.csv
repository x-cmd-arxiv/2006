types, we have carried out a detailed study of the history of element
production by spheroidal and dwarf irregular galaxies. Spheroidal galaxies
suffer a strong and intense star formation episode at early times. In dwarf
irregulars, the SFR proceeds at a low regime but continuously. Both galactic
types enrich the IGM with metals, by means of galactic winds. We have assumed
that the galaxy number density is fixed and normalized to the value of the
optical luminosity function observed in the local universe. Our models allow us
to investigate in detail how the metal fractions locked up in spheroid and
dwarf irregular stars, in the ISM and ejected into the IGM have changed with
cosmic time. By relaxing the instantaneous recycling approximation and taking
into account stellar lifetimes, for the first time we have studied the
evolution of the chemical abundance ratios in the IGM and compared our
predictions with a set of observations by various authors. Our results indicate
that the bulk of the IGM enrichment is due to spheroids, with dwarf irregular
galaxies playing a negligible role. Our predictions grossly account for the
[O/H] observed in the IGM at high redshift, but overestimate the [C/H].
Furthermore, it appears hard to reproduce the abundance ratios observed in the
high-redshift IGM. Some possible explanations are discussed in the text. This
is the first attempt to study the abundance ratios in the IGM by means of
detailed chemical evolution models which take into account the stellar
lifetimes. Numerical simulations adopting our chemical evolution prescriptions
could be useful to improve our understanding of the IGM chemical enrichment.

two were extended, and one was not detected in the Chandra observation but is
likely a flare star. One of the extended sources may be a pulsar wind nebula,
but if so it is probably not associated with the nearby SNR. We are then left
with no identified neutron stars in these six SNRs down to luminosity limits of

limit of extremely weak magnetic field, i.e., as the ratio of ion cyclotron
frequency to orbital frequency (X) becomes small. Considered only in terms of
cold two-fluid theory, instability persists to arbitrarily small values of X,
and the maximum growth rate is of order the orbital frequency except for the
range m_e/m_i < |X| < 1, where it can be rather smaller. In this range, field
aligned with rotation (X > 0) produces slower growth than anti-aligned field (X
< 0). The maximum growth rate is generally achieved at smaller and smaller
wavelengths as |X| diminishes. When |X| < m_e/m_i, new unstable
""electromagnetic-rotational"" modes appear that do not depend on the equilibrium
magnetic field. Because the most rapidly-growing modes have extremely short
wavelengths when |X| is small, they are often subject to viscous or resistive
damping, which can result in suppressing all but the longest wavelengths, for
which growth is much slower. We find that this sort of damping is likely to
curtail severely the frequently-invoked mechanism for cosmological magnetic
field growth in which a magnetic field seeded by the Biermann battery is then
amplified by the magneto-rotational instability. On the other hand, the small
|X| case may introduce interesting effects in weakly-ionized disks in which
dust grains carry most of the electric charge.

stellar populations (as measured with SAURON) often contain a distinctly young
central region (on scales of a few hundred parsec or less) compared to the rest
of the galaxy. Moreover, these compact, young components are found to be mostly
counter-rotating with respect to the rest of the galaxy. Given that there is no
well-established reason for such young components to `prefer' counter- over
co-rotation, this finding raises the following questions: How common are these
small KDCs as a function of age? Why are there more young than old compact
KDCs? Where are the equivalent co-rotating components? We explore these
questions using simple simulated velocity fields and stellar population models,
and find that the fading of the young component as it evolves, coupled with the
fact that counter-rotating components are more easily detected in the velocity
field, may help explain the observed trends.

warm dark matter universe with a cosmological constant. We compare a set of
simulations using a single cosmological realization but with a wide range of
warm dark matter particle masses which have not yet been conclusively ruled out
by observations. The addition of a warm dark matter component to the initial
power spectrum results in a delay in the collapse of high density gas at the
center of the most massive halo in the simulation and, as a result, an increase
in the virial mass of this halo at the onset of baryon collapse. Both of these
effects become more pronounced as the warm dark matter particle mass becomes
smaller. A cosmology using a gravitino warm dark matter power spectrum assuming
a particle mass of m_{WDM} ~ 40keV is effectively indistinguishable from the
cold dark matter case, whereas the m_{WDM} ~ 15 keV case delays star formation
by approx. 10^8 years. There is remarkably little scatter between simulations
in the final properties of the primordial protostar which forms at the center
of the halo, possibly due to the overall low rate of halo mergers which is a
result of the WDM power spectrum. The detailed evolution of the collapsing halo
core in two representative WDM cosmologies is described. At low densities
(n_{b} <= 10^5 cm^{-3}), the evolution of the two calculations is qualitatively
similar, but occurs on significantly different timescales, with the halo in the
lower particle mass calculation taking much longer to evolve over the same
density range and reach runaway collapse. Once the gas in the center of the
halo reaches relatively high densities (n_{b} >= 10^5 cm^{-3}) the overall
evolution is essentially identical in the two calculations.

infrared galaxies, expected based on the presence of mid-infrared ice
absorption in their spectra and the known far infrared optical properties of
ice, is still largely unsupported by direct observation owing to insufficient

here.
  A clear consequence of far infrared ice emission is the need to extend the
range of redshifts considered for submillimeter sources. This is demonstrated
via the example of HDF 850.1.
  The solid phase of the ISM during reionization may be dominated by ice, and
this could lead to the presence of reionization sources in submillimeter source
catalogs. Submillimeter sources not detected at 24 micron in the GOODS-N field
are examined. Two candidate reionization sources are identified at 3.6 micron
through possible Gunn-Peterson saturation in the Z band.

large-scale environment up to z=1.5 from the VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey (VVDS) first
epoch data. The 3D galaxy density field is reconstructed using a sample of 6582
galaxies with 17.5 < I_{AB} < 24 and measured spectroscopic redshifts. We split
the sample in four redshift bins up to z=1.5 and in under-dense and over-dense
environments according to the average density contrast \delta=0. There is a
strong dependence of the Luminosity Function (LF) with large-scale environment
up to z=1.2: the LF shape is observed to have a steeper slope in under-dense
environments. We find a continuous brightening of \Delta M* ~0.6 mag from
z=0.25 to z=1.5 both in under-dense and over-dense environments. The rest-frame
B-band luminosity density continuously increases in under-dense environments
from z=0.25 to z=1.5 whereas its evolution in over-dense environments presents
a peak at z~0.9. We interpret the peak by a complex interplay between the
decrease of the star formation rate and the increasing fraction of galaxies at
\delta>0 due to hierarchical growth of structures. As the environmental
dependency of the LF shape is already present at least up to z=1.2, we
therefore conclude that either the shape of the LF is imprinted very early on
in the life of the Universe, a `nature' process, or that `nurture' physical
processes shaping up environment relation have already been efficient earlier
than a look-back time corresponding to 30% of the current age of the Universe.

arriving at Earth from the general direction of the galactic center have been
reported from the analysis of AGASA and SUGAR data. The more recently

detected an unusually soft TeV source roughly coincident with the location of
the previously claimed CR anisotropy. In this paper, we develop a model for the
TeV emission from this object, consistent with observations at other
wavelengths, and examine the circumstances under which it might have
contributed to the $\sim$ EeV cosmic ray spectrum. We find that the supernova
remnant G8.7-0.1 can plausibly account for all the known radiative
characteristics of HESS J1804-216, but that it can accelerate cosmic rays only
up to an energy $\sim 10^5$ GeV. On the other hand, the pulsar (PSR J1803-2137)
embedded within this remnant can in principle inject EeV protons into the
surrounding medium, but it cannot account for the broadband spectrum of HESS
J1804-216. We therefore conclude that although G8.7-0.1 is probably the source
of TeV photons originating from this direction, there is no compelling
theoretical motivation for expecting a cosmic ray anisotropy at this location.
However, if G8.7-0.1 is indeed correctly identified with HESS J1804-216, it
should also produce a $\sim$ GeV flux detectable in a one-year all sky survey
by GLAST.

great topical interest. Accordingly, in this paper we focus on the electron
surfing process. Self-consistent kinetic simulations, using both relativistic
Vlasov and PIC (Particle In Cell) approaches, show here that electrons can be
accelerated to highly relativistic energies (up to 100 m_e c^2) if the phase
speed of the electrostatic wave is mildly relativistic (0.6c to 0.9c for the
magnetic field strengths considered). The acceleration is strong because of
relativistic stabilisation of the nonlinearly saturated electrostatic wave,
seen in both relativistic Vlasov and PIC simulations. An inverse power law
momentum distribution can arise for the most strongly accelerated electrons.
These results are of relevance to observed rapid changes in the radio
synchrotron emission intensities from microquasars, gamma ray bursts and other
astrophysical objects that require rapid acceleration mechanisms for electrons.

occasionally less than zero. A scalar potential model (SPM) that links the
galaxy scale $z$ to the cosmological scale $z$ of the Hubble Law is postulated.
Several differences among galaxy types suggest that spiral galaxies are Sources
and that early type, lenticular, and irregular galaxies are Sinks of a scalar
potential field. The morphology-radius and the intragalactic medium cluster
observations support the movement of matter from Source galaxies to Sink
galaxies. A cell structure of galaxy groups and clusters is proposed to resolve
a paradox concerning the scalar potential like the Olber's paradox concerning
light. For the sample galaxies, the ratio of the luminosity of Source galaxies
to the luminosity of Sink galaxies approaches $2.7 \pm 0.1$. An equation is
derived from sample data, which is anisotropic and inhomogeneous, relating $z$
of and the distance $D$ to galaxies. The calculated $z$ has a correlation
coefficient of 0.88 with the measured $z$ for a sample of 32 spiral galaxies
with $D$ calculated using Cepheid variable stars. The equation is consistent
with $z<0$ observations of close galaxies. At low cosmological distances, the
equation reduces to $z \approx \exp(KD) \, -1 \approx KD$, where $K$ is a
constant, positive value. The equation predicts $z$ from galaxies over 18 Gpc
distant approaches a constant value on the order of 500. The SPM of $z$
provides a physical basis for the $z$ of particle photons. Further, the SPM
qualitatively suggests the discrete variations in $z$, which was reported by W.
G. Tifft, 1997, Astrophy. J. 485, 465 and confirmed by others, are consistent

qualitatively new features of coexistence, competition and collapse of rotating
spiral waves (RSWs) in three-level excitable media under conditions of strong

by unusual mechanism of RSWs evolution when RSW's cores get into the surface
layer of an active medium (i.~e. the layer of ACs resided at the absorbing
boundary). Instead of well known scenario of RSW collapse, which takes place
after collision of RSW's core with absorbing boundary, we observed complicated
transformations of the core leading to nonlinear ''reflection'' of the RSW from
the boundary or even to birth of several new RSWs in the surface layer. To our
knowledge, such nonlinear ''reflections'' of RSWs and resulting die hard
vorticity in excitable media with absorbing boundaries were unknown earlier.

subtleties due to singularities in the critical behavior of the coexistence

decision-making under uncertainty. In each round, a gambler must pull one of
$K$ arms of a slot machine, without any foreknowledge of their payouts, except
that they are uniformly bounded. A standard objective is to minimize the
gambler's regret, defined as the gambler's total payout minus the largest
payout which would have been achieved by any fixed arm, in hindsight. Note that
the gambler is only told the payout for the arm actually chosen, not for the
unchosen arms.
  Almost all previous work on this problem assumed the payouts to be
non-adaptive, in the sense that the distribution of the payout of arm $j$ in
round $i$ is completely independent of the choices made by the gambler on
rounds $1, \dots, i-1$. In the more general model of adaptive payouts, the
payouts in round $i$ may depend arbitrarily on the history of past choices made
by the algorithm.
  We present a new algorithm for this problem, and prove nearly optimal
guarantees for the regret against both non-adaptive and adaptive adversaries.
After $T$ rounds, our algorithm has regret $O(\sqrt{T})$ with high probability
(the tail probability decays exponentially). This dependence on $T$ is best
possible, and matches that of the full-information version of the problem, in
which the gambler is told the payouts for all $K$ arms after each round.
  Previously, even for non-adaptive payouts, the best high-probability bounds
known were $O(T^{2/3})$, due to Auer, Cesa-Bianchi, Freund and Schapire. The
expected regret of their algorithm is $O(T^{1/2}) for non-adaptive payouts, but
as we show, $\Omega(T^{2/3})$ for adaptive payouts.

  Tradeoff","Revised submission to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  A recent result of Zheng and Tse states that over a quasi-static channel,
there exists a fundamental tradeoff, referred to as the diversity-multiplexing
gain (D-MG) tradeoff, between the spatial multiplexing gain and the diversity
gain that can be simultaneously achieved by a space-time (ST) block code. This
tradeoff is precisely known in the case of i.i.d. Rayleigh-fading, for T>=
n_t+n_r-1 where T is the number of time slots over which coding takes place and
n_t,n_r are the number of transmit and receive antennas respectively. For T <
n_t+n_r-1, only upper and lower bounds on the D-MG tradeoff are available.
  In this paper, we present a complete solution to the problem of explicitly
constructing D-MG optimal ST codes, i.e., codes that achieve the D-MG tradeoff
for any number of receive antennas. We do this by showing that for the square
minimum-delay case when T=n_t=n, cyclic-division-algebra (CDA) based ST codes
having the non-vanishing determinant property are D-MG optimal. While
constructions of such codes were previously known for restricted values of n,
we provide here a construction for such codes that is valid for all n.
  For the rectangular, T > n_t case, we present two general techniques for
building D-MG-optimal rectangular ST codes from their square counterparts. A
byproduct of our results establishes that the D-MG tradeoff for all T>= n_t is
the same as that previously known to hold for T >= n_t + n_r -1.

to an observer falling freely from infinity, initially at rest. The size
shrinks for an observer falling freely from infinity, with a positive initial

Unification in a scale TeV, quantum gravity in this scale and deviation of

production of Higgs bosons from them via Hawking radiation. This is a different
production mode for the Higgs boson, which would normally be produced via
direct pQCD parton fusion processes. In this paper we compare total cross
sections and transverse momentum distributions d\sigma/dp_T for Higgs
production from black holes at the LHC with those from direct parton fusion
processes at next-to-next-to-leading order and next-to-leading order
respectively. We find that the Higgs production from black holes can be larger
or smaller than the direct pQCD production depending upon the Planck mass and
black hole mass. We also find that d\sigma/dp_T of Higgs production from black
holes increases as a function of p_T which is in sharp contrast with the pQCD
predictions where d\sigma/dp_T decreases so we suggest that the measurement of
an increase in d\sigma/dp_T as p_T increases for Higgs (or any other heavy
particle) production can be a useful signature for black holes at the LHC.

be analyzed. Here we focus on the determination of possible CP--odd phases of
these parameters. To that end, we exploit the electron/positron beam
polarization, including transverse polarization, as well as the spin/angular
correlations of the neutralino production $e^+ e^- \to \tilde{\chi}^0_i

measured, the $Z$ and $h$ modes are independent of the $\tilde{\chi}^0_i$
polarization, but CP--odd observables constructed from the leptonic decay mode
can help in reconstructing the neutralino sector of the CP--noninvariant MSSM.
In this situation, transverse beam polarization does not seem to be
particularly useful in probing explicit CP violation in the neutralino sector
of the MSSM. This can most easily be accomplished using longitudinal beam
polarization.

0.2% at $\mu=M_Z$. The Koide-like relations for the running masses of neutrinos

contradictions might be superficial since the results in point depend in fact
on the measurements procedure. The lattice simulations correspond to
measurements with high resolution while the quasiclassical picture assumes poor
resolution. We will argue that the general trend is that what looks
quasiclassical in measurements with poor resolution becomes fine tuned in
measurements with fine resolution. The main emphasis is on the topological

massive closed strings. The transfer of this energy to Standard Model (SM) open
string modes depends on where the SM branes and the brane annihilation are
located: in the bulk, in the same throat or in different throats. We find that,
in all cases as long as the brane annihilation and the SM branes are not both
in the bulk, the transfer of energy to start the hot big bang epoch can be
efficient enough to be compatible with big bang nucleosynthesis. The
suppression of the abundance of the graviton and its Kaluza-Klein (KK) thermal
relics follows from the warped geometry in flux compactification. This works
out even in the scenarios where a long period of tunneling is expected. In the
multi-throat scenario, we find a dynamical mechnism of selecting a long throat
as the SM throat. We establish three new dark matter candidates: KK modes with
specific angular momentum in the SM throat, those in the brane annihilation
throat, and different matters generated by KK modes tunneled to other throats.
Since the latter two couple to the visible matter sector only through graviton
mediation, they behave as hidden dark matter. Hidden dark matter has novel
implications on the dark matter coincidence problem and the high energy cosmic
rays.

spacetime dimensions, is performed. These black holes live in an anti-de Sitter
spacetime, i.e., a spacetime with negative cosmological constant. To find the
entropy, the approach developed by Solodukhin is followed. The method consists
in a redefinition of the variables in the metric, by considering the radial
coordinate as a scalar field. Then one performs a 2+(D-2) dimensional
reduction, where the (D-2) dimensions are in the angular coordinates, obtaining
a 2-dimensional effective scalar field theory. This theory is a conformal
theory in an infinitesimally small vicinity of the horizon. The corresponding
conformal symmetry will then have conserved charges, associated with its
infinitesimal conformal generators, which will generate a classical Poisson
algebra of the Virasoro type. Shifting the charges and replacing Poisson
brackets by commutators, one recovers the usual form of the Virasoro algebra,
obtaining thus the level zero conserved charge eigenvalue L_0, and a nonzero
central charge c. The entropy is then obtained via the Cardy formula.

scenario, a matching condition between the metric perturbations in the pre-big
bang phase and those in the post big-bang phase is often assumed. Various
matching conditions have been considered in the literature. Nevertheless
obtaining a scale invariant CMB spectrum via a concrete mechanism remains
impossible. In this paper, we examine this problem from the point of view of
local causality. We begin with introducing the notion of local causality and
explain how it constrains the form of the matching condition. We then prove a
no-go theorem: independent of the details of the matching condition, a scale
invariant spectrum is impossible as long as the local causality condition is
satisfied. In our framework, it is easy to show that a violation of local
causality around the bounce is needed in order to give a scale invariant
spectrum. We study a specific scenario of this possibility by considering a
nonlocal effective theory inspired by noncommutative geometry around the bounce
and show that a scale invariant spectrum is possible. Moreover we demonstrate
that the magnitude of the spectrum is compatible with observations if the
bounce is assumed to occur at an energy scale which is a few orders of
magnitude below the Planckian energy scale.

vector $\mu =(\mu_i)$ is thought to be sparse, with most coordinates 1 but a
small fraction significantly larger than 1; roughly, most coordinates are
simply `noise,' but a small fraction contain `signal.' We measure risk by
per-coordinate mean-squared error in recovering $\log(\mu_i)$, and study
minimax estimation over parameter spaces defined by constraints on the
per-coordinate p-norm of $\log(\mu_i)$:
$\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\log^p(\mu_i)\leq \eta^p$. We show for large n and
small $\eta$ that FDR thresholding can be nearly Minimax. The FDR control
parameter 0<q<1 plays an important role: when $q\leq 1/2$, the FDR estimator is
nearly minimax, while choosing a fixed q>1/2 prevents near minimaxity. These
conclusions mirror those found in the Gaussian case in Abramovich et al. [Ann.

a wide range of other distributional assumptions, other loss measures and

residuals of a GARCH model when the mean is known to be 0. We consider partial
sums of $k$th powers of residuals, CUSUM processes and self-normalized partial
sum processes. The $k$th power partial sum process converges to a Brownian
process plus a correction term, where the correction term depends on the $k$th
moment $\mu_k$ of the innovation sequence. If $\mu_k=0$, then the correction
term is 0 and, thus, the $k$th power partial sum process converges weakly to
the same Gaussian process as does the $k$th power partial sum of the i.i.d.
innovations sequence. In particular, since $\mu_1=0$, this holds for the first
moment partial sum process, but fails for the second moment partial sum
process. We also consider the CUSUM and the self-normalized processes, that is,
standardized by the residual sample variance. These behave as if the residuals
were asymptotically i.i.d. We also study the joint distribution of the $k$th

[AR($\infty$)] process. Shibata [Ann. Statist. 8 (1980) 147--164] considered
the problem of choosing a finite-order AR model, allowing the order to become
infinite as the number of observations does in order to obtain a better
approximation. He showed that, for the purpose of predicting the future of an
independent replicate, Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and its variants
are asymptotically efficient. Although Shibata's concept of asymptotic
efficiency has been widely accepted in the literature, it is not a natural
property for time series analysis. This is because when new observations of a
time series become available, they are not independent of the previous data. To
overcome this difficulty, in this paper we focus on order selection for
forecasting the future of an observed time series, referred to as
same-realization prediction. We present the first theoretical verification that
AIC and its variants are still asymptotically efficient (in the sense defined
in Section 4) for same-realization predictions. To obtain this result, a
technical condition, easily met in common practice, is introduced to simplify
the complicated dependent structures among the selected orders, estimated
parameters and future observations. In addition, a simulation study is
conducted to illustrate the practical implications of AIC. This study shows
that AIC also yields a satisfactory same-realization prediction in finite
samples. On the other hand, a limitation of AIC in same-realization settings is
pointed out. It is interesting to note that this limitation of AIC does not
exist for corresponding independent cases.

holomorphic functions on the unit disk which are closely connected each other:
the class of starlike and spirallike functions, the class of semigroup
generators, and the class of functions with positive real part. It is
more-or-less known that starlike or spirallike functions can be defined as
solutions of singular differential equations which, in general, are not stable
under the motion of interior singular points to the boundary. At the same time,
one can establish a perturbation formula which continuously transforms a
starlike (or spirallike) function with respect to a boundary point to a
starlike (or spirallike) function with respect to an interior point. This
formula is based on an appropriate approximation method of holomorphic
generators which determine the above-mentioned differential equations. In turn,
the well-known Berkson--Porta parametric representation of holomorphic
generators leads us to study an approximation-interpolation problem for the
class of functions with positive real part. While this problem is of
independent interest, the solution we present here is again based on the
Berkson--Porta formula. Finally, we apply our results to solve a natural
perturbation problem for one-parameter semigroups of holomorphic self-mappings,
as well as the eigenvalue problem for the semigroup of composition operators.

expands adiabatically. The system also displays radial and elliptic flow.
Radial flow is manifested as a broadening of the pT distributions with respect
to pp collisions. It is typically thought to result from multiple scattering of
partons or hadrons before dynamic freeze-out. Elliptic flow occurs when heavy
ions do not collide exactly head on. The initial geometrical asymetry is
translated into a momentum asymetry via pressure gradiants. Since these

for the systems used in this study, both adaptive integration and path sampling
offer unique advantages over the more traditional approaches. Specifically,
adaptive integration is found to provide very precise long-simulation $\Delta

offering rapid estimation of $\Delta F$. The results demonstrate that the
adaptive integration approach is the best overall method for the systems
studied here. The single-ensemble path sampling approach is found to be
superior to ordinary Jarzynski averaging for the uni-directional,

The turbulent force, represented here by the turbulent Lamb vector, is divided
in two contributions. The contribution including only subfilter fields is
deterministically modeled through a classical eddy-viscosity. The other
contribution including both filtered and subfilter scales is dynamically
computed as solution of a generalized (stochastic) Langevin equation. This
equation is derived using Rapid Distortion Theory (RDT) applied to the
subfilter scales. The general friction operator therefore includes both
advection and stretching by the resolved scale. The stochastic noise is derived
as the sum of a contribution from the energy cascade and a contribution from
the pressure. The LES model is thus made of an equation for the resolved scale,
including the turbulent force, and a generalized Langevin equation integrated
on a twice-finer grid. The model is validated by comparison to DNS and is
tested against classical LES models for isotropic homogeneous turbulence, based
on eddy viscosity. We show that even in this situation, where no walls are
present, our inclusion of backscatter through the Langevin equation results in
a better description of the flow.

constraints). The associated 15-dimensional integrands -- in terms of the

In standard quantum mechanics, which permits infinite parallelism and the
infinitely precise specification of states, a negative answer to both questions
is not ruled out. On the other hand, empirical evidence suggests that
NP-complete problems are intractable in the physical world. Likewise,
computational problems known to be algorithmically uncomputable do not seem to
be computable by any physical means. We suggest that this close correspondence
between the efficiency and power of abstract algorithms on the one hand, and
physical computers on the other, finds a natural explanation if the universe is
assumed to be algorithmic; that is, that physical reality is the product of
discrete sub-physical information processing equivalent to the actions of a
probabilistic Turing machine. This assumption can be reconciled with the
observed exponentiality of quantum systems at microscopic scales, and the
consequent possibility of implementing Shor's quantum polynomial time algorithm
at that scale, provided the degree of superposition is intrinsically, finitely
upper-bounded. If this bound is associated with the quantum-classical divide
(the Heisenberg cut), a natural resolution to the quantum measurement problem
arises. From this viewpoint, macroscopic classicality is an evidence that the
universe is in BPP, and both questions raised above receive affirmative
answers. A recently proposed computational model of quantum measurement, which
relates the Heisenberg cut to the discreteness of Hilbert space, is briefly
discussed. A connection to quantum gravity is noted. Our results are compatible
with the philosophy that mathematical truths are independent of the laws of
physics.

The time
evolution of the system can be described by an effective non-hermitian
Hamiltonian H_{eff}, in accord with the Wigner--Weisskopf approximation, and an
additional term of the Lindblad form, the socalled dissipator. We show that,
after enlarging the original Hilbert space by states which represent the decay
products of the unstable states, the non-hermitian part of H_{eff} --the
``particle decay''-- can be incorporated into the dissipator of the enlarged
space via a specific Lindblad operator. Thus the new formulation of the time
evolution on the enlarged space has a hermitian Hamiltonian and is probability
conserving. The equivalence of the new formulation with the original one
demonstrates that the time evolution which is governed by a non-hermitian
Hamiltonian and a dissipator of the Lindblad form is nevertheless completely
positive, just as systems with hermitian Hamiltonians.

where the exponent for the quantum transport is twice the exponent of its
classical counterpart. For small-world networks, however, the measure shows
rather a stretched exponential law but still the quantum transport outperforms
the classical one. Some finite tree-graphs have a few highly degenerate
eigenvalues, such that, on the other hand, on them the classical transport may
be more efficient than the quantum one.

distribution, $p(\phi|m)$, for the phase $\phi$ given measurement outcome $m$,
will generally have multiple peaks. Therefore, the phase sensitivity of an
interferometer cannot be adequately characterized by the standard deviation,
such as $\Delta\phi\sim 1/\sqrt{N}$ (the standard limit), or $\Delta\phi\sim
1/N$ (the Heisenberg limit). We propose an alternative measure of phase
sensitivity--the fidelity of an interferometer--defined as the Shannon mutual
information between the phase shift $\phi$\ and the measurement outcomes $m$.
As an example application of interferometer fidelity, we consider a generic
optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer, used as a sensor of a classical field. We
find the surprising result that an entangled {\it N00N} state input leads to a
lower fidelity than a Fock state input, for the same photon number.
