and turbulent pumping of large scale magnetic fields, respectively, due to
passive advection by convection are determined in the rapid rotation regime
corresponding to the deep layers of the solar convection zone.
  Methods. A 3D rectangular local model is used for solving the full set of MHD
equations in order to compute the electromotive force (emf), E = <u x b>,
generated by the interaction of imposed weak gradient-free magnetic fields and
turbulent convection with varying rotational influence and latitude. By
expanding the emf in terms of the mean magnetic field, E_i = a_ij <B_j>, all
nine components of a_ij are computed. The diagonal elements of a_ij describe
the alpha-effect, whereas the off-diagonals represent magnetic pumping. The
latter is essentially the advection of magnetic fields by means other than the
underlying large-scale velocity field. Comparisons are made to analytical
expressions of the coefficients derived under the first-order smoothing
approximation (FOSA).
  Results. In the rapid rotation regime the latitudinal dependence of the
alpha-components responsible for the generation of the azimuthal and radial
fields does not exhibit a peak at the poles, as is the case for slow rotation,
but at a latitude of about 30 degrees. The magnetic pumping is predominantly
radially down- and latitudinally equatorward as in earlier studies. The
numerical results compare surprisingly well with analytical expressions derived
under first-order smoothing, although the present calculations are expected to
lie near the limits of the validity range of FOSA.

limits and estimated accretion rates. The average temperature of WDs in DNe
below the period gap is ~18,000K. For WDs in DNe above the period gap, the
average WD temperature is ~26,000K. There is a flux component, in addition to a
WD photosphere, which contributes >60% of the flux in the FUV in 53% of the

an optically thick accretion disk since, according to the disk instability

For 82 X-ray bright sources, we perform the X-ray spectral analysis leaving
both Gamma and N_H free. The weighted mean value is <Gamma>~ 1.75+-0.02, with
an intrinsic dispersion of sigma~0.30. We do not find hints of a correlation
between Gamma and the N_H. We detect the presence of a scattered component at
soft energies in 8 sources, and a pure reflection spectrum, typical of
Compton-thick AGN, in 14 sources (Compton-thick AGN candidates). The intrinsic
N_H distribution shows a lognormal shape, peaking around log(N_H)~23.1 and with
sigma~1.1. We find that the fraction of absorbed sources (with N_H>10^{22}

that the three standard neutrinos have degenerate mass, which is at odds with
recent terrestrial measurements of the difference in the square of neutrino
masses. In this paper we examine whether the use of this approximation is
justified for the cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum, matter power
spectrum and the CMB lensing potential power spectrum. We find that, assuming
m^2_{23} ~ 2.5x10^{-3}$eV^2 in agreement with recent Earth based measurements
of atmospheric neutrino oscillations, the correction due to non-degeneracy is
of the order of precision of present numerical codes and undetectable for the
foreseeable future for the CMB and matter power spectra. An ambitious
experiment that could reconstruct the lensing potential power spectrum to the
cosmic variance limit up to l~1000 will have to take the effect into account in
order to avoid biases. The degeneracies with other parameters, however, will
make the detection of the neutrino mass difference impossible. We also show
that relaxing the bound on the neutrino mass difference will also increase the
error-bar on the sum of neutrino masses by a factor of up to a few. For exotic
models with significantly non-degenerate neutrinos the corrections due to
non-degeneracy could become important for all the cosmological probes discussed

surprising result that many bursts have large X-ray flares superimposed on the
underlying afterglow. These flares were sometimes intense, rapid, and late
relative to the nominal prompt phase. The most intense of these flares was
observed by XRT with a flux >500 the afterglow. This burst then surprised
observers by flaring again after >10000 s. The intense flare can be most easily
understood within the context of the standard fireball model, if the internal
engine that powers the prompt GRB emission is still active at late times.
Recent observations indicate that X-ray flares are detected in ~1/3 of XRT
detected afterglows. By studying the properties of the varieties of flares

them to overall burst properties, models of flare production and the GRB

$0.28\lesssim M_3/M_{12}\lesssim0.75$ and implied outer periods
$P\lesssim10^6{\rm d}$. We find that if the frequency of tertiaries was the
same as that of binary companions to solar-type stars, we would have expected
to detect about 12 tertiaries. In contrast, if all contact binaries were in
triple systems, one would expect about 20. Thus, our results are not
conclusive, but sufficiently suggestive to warrant further studies.

redshift clusters of galaxies known have been studied. Photometry has been
measured in the V, R, I, z, F606W, F814W, J and K bands to a depth of K*+2.5
and spectroscopy confirms 27 K band selected cluster members. The V-K colours
are equivalent to a rest-frame colour of ~2700A-J, and provide a very sensitive
measure of star-formation activity. HST ACS imaging has been used to
morphologically classify the galaxies.
  The cluster has a low early-type fraction compared to nearby clusters, with
only 33% of the cluster members having types E or S0. The early-type member
galaxies form a clear red-sequence in all colours. The scatter and slope of the
relations show no evolution compared to the equivalent Coma cluster relations,
suggesting the stellar populations are already very old. The normalisation of
the relations has been compared to models based on synthetic stellar
populations, and are most consistent with stellar populations forming at z>3.
Some late-type galaxies were found to lie on the red-sequence, suggesting that
they have very similar stellar populations to the early-types.
  These results present a picture of a cluster in which the early-type galaxies
are all old, but in which there must be future morphological transformation of
galaxies to match the early-type fraction of nearby clusters. In order to
preserve the tight colour-magnitude relation of early-types seen in nearby
clusters, the late-type galaxies must transform their colours, through the
cessation of star-formation, before the morphological transformation occurs.
Such evolution is observed in the late-types lying on the colour-magnitude
relation.

X-Ray Telescope (XRT) have a very steep-decay component (tail) following the
prompt gamma-rays in the early phase and have some erratic flares occurring at
a time from ~10^2 up to ~10^5 seconds. Based on the assumption that these tails
and flares are of internal shock origin and that their decline behaviors are
dominated by the curvature effect of the fireball, we present a
self-consistency test for this scenario with a sample of 36
prompt-emission-tails/flare-tails in 22 GRB XRT light curves. Our results show
that the t0 of the prompt emission tails and the tails of well-separated flares
are usually at the rising segment of the last pulse of the prompt emission or
the corresponding X-ray flare, being self-consistent with the expectation of
the internal dissipation models for the prompt emission and X-ray flares. Our
results indicate that each X-ray flare forms a distinct new episode of central
engine activity and the GRB central engine remains active after the prompt
emission is over, sometimes up to ~1 day after the GRB trigger (e.g. GRB
050502B & GRB 050724). This challenges the conventional central engine models
and calls for new ideas to re-start the central engine. We further show that
the on-set time of the late central engine activity does not depend on the GRB
duration. We also identify a minority group of GRBs whose combined BAT-XRT
light curves are smoothly connected without an abrupt transition between the
prompt emission and the afterglow. These GRBs may have an external origin for
both the prompt emission and the afterglow.

spectral complexity in some narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1). In this
work, we define two samples of NLS1: a complex sample whose members exhibit
high-energy complexity (C-sample), and a general sample of NLS1 whose 2.5-10
keV spectra do not strongly deviate from a simple power law (S-sample).
Considering historical light curves of each object we find that the C-sample is
representative of NLS1 in a low X-ray flux state, whereas the members of the
S-sample appear to be in a typical flux state. Moreover, from measurements of
alpha_ox with contemporaneous UV/X-ray data, we find that the C-sample of NLS1
appear X-ray weaker at the time of the observation. For two NLS1 in the
C-sample multi-epoch measurements of alpha_ox are available and suggest that
alpha_ox approaches more normal values as the complexity between 2.5-10 keV
diminishes. This implies that a source could transit from one sample to the
other as its X-ray flux varies. Secondly, there are indications that the
C-sample sources, on average, exhibit stronger optical FeII emission, with the
three most extreme (FeII/H_beta > 1.8) FeII emitters all displaying complexity
in the 2.5-10 keV band. However, it is not clear if the possible connection
between FeII strength and spectral complexity is due to the FeII producing
mechanism or because strong FeII emitters may exhibit the greatest variability
and consequently more likely to be caught in an extreme (low) flux state. Based
on the current analysis it we can not straightforwardly dismiss absorption or
reflection as the cause of the X-ray complexity.

supergiants. We estimate a distance of 5.8~\kpc to the cluster by associating
an OH maser with the envelope of one of the stars. We also identify a
``yellow'' supergiant of G6~I type in the cluster. Assuming a Salpeter IMF, we
infer an initial cluster mass of 20,000 to 40,000~\Msun for cluster ages of
7-12~\Myr. Continuing with these assumptions, we find 80% of the intial mass
and 99% of the number of stars remain at the present time. We associate the
cluster with an x-ray source (detected by {\it ASCA} and {\it Einstein}), a
recently discovered very high energy $\gamma$-ray source (detected by {\it
INTEGRAL} and {\it HESS}), and several non-thermal radio sources, finding that
these objects are likely related to recent supernovae in the cluster. In
particular, we claim that the cluster has produced at least one recent
supernova remnant with properties similar to the Crab nebula. It is not
unlikely to find such a source in this cluster, given our estimated supernova
rate of one per 40,000 to 80,000~{\it yr}.

disks. The dominant crystallization by thermal annealing happens in the very
early phases of disk formation and evolution. Both the disk properties and the
level of crystallinity are thereby directly linked to the properties of the
molecular cloud core from which the star+disk system was formed. We show that,
under the assumption of single star formation, rapidly rotating clouds produce
disks which, after the main infall phase (i.e. in the optically revealed class
II phase), are rather massive and have a high accretion rate but low
crystallinity. Slowly rotating clouds, on the other hand, produce less massive
disks with lower accretion rate, but high levels of crystallinity. Cloud
fragmentation and the formation of multiple stars complicates the problem and
necessitates further study. The underlying physics of the model is
insufficiently understood to provide the precise relationship between
crystallinity, disk mass and accretion rate. But the fact that with `standard'
input physics the model produces disks which, in comparison to observations,
appear to have either too high levels of crystallinity or too high disk masses,
demonstrates that the comparison of these models to observations can place
strong contraints on the disk physics. The question to ask is not why some
sources are so crystalline, but why some other sources have such a low level of
crystallinity.

magnetic fields change the specific heats and the polytropic exponent gamma of
the gas in the convective envelope, the mass-radius adiabatic exponent xi_ad
also changes. We find that turbulent magnetic fields can produce 10% less
restrictive critical q-profiles while large-scale toroidal and poloidal fields
have smaller effects. Thus, magnetic fields alone do not account for the
stability of all the anomalous CVs. However, we found that the small variations
of xi_ad induced by solar-type magnetic cycles explain the amplitudes of the
cyclic accretion luminosity variations shown by several CVs.

universe with a $T^1xR^2$ spatial section, the residual Newtonian gravitational
force (to first order) provides an anisotropic effect that repels test
particles from the cluster in the compact direction, in a way algebraically
similar to that of dark energy. For a typical test object at comoving distance
$\chi$ from the nearest dense nodes of the cosmic web of density perturbations,
the pressure-to-density ratio $w$ of the equation of state in an FLRW universe,
is w \sim - (\chi/L)^3, where $L$ is the size of the fundamental domain, i.e.
of the universe. Clearly, |w|<<1. For a T^3 spatial section of exactly equal
fundamental lengths, the effect cancels to zero. For a T^3 spatial section of
unequal fundamental lengths, the acceleration effect is anisotropic in the
sense that it will *tend to equalise the three fundamental lengths*. Provided
that at least a modest amount of inflation occurred in the early Universe, and
given some other conditions, multiple connectedness does generate an effect
similar to that of dark energy, but the amplitude of the effect at the present
epoch is too small to explain the observed dark energy density and its
anisotropy makes it an unrealistic candidate for the observed dark energy.

E","Phys. Rev. E 73, 031111 (2006)","10.1103/PhysRevE.73.031111",,"cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  The properties of a wide variety of growing models, generically called
$X/RD$, are studied by means of numerical simulations and analytic
developments. The study comprises the following $X$ models: Ballistic
Deposition, Random Deposition with Surface Relaxation, Das Sarma-Tamboronea,
Kim-Kosterlitz, Lai-Das Sarma, Wolf-Villain, Large Curvature, and three
additional models that are variants of the Ballistic Deposition model.
  It is shown that after a growing regime, the interface width becomes
saturated at a crossover time ($t_{x2}$) that, by fixing the sample size,
scales with $p$ according to $t_{x2}(p)\propto p^{-y}, \qquad (p > 0)$, where
$y$ is an exponent. Also, the interface width at saturation ($W_{sat}$) scales
as $W_{sat}(p)\propto p^{-\delta}, \qquad (p > 0)$, where $\delta$ is another
exponent.
  It is proved that, in any dimension, the exponents $\delta$ and $y$ obey the
following relationship: $\delta = y \beta_{RD}$, where $\beta_{RD} = 1/2$ is
the growing exponent for $RD$. Furthermore, both exponents exhibit universality
in the $p \to 0$ limit.
  By mapping the behaviour of the average height difference of two neighbouring
sites in discrete models of type $X/RD$ and two kinds of random walks, we have
determined the exact value of the exponent $\delta$.
  Finally, by linking four well-established universality classes (namely
Edwards-Wilkinson, Kardar-Parisi-Zhang, Linear-MBE and Non-linear-MBE) with the
properties of both random walks, eight different stochastic equations for all
the competitive models studied are derived.

of cognitive radios for distributed adaptive channel allocation. We define two
different objective functions for the spectrum sharing games, which capture the
utility of selfish users and cooperative users, respectively. Based on the
utility definition for cooperative users, we show that the channel allocation
problem can be formulated as a potential game, and thus converges to a
deterministic channel allocation Nash equilibrium point. Alternatively, a
no-regret learning implementation is proposed for both scenarios and it is
shown to have similar performance with the potential game when cooperation is
enforced, but with a higher variability across users. The no-regret learning
formulation is particularly useful to accommodate selfish users.
Non-cooperative learning games have the advantage of a very low overhead for
information exchange in the network.
  We show that cooperation based spectrum sharing etiquette improves the
overall network performance at the expense of an increased overhead required
for information exchange.

decoder's information input and soft output. This paper introduces a new class
of interleavers, the inter-block permutation (IBP) interleavers, that can be
build on any existing ""good"" block-wise interleaver by simply adding an IBP
stage. The IBP interleavers reduce the above-mentioned correlation and increase
the effective interleaving size. The increased effective interleaving size
improves the distance spectrum while the reduced covariance enhances the
iterative decoder's performance. Moreover, the structure of the
IBP(-interleaved) turbo codes (IBPTC) is naturally fit for high rate
applications that necessitate parallel decoding.
  We present some useful bounds and constraints associated with the IBPTC that
can be used as design guidelines. The corresponding codeword weight upper
bounds for weight-2 and weight-4 input sequences are derived. Based on some of
the design guidelines, we propose a simple IBP algorithm and show that the
associated IBPTC yields 0.3 to 1.2 dB performance gain, or equivalently, an
IBPTC renders the same performance with a much reduced interleaving delay. The
EXIT and covariance behaviors provide another numerical proof of the

in many important cases these have first-order equivalents. Computing such
equivalents is important for both logical and computational reasons. On the
other hand, canonicity of modal formulae is important, too, because it implies
frame-completeness of logics axiomatized with canonical formulae.
  Computing a first-order equivalent of a modal formula amounts to elimination
of second-order quantifiers. Two algorithms have been developed for
second-order quantifier elimination: SCAN, based on constraint resolution, and
DLS, based on a logical equivalence established by Ackermann.
  In this paper we introduce a new algorithm, SQEMA, for computing first-order
equivalents (using a modal version of Ackermann's lemma) and, moreover, for
proving canonicity of modal formulae. Unlike SCAN and DLS, it works directly on
modal formulae, thus avoiding Skolemization and the subsequent problem of
unskolemization. We present the core algorithm and illustrate it with some
examples. We then prove its correctness and the canonicity of all formulae on
which the algorithm succeeds. We show that it succeeds not only on all
Sahlqvist formulae, but also on the larger class of inductive formulae,
introduced in our earlier papers. Thus, we develop a purely algorithmic
approach to proving canonical completeness in modal logic and, in particular,
establish one of the most general completeness results in modal logic so far.

particular, we discuss the definability of the Barbero connection without any
gauge fixing. Although it is not the pullback of a spacetime connection onto
the three-surface and it does not have a natural spacetime interpretation, this
does not mean that the Barbero connection is not suitable variable for
quantisation; it appears naturally in the formalism even in absence of gauge
fixing. It may be employed therefore, to define loop variables similar to those

the vacuum ODLRO condensate inflation field in which the non-compact

field actions. Quantum gravity zero point vacuum fluctuations should be
renormalizable at the spin 1 tetrad level where there is a natural
scale-dependent holographic dimensionless coupling (hG/\zpf/c^3)^1/3 ~
(Bekenstein BITS)^-1/3. The spacetime tetrad rotation coefficients play the
same role as do the Lie algebra structure constants in internal symmetry spin 1
Yang-Mills local gauge theories. This suggests an intuitively pleasing natural
""organizing idea"" now missing in superstring theory. It is then clear why
supersymmetry must break in order for our pocket universe to come into being
with a small w = -1 negative pressure zero point exotic vacuum dark energy

predicts that the Large Hadron Collider will never find any viable
on-mass-shell dark matter exotic particles able to explain Omega(DM) ~ 0.23 as
a matter of fundamental principle, neither will any other conceivable dark
matter detector because dark matter forming galactic halos et-al is entirely
virtual exotic vacuum w = - 1 with positive irreducibly random quantum zero

along S^1 and S^2 are afflicted by a robust instability. It is triggered by
superradiant bound state modes. The Kaluza-Klein momentum of the mode along the

strings and branes was first suggested by Marolf and Palmer and studied in
detail by Cardoso, Lemos and Yoshida. We find the frequency spectrum and
timescale of this instability in the black ring background, and show that it is
active for large radius rings with large rotation along S^2. We identify the
endpoint of the instability and argue that it provides a dynamical mechanism
that introduces an upper bound in the rotation of the black ring. To estimate
the upper bound, we use the recent black ring model of Hovdebo and Myers, with
a minor extension to accommodate an extra small angular momentum. This
dynamical bound can be smaller than the Kerr-like bound imposed by regularity
at the horizon. Recently, the existence of higher dimensional black rings is
being conjectured. They will be stable against this mechanism.

that the horizon at $r=N$ should be the outer horizon of the black hole. We

computation of the virtual cohomological dimension of the mapping class group,
Looijenga conjectured that the moduli space of smooth Riemann surfaces admits a
stratification by affine subsets with a certain number of layers. Similarly,
Roth and Vakil extended the conjecture to the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces
of compact type, of Riemann surfaces with rational tails and of Riemann
surfaces with at most k rational components. As a consequence of Lefschetz's
theorem, Roth-Vakil's conjecture would also imply that the previous (coarse)
moduli spaces are homotopy equivalent to cellular complexes of a certain
dimension. Using Harer's computation for the moduli spaces of smooth Riemann
surfaces, we prove this last statement.

several blocks can merge at the same time to form a single block. In the case
that the measure $\Lambda$ is the $\operatorname {Beta}(2-\alpha,\alpha)$
distribution, they are also known to describe the genealogies of large
populations where a single individual can produce a large number of offspring.
Here, we use a recent result of Birkner et al. to prove that Beta-coalescents
can be embedded in continuous stable random trees, about which much is known
due to the recent progress of Duquesne and Le Gall. Our proof is based on a
construction of the Donnelly--Kurtz lookdown process using continuous random
trees, which is of independent interest. This produces a number of results
concerning the small-time behavior of Beta-coalescents. Most notably, we
recover an almost sure limit theorem of the present authors for the number of
blocks at small times and give the multifractal spectrum corresponding to the
emergence of blocks with atypical size. Also, we are able to find exact
asymptotics for sampling formulae corresponding to the site frequency spectrum
and the allele frequency spectrum associated with mutations in the context of
population genetics.

whose predictions have been tested to more than ten decimal places. If it were
possible to make calculations in QCD the same way we can in QED, we would have
removed one of the biggest obstacles in the way of understanding matter in the
universe. Unfortunately, the properties of QCD make such calculations
impossible at present. Historically, there have been two approaches to this
problem. First, we work to improve our ability to solve QCD, with the most
visible effort being the field of Lattice QCD. Second, we make models of QCD
that attempt to incorporate what we believe to be the most important
symmetries, dynamics, or degrees of freedom, and then test these models against
experimental measurements sensitive to these assumptions. Even the earliest
quark models of hadrons structure and the simplest bag models have had great
success, far beyond any reasonable expectation, indicating that these models
have isolated some of the key features of QCD. More detailed models and ever
more sophisticated experimental tests are significantly improving such details,
and helping to better identify the most relevant features of QCD, one of the
key missing pieces in our understanding of the nature of matter.

it was claimed that the debate could be closed by an experimental proof, a

reports on previously published measurements and additional studies on the
effects of the purity of the gases in which the GEM performance is evaluated.
In He, at temperatures between 77 and 293 K, triple-GEM structures operate at
rather high gains, exceeding 1000. There is an indication that this high gain
is achieved through the Penning effect as a result of impurities in the gas. At
lower temperatures the gain-voltage characteristics are significantly modified
probably due to the freeze-out of these impurities. Double-GEM and single-GEM
structures can operate down to 3 K at gains reaching only several tens at a gas
density of about 0.5 g/l; at higher densities the maximum gain drops further.
In Ne, the maximum gain also drops at cryogenic temperatures. The gain drop in
Ne at low temperatures can be re-established in Penning mixtures of Ne+H2: very
high gains, exceeding 104, have been obtained in these mixtures at 30-77 K, at
a density of 9.2 g/l which corresponds to saturated Ne vapor density at 27 K.
The addition of small amounts of H2 in He also re-establishes large GEM gains
above 30 K but no gain was observed in He+H2 at 4 K and a density of 1.7 g/l
(corresponding to roughly one-tenth of the saturated vapor density). These
studies are, in part, being pursued in the development of two-phase He and Ne
detectors for solar neutrino detection.

a distributed delay formulation of the time lag between transcription factor

introduces a transition from a stable steady state to limit cycle oscillations
and then a second transition back to a stable steady state which has not been
observed in previously published models. On the basis of our results and
following recent discussions about the role of delay-induced oscillations in
gene transcription we establish the hypothesis that the period of the
delay-induced cyclic changes should be characterized by an upper bound so that
it cannot be greater then the period of fundamental biological cycles. We
demonstrate our approach for two models. The first model describes Hes1
autorepression with equations for Hes1 mRNA production and Hes1 protein
translation. The second model describes Hes1 repression by the protein complex
Gro/TLE1/Hes1, where Gro/TLE1 is activated by Hes1 phosphorylation.

types of reference frame: a reference direction, realized by a spin-j system,
and a phase reference, realized by an oscillator mode with bounded energy. For
both cases, we show that our measure of longevity increases quadratically with
the size of the reference system and is therefore non-additive. For instance,
the number of measurements that a directional reference frame consisting of N
parallel spins can be put to use scales as N^2. Our results quantify the extent
to which microscopic or mesoscopic reference frames may be used for repeated,
high-precision measurements, without needing to be reset - a question that is
