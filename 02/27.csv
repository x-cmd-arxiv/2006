conundrum in galaxy clusters focus exclusively on the role of the central
galaxy. Such models require fine-tuning of highly uncertain microscopic
transport properties to distribute the thermal thermal over the entire cluster
cooling core. We propose that the ICM is instead heated by multiple, spatially
distributed AGNs. There is mounting observational evidence for multiple AGNs in
cluster environments. Active AGNs drive bubbles into the ICM. We identify three
distinct interactions between the bubble and the ICM: (1) Upon injection, the
bubbles expand rapidly in situ to reach pressure equilibrium with their
surroundings, generating shocks and waves whose dissipation is the principal
source of ICM heating. (2) Once inflated, the bubbles rise buoyantly at rate
determined by a balance with the viscous drag force, which itself results in
some additional heating. (3) Rising bubbles expand and compress their
surroundings. This process is adiabatic and does not contribute to any
additional heating; rather, the increased ICM density due to compression
enhances cooling. Our model sidesteps the ``transport'' issue by relying on the
spatially distributed galaxies to heat the cluster core. We include self
regulation in our model by linking AGN activity in a galaxy to cooling
characteristics of the surrounding ICM. We use a spherically symmetric
one-dimensional hydrodynamical code to carry out a preliminary study
illustrating the efficacy of the model. Our self-regulating scenario predicts
that there should be enhanced AGN activity of galaxies inside the cooling
regions compared to galaxies in the outer parts of the cluster. This prediction
remains to be confirmed or refuted by observations.

can be heated or magnetized depending on the values of various magnetic
field-aligned parameters. Then we may expect high-energy thermal/nonthermal

MHD shocks and discuss the shocked plasma region in the black hole
magnetosphere. We also investigate the effects of the poloidal magnetic field
and the black hole spin on the properties of shocks, and show that both effects
can modify the distribution of the shock front and shock strength. We find for
strong MHD shock formation that fast rotating magnetic fields are necessary.
The physics of non-equatorial MHD shocks in the black hole magnetosphere could
be very important when we are to construct the central engine model of various

were selected from the deep data with good completeness over 0<z<5, and 2 to 3
magnitudes fainter than the SDSS main survey. Spectroscopic follow-up was
carried out on the 6.5m MMT with Hectospec. The preliminary sample of this SDSS
faint quasar survey (hereafter SFQS) covers ~ 3.9 deg^2, contains 414 quasars,
and reaches g=22.5. The overall selection efficiency is ~ 66% (~ 80% at
g<21.5); the efficiency in the most difficult redshift range (2<z<3) is better
than 40%. We use the 1/V_{a} method to derive a binned estimate of the quasar
luminosity function (QLF) and model the QLF using maximum likelihood analysis.
The best model fits confirm previous results showing that the QLF has steep
slopes at the bright end and much flatter slopes (-1.25 at z<2.0 and -1.55 at
z>2.0) at the faint end, indicating a break in the QLF slope. Using a
luminosity-dependent density evolution model, we find that the quasar density
at M_{g}<-22.5 peaks at z~2, which is later in cosmic time than the peak of
z~2.5 found from surveys of more luminous objects. The SFQS QLF is consistent
with the results of the 2dF QSO Redshift Survey, the SDSS, and the 2dF-SDSS LRG
and QSO Survey, but probes fainter quasars. We plan to obtain more quasars from
future observations and establish a complete faint quasar sample with more than

from a recent study of the Sculptor galaxy NGC 300 where stellar photometry has
been used to demonstrate that the outer disc extends to 10 effective radii, far
beyond what was thought possible for a normal low-luminosity spiral. We confirm
this finding by a reanalysis of the background counts. Secondly, we determine

(SNe Ia) in young supernova remnants (SNRs) by recognizing distinct features of
absorption lines due to Fe I appearing in the spectrum. If a sufficient amount
of Fe I remains in the ejecta, Fe I atoms moving toward us absorb photons by
transitions from the ground state to imprint broad absorption lines exclusively
with the blue-shifted components in the spectrum of the companion star. To
investigate the time evolution of column depth of Fe I in the ejecta, we have
performed hydrodynamical calculations for SNRs expanding into the uniform
ambient media, taking into account collisional ionizations, excitations, and
photo-ionizations of heavy elements. As a result, it is found that the
companion star in Tycho's SNR will exhibit observable features in absorption
lines due to Fe I at $\lambda\lambda = 371.9935$ nm and 385.9911 nm if a carbon
deflagration SN model is taken. However, these features may disappear by taking
another model that emits a few times more intense ionizing photons from the
shocked outer layers. To further explore the ionization states in the freely
expanding ejecta, we need a reliable model to describe the structure of the
outer layers.

galaxies evolves as an old and passively evolving population formed at high
redshift without any need for additional redshift-dependent evolution. Models
with a prolonged stellar mass growth are rejected by the data with high
confidence. The data also reject models in which the age of the stars is the
same at all redshifts. Similarly, the characteristic stellar mass evolves, in
the last two thirds of the universe age, as expected for a stellar population
formed at high redshift. Together with the old age of stellar populations
derived from fundamental plane studies, our data seems to suggest that
early-type cluster galaxies have been completely assembled at high redshift,

derive the LF and mass evolution homogeneously over the whole redshift range,

prefer multi-temperature models especially in the core. The radial profiles of
oxygen and iron measured with EPIC/RGS and the line profiles in RGS suggest
that there is a dip in the O/Fe ratio in the centre of the cluster compared to
its immediate surroundings. A possible explanation for the large scale
metallicity distribution is that SNIa and SNII products are released in the ICM
through ram-pressure stripping of in-falling galaxies. This causes a peaked
metallicity distribution. In addition, SNIa in the central cD galaxy enrich
mainly the centre of the cluster with iron. This excess of SNIa products is
consistent with the low O/Fe ratio we detect in the centre of the cluster. We
fit the abundances we obtain with yields from SNIa, SNII and Population-III
stars to derive the clusters chemical evolution. We find that the measured
abundance pattern does not require a Population-III star contribution. The
relative contribution of the number of SNIa with respect to the total number of
SNe which enrich the ICM is about 25-50%. Furthermore, we discuss the possible
presence of a non-thermal component in the EPIC spectra. A potential source of
this non-thermal emission can be inverse-Compton scattering between Cosmic

possible shock in the region of the Coma relic. We therefore suggest that the
main source of energy for particles radiating in the radio relic is likely to
be turbulence. From the X-ray data, we can also set a flux upper limit of 3.2 x
10e-13 erg/cm^2 s, in the 0.3 - 10 keV energy range, to the non-thermal
emission in the relic region. This leads to a magnetic field B > 1.05 microG.

emission is exceedingly weak. For this reason, the cloudlet hypothesis remains
so far substantially unproven. In this Letter we propose a new method to probe
the presence of cold H_2 clouds in galactic halos: the ground transition of
ortho-H_2D^+ at 372 GHz. We discuss why the H_2D^+ is abundant under the
physical conditions appropriate for the cloudlets, and present a chemical model
that predicts the H_2D^+ abundance as function of four key parameters: gas
density and metallicity, cosmic ray ionization rate and dust grain size. We
conclude that current ground-based instruments might detect the ortho-H_2D^+

large quantities of dark baryonic matter around galaxies.

and reveal the origin of the specific critical phenomena. We demonstrate that a
so-called ``corona'' of the k-core plays a crucial role (corona is a subset of
vertices in the k-core which have exactly k neighbors in the k-core). It turns
out that the k-core percolation threshold is at the same time the percolation
threshold of finite corona clusters. The mean separation of vertices in corona
clusters plays the role of the correlation length and diverges at the critical
point. We show that a random removal of even one vertex from the k-core may
result in the collapse of a vast region of the k-core around the removed
vertex. The mean size of this region diverges at the critical point. We find an
exact mapping of the k-core percolation to a model of cooperative relaxation.
This model undergoes critical relaxation with a divergent rate at some critical

quantum dots, i.e., the fact that the ground state energy of two electron-hole
pairs goes above twice the ground-state energy of one pair, can entirely be
assigned to a charge separation effect, whatever its origin. In the absence of
external electric field, this charge separation comes from different
''spreading-out'' of the electron and hole wavefunctions linked to the finite
height of the barriers. When the dot size shrinks, the two-pair energy always
stays below when the barriers are infinite. On the opposite, because barriers
are less efficient for small dots, the energy of two-pairs in a dot with finite
barriers, ends by behaving like the one in bulk, i.e., by going above twice the
one-pair energy when the pairs get too close. For a full understanding of this
''antibinding'' effect, we have also reconsidered the case of one pair plus one
carrier. We find that, while the carriers just have to spread out of the dot
differently for the ''antibinding'' of two-pairs to appear, this
''antibinding'' for one pair plus one carrier only appears if this carrier is
the one which spreads out the less. In addition a remarkable sum rule exists
between the ""binding energies"" of two pairs and of one pair plus one carrier.

random field: i.e., the model parameters are estimated on the basis of an
initial set of data, and then the fitted model is used to perform prediction
(e.g., smoothing, denoising, interpolation) on a new noisy observation. Working
under the restriction of limited computation, we analyze a joint method in
which the \emph{same convex variational relaxation} is used to construct an
M-estimator for fitting parameters, and to perform approximate marginalization
for the prediction step. The key result of this paper is that in the
computation-limited setting, using an inconsistent parameter estimator (i.e.,
an estimator that returns the ``wrong'' model even in the infinite data limit)
can be provably beneficial, since the resulting errors can partially compensate
for errors made by using an approximate prediction technique. En route to this
result, we analyze the asymptotic properties of M-estimators based on convex
variational relaxations, and establish a Lipschitz stability property that
holds for a broad class of variational methods. We show that joint
estimation/prediction based on the reweighted sum-product algorithm
substantially outperforms a commonly used heuristic based on ordinary

whole picture and the final fate of the gravitational collapse of a dust cloud
differ greatly between the cases with $n=5$ and $n \ge 6$. There are two
families of solutions, which we call plus-branch and the minus-branch
solutions. Bounce inevitably occurs in the plus-branch solution for $n \ge 6$,
and consequently singularities cannot be formed. Since there is no trapped
surface in the plus-branch solution, the singularity formed in the case of

massless for $n \ge 6$, while massive naked singularities are possible for
$n=5$. In the homogeneous collapse represented by the flat
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker solution, the singularity formed is spacelike for $n

first order Dirac Lagrangian is dual equivalent to the two order Lagrangian of

topological defects in general, and cosmic strings in particular, are deeply
rooted in the framework of grand unified theories. Indeed, it was shown that
cosmic strings are expected to be generically formed within supersymmetric
grand unified theories. This theoretical support gave a new boost to the field
of cosmic strings, a boost which has been recently enhanced when it was shown
that cosmic superstrings (fundamental or one-dimensional Dirichlet branes) can
play the role of cosmic strings, in the framework of braneworld cosmologies.
  To build a cosmological scenario we employ high energy physics; inflation and
cosmic strings then naturally appear. Confronting the predictions of the
cosmological scenario against current astrophysical/cosmological data we impose
constraints on its free parameters, obtaining information about the high energy
physics we employed.
  This is a beautiful example of the rich and fruitful interplay between
cosmology and high energy physics.

equation. Included are alternative explanations of results of Ward,
Fokas-Ioannidou, Villarroel and Zakhorov-Mikhailov. The equations are
formulated in terms of a number of equivalent Lax pairs; we make use of the
natural Lorentz action on the Lax pairs and frames. A new Hamiltonian
formulation for the Ward equations is introduced. We outline both scattering

large class of monopoles which are global in time and have both continuous and

statistical phase-space area (degraded quality) and particle losses in
alternating gradient quadrupole transport channels when the undepressed phase
advance sigma_0 increases beyond about 85 degrees per lattice period. Although
this criterion has been used extensively in practical designs of strong
focusing intense beam transport lattices, the origin of the limit has not been
understood. We propose a mechanism for the transport limit resulting from
classes of halo particle resonances near the core of the beam that allow
near-edge particles to rapidly increase in oscillation amplitude when the
space-charge intensity and the flutter of the matched beam envelope are both
sufficiently large. When coupled with a diffuse beam edge and/or perturbations
internal to the beam core that can drive particles outside the edge, this
mechanism can result in large and rapid halo-driven increases in the
statistical phase-space area of the beam, lost particles, and degraded
transport. A core-particle model is applied to parametrically analyze this
process. Extensive self-consistent particle in cell simulations are employed to
better quantify space-charge limit and verify core-particle model predictions.

needed to the known macroscopic permeability function in order to correctly
describe these materials. Depending on the dominating loss mechanism
(conductive losses in metal parts or dielectric losses in the substrate) the
permeability function has different forms. The proposed circuit model and
permeability function are experimentally validated. Furthermore, starting from
the generalized circuit model we derive an explicit expression for the
electromagnetic field energy density in artificial magnetic media. This
expression is valid at low frequencies and in the vicinity of the resonance
also when dispersion and losses in the material are strong. The presently
obtained results for the energy density are compared with the results obtained
using different methods.

light through a subwavelength nm-size slit in a thick metal film. The simple
formulae for the transmitted electromagnetic fields and the transmission
coefficient are derived by using the narrow-slit approximation and the Green's
function formalism for the solution of Maxwell's equations. The resonance
wavelengths are in agreement with the semi-analytical model [Y. Takakura, Phys.
Rev. Lett. 86, 5601 (2001)], which solves the wave equations by using the
Rayleigh field expansion. Our formulae, however, show great resonant
enhancement of a transmitted wave, while the Rayleigh expansion model predicts
attenuation. The difference is attributed to the near-field subwavelength
diffraction, which is not considered by the Rayleigh-like expansion models.

probabilistic realization of the fundamental Toffoli and Fredkin gates without
resorting to a sequence of single- and two-qubit gates. This yields more
compact schemes and potentially reduces the number of ancilla photons. The
proposed setups involve passive linear optics, sources of auxiliary single
photons or maximally entangled pairs of photons, and single-photon detectors.
In particular, we propose an interferometric implementation of the Toffoli gate
in the coincidence basis, which does not require any ancilla photons and is
experimentally feasible with current technology.

is investigated a simple QFT system with interaction, consisting of a classical
source coupled linearly to a quantum scalar field, that is exactly solved. The
expression for the time evolution of the state describing the system is given.
The expectation value of any arbitrary ``good'' local observable, expressed as
a function of the field operator and its space and time derivatives, is
obtained explicitly at all order in the field-matter coupling constant. These
expectation values have a source dependent part that is shown to be always
causally retarded, while the non local contributions are source independent and
