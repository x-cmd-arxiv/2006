explore specific constraints that the mathematical properties of the induction

normal galaxies, while the clustering amplitude (r_0) of LINERs is consistent
with that of the parent galaxy population. The similarities in the host
properties (color and concentration index) of Seyferts and LINERs suggest that
the difference in their r_0 is not driven by the morphology-density relation.
We find that the luminosity of [O I] emission shows the strongest influence on
AGN clustering, with low L([O I]) sources having the highest r_0. This trend is
much stronger than the previously detected dependence on L([O III]), which we
confirm. There is a strong correspondence between the clustering patterns of
objects of given spectral type and their physical properties. LINERs, which
exhibit high r_0, show the lowest luminosities and obscuration levels, and
relatively low gas densities (n_e), suggesting that these objects harbor black
holes that are relatively massive yet weakly active or inefficient in their
accretion, probably due to the insufficiency of their fuel supply. Seyferts,
which have low r_0, are luminous and show large n_e, suggesting that their
black holes are less massive but accrete quickly and efficiently enough to
clearly dominate the ionization. The low r_0 of the H II galaxies can be
understood as a consequence of both the morphology-density and star formation
rate-density relations, however, their spectral properties suggest that their
centers hide amidst large amounts of obscuring material black holes of
generally low mass whose activity remains relatively feeble. Our own Milky Way
may be a typical such case.[abridged]

population. Older mock galaxies are significantly more clustered in our
catalog, which consists of satellite haloes as well as the central peaks of
discrete haloes, selected solely by peak circular velocity. This age dependence
is caused mainly by the age-clustering relation for discrete haloes, recently
found by Gao et al., acting mostly on field members, combined with the tendency
for older mock galaxies to lie within groups and clusters, where galaxy
clustering is enhanced. Our results suggest that the clustering age dependence
is manifested in real galaxies. At small scales (less than ~5 Mpc/h), the very
simple assumption that galaxy colour depends solely on halo age is inconsistent
with the strength of the observed clustering colour trends, where red galaxies
become increasingly more clustered than blue galaxies toward smaller scales,
suggesting that luminosity weighted galaxy ages do not closely trace the
assembly epoch of their dark matter hosts. The age dependence is present but is
much weaker for satellite haloes lying within groups and clusters than for the
global population.

the protogalactic collapse phase, leading to disk galaxies that are too compact
with respect to the observations. High-resolution N-body/SPH simulations in a
cosmological context are presented including cold gas and dark matter. A halo
with quiet merging activity since z~3.8 and with a high spin parameter is
analysed that should be an ideal candidate for the formation of an extended
galactic disk. We show that the gas and the dark matter have similar specific
angular momenta until a merger event occurs at z~2 with a mass ratio of 5:1.
All the gas involved in the merger loses a substantial fraction of its specific
angular momentum due to tidal torques and falls quickly into the center.
Dynamical friction plays a minor role,in contrast to previous claims. In fact,
after this event a new extended disk begins to form from gas that was not
involved in the 5:1 merger event and that falls in subsequently. We argue that
the angular momentum problem of disk galaxy formation is a merger problem: in
cold dark matter cosmology substantial mergers with mass ratios of 1:1 to 6:1
are expected to occur in almost all galaxies. We suggest that energetic
feedback processes could in principle solve this problem, however only if the
heating occurs at the time or shortly before the last substantial merger event.
Good candidates for such a coordinated feedback would be a merger-triggered
star burst or central black hole heating. If a large fraction of the low
angular momentum gas would be ejected as a result of these processes, late-type
galaxies could form with a dominant extended disk component, resulting from
late infall, a small bulge-to-disk ratio and a low baryon fraction, in
agreement with observations.

examine the sensitivity of the future microlensing survey to Earth-mass planets
located in the habitable zone. For this, we estimate the fraction of Earth-mass
planets that will be located in the habitable zone of their parent stars by
carrying out detailed simulation of microlensing events based on standard
models of the physical and dynamic distributions and the mass function of
Galactic matter. From this investigation, we find that among the total
detectable Earth-mass planets from the survey, those located in the habitable
zone would comprise less than 1% even under a less-conservative definition of
the habitable zone. We find the main reason for the low sensitivity is that the
projected star-planet separation at which the microlensing planet detection
efficiency becomes maximum (lensing zone) is in most cases substantially larger
than the median value of the habitable zone. We find that the ratio of the

formation of the black hole as well as the gas accretion onto it are triggered

System, the evolution of the Earth, and the chemical basis for life, we are not
much closer than the ancient Greeks to an answer of whether life has arisen and
persisted on any other planet. The origin of life as a planetary phenomenon
will probably resist successful explanation as long as we lack an early record
of its evolution and additional examples. It is widely thought that the
geologic record shows that life emerged quickly after the end of prolonged
bombardment of the Earth. New data and simulations contradict that view and
suggest that more than half a billion years of unrecorded Earth history may
have elapsed between the origin of life and LUCA. The impact-driven exchange of
material between the inner planets may have allowed earliest life to be more
cosmopolitan. Indeed, terrestrial life may not have originated on the Earth, or
even on any planet. Smaller bodies, e.g. the parent bodies of primitive
meteorites, offer alternative environments for the origin of life in our Solar
System. The search for past or present life on Mars is an obvious path to
greater enlightenment. The subsurface oceans of some icy satellites of the
outer planets represent the best locales to search for an independent origin of
life in the Solar System because of the high dynamical barriers for transfer,
intense radiation at their surfaces, and thick ice crusts. The ``ultimate''
answer to the abundance of life in the Cosmos will remain the domain of
speculation until we develop observatories capable of detecting habitable
planets - and signs of life - around the nearest million or so stars.

possible systematic effects in mapping real clusters to underlying dark halos

a function of environmental (cluster-centric distance, local galaxy density)

find that, for any particular galaxy luminosity, the ellipticals in the inner
and denser regions of the clusters are about 5% smaller than those in the outer
regions, which is in good agreement with the finding of Strom & Strom (1978)
based on photographic photometry. The null hypothesis (ie., galaxy sizes are
independent of the cluster-centric distance or density) is rejected at a
significance level of better than 99.7%. Numericals models of Aguilar & White
(1986) predict that tidal stripping can lead to changes in the whole structure
of ellipticals producing shrinkage and brightening of the galaxy, qualitatively
consistent with our measurements and also with the findings of Trujillo et al.

on the microscopic processes of the interface formation and on the iron
valence-band. We show that the Fe contact with ZnSe induces a chemical
conversion of the ZnSe outermost atomic layers. The main driving force that
induces this rearrangement is the requirement for a stable Fe-Se bonding at the
interface and a Se monolayer that floats at the Fe growth front. The released
Zn atoms are incorporated in substitution in the Fe lattice position. This
formation process is independent of the ZnSe surface termination (Zn or Se).
The Fe valence-band evolution indicates that the d-states at the Fermi level
show up even at submonolayer Fe coverage but that the Fe bulk character is only
recovered above 10 monolayers. Indeed, the Fe &#61508;1-band states,
theoretically predicted to dominate the tunneling conductance of Fe/ZnSe/Fe
junctions, are strongly modified at the FM/SC interface.

As the bias V is tuned away from the boundary value V_{th} of the bistable

derive a relation providing f from the dependence of a given diffraction peak's
amplitude on the azimuthal angle. The method is applied to two systems of
Na-fluorohectorite (NaFH) clay particles, using synchrotron radiation and a
WAXS setup with a two-dimensional detector. In the first system, which consists
of dry-pressed NaFH samples, the orientation distribution probability function
corresponds to a classical uniaxial nematic order. The second system is
observed in bundles of polarized NaFH particles in silicon oil; in this case,
the nanostacks have their directors on average in a plane normal to the
reference direction, and f is a function of the angle between a nano-stack's
director and that plane. In both cases, a suitable Maier-Saupe function is
obtained for the distributions, and the reference direction is determined with
respect to the laboratory frame. The method only requires one scattering image.

from several diffraction peaks independently.

that the odd-th bond is antiferromagnetic with strength $J$ and even-th bond
can take the values ${\JS}$ and ${\JW}$ $ ({\JS} > J > {\JW} > 0)$ randomly
with probability $p$ and $1-p$, respectively. The pure version ($p=0$ and
$p=1$) of this model has a spin gap but exhibits a field induced
antiferromagnetism in the presence of interchain coupling if Zeeman energy due
to the magnetic field exceeds the spin gap. For $0 < p < 1$, the
antiferromagnetism is induced by randomness at small field region where the
ground state is disordered due to the spin gap in the pure case. At the same
time, this model exhibits randomness induced plateaus at several values of
magnetization. The antiferromagnetism is destroyed on the plateaus. As a
consequence, we find a series of reentrant quantum phase transitions between
the transverse antiferromagnetic phases and disordered plateau phases with the
increase of the magnetic field for moderate strength of interchain coupling.
Above the main plateaus, the magnetization curve consists of a series of small
plateaus and the jumps between them, It is also found that the
antiferromagnetism is induced by infinitesimal interchain coupling at the jumps
between the small plateaus. We conclude that this antiferromagnetism is
supported by the mixing of low lying excited states by the staggered interchain
mean field even though the spin correlation function is short ranged in the
ground state of each chain.

theory (TDDFT) be an exact formulation of the time-evolution of an interacting
N-electron system is critically reexamined. It is demonstrated that the
previous TDDFT foundation, resting on three theorems by Runge and Gross (RG)
[Phys.Rev.Lett.52, 997(1984)], is invalid because undefined phase factors
corrupt the RG action integral functionals. Our finding confirms much of a
previous analysis by van Leeuwen [Int. J. Mod. Phys. B15, 1969(2001)]. To
analyze the RG theorems and other aspects of TDDFT, an utmost simplification of
the KS theory is introduced, in which the density is obtained from a single KS
equation for one spatial (spin-less) particle. This radical KS formulation
allows us to analyze also the concept of KS-type equations derived without a
variational principle. We argue that such an approach can reproduce, but not
predict the time-development of the exact density of the interacting N-electron
system. Besides the issue of the formal exactness of TDDFT, it is shown that
both the static and time-dependent KS linear response equations neglect the
particle-particle (p-p) and hole-hole (h-h) matrix elements of the perturbing
operator. For a local (multiplicative) operator this does not lead to a loss of
information due to a remarkable general property of local operators.
Accordingly, no logical inconsistency arises here, because DFT requires
external potentials to be local.

accurate results for the spectrum, expectation values and eigenstates for all
values of the coupling and in the thermodynamic limit. New aspects of the phase

wavefunction has a macroscopic quantum effect, due to the unique condensate of
electron pairs. The amplitude of the wavefunction is directly related to the
pair density, but both amplitude and phase enter the Josephson current : the
coherent tunneling of pairs between superconductors. Very sensitive devices
exploit the superconducting state, however properties of the {\it condensate}
on the {\it local scale} are largely unknown, for instance, in unconventional
high-T$_c$ cuprate, multiple gap, and gapless superconductors.
  The technique of choice would be Josephson STS, based on Scanning Tunneling
Spectroscopy (STS), where the condensate is {\it directly} probed by measuring
the local Josephson current (JC) between a superconducting tip and sample.
However, Josephson STS is an experimental challenge since it requires stable
superconducting tips, and tunneling conditions close to atomic contact. We
demonstrate how these difficulties can be overcome and present the first
spatial mapping of the JC on the nanometer scale. The case of an MgB$_2$ film,
subject to a normal magnetic field, is considered.

background gravitation that pervades the universe (unavoidable because of the

introduces a possible source of discrepancy between the marches of atomic and
gravitational clocks, which accelerate with respect to one another. This
produces in its turn another discrepancy between the observations, performed
with atomic time, and the theoretical analysis, which uses parametric
astronomical time. Curiously, this approach turns out to be compatible with
current physics; lacking a unified theory of quantum physics and gravitation,
it cannot be discarded {\it a priori}. It happens that this phenomenon has the
same footprint as the Pioneer Anomaly, what suggests a solution to this riddle.
This is because the velocity of the Pioneer spaceship with respect to atomic
time turns out to be slightly smaller that with astronomical time, so that that
the apparent trajectory lags behind the real one. In 1998, after many

number of quarks, exemplifying the pentaquark Theta^{+} (I=0,J=1/2) in the
Borel sum rule. Our approach enables reliable extraction of the pentaquark
properties from the sum rule with good stability in a remarkably wide Borel
window. The appearance of its valid window originates from a favorable setup of
the correlation functions with the aid of it chirality of the interpolating
fields on the analogy of the Weinberg sum rule for the vector currents. Our
setup leads to large suppression of the continuum contributions which have
spoiled the Borel stability in the previous analyses, and consequently enhances
importance of the higher-dimensional contributions of the OPE, which are
indispensable for investigating the pentaquark properties. Implementing the OPE
analysis up to dimension 15, we find that the sum rules for the chiral-even and
odd parts independently give the Theta^{+} mass of 1.68 pm 0.22 GeV with
uncertainties of the condensate values. Our sum rule indeed gives rather flat
Borel curves almost independent of the continuum thresholds both for the mass
and pole residue. Finally, we also discuss possible isolation of the observed
states from the KN scattering state on view of chiral symmetry.

processes) so that the rate is optimal as a universal upper bound. As a first
application, we establish the O((log N)^{-1/2}) upper bound for general It\^o
processes which include multidimensional diffusions. Then, we focus on the
specific family of L\'evy processes for which we derive a general quantization
rate based on the regular variation properties of its L\'evy measure at 0. The
case of compound Poisson processes, which appear as degenerate in the former
approach, is studied specifically: we observe some rates which are between the
finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional ``usual'' rates

  Series",,,"NO. 25 (2005)","math.PR",,"  In this paper we study perpetual integral functionals of diffusions. Our
interest is focused on cases where such functionals can be expressed as first
hitting times for some other diffusions. In particular, we generalize the
result which connects one-sided functionals of Brownian motion with drift with
first hitting times of reflecting diffusions.
  Interpretating perpetual integral functionals as hitting times allows us to
compute numerically their distributions by applying numerical algorithms for
hitting times. Hereby, we discuss two approaches: the numerical inversion of
the Laplace transform of the first hitting time and the numerical solution of
the PDE associated with the distribution function of the first hitting time.
  For numerical inversion of Laplace tranforms we have implemented the Euler
algorithm developed by Abate and Whitt. However, perpetuities lead often to
diffusions for which the explicit forms of the Laplace transforms of first
hitting times are not available. In such cases, and also otherwise, algorithms
for numerical solutions of PDE's can be evoked. In particular, we analyze the
Kolmogorov PDE of some diffusions appearing in our work via the Crank-Nicolson
scheme.

The isotropic part of this quasi-particle interaction is characterized by four
density dependent (dimensionful) Fermi-liquid parameters: $f_0(k_f), f_0'(k_f),
g_0(k_f)$ and $g_0'(k_f)$. In the approximation to $1\pi$-exchange and iterated
$1\pi$-exchange (which as such leads already to a good nuclear matter equation
of state) we find a spin-isospin interaction strength of $g_0'(2m_\pi) = 1.14
$fm$^2$, compatible with existing empirical values. In the next step we include
systematically the contributions from $2\pi$-exchange with virtual
$\Delta(1232) $-isobar excitation which have been found important for good
single-particle properties and spin-stability of nuclear matter. Without any
additional short distance terms the spin-dependent Fermi-liquid parameters
$g_0(k_{f0})$ and $g'_0(k_{f0})$ come out far too large. Estimates of these
short-distance parameters from realistic NN-potentials go in the right
direction, but sizeable enhancement factors are still needed to reproduce the
empirical values of $g_0(k_{f0})$ and $g_0'(k_{f0})$. This points towards the
importance of higher order iterations subsumed in the induced interaction. We
consider also the tensor part of the quasi-nucleon interaction at the Fermi
surface. In comparison to the leading $1\pi$-exchange tensor interaction we
find from the $2\pi$-exchange corrections almost a doubling of the isoscalar
tensor strength $h_0(k_f)$, whereas the isovector tensor strength $h_0'(k_f)$
is much less affected. These features are not changed by the inclusion of the

scale to small scale and extended self similarity properties of the beat to
beat fluctuations of healthy subjects as well as those with congestive heart
failure. To check the Markov nature, we use a novel inverse method that
utilizes a set of data to construct a simple equation that governs the
stochastic process for which the data have been measured, hence enabling us to
reconstruct the stochastic process. The inverse method provides a novel
technique for distinguishing the two classes of subjects in terms of a drift
and a diffusion coefficients which behave completely differently for the two
classes of subjects.To investigate the cascade of information from large to
small time scales we also analyze the statistical properties of interbeat
intervals cascade by considering the joint probability distribution for two
interbeat increments. As a result, the joint probability distributions of the
increments in the interbeat intervals obey a Fokker-Planck equation. Finally we
analyze the extended self-similarity (ESS) in the beat-to-beat fluctuations in
the heart rates of healthy and congestive heart failure subjects.The proposed
methods provide the novel techniques for distinguishing the two classes of
subjects in terms of the drift and diffusion coefficients, intermittency
exponents which behave differently for two classes of the subjects, namely,
healthy subjects and those with congestive heart failure.

processes is one of the primary challenges in systems biology. However, despite
considerable advance in the topological analysis of metabolic networks,
explicit kinetic modeling based on differential equations is still often
severely hampered by inadequate knowledge of the enzyme-kinetic rate laws and
their associated parameter values. Here we propose a method that aims to give a
detailed and quantitative account of the dynamical capabilities of metabolic
systems, without requiring any explicit information about the particular
functional form of the rate equations. Our approach is based on constructing a
local linear model at each point in parameter space, such that each element of
the model is either directly experimentally accessible, or amenable to a
straightforward biochemical interpretation. This ensemble of local linear
models, encompassing all possible explicit kinetic models, then allows for a
systematic statistical exploration of the comprehensive parameter space. The
method is applied to two paradigmatic examples: The glycolytic pathway of yeast
and a realistic-scale representation of the photosynthetic Calvin cycle.

  perturbation analysis","9 pages",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Seeking for a relativistic generalisation of the non-relativistic
Schroedinger equation, one very soon arrives at equations with a square-root
operator by having applied the quantum mechanical correspondence principle to
the formula of relativistic energy. The problems of these equations are at
least two fold: when coupled to an electromagnetic field, their relativistic
invariance is not evident or even doubtful and due to their non-local
character, it seems to be that they cannot be maintained mathematically in an
easy way. For spin-1/2 particles, these difficulties can be overcome by the
Dirac equation, which leads e.g. to the prediction of binding energies of an
electron in a hydrogen atom that are compatible with experimental results up to
the forth order of the fine structure constant, inclusively. Ignoring the
problem with relativistic invariance, one may ask, if there exists a
square-root equation, for which one can achieve the same good agreement with
experiments for the latter physical system. It is going to be shown, that the
answer to this question is affirmative and does not exceed the skills obtained
in a course about non-relativistic quantum mechanics and physics of atoms,
respectively.

aspect of hidden variable theory (HVT). We consider successive measurements of
non-commuting operators on a input spin $s$ state. The key point is that,
although these operators are non-commuting, they act on different states so
that the joint probabilities for the outputs of successive measurements are
well defined. We show that, in this scenario HVT leads to Bell type
inequalities for the correlation between the outputs of successive
measurements. We account for the maximum violation of these inequalities by
quantum correlations by varying spin value and the number of successive
measurements. Our approach can be used to obtain a measure of the deviation of
QM from realism say in terms of the amount of information needed to be
transferred between successive measurements in order to classically simulate
the quantum correlations.
