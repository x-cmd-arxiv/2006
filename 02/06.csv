massive black hole and starburst with outflow, that seems capable of explaining
most of the observational properties of at least part of AGNs. Our suggestion

with the AGN where the NLR, BLR and BAL region are produced in part by the
outflow process with shells and in compact supernova remnants. The outflow
process in BAL QSOs with extreme IR and Fe II emission is studied. In addition,
the Fe II poblem regarding the BLR of AGN is analysed. Neither the correlations
between the BAL, IR emission, FeII intensity and the intrinsic properties of
the AGN are clearly understood. We suggest here that the behaviour of the BAL,
IR and FeII emission in AGNs can be understood inside an evolutionary and
composite model for AGNs. In our model, strong BAL systems and Fe II emission
are present (and intense) in young IR objects. Orientation/ obscuration effects
take the role of a second parameter providing the segregation between Sy1/Sy2

by a constant non-linear coupling parameter, $f_{\rm NL}$. We fully take into
account the effect of the radiation transfer function, and thus provide the
most accurate estimate of the signal-to-noise ratio of the angular trispectrum

of the trispectrum summed up to a given $l$ is approximately a power-law,
$(S/N)(<l)\sim 2.2\times 10^{-9}f^2_{\rm NL}l^2$, up to the maximum multipole
that we have reached in our numerical calculation, $l=1200$, assuming that the
error is dominated by cosmic variance. Our results indicate that the
signal-to-noise ratio of the temperature trispectrum exceeds that of the
bispectrum at the critical multipole, $l_c \sim 1500~(50/|f_{\rm NL}|)$.
Therefore, the trispectrum of the Planck data is more sensitive to primordial
non-Gaussianity than the bispectrum for $|f_{\rm NL}|\gtrsim 50$. We also
report the predicted constraints on the amplitude of trispectrum, which may be
useful for other non-Gaussian models such as curvaton models.

$H_0$ can then be derived. Furthermore, such measurements on a sample of
clusters with a range of redshift can potentially be used to discriminate
different cosmological models. In this paper, we present statistical studies on
the systematic errors in the determination of $H_0$ due to the triaxiality and
non-isothermality of clusters of galaxies. Different from many other studies
that assume artificially a specific distribution for the intracluster gas, we
start from the triaxial model of dark matter halos obtained from numerical
simulations. The distribution of the intracluster gas is then derived under the
assumption of the hydrodynamic equilibrium. For the equation of state of the
intracluster gas, both the isothermal and the polytropic cases are
investigated. We run Monte Carlo simulations to generate samples of clusters
according to the distributions of their masses, axial ratios, concentration
parameters, as well as line-of-sight directions. To mimic observations, the
estimation of the Hubble constant is done by fitting X-ray and SZ profiles of a
triaxial cluster with the isothermal and spherical $\beta$-model. We find that
for a sample of clusters with $M=10^{14}h^{-1}\hbox{M}_{\odot}$ and $z=0.1$,
the value of the estimated $H_0$ is positively biased with
$H_0^{peak}(estimated)\approx 1.05H_0(true)$ and $H_0^{ave}(estimated)\approx
1.05H_0(true)$ for the isothermal case. For the polytropic case with

cosmological models with dissipative dust fluid (described by dark matter,
baryonic matter and dark energy) are analyzed using dynamical system approach.
With that approach, one is able to see how generic the class of solutions
leading to the desired property -- acceleration -- is. The theory of dynamical
systems also offers a possibility of investigating all possible solutions and
their stability with tools of Newtonian mechanics of a particle moving in a
1-dimensional potential which is parameterized by the cosmological scale
factor. We demonstrate that flat cosmology with bulk viscosity can be treated
as a conservative system with a potential function of the Chaplygin gas type.
We also confront viscous models with SNIa observations. The best fitted models
are obtained by minimizing the $\chi^{2}$ function which is illustrated by
residuals and $\chi^{2}$ levels in the space of model independent parameters.
The general conclusion is that SNIa data supports the viscous model without the
cosmological constant. The obtained values of $\chi^{2}$ statistic are
comparable for both the viscous model and LCDM model. The Bayesian information
criteria are used to compare the models with different power law
parameterization of viscous effects. Our result of this analysis shows that
SNIa data supports viscous cosmology more than the LCDM model if the
coefficient in viscosity parameterization is fixed. The Bayes factor is also
used to obtain the posterior probability of the model.

system at z_abs=2.6183 toward the quasar Q0913+072 (z_em=2.785) using public

density in this absorber is logN(HI)=20.36. Accurate column densities are
derived for CII, NI, OI, AlII, SiII, and FeII. Upper limits are given for FeIII

offers the unique opportunity to measure accurate CNO abundances in a

abundances in the DLA system are consistent with an enrichment from a single
starburst of a zero-metallicity population of massive stars (10-50 M_sun)

  meeting (October 2005); full table of VLM binaries can be obtained at
  http://paperclip.as.arizona.edu/~nsiegler/VLM_binaries",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The properties of multiple stellar systems have long provided important
empirical constraints for star formation theories, enabling (along with several
other lines of evidence) a concrete, qualitative picture of the birth and early
evolution of normal stars. At very low masses (VLM; M <~ 0.1 M_sun), down to
and below the hydrogen burning minimum mass, our understanding of formation
processes is not as clear, with several competing theories now under
consideration. One means of testing these theories is through the empirical
characterization of VLM multiple systems. Here, we review the results of
various VLM multiplicity studies to date. These systems can be generally
characterized as closely separated (93% have projected separations Delta < 20
AU) and near equal-mass (77% have M_2/M_1 >= 0.8) occurring infrequently
(perhaps 10-30%). Both the frequency and maximum separation of stellar and
brown dwarf binaries steadily decrease for lower system masses, suggesting that
VLM binary formation and/or evolution may be a mass-dependent process. There is
evidence for a fairly rapid decline in the number of loosely-bound systems
below ~0.3 M_sun, corresponding to a factor of 10-20 increase in the minimum
binding energy of VLM binaries as compared to more massive stellar binaries.
This wide-separation ``desert'' is present among both field (~1-5 Gyr) and
older (> 100 Myr) cluster systems, while the youngest (<~10 Myr) VLM binaries,
particularly those in nearby, low-density star forming regions, appear to have
somewhat different systemic properties. We compare these empirical trends to
predictions laid out by current formation theories, and outline future
observational studies needed to probe the full parameter space of the lowest
mass multiple systems.

the optical range using the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) and the Intermediate
Dispersion Spectrograph (IDS). We have observed a large number of short and
weak flares occurring very frequently (flare activity > 0.71 hours-1). This is
in favour of the very important role that flares can play in stellar coronal
heating. The detected flares are non white-light flares and, though most of
solar flares belong to this kind, very few such events had been previously
observed on stars. The behaviour of different chromospheric lines (Balmer
series from H_alpha to H_11, Ca II H & K, Na I D_1 & D_2, He I 4026 AA and He I

estimated the physical parameters of the flaring plasma by using a procedure
which assumes a simplified slab model of flares. All the obtained physical
parameters are consistent with previously derived values for stellar flares,
and the areas - less than 2.3% of the stellar surface - are comparable with the
size inferred for other solar and stellar flares. Finally, we have studied the
relationships between the physical parameters and the area, duration, maximum
flux and energy released during the detected flares.

therefore extends the number of possible breaking patterns that can be

of quantum double algebras is an optimal tool when analyzing a wide variety of

crystals. The power of this approach stems from the fact that one may
characterize both ordinary and topological modes as representations of a single

defect mediated as well as ordinary symmetry breaking patterns and subsequent
confinement phenomena can be given. The formalism applies equally well to
systems exhibiting global, local, internal and/or external (i.e. spatial)
symmetries. The subtle differences in interpretation for the various situations
are pointed out. We show that the Hopf symmetry breaking formalism reproduces
the known results for ordinary (electric) condensates, and we derive formulae
for defect (magnetic) condensates which also involve the phenomenon of symmetry
restoration. These results are applied in two papers which will be published in

for the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. One of the unique feature of the
model is that the $\alpha$ as obtained from the structure factor $S(k,t)$ for

increases linearly with x. Furthermore, we show that the Zr atoms tend to

change the system behavior. Even one-bit of information can increase the
diversity order of the system compared to the system with no transmitter

transmitter increases, the diversity order for each multiplexing gain increases

adapts the power control strategy based on the average channel conditions of

medium is regarded as a valuable tool to probe the medium created in
ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. The angular correlation pattern of
hadrons associated with a hard trigger in the region of p_T ~1-2 GeV which
exhibits a dip in the expected position of the away side jet has given rise to
the idea that energy is lost predominantly to propagating collective modes
('Mach cones'). Recent measurements by the STAR collaboration have shown that
for a high p_T > 8 GeV trigger the angular pattern of associate hadrons for p_T
> 4 GeV shows the emergence of the expected away side peak. These di-jet events
suggest that the away side parton may emerge occasionally without substantial
energy loss. Since in such a back-to-back configuration one of the partons may
travel through the central region of the fireball, the average in-medium
pathlength is substantial and the expected energy loss is not only sensitive to
the initial geometry of matter but also to the change of geometry due to
expansion. We show that radiative energy loss is able to explain the dijet
events provided that the expansion of the medium is taken into account.

"math/0602093","Tobias H. Jaeger","Tobias Jaeger","The creation of strange non-chaotic attractors in non-smooth saddle-node
  bifurcations","Revised version, 197 pages; Compared to the previous version, an new
  section now gives an overview over the main results, and more details on the
  applications were included. To appear in Memoirs of the AMS",,,,"math.DS",,"  We propose a general mechanism by which strange non-chaotic attractors (SNA)
are created during the collision of invariant curves in quasiperiodically
forced systems. This mechanism is first discussed on an heuristic level and by
means of simulations. In the considered examples, a stable and an unstable
invariant circle undergo a saddle-node bifurcation, but instead of a neutral
invariant curve there exists a strange non-chaotic attractor-repeller pair at
the bifurcation point. This process is accompanied by a very characteristic
behaviour of the invariant curves prior to their collision, which we call
'exponential evolution of peaks'.
  This observation is then used to give a rigorous description of non-smooth
saddle-node bifurcations. The non-smoothness of the bifurcations and the
resulting existence of SNA is established via the occurrence
'sink-source-orbits', meaning orbits with positive Lyapunov exponent both
forwards and backwards in time.
  In order to demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, we discuss its
application to some parameter families, including the so-called Harper map.
Further, we prove the existence of strange non-chaotic attractors with a
certain inherent symmetry, as they occur in non-smooth pitchfork bifurcations.

examples on $Z^d$ and on homogeneous trees in which product measures are
stationary even when they are neither homogeneous nor reversible. We then begin
the task of narrowing down the possibilities for existence of other stationary
measures for the process on $Z^d$. In particular, we study stationary measures
that are invariant under translations in all directions orthogonal to a fixed
nonzero vector. We then prove a number of convergence results as $t\to\infty$

we show convergence of such measures to the above stationary measures. We also

gases (CO$_2$ and SF$_6$) with Prandtl numbers near $Pr\simeq 1$ and in a
H$_2$-Xe mixture with $Pr=0.17$. Focusing on the strongly nonlinear regime we
employ Galerkin stability analyses and direct numerical simulations of the
Navier-Stokes equations. For $Pr \simeq 1$ and intermediate non-Boussinesq
effects we find reentrance of stable hexagons as the Rayleigh number is
increased. For stronger non-Boussinesq effects the hexagons do not exhibit any
amplitude instability to rolls. Seemingly, this result contradicts the
experimentally observed transition from hexagons to rolls. We resolve this
discrepancy by including the effect of the lateral walls. Non-Boussinesq
effects modify the spiral defect chaos observed for larger Rayleigh numbers.
For convection in SF$_6$ we find that non-Boussinesq effects strongly increase
the number of small, compact convection cells and with it enhance the cellular
character of the patterns. In H$_2$-Xe, closer to threshold, we find instead an
enhanced tendency toward roll-like structures. In both cases the number of
spirals and of target-like components is reduced. We quantify these effects
using recently developed diagnostics of the geometric properties of the

encoding rates $k/n$ asymptotically approaching the maximum possible value.
Explicit constructions of these topological codes are presented using surfaces
of arbitrary genus. We find a class of regular toric codes that are optimal.
For physical implementations, we present planar topological codes.

colouring pseudo-telepathy game for the set of vectors having Kochen-Specker
property in four dimension. A sufficient condition to have a winning strategy
for the impossible colouring pseudo-telepathy game for general $d$-dimension,
with single use of NL-box, is then described. It is also shown that the magic
square pseudo-telepathy game of any size can be won by using just two ebits of
entanglement -- for quantum strategy, and by a single NL-box -- for non-local
strategy.

external potentials by Gross et al. [Phys. Rev. A 37, 2809 (1988)] is
self-contradictory since the to-be-refuted assumption (negation) regarding the
ensemble one-electron densities and the assumption about the external
potentials are logically incompatible to each other due to the Kato
electron-nuclear cusp theorem. It is however proved that the Kato theorem
itself provides a satisfactory proof of this theorem.
