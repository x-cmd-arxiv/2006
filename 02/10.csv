explaining a broad-band brightening of the HST-1 region related to the variable
activity of the central core. We show that assuming a previous epoch of the
high central black hole activity resulting in ejection of excess particles and
photons down along the jet, one may first expect a high-energy flare of HST-1
due to inverse-Comptonisation of the nuclear radiation, followed after a few
years by an increase in the synchrotron continuum of this region. If this is
the case, then the recently observed increase in the knot luminosity in all

FeH, which are seen throughout the M and L spectral types. These molecular
features are not as blended as other optical molecular bands, are reasonably
strong through most of the spectral range, and exhibit a response to magnetic
fields which is easier to detect than other magnetic diagnostics, including the
usual optical and near-infrared atomic spectral lines that have heretofore been
employed. The FeH bands show a systematic growth as the star gets cooler. We do
not find any contamination by CrH in the relevant spectral region. We are able
to model cool and rapidly-rotating spectra from warmer, slowly-rotating spectra
utilizing an interpolation scheme based on optical depth scaling. We show that
the FeH features can distinguish between negligible, moderate, and high
magnetic fluxes on low-mass dwarfs, with a current accuracy of about one
kilogauss. Two different approaches to extracting the information from the
spectra are developed and compared. Which one is superior depends on a number
of factors. We demostrate the validity of our new procedures by comparing the
spectra of three M stars whose magnetic fluxes are already known from atomic
line analysis. The low and high field stars are used to produce interpolated
moderate-strength spectra which closely resemble the moderate-field star. The
assumption of linear behavior for the magnetic effects appears to be
reasonable, but until the molecular constants are better understood the method
is subject to that assumption, and rather approximate. Nonetheless, it opens a
new regime of very low-mass objects to direct confirmation and testing of their
magnetic dynamos.

shape of the light curve and the ratio L_X (1-10 keV)/L_opt resemble the
mini-outbursts observed in GRO J0422+32 and XTE J1859+226. During early
decline, we find a 0.02-mag amplitude variation consistent with a superhump
modulation, like the one observed during the 2000 outburst. Similarly, XTE
J1118+480 displayed a double-humped ellipsoidal modulation distorted by a
superhump wave when settled into a near-quiescence level, suggesting that the
disk expanded to the 3:1 resonance radius after outburst where it remained
until early quiescence. The system reached quiescence at R=19.02+-0.03 about
three months after the onset of the outburst. The optical rise preceded the
X-ray rise by at most 4 days. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at the
different epochs during outburst are all quasi-power laws with F_nu

primordial magnetic field (PMF) can strongly affect the CMB power spectrum and
the formation of large scale structure. In this paper, we calculate the CMB
temperature anisotropies generated by including a power-law magnetic field at

galaxies (ULIRGs; UGC 5101, Mrk 273, and IRAS 17208-0014) in the 3-mm
wavelength range, using the Nobeyama Millimeter Array. Both the HCN (J=1-0) and
HCO+ (J=1-0) molecular lines were observed simultaneously. HCN emission was
clearly detected at the nuclear positions of these ULIRGs, and HCO+ emission
was detected at the nuclear positions of UGC 5101 and IRAS 17208-0014. The HCN
to HCO+ brightness-temperature ratios toward the nuclei of the three ULIRGs
were derived and compared with those of lower luminosity galaxies known to be
dominated by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) or starbursts. In UGC 5101 and Mrk
273, where there is evidence for obscured AGNs from previous observations at
other wavelengths, we found high HCN/HCO+ ratios (>1.8) that are in the range
found for AGN-dominated galaxies. In IRAS 17208-0014, where the presence of a
powerful obscured AGN has been unclear, the ratio (1.7) is in between the
observed values for starburst- and AGN-dominated galaxies. The high HCN/HCO+
brightness-temperature ratios in UGC 5101 and Mrk 273 could be the consequence
of an HCN abundance enhancement, which is expected from chemical effects of the
central X-ray emitting AGN on the surrounding dense molecular gas. Our proposed
millimeter interferometric method based on HCN/HCO+ ratios may be an effective
tool for unveiling elusive buried AGNs at the cores of ULIRGs, especially
because of the negligible dust extinction at these wavelengths.

substantial amounts of hydrogen associated with the system. Contrary to
previous claims, we show that its unusual properties can be understood within
the framework of one of the most favoured progenitor models, the so-called
supersoft channel. This requires that the donor star was initially relatively
massive ($\sim 3\Ms$) and that the system experienced a delayed dynamical
instability, leading to a large amount of mass loss from the system in the last
few $10^4 $yr before the explosion. This can produce the inferred hydrogen-rich
circumstellar environment, most likely with a disc-like geometry. However, to
apply these models requires a larger accretion efficiency onto the white dwarf
than is assumed in present parameterizations. If this is confirmed, it would
most likely increase estimates for the frequency of the single-degenerate
channel. Based on population synthesis simulations we estimate that not more
than 1 in 100 SNe Ia should belong to this subgroup of SNe Ia.

massive than the Sun. Though the strongest candidate for a so called
intermediate mass black hole, the only support stems from the observed
luminosity and the 0.05-0.1 Hz quasi periodicity in its signal. Interestingly,
the $7-12 $Myr old star cluster MGG-11 which has been associated with the X-ray
source is sufficiently dense that an intermediate mass black hole could have
been produced in the cluster core via collision runaway. The recently
discovered $62.0\pm 2.5$ day periodicity in the X-ray source X-1 further
supports the hypothesis that this source is powered by a black hole several
hundred times more massive than the Sun. We perform detailed binary evolution
simulations with an accreting compact object of $10-5000 \msun $ and find that
the X-ray luminosity, the age of the cluster, the observed quasi periodic
oscillations and the now observed orbital period are explained best by a black
hole of $200-5000 \msun $ that accretes material from a $22-25\msun$ giant
companion in a state of Roche-lobe contact. Interestingly such a companion star
is consistent with the expectation based on the tidal capture in a young and
dense star cluster like MGG-11, making the picture self consistent.

However, search for annihilation emission from individual Type Ia supernovae

511 keV annihilation flux from individual SNe Ia, as well as their contribution
to the overall diffuse emission, depends critically on the escape fraction of
positrons produced in $^{56}$Co decays. Late optical light curves suggest that
this fraction may be as high as 5%. We searched for positron annihilation
radiation from the historical Type Ia supernova SN 1006 using the SPI
instrument on \integral. We did not detect significant 511 keV line emission,
with a 3$\sigma$ flux upper limit of 0.59 x 10$^{-4}$ ergs cm^-2 s^-1 for \wsim
1 Msec exposure time, assuming a FWHM of 2.5 keV. This upper limit corresponds
to a 7.5% escape fraction, 50% higher than the expected 5% escape scenario, and
rules out the possibility that Type Ia supernovae produce all of the positrons
in the Galaxy (~ 12% escape fraction), if the mean positron lifetime is less
than 10$^{5}$ years. Future observations with \integral will provide stronger
limits on the escape fraction of positrons, the mean positron lifetime, and the

inferred isotropic release in gamma-rays of ~4.44 x 10^53 ergs in the 1-10^4
keV rest frame energy range. The Swift X-Ray Telescope followed the afterglow
for 14 days, detecting two breaks in the light curve at 7.4(+/-1.5) ks and 58.0
(+9.9/-15.4) ks after the burst trigger. The power law decay slopes before,
between and after these breaks were 0.25 (+0.16/-0.17), 1.17 (+0.08/-0.09) and
1.97 (+0.27/-0.28) respectively. The light curve can also be fit with a
`smoothly broken' power law model with a break observed at ~ T+18.5 ks, with
decay slopes of ~0.4 and ~1.8 before and after the break respectively. The
X-ray afterglow shows no spectral variation over the course of the Swift
observations, being well fit with a single power law of photon index ~1.90.
This behaviour is expected for the cessation of continued energisation of the
ISM shock followed by a break caused by a jet, either uniform or structured.
Neither break is consistent with a cooling break. The spectral energy
distribution indeed shows the cooling frequency to be below the X-ray but above
optical frequencies. The optical -- X-ray spectrum also shows that there is
significant X-ray absorption in excess of that due to our Galaxy but very
little optical/UV extinction, with E(B-V) ~0.10 for a SMC-like extinction
curve.

near-infrared, sub-millimeter, millimeter, radio, and Very Long Baseline Array
(VLBA) monitoring. S5 0716+71 was very bright at radio frequencies and in a
rather faint optical state during the INTEGRAL pointing; significant inter-day
and low intra-day variability was recorded in the radio regime, while typical
fast variability features were observed in the optical band. No correlation was
found between the radio and optical emission. The source was not detected by
INTEGRAL, neither by the X-ray monitor JEM-X nor by the gamma-ray imager ISGRI,

estimated. A brightness temperature Tb>2.1x10^{14} K was inferred from the
radio variability, but no corresponding signatures of IC avalanches were

either a lower limit delta>8 to the Doppler factor affecting the radio emission

galaxy population is into bulges and discs and that the galaxy bimodality
reflects the two component nature of galaxies and not two distinct galaxy
classes. We argue that these two-components require two independent formation
mechanisms/processes and advocate early bulge formation through initial
collapse and ongoing disc formation through splashback, infall and
merging/accretion. We calculate the B-band luminosity-densities and
stellar-mass densities within each subdivision and estimate that the z ~ 0
stellar mass content in spheroids, bulges and discs is 35 +/- 2 per cent, 18
+/- 7 and 47 +/- 7 per cent respectively. [Abridged]

also strengthen the conjecture that a jet is aligned with the spin of the BH at
its base and that the jet flips into the direction of the orbital angular
momentum of the pre-merger binary black hole (BHB). We could also restrict the
distance where the pre-merger jet is bent into Z-shape by the inspiralling
galaxy to the range of 30-100 kpc. One of three possible orientations of the
jet relative to our line of sight is more likely than the others and allows us
to deduce the direction of the spin of the merged BH. The existence of XRGs and
ZRGs proves that the binary has merged, contrary to previous speculations that
after a merger of two galaxies the decay of the BHB stalls due to loss cone
depletion. In ZRGs the black holes probably merge on timescales of some 10^8 yr
after the bending of the jet in a distance of about 50 kpc. Thus, in a way, the
bending starts a stop watch for the rest of the merger.

relaxation via an empirical parameter known as the ``spin diffusion length''.
According to this model, the ensemble averaged spin of electrons drifting and
diffusing in a solid decays exponentially with distance due to spin dephasing
interactions. The characteristic length scale associated with this decay is the
spin diffusion length. The DD model also predicts that this length is different
for ``upstream'' electrons traveling in a decelerating electric field than for
``downstream'' electrons traveling in an accelerating field. However this
picture ignores energy quantization in confined systems (e.g. quantum wires)
and therefore fails to capture the non-trivial influence of subband structure
on spin relaxation. Here we highlight this influence by simulating upstream
spin transport in a multi-subband quantum wire, in the presence of
D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation, using a semi-classical model that accounts
for the subband structure rigorously.
  We find that upstream spin transport has a complex dynamics that defies the
simplistic definition of a ``spin diffusion length''.
  In fact, spin does not decay exponentially or even monotonically with
distance, and the drift diffusion picture fails to explain the qualitative
behavior, let alone predict quantitative features accurately. Unrelated to spin
transport, we also find that upstream electrons undergo a ``population
inversion'' as a consequence of the energy dependence of the density of states
in a quasi one-dimensional structure.

t Co|10 nm Cu), while materials in contact with the Cu outer interfaces are
varied to determine their influence on the magnetization damping. The resonance
field and the linewidth were studied for in-plane magnetic fields in field
swept experiments at a fixed frequency, from 4 to 25 GHz. The Co layers have a
lower magnetization density than the bulk, and an interface contribution to the
magnetic anisotropy normal to the film plane. The Gilbert damping, as
determined from the frequency dependence of the linewidth, increases with
decreasing Co layer thickness for films with outer Pt layers. This enhancement
is not observed in structures without Pt layers. The result can be understood
in terms of a non-local contribution to the damping due to spin pumping from Co
through the Cu layer and spin relaxation in Pt layers. Pt layers just 1.5 nm
thick are found to be sufficient to enhance the damping and thus act as
efficient ""spin-sinks"". In structures with Pt outer layers, this non-local
contribution to the damping becomes predominant when the Co layer is thinner

strong border effect which does not scale with system size), we examine the

Removing border effects, the conservative regime exhibits a Poisson-like degree
statistics and is uncorrelated, while the nonconservative has a broad
power-law-like distribution of degrees (if the smallest events are ignored),
which reproduces the observed behavior of real earthquakes. In this regime the
graph has also a unusually strong degree correlation among the vertices with
higher degree, which is the result of the existence of temporary attractors for
the dynamics: as the system evolves, the epicenters concentrate increasingly on
fewer sites, exhibiting strong synchronization, but eventually spread again
over the lattice after a series of sufficiently large earthquakes. We propose
an analytical description of the dynamics of this growing network, considering
a Markov process network with hidden variables, which is able to account for

dimensionless coupling the quasiparticle renormalization at small momentum in
the breathing polaron is much smaller, ii) the quasiparticle renormalization at
small momentum in the breathing polaron increases with phonon frequency unlike
in the Holstein model where it decreases, iii) in the Holstein model the
quasiparticle dispersion displays a kink and a small gap at an excitation
energy equal to the phonon frequency w0 while in the breathing model it
displays two gaps, one at excitation energy w0 and another one at 2w0. These
differences have two reasons: first, the momentum of the relevant scattered
phonons increases with increasing polaron momentum and second, the breathing
bare coupling is an increasing function of the phonon momentum. These result in
an effective electron-phonon coupling for the breathing model which is an
increasing function of the total polaron momentum, such that the small momentum
polaron is in the weak coupling regime while the large momentum one is in the
strong coupling regime. However the first reason does not hold if the free

which cannot be described by the charge renormalization concept [S. Alexander

macroions, we find an almost perfect qualitative agreement between our
simulation data and the primitive model. However, on a quantitative level,
neither Debye-H\""uckel theory nor the charge renormalization concept can be
confirmed in detail. This seems mainly to be related to the fact, that for
small ion concentrations, microionic layers can strongly overlap, whereas,
simultaneously, excluded volume effects are less important. In the case of
isolated triples, where we compare between coaxial and triangular geometries,
we find attractive corrections to pairwise additivity in the limit of small
macroion separations and salt concentrations. These triplet interactions arise
if all three microionic layers around the macroions exhibit a significant
overlap. In contrast to the case of two isolated colloids, the charge
distribution around a macroion in a triple is found to be anisotropic.

c_DNA^{-0.29\pm0.04} and is independent of the ionic strength in the low added

vary with DNA concentration but depends on the ionic strength of the added salt
as I_s^{-1} in the high added salt regime. On the other hand, the
characteristic length scale of the HF process, 3<L_HF<50 nm, varyes with DNA
concentration as c_DNA^{-0.5} for intermediate and large DNA concentrations. At
low DNA concentrations and in the low added salt limit the characteristic
length scale of the HF process scales as c_DNA^{-0.33}. We put these results in
perspective regarding the integrity of the double stranded form of DNA at low

counterions are primarily active in the HF relaxation, while the condensed
counterions play a role only in the LF relaxation. We also suggest theoretical
interpretations for all these length scales in the whole regime of DNA and salt

modeled by the Lennard-Jones potential, with symmetric parameters that lead to
a miscibility gap in the bulk. In the thin-film geometry, an interesting

with the state explosion problem, we have proposed in previous works to
partition the reachability graph, and to perform the verification on each part
separately. Moreover, we have defined a class, called Bmod, of dynamic
properties that are verifiable by parts, whatever the partition. We decide if a
property P belongs to Bmod by looking at the form of the Buchi automaton that
accepts the negation of P. However, when a property P belongs to Bmod, the
property f => P, where f is a fairness assumption, does not necessarily belong
to Bmod. In this paper, we propose to use the refinement process in order to
build the parts on which the verification has to be performed. We then show
that with such a partition, if a property P is verifiable by parts and if f is
the expression of the fairness assumptions on a system, then the property f =>
P is still verifiable by parts. This approach is illustrated by its application
to the chip card protocol T=1 using the B engineering design language.

(FLRW) Universe. The spatial inhomogeneities in the magnetic field are
consistently implemented using the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) approximation,
which yields an additional source term due to the interaction of the magnetic
field with velocity perturbations in the plasma. Comparing the solutions with
the corresponding results in our previous work indicates that, on super-horizon
scales, the interaction with the spatially inhomogeneous field in the dust
regime induces the same boost as the case of a homogeneous field, at least in
the ideal MHD approximation. This is attributed to the observation that the MHD
induced part of the generated field effectively only contributes on scales
where the coherence length of the initial field is less than the Hubble scale.
At sub-horizon scales, the GW induced magnetic field is completely negligible
in relation to the MHD induced field. Moreover, there is no amplification found

moderate energies is considered. Substantial renormalization scheme dependence
of the perturbative predictions obtained with the conventional renormalization
group improved perturbative approximants is discussed, using as an example the
QCD effective charge appearing in the static interquark potential and the QCD
corrections to the Gross-Llewellyn-Smith sum rule in the deep inelastic
neutrino-nucleon scattering. A new method for evaluating the QCD predictions at
moderate energies is proposed, based on a modified couplant, which is
constructed to be free from Landau singularity and less renormalization scheme
dependent than the conventional couplant. The modified couplant contains an
adjustable parameter, which may be used to improve the modified perturbative
predictions in low orders by utilizing some information outside of perturbation
theory. This parameter is fixed by matching the modified predictions to the
phenomenological expression for the effective charge in the interquark
potential. The renormalization scheme dependence of the perturbative
predictions in the modified expansion is then discussed in detail, including
the predictions selected by the Principle of Minimal Sensitivity applied to the
modified expansion. It is shown that the predictions obtained in the modified
expansion are much more stable with respect to change of the renormalization
scheme parameters than the predictions obtained in the conventional approach.
It is also found that the modified predictions display somewhat weaker energy
dependence then the predictions obtained with the conventional expansion, which
may help accommodate in a consistent way some low values of the strong coupling
parameter measured at low energies with the values measured at high energies.

by mismatch between the Fermi surfaces of the pairing quarks in 2-flavor color
superconductor. With the increase of mismatch, the 2SC phase exhibits
chromomagnetic instability as well as color neutral baryon current instability.
We describe the 2SC phase in the nonlinear realization framework, and show that
each instability indicates the spontaneous generation of the corresponding
pseudo Nambu-Golstone current. The Nambu-Goldstone currents generation state
covers the gluon phase as well as the one-plane wave LOFF state. We further
point out that, when charge neutrality condition is required, there exists a
narrow unstable LOFF (Us-LOFF) window, where not only off-diagonal gluons but
the diagonal 8-th gluon cannot avoid the magnetic instability. In this Us-LOFF
window, the diagonal magnetic instability cannot be cured by off-diagonal gluon
condensate in the color superconducting phase.

observed universe is interpreted as a 4-brane in six dimensions, with a
Kaluza-Klein spatial direction in addition to the usual three noncompact
spatial dimensions. This construction is distinct from other brane world
constructions in six dimensions, which introduce the universe as a 3-brane
corresponding to a topological defect in six dimensions, or which require a
particular configuration of matter fields on the brane. We demonstrate that the
model reproduces localized gravity on the brane in the expected form of a
Newtonian potential with Yukawa-type corrections. We show that allowed
parameter ranges include values which potentially solve the hierarchy problem.
An exact nonlinear gravitational wave solution on the background is exhibited.
The class of solutions given applies to Ricci-flat geometries in four
dimensions, and consequently includes brane world realizations of the
Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes as particular examples. Arguments are given
which suggest that the hybrid compactification of the Salam-Sezgin model can be
extended to reductions to arbitrary Einstein space geometries in four
dimensions.

product on the fiber and intersection product on the base, makes sense on the
total space homology of any fiberwise monoid E over a closed oriented manifold
M. More generally the Thom spectrum E^{-TM} is a ring spectrum. Similarly a
fiberwise module over E defines a module over E^{-TM}. Fiberwise monoids
include adjoint bundles of principal bundles, and the construction is natural
with respect to maps of principal bundles. This naturality implies homotopy
invariance of the algebra structure on H_*(LM) arising from the loop product.
If M=BG is the infinite dimensional classifying space of a compact Lie group,
then we get a well-defined pro-ring spectrum, which we define to be the string
topology of BG. If E has a fiberwise action of the little n-cubes operad then
E^{-TM} is an E_n-ring spectrum. This gives homology operations combining
Dyer-Lashof operations on the fiber and Steenrod operations on the base. We
give several examples where the new operations give homological insight,

identifying the unknown part of this model, the mixing distribution $\mu$, from
a finite sample of independent observations from $\pi_{\mu}$. Assuming that the
mixing distribution has a density function, we wish to estimate this density
within appropriate function classes. A general approach is proposed and its
scope of application is investigated in the case of discrete distributions.
Mixtures of power series distributions are more specifically studied. Standard
methods for density estimation, such as kernel estimators, are available in
this context, and it has been shown that these methods are rate optimal or
almost rate optimal in balls of various smoothness spaces. For instance, these
results apply to mixtures of the Poisson distribution parameterized by its
mean. Estimators based on orthogonal polynomial sequences have also been
proposed and shown to achieve similar rates. The general approach of this paper
extends and simplifies such results. For instance, it allows us to prove
asymptotic minimax efficiency over certain smoothness classes of the
above-mentioned polynomial estimator in the Poisson case. We also study
discrete location mixtures, or discrete deconvolution, and mixtures of discrete

has been a challenge for the last decades. In particular, the reaction pp ->
pppi0 is highly sensitive to short-range mechanisms, because isospin
conservation suppresses the otherwise dominant pion exchange term. However, the
relative importance of the various reaction processes has been very difficult
to establish.
  After reviewing the state-of-the-art of the theoretical approaches, we
address the validity of the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) through
its link to the time-ordered perturbation theory (TOPT) diagrams. As the energy
of the exchanged pion is not determined unambiguously within the
non-relativistic formalism underlying DWBA, we analyse several options to
determine which one is closer to TOPT.
  The S-matrix technique, successfully used below threshold, is shown to
reproduce the results of TOPT for the re-scattering mechanism in pi0
production. It is afterwards applied to full calculations of both charged and
neutral pion production reactions, the cross sections of which are described
successfully. The main production mechanisms and partial waves corresponding to
high angular momentum are included in the calculations. Finally we discuss the
effect on the cross section of the frequent prescriptions for the energy of the

studied. While for general operating conditions the system evolves to a
superposition of Bell states (a dark state) in the long-time limit, under a
particular resonance condition no steady state is reached within a finite time.
We analyze the conditional quantum evolution (quantum trajectories) to
characterize the asymptotic behavior under this resonance condition. A distinct
bimodality is observed: for perfect qubit coupling, the system either evolves
to a maximally entangled Bell state without emitting photons (the dark state),
or executes a sustained entangled-state cycle - random switching between a pair
of Bell states while emitting a continuous photon stream; for imperfect
coupling, two entangled-state cycles coexist, between which a random selection
is made from one quantum trajectory to another.

of GaAs. We show that if a weak coherent state is used to enhance the chi(2)
interaction, the strong coupling regime between two modes at different
frequencies occupied by a single photon is within reach of current technology.
The unstimulated strong coupling of a single photon and a photon pair is very
challenging and will require an improvement in mirocavity quality factors of
2-4 orders of magnitude to be observable.

there exists a joint restriction to the information gain and distortion by

maximize the quality of the outcome by finding the optimal (covariant)
instrument. In order to optimize this joint restriction, the family of
covariant instruments is classified. This is an important side result.

identity of the voters cannot be matched with their vote. To achieve this we
use an entangled quantum state to represent the ballots. Each ballot includes

Measuring the content of the envelope yields a random number which reveals no
information about the vote. However, the outcome of the elections can be

cryptographic systems; however, little is known on their quantum counterpart,
called quantum hardcore functions. With a new insight into fundamental
properties of quantum hardcores, we present three new quantum hardcore
functions for any (strong) quantum one-way function. We also give a ""quantum""
solution to Damgard's question (CRYPTO'88) on a classical hardcore property of
his pseudorandom generator, by proving its quantum hardcore property. Our major
technical tool is the new notion of quantum list-decoding of ""classical""
error-correcting codes (rather than ""quantum"" error-correcting codes), which is
defined on the platform of computational complexity theory and computational
cryptography (rather than information theory). In particular, we give a simple
but powerful criterion that makes a polynomial-time computable classical block
code (seen as a function) a quantum hardcore for all quantum one-way functions.
On their own interest, we construct efficient quantum list-decoding algorithms
for classical block codes whose associated quantum states (called codeword
states) form a nearly phase-orthogonal basis.
