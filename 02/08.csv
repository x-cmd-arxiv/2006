the X-ray flash (XRF) 020903, covering 300 days. The afterglow showed a very
rapid rise in the first day, followed by a relatively slow decay in the next
few days. There was a clear bump in the light curve after ~25 days, accompanied
by a drastic change in the spectral energy distribution. The light curve and
the spectral energy distribution are naturally interpreted as the emergence --
and subsequent decay -- of a supernova (SN), similar to SN 1998bw. At peak
luminosity, the SN is estimated to be 0.8 +/- 0.1 mag fainter than SN1998bw.
This argues in favor of the existence of a supernova associated with this X-ray
flash. A spectrum obtained 35 days after the burst shows emission lines from
the host galaxy. We use this spectrum to put an upper limit on the oxygen
abundance of the host at [O/H] < -0.6 dex. We also discuss a possible trend
between the softness of several bursts and the early behavior of the optical
afterglow, in the sense that XRFs and X-ray rich GRBs seem to have a plateau

where XRFs are similar to GRBs but seen off the jet axis.

interactions have been observed in numerous systems by ROSAT, CHANDRA and
XMM-NEWTON, and understanding them has implications for AGN feedback and galaxy
formation. Starting from the hydrodynamic simulations of Reynolds, Heinz &
Begelman, we calculate the properties of the highly ionized iron and oxygen
lines (seen in absorption against the central active galactic nucleus; AGN),
predicting line shapes, equivalent widths, column densities and velocity
shifts. The main effect of the jet on the absorption lines is a reduction of
the line strength from that of the quiescent ICM and the introduction of some
velocity structure in the line profile. We investigate whether these features
are detectable with current as well as future high-resolution X-ray
spectrometers. We conclude that the CHANDRA transmission gratings have
insufficient sensitivity to detect these features with high significance, and
certainly would not allow a study of the dynamics of the interaction via
absorption signatures. CONSTELLATION-X, on the other hand, will allow superb
constraints to be derived. We can also use this analysis to assess the idea
that radio-galaxy induced ICM outflows give rise to the resonant oxygen X-ray
absorption lines that have been claimed as evidence for the warm-hot
intergalactic medium (WHIM). We show that these detached, high-velocity oxygen
absorption lines cannot result from a radio-galaxy/ICM interaction, thereby
strengthening the WHIM interpretation.

(log{g}=8.5) to the data indicate that the WD has a temperature T~15,000K,
about ~1500K above its quiescent temperature and it is still showing the effect
of the outburst. Taking into account temperature estimates of the earlier phase
of the cooling, we model the cooling curve of WZ Sge, over a period of 3 years,
using a stellar evolution code including accretion and the effects of
compressional heating. Assuming that compressional heating alone is the source
of the energy released during the cooling phase, we find that (1) the mass of
the white dwarf must be quite large (~1.0 Msun); and (2) the mass accretion
rate must have a time-averaged (over 52 days of outburst) value of the order of
1.E-8 Msun/yr or larger. The outburst mass accretion rate derived from these
compressional heating models is larger than the rates estimated from optical
observations and from a FUV spectral fit by up to one order of magnitude. This
implies that during the cooling phase the energy released by the WD is not due

extinction map shows small scale clumpy structures possibly due to a clumpy
dust distribution. We also identify in this map a shell structure, for which we
establish a causal relation with the expanding gas structure produced by the
stellar winds coming from the Super Star Clusters (SSC) in the center of the
galaxy. The comparison of the spatial profiles of the extinction, dust and
gaseous emissions crossing the border of the shell shows a layered structure;
the peak of this Halpha distribution lying closest to the SSC A, followed
outwards by the peak of the extinction and at a still larger distances by the
bulk of the atomic gas. We suggest that the extinction shell has been produced
by the SSCs and that it can be explained by the accumulation of dust at the

between the predicted shape of the mass function of dark matter halos and the
observed shape of the luminosity function of galaxies. The number of massive
halos is predicted to decrease as a power law (N proportional to M^-2) out to
very large masses, while the galaxy luminosity function cuts off exponentially
at luminosities above L*. This implies that the efficiency with which gas cools
onto massive systems is lower than expected. This letter investigates the role
of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) in continually re-heating the
cooling gas. By combining two observational results, the time-averaged energy
output associated with recurrent radio source activity is determined, as a
function of the black hole mass of the host galaxy: H = 10^21.4 (M_BH /
M_sun)^1.6 W. It is shown that for massive elliptical galaxies this
radio-source heating balances the radiative energy losses from the hot gas
surrounding the galaxy. The recurrent radio-loud AGN activity may therefore
provide a self-regulating feedback mechanism capable of controlling the rate of
growth of galaxies.

techniques, thus quantitative data are manipulated to provide qualitative
images. Introduced in this study is a new normalizing radial graded filter
(NRGF), a simple filter for removing the radial gradient to reveal coronal
structure. Applied to polarized brightness observations of the corona, the NRGF
produces images which are striking in their detail. Total brightness white
light images include contributions from the F corona, stray light and other
instrumental contributions which need to be removed as effectively as possible
to properly reveal the electron corona structure. A new procedure for
subtracting this background from LASCO C2 white light total brightness images
is introduced. The background is created from the unpolarized component of
total brightness images and is found to be remarkably time-invariant, remaining
virtually unchanged over the solar cycle. By direct comparison with polarized

superior in depicting coronal structure accurately, particularly when used in
conjunction with the NRGF. The effectiveness of the procedures is demonstrated

the radiative scattering component of O VI lines in the corona. Observations of
O VI disk spectra show a 1032/1038 line intensity ratio of >2.6 in a sunspot
compared to quiet disk values of 2. The enhancement of the 1032 line in
comparison to the 1038 is likely due to interaction between molecular hydrogen
emission from the sunspot and the chromospheric O5+. Modeling shows that a
contribution from sunspots increases the coronal O VI 1032/1038 intensity ratio
to values considerably higher than those achieved with a quiet disk or coronal
hole spectrum. Therefore a re-examination of flow velocities derived from
UVCS/SOHO streamer observations must be made. This modeling demonstrates that
the inclusion of sunspots, when present, may lead to non-zero outflow
velocities at lower heights in streamer cores in contrast to some existing
model results.

supernova (SN) of type II/Ib with a massive progenitor, has an age of \approx
1600 yr and is at a distance of \approx 1 kpc, the theory gives indeed a
consistent description for all the existing observational data. Specifically it
is shown that an efficient production of nuclear CRs, leading to strong shock
modification, and a large downstream magnetic field strength B_d ~ 100 mkG can
reproduce in detail the observed synchrotron emission from radio to X-ray
frequencies together with the gamma-ray spectral characteristics as observed by
the H.E.S.S. telescopes. Small-scale filamentary structures observed in
nonthermal X-rays provide empirical confirmation for the field amplification
scenario which leads to a strong depression of the inverse Compton and
Bremsstrahlung fluxes. Going beyond that and using a semi-empirical relation
for young SNRs between the resulting CR pressure and the amplified magnetic
field energy upstream of the outer SN shock as well as a moderate upper bound
for the mechanical explosion energy, it is possible to also demonstrate the
actual need for a considerable shock modification in RX J1713.7-3946. It is
consistent with RX J1713.7-3946 being an efficient source of nuclear cosmic

of blazars and their contribution to the extragalactic diffuse gamma-ray
background (EGRB). Radio and gamma-ray luminosity correlation is introduced to
take into account the radio detectability which is important for the blazar
identification. Previous studies considered only pure luminosity evolution
(PLE) or pure density evolution, but we introduce the luminosity dependent
density evolution (LDDE) model, which is favored from the evolution of X-ray
luminosity function (XLF) of AGNs. The model parameters are constrained by
likelihood analyses about the observed redshift and gamma-ray flux
distributions of the EGRET blazars. We find that the LDDE model gives a better
fit to the observed distributions than the PLE model, indicating that the LDDE
model is also appropriate for gamma-ray blazars, and that the jet activity is
universally correlated with the accretion history of AGNs. The normalization
between the GLF and XLF is consistent with the unified picture of AGNs, when
the beaming and a reasonable duty cycle of jet activity are taken into account.
We then find that only 25--50% of the EGRB can be explained by unresolved
blazars with the best-fit LDDE parameters. Unresolved blazars can account for
all the EGRB only with a steeper index of the faint-end slope of the GLF, which
is marginally consistent with the EGRET data but inconsistent with that of the
XLF. Therefore unresolved AGNs cannot be the dominant source of the EGRB,
unless there is a new population of gamma-ray emitting AGNs that evolves
differently from the XLF of AGNs. Predictions for the GLAST mission are made,
and we find that the best-fit LDDE model predicts about 3000 blazars in the
entire sky, which is considerably fewer than a previous estimate.

using the 1.0 m robotic telescope of Mt. Lemmon Optical Astronomy Observatory,
in Arizona, USA, the 0.6 m telescope of Sobaeksan Optical Astronomy Observatory
and the 1.8 m telescope of Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory, in the
Republic of Korea. During the observations, all sources show strong flux
variations with amplitudes of larger than 0.5 mag. Variations with amplitudes
of over 1 mag are found in four sources. Intraday variations with amplitudes
larger than 0.15 mag, and a rapid brightness increase with a rate of ~0.2 mag
per day in four days, are detected in S5 0716+71. We investigate the
relationship between the colour index and source brightness for each source. We
find that two out of three FSRQs tend to be redder when they are brighter, and,
conversely, all BL Lac objects tend to be bluer. In particular, we find a
significant anti-correlation between the V-I colour index and R magnitude for
3C 454.3. This implies that the spectrum became steeper when the source was
brighter, which is opposite to the common trend for blazars. In contrast,
significant positive correlations are found in 3C 66A, S5 0716+71, and BL Lac.
However, there are only very weak correlations for PKS 0735+17 and OJ 287. We
propose that the different relative contributions of the thermal versus
non-thermal radiation to the optical emission may be responsible for the
different trends of the colour index with brightness in FSRQs and BL Lac
objects.

comparison to earlier approximations, our formula provides a few significant
advantages. Integration of the emissivity over the whole frequency range,
starting from the proper minimal emitting frequency, gives the correct cooling
rate for any energy particle. Further, the spectrum of the emission is well
approximated over the whole frequency range, even for relatively low particle
energies (beta << 0.1), where most of the power is emitted in the first
harmonic. In order to test our continuous approximation, we compare it with a
recently derived approximation of the first ten harmonics. Finally, our formula
connects relatively smooth to the synchrotron emission at beta=0.9. We show
that the self-absorption is a very efficient heating mechanism for low energy
particles, independent of the shape of the particle distribution responsible
for the self-absorbed synchrotron emission. We find that the energy gains for
low energy particles are always higher than energy losses by cyclo-synchrotron
emission. We show also that the spectral index of the self-absorbed part of the

cores discussing simulations performed with a modified Newtonian gravitational
potential that mimics general relativistic effects. The approximate TOV
potential used in our simulations catches several features of fully
relativistic simulations quite well. It is able to correctly reproduce the
behavior of models which show a qualitative change both of the dynamics and the
gravitational wave signal when switching from Newtonian to fully relativistic
simulations. If this is not the case, the Newtonian and the approximate TOV
models differ quantitatively. The collapse proceeds to higher densities with
the approximate TOV potential allowing for a more efficient amplification of
the magnetic field by differential rotation. Sufficiently strong magnetic
fields brake down the core's rotation and trigger a contraction phase to higher
densities. Several models exhibit two different kinds of shock generation. Due
to magnetic braking, a first shock wave created during the initial centrifugal
bounce does not suffice to eject any mass, and the core continues to collapse
to supranuclear densities. Another stronger shock wave is generated during the
second bounce as the core exceeds nuclear matter density. The gravitational
wave signal of these models does not fit into the standard classification.
Instead it belongs to the signal type IV introduced by us in the first paper of
this series. This signal type is more frequent for the approximate relativistic
potential than for the Newtonian one. Strongly magnetized models emit a
substantial fraction of their GW power at very low frequencies. A flat spectrum
between 10 Hz and > 100 kHz denotes the generation of a jet-like outflow.

blending with interstellar absorption lines. When applied to the stellar
component only of the complex CIV 1549 features in two high redshift galaxies
with good quality spectra, MS1512-cB58 (z = 2.7268) and Q1307-BM1163 (z =

in good agreement with other metallicity determinations based on nebular
emission and interstellar absorption lines. Our main conclusion is that for
this method to give reliable results at high redshifts, it should only be used
on data of sufficiently high spectral resolution (R > 1000) for stellar and
interstellar CIV components to be clearly separated. Oxygen abundances will be
systematically overestimated if the local calibration is applied to spectra of
high-z galaxies obtained with the low resolving powers (R ~ 200-300) of many
current wide field surveys. It will also be necessary to understand better the
causes of the scatter in the local relation, before we can be confident of

exhibit large star-to-star variations in the abundances of light elements that
are not exhibited by field giants. This fact can be taken as evidence that the
extra mixing mechanism(s) that operate in globular cluster giants may be
consequences of star-star interactions in the dense stellar environment. In
order to constrain the extra mixing mechanism(s), we study the influence of
helium enrichment along the red giant branch (RGB) on the evolution of stars
through the horizontal branch. Three possible modes of helium enrichment are
considered, associated with close encounters of stars in the globular clusters.
We show that as a consequence of the variations in the core mass as well as in
the total mass due to mass loss, the color of horizontal branch models are
distributed over almost all range of horizontal branch. The results are
discussed in relation to the scenario for the origin of the abundance anomalies
and for the effects on the morphology of horizontal branch. We argue that the
star-star interactions can explain not only the source of angular momentum of
rapid rotation but also provide a mechanism for the bimodal distribution of
rotation rates in some globular clusters. We also propose the time elapsed from
the latest core collapse phase during the gravo-thermal oscillations as the
second parameter to explain the variations in HB morphology among the globular

increase quantum fluctuations and can destabilize the magnetically ordered

magnetization can vary drastically among as-grown Ga[1-x]Mn[x]As films despite
being deposited under seemingly similar conditions. These results imply that
the depth profile of interstitial Mn is dependent not only on annealing, but is
also extremely sensitive to initial growth conditions. We observe that
annealing improves the magnetization by producing a surface layer that is rich
in Mn and O, indicating that the interstitial Mn migrates to the surface.
Finally, we expand upon our previous neutron reflectivity study of
Ga[1-x]Mn[x]As, by showing how the depth profile of the chemical composition at
the surface and through the film thickness is directly responsible for the
complex magnetization profiles observed in both as-grown and annealed films.

\chi(q,\omega) in the slave-boson mean-field scheme of the bilayer t-J model.
In the d-wave pairing state, the strongest magnetic spectral weight appears at
q=Q=(pi,pi) and \omega=\omega_{Q}^{res}, and spreads into a diamond-shaped
shell around Q in q space for \omega<\omega_{Q}^{res}. This weight is due to a
collective mode, namely a particle-hole bound state, which has a downward
\omega versus q dispersion around Q. Within the high intensity shell, the
incommensurate (IC) signals at q=(pi,pi\pm 2pi\eta) and (pi\pm 2pi\eta,pi) tend
to be stronger than the diagonal incommensurate (DIC) signals at q=(pi\pm
2pi\eta',pi\pm 2pi\eta'), especially for a large hole density \delta. For
\omega \ll \omega_{Q}^{res} the IC signals completely disappear and the weight
remains only around the DIC positions. For \omega > \omega_{Q}^{res} strong
signals of Im\chi(q,\omega) tracing an upward dispersion are found and
interpreted as an overdamped collective mode near \omega_{Q}^{res}. In the
normal state, Im\chi(q,\omega) has a broad peak at q=Q. That is, the IC and DIC
signals appear only in the d-wave pairing state. We also study effects of a
small orthorhombic anisotropy, which is intrinsic in untwinned YBCO crystals.
Because of electron-electron correlations favoring d-wave shaped Fermi surface
deformations (dFSD), we expect an enhanced anisotropy of magnetic excitation
spectra. This effect is particularly pronounced for low \delta and at
relatively high temperature. The present theory provides a rather detailed
microscopic explanation of the most salient properties of magnetic excitations
observed in YBCO.

$R^{bulk,boundary}(x)$ are very different : whereas $R^{bulk}(x)$ decays

of excitations of length $l=L$ accordingly decays as

$\lambda_d=1+\theta_d-\sigma_d$. We obtain $\lambda_1 \simeq 0.67$, $\lambda_2

that by construction obeys this discontinuity condition. By its variation
one-electron equations are obtained with potential in the form of projection
operator. The operator increases a separation between occupied and empty bands
thus curing LDA deficiency of energy gap value systematic underestimation.
Orbital densities functional minimization gives ground state orbital and total
electron densities. The ODF expression for the energy of orbital densities
fluctuations around the ground state values defines ODF fluctuation Hamiltonian
that allows to treat correlation effects. Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT)
was used to solve this Hamiltonian with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method for
effective impurity problem. We have applied ODF method to the problem of
metal-insulator transition in lanthanum trihydride LaH_{3-x}. In LDA
calculations ground state of this material is metallic for all values of
hydrogen nonstoichiometry x while experimentally the system is insulating for x
< 0.3. ODF method gave paramagnetic insulator solution for LaH_3 and LaH_{2.75}
but metallic state for LaH_{2.5}.

identified as homogeneous disordered structures, namely the very high-density
vHDA and the low-density amorphous LDA ice. Structures showing an intermediate
static structure factor with respect to vHDA and LDA are heterogeneous phases.
This holds independently from their preparation procedure, i.e. either obtained
by pressure amorphisation of ice I_h or by heating of vHDA. The degree of
heterogeneity can be progressively suppressed when higher pressures and
temperatures are applied for the sample preparation. In accordance with the
suppressed heterogeneity the maximum of the static structure factor displays a
pronounced narrowing of the first strong peak, shifting towards higher
Q-numbers. Moreover, the less heterogeneous the obtained structures are the
slower is the transformation kinetics from the high--density modifications into
LDA. The well known high-density amorphous structure HDA does not constitute
any particular state of the amorphous water network. It is formed due to the
preparational procedure working in liquid nitrogen as thermal bath, i.e. at

  Conference. Mumbai, Indai. February 2006",,,,"cs.DC",,"  Results from and progress on the development of a Data Intensive and Network
Aware (DIANA) Scheduling engine, primarily for data intensive sciences such as
physics analysis, are described. Scientific analysis tasks can involve
thousands of computing, data handling, and network resources and the size of
the input and output files and the amount of overall storage space allocated to
a user necessarily can have significant bearing on the scheduling of data
intensive applications. If the input or output files must be retrieved from a
remote location, then the time required transferring the files must also be
taken into consideration when scheduling compute resources for the given
application. The central problem in this study is the coordinated management of
computation and data at multiple locations and not simply data movement.
However, this can be a very costly operation and efficient scheduling can be a
challenge if compute and data resources are mapped without network cost. We
have implemented an adaptive algorithm within the DIANA Scheduler which takes
into account data location and size, network performance and computation
capability to make efficient global scheduling decisions. DIANA is a
performance-aware as well as an economy-guided Meta Scheduler. It iteratively
allocates each job to the site that is likely to produce the best performance
as well as optimizing the global queue for any remaining pending jobs.
Therefore it is equally suitable whether a single job is being submitted or
bulk scheduling is being performed. Results suggest that considerable
performance improvements are to be gained by adopting the DIANA scheduling
approach.

created in heterotic compactifications as bound states of open membranes,
five-branes wrapped on four-cycles and solitonic strings. However, in generic

of Aharanov-Bohm strings. In this case, heterotic cosmic strings will have to
be unstable under breakage on monopoles. We estimate the monopole masses and
find that they are big enough so that the strings can be metastable with a
sufficiently long lifetime. On the other hand, if we allow one or more axions
to remain massless at low energies, stable global strings can be produced.

the static one via Wick rotation, however the additional spatial dependence of
the metric prevents this mapping from being invertible. Instead we find that a

different from the behaviour in Minkowski space. We go on to construct the most

the static equations of motion, or by finding configurations which minimise the

theory in the same generic background and find solutions consistent with energy
minimisation. In the $NS$5-brane background we find time dependent solutions to

theory on a three-sphere with non-zero chemical potentials is examined. In the
zero coupling limit, a transition line in the mu-T plane is found, separating a
""confined"" phase in which the Polyakov loop has vanishing expectation value
from a ""deconfined"" phase in which this order parameter is non-zero. For
non-zero but weak coupling, perturbative methods may be used to construct a
dimensionally reduced effective theory valid for sufficiently high temperature.
If the maximal chemical potential exceeds a critical value, then the free
energy becomes unbounded below and no genuine equilibrium state exists.
However, the deconfined plasma phase remains metastable, with a lifetime which
grows exponentially with Nc (not Nc^2). This metastable phase persists with
increasing chemical potential until a phase boundary, analogous to a spinodal
decomposition line, is reached. Beyond this point, no long-lived locally stable
quasi-equilibrium state exists.
  The resulting picture for the phase diagram of the weakly coupled theory is
compared with results believed to hold in the strongly coupled limit of the
theory, based on the AdS/CFT correspondence and the study of charged black hole
thermodynamics. The confinement/deconfinement phase transition at weak coupling
is in qualitative agreement with the Hawking-Page phase transition in the
gravity dual of the strongly coupled theory. The black hole thermodynamic
instability line may be the counterpart of the spinodal decomposition phase
boundary found at weak coupling, but no black hole tunneling instability,
analogous to the instability of the weakly coupled plasma phase is currently
known.

construct explicit configurations, for which the index is of order 1, but the

  6 figures",,,,"math.CO math-ph math.MP math.PR",,"  The partially asymmetric exclusion process (PASEP) is an important model from
statistical mechanics which describes a system of interacting particles hopping
left and right on a one-dimensional lattice of $n$ sites. It is partially
asymmetric in the sense that the probability of hopping left is $q$ times the
probability of hopping right. Additionally, particles may enter from the left
with probability $\alpha$ and exit from the right with probability $\beta$.
  In this paper we prove a close connection between the PASEP and the
combinatorics of permutation tableaux. (These tableaux come indirectly from the
totally nonnegative part of the Grassmannian, via work of Postnikov, and were
studied in a paper of Steingrimsson and the second author.) Namely, we prove
that in the long time limit, the probability that the PASEP is in a particular
configuration $\tau$ is essentially the generating function for permutation
tableaux of shape $\lambda(\tau)$ enumerated according to three statistics. The
proof of this result uses a result of Derrida, Evans, Hakim, and Pasquier on
the {\it matrix ansatz} for the PASEP model.
  As an application, we prove some monotonicity results for the PASEP. We also
derive some enumerative consequences for permutations enumerated according to
various statistics such as weak excedence set, descent set, crossings, and
occurences of generalized patterns.

  Series B",,,,"math.AP q-bio.CB q-bio.MN q-bio.PE",,"  Bacteria are able to respond to environmental signals by changing their rules
of movement. When we take into account chemical signals in the environment,
this behaviour is often called chemotaxis. At the individual-level, chemotaxis
consists of several steps. First, the cell detects the extracellular signal
using receptors on its membrane. Then, the cell processes the signal
information through the intracellular signal transduction network, and finally
it responds by altering its motile behaviour accordingly. At the population
level, chemotaxis can lead to aggregation of bacteria, travelling waves or
pattern formation, and the important task is to explain the population-level
behaviour in terms of individual-based models. It has been previously shown
that the transport equation framework is suitable for connecting different
levels of modelling of bacterial chemotaxis. In this paper, we couple the
transport equation for bacteria with the (parabolic/elliptic) equation for the
extracellular signals. We prove global existence of solutions for the general
hyperbolic chemotaxis models of cells which process the information about the
extracellular signal through the intracellular biochemical network and interact
by altering the extracellular signal as well. The conditions for global
existence in terms of the properties of the signal transduction model are
given.

methods of computing Groebner Bases. Two of these methods include the Groebner
Walk method and the computation of Involutive Bases. By the mid 1980's,
Buchberger's work had been generalised for noncommutative polynomial rings by
Bergman and Mora. This thesis provides the corresponding generalisation for
Involutive Bases and (to a lesser extent) the Groebner Walk, with the main
results being as follows. (1) Algorithms for several new noncommutative
involutive divisions are given, including strong; weak; global and local
divisions. (2) An algorithm for computing a noncommutative Involutive Basis is
given. When used with one of the aforementioned involutive divisions, it is
shown that this algorithm returns a noncommutative Groebner Basis on
termination. (3) An algorithm for a noncommutative Groebner Walk is given, in
the case of conversion between two harmonious monomial orderings. It is shown
that this algorithm generalises to give an algorithm for performing a
noncommutative Involutive Walk, again in the case of conversion between two
harmonious monomial orderings. (4) Two new properties of commutative involutive
divisions are introduced (stability and extendibility), respectively ensuring
the termination of the Involutive Basis algorithm and the applicability (under
certain conditions) of homogeneous methods of computing Involutive Bases.

  inhomogeneities","Revised version",,,,"math.DS",,"  Spirals have been studied from a dynamical system perspective starting with
Barkley's seminal papers linking a wide class of spiral wave dynamics to the
Euclidean symmetry of the excitable media in which they are observed. However,
in order to explain certain non-Euclidean phenomena, such as anchoring and
epicyclic drifting, LeBlanc and Wulff introduced a single translational
symmetry-breaking perturbation to the center bundle equation and showed that
rotating waves may be attracted to a non-trivial solution manifold and travel
epicyclically around the perturbation center.
  In this paper, we continue the (model-independent) investigation of the
effects of inhomogeneities on spiral wave dynamics by studying epicyclic
drifting in the presence of: a) $n$ simultaneous translational
symmetry-breaking terms, with $n > 1$, and b) a combination of a single
rotational symmetry-breaking term and a single translational symmetry-breaking
term. These types of forced Euclidean symmetry-breaking provide a much more
realistic model of certain excitable media such as cardiac tissue. However, the
main theoretical tool used by LeBlanc and Wulff can only be applied to their
particular perturbation: we show how an averaging theorem of Hale can be
modified to analyze our two more general scenarios and state the conditions
under which epicyclic drifting takes place in the general case. In the process,
we recover LeBlanc and Wulff's specific result. Finally, we illustrate our
results with the help of a simple numerical simulation of a modified bidomain
model.

dynamics of spiral waves in excitable media. In two landmark papers, Barkley
noticed that some of the behaviour could be explained by the inherent Euclidean
symmetry of these models. LeBlanc and Wulff then introduced forced Euclidean
symmetry-breaking (FESB) to the analysis, in the form of individual
translational symmetry-breaking (TSB) perturbations and rotational
symmetry-breaking (RSB) perturbations; in either case, it is shown that spiral
anchoring is a direct consequence of the FESB.
  In this article, we provide a characterization of spiral anchoring when two
perturbations, a TSB term and a RSB term, are combined, where the TSB term is
centered at the origin and the RSB term preserves rotations by multiples of
$\frac{2\pi}{\jmath^*}$, where $\jmath^*\geq 1$ is an integer. When
$\jmath^*>1$ (such as in a modified bidomain model), it is shown that spirals
anchor at the origin, but when $\jmath^* =1$ (such as in a planar
reaction-diffusion-advection system), spirals generically anchor away from the
origin.

stock-price fluctuations. The statistical properties of the data are relatively
homogeneous within the same day but the large jumps between different days
prevent the extension of the analysis to large times. This leads to intrinsic
finite size effects which alter the apparent Hurst (H) exponent. We show, by
analytical methods, that finite size effects always lead to an enhancement of
H. We then consider the effect of fat tails on the analysis of the roughness
and show that the finite size effects are strongly enhanced by the fat tails.
The non stationarity of the stock price dynamics also enhances the finite size
effects which, in principle, can become important even in the asymptotic
regime. We then compute the Hurst exponent for a set of stocks of the NYSE and
argue that the interpretation of the value of H is highly ambiguous in view of
the above results. Finally we propose an alternative determination of the
roughness in terms of the fluctuations from moving averages with variable
characteristic times. This permits to eliminate most of the previous problems
and to characterize the roughness in useful way. In particular this approach
corresponds to the automatic elimination of trends at any scale.

infinite entanglement in the building blocks produces fully symmetric Gaussian

entanglement sharing, a basic difference with spin chains is revealed: Gaussian

  (2005)",,,"quant-ph",,"  In Stephen Adler's book, ""Quantum theory as an emergent phenomenon,"" the
author starts from a classical mechanics structure and ""derives"" the formalism
of quantum theory, together with wave function collapse dynamics, the latter
providing the interpretation of quantum theory. A detailed outline of the
author's argument is presented in this book review.

A73 (2006) 042306","10.1103/PhysRevA.73.042306",,"quant-ph",,"  We consider quantum communication in the case that the communicating parties
not only do not share a reference frame but use imperfect quantum communication
channels, in that each channel applies some fixed but unknown unitary rotation
to each qubit. We discuss similarities and differences between reference frames
within that quantum communication model and gauge fields in gauge theory. We
generalize the concept of refbits and analyze various quantum communication
protocols within the communication model.
