averaging across all environments at z~1, less than 50 percent of the stellar
mass which ends up in early-types today is actually in early-type progenitors
at this redshift. The corresponding value is ~65 percent in clusters due to
faster morphological transformations in the such dense environments. We develop
probabilistic prescriptions which provide a means of including spiral (i.e. non
early-type) progenitors at intermediate and high redshifts, based on their
luminosity and optical (BVK) colours. For example, at intermediate redshifts
(z~0.5), large (M_B<-21.5), red (B-V>0.7) spirals have ~75-95 percent chance of
being a progenitor, while the corresponding probability for large blue spirals
(M_B<-21.5, B-V<0.7) is ~50-75 percent. Finally, we explore the correspondence
between the true progenitor set of present-day early-types and the commonly
used `red-sequence', defined as the set of galaxies within the part of the
colour-magnitude space which is dominated by early-type objects. While large
members (M_V<-22) of the `red sequence' trace the progenitor set accurately in
terms of numbers and mass, the relationship breaks down severely at fainter

that one may not obtain information about the existence of asymptotic freedom
(AF) and chiral symmetry restoration (CSR) for quarks of QCD at high density.
This information may still be obtained from compact stars - if they are made up
of strange quark matter. Very high gravitational redshift lines (GRL), seen
from some compact stars, seem to suggest high ratios of mass and radius (M/R)
for them. This is suggestive of strange stars (SS) and can in fact be fitted
very well with SQM equation of state deduced with built in AF and CSR. In some
other stars broad absorption bands appear at about ~ 0.3 keV and multiples
thereof, that may fit in very well with resonance with harmonic compressional
breathing mode frequencies of these SS. Emission at these frequencies are also
observed in six stars. If these two features of large GRL and BAB were observed
together in a single star, it would strengthen the possibility for the
existence of SS in nature and would vindicate the current dogma of AF and CSR
that we believe in QCD. Recently, in 4U 1700-24, both features appear to be
detected, which may well be interpreted as observation of SS - although the
group that analyzed the data did not observe this possibility. We predict that
if the shifted lines, that has been observed, are from neon with GRL shift z =
0.4 - then the compact object emitting it is a SS of mass 1.2 M_sun and radius
7 km. In addition the fit to the spectrum leaves a residual with broad dips at
0.35 keV and multiples thereof, as in 1E1207-5209 which is again suggestive of

with emission from an X-ray heated accretion disc. During the first 16 days

suggest that a major part of the I band excess was due to synchrotron emission
triggered by the X-ray burst. Several other significant short duration changes

new measurements of the 1.4-43 GHz radio spectrum we also present the analysis
and results of a target-of-opportunity X-ray observation using XMM-Newton, made

variability hinted at in previous observations. GB B1428+4217 is one of several
high-redshift radio-loud quasars that display a low energy break in the X-ray

X-ray spectral analysis of the latest XMM-Newton data is shown to be consistent
with the warm absorption scenario which we have hypothesized previously. Warm
absorption is also consistent with the observed X-ray spectral variability of
the source, in which the spectral changes can be successfully accounted-for
with a fixed column density of material in which the ionization state is
correlated with hardness of the underlying power-law emission.

strength at the BH horizon, while it is almost unaffected by the radial profile

sensitive function of the effective neutrino temperature at the flow injection

luminosity except, perhaps, during the very early stages of evolution. We find
that models based on simple analytic approximations successfully reproduce the

mechanisms is advocated to quench mass accretion within haloes larger than
about 1e13 Msun that host bright quasars. These models also match the observed

underpredict the QSO biasing which, instead, is correctly reproduced by

in the nuclei of protogalaxies, without the need for seed black holes left over
from early star formation. Self-gravitating gas in dark matter halos can lose
angular momentum rapidly via runaway, global dynamical instabilities, the
so-called ""bars within bars"" mechanism. This leads to the rapid buildup of a
dense, self-gravitating core supported by gas pressure - surrounded by a
radiation pressure-dominated envelope - which gradually contracts and is
compressed further by subsequent infall. These conditions lead to such high
temperatures in the central region that the gas cools catastrophically by
thermal neutrino emission, leading to the formation and rapid growth of a
central black hole.
  We estimate the initial mass and growth rate of the black hole for typical
conditions in metal-free halos with T_vir ~ 10^4 K, which are the most likely
to be susceptible to runaway infall. The initial black hole should have a mass
of <~20 solar masses, but in principle could grow at a super-Eddington rate
until it reaches ~ 10^4-10^6 solar masses. Rapid growth may be limited by
feedback from the accretion process and/or disruption of the mass supply by
star formation or halo mergers. Even if super-Eddington growth stops at
\~10^3-10^4 solar masses, this process would give black holes ample time to
attain quasar-size masses by a redshift of 6, and could also provide the seeds
for all supermassive black holes seen in the present universe.

source in the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is discussed. The outflow from a
sub-parsec scale accretion disc is numerically modelled for parameters
appropriate to the Galactic Centre. The resulting obscuration pattern is very
patchy, with some lines of sight becoming optically thick to Thomson
scattering. A fixed observer would see column depth changing by factors of many
over time scales of order months to hundreds of years, depending on the
physical size of the outflow region. Such winds may be relevant for obscuration
of some AGN and especially ""changing look AGN"". However, averaged over the sky
as seen from the central source, these winds are always optically thin unless
wind outflow rates are super-Eddington. A simple scaling argument shows that
this is true not only for stellar-driven winds but for any AGN winds. We
therefore conclude that AGN winds are unable to account for the vast majority
of optically thick obscured AGN (a significant fraction of all AGN). We suggest
that the most likely source of optically thick obscuration in AGN is a warped
parsec scale accretion disc.

chemistry and time-dependent dust formation with coupled grey Monte Carlo

picture of the dust formation and wind acceleration as compared to earlier
published spherically symmetric (1D) models. The so-called exterior
$\kappa$-mechanism causes radial oscillations with short phases of active dust
formation between longer phases without appreciable dust formation, just like
in the 1D models. However, in 2D geometry, the oscillations can be out-of-phase
at different places above the stellar atmosphere which result in the formation
of dust arcs or smaller caps that only occupy a certain fraction of the total
solid angle. These dust structures are accelerated outward by radiation
pressure, expanding radially and tangentially like mushroom clouds, while
dust-poor matter is falling back towards the star at other places. A highly
dynamical and turbulent dust formation zone is created in this way, which again
leads to inhomogeneous dust production. Further away from the star, flow
instabilities (e.g. Rayleigh-Taylor) have time to fragment the outward moving
arcs and shells to produce numerous small-scale cloud-like sub-structures.

characteristics of a flow event (a jump between two energy minima in

described by a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation with rates in k-space of
the form $\Gamma_0+Dk^2$ with $D\gg\Gamma_0a^2$ where $a$ is the average
intermolecular distance. The inequality expresses a long-wavelength dominance
of the dynamics which implies that the Hamiltonian (free energy) may be taken
to be ultra local. As an illustration of the theory the case with the simplest
non-trivial Hamiltonian is solved to second order in the Gaussian
approximation, where it predicts an asymmetric frequency dependence of the
isothermal bulk modulus with Debye behavior at low frequencies and an
$\omega^{-1/2}$ decay of the loss at high frequencies. Finally, a general
formalism for the description of viscous liquid dynamics, which supplements the
density dynamics by including stress fields, a potential energy field, and

recalled and the density-density correlation function $H(z_1,z_2;\Delta x)$

fluctuations follow the (extended) capillary-wave theory expression
$S(q)=kT/(D+\gamma q^2 +\kappa q^4) $ for sufficiently small wave vectors $q$.
We find $\kappa$ {\it negative}, $\kappa <0$ . At $q=2\pi$ there is a strong
nearest-neighbor peak. Both these results confirm the earlier findings as
established in simulations in d=3 and in continuous space, but now in an

which should show a closer agreement with experimental data and with
calculations along atomistic models. The presented theory is applied to the
calculation of optical phonons in a Ge nanowire. We have found the dispersion
curves for various optical phonon modes. We also normalize the modes and
discuss the electron-phonon interaction within the deformation potential

  Cooperative Diversity, Coding, and Transmission Energy Gain","revised version",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  We study an incremental redundancy (IR) cooperative coding scheme for
wireless networks. To exploit the spatial diversity benefit we propose a
cluster-based collaborating strategy for a quasi-static Rayleigh fading channel
model and based on a network geometric distance profile. Our scheme enhances
the network performance by embedding an IR cooperative coding scheme into an
existing noncooperative route. More precisely, for each hop, we form a
collaborating cluster of M-1 nodes between the (hop) sender and the (hop)
destination. The transmitted message is encoded using a mother code and
partitioned into M blocks corresponding to the each of M slots. In the first
slot, the (hop) sender broadcasts its information by transmitting the first
block, and its helpers attempt to relay this message. In the remaining slots,
the each of left-over M-1 blocks is sent either through a helper which has
successfully decoded the message or directly by the (hop) sender where a
dynamic schedule is based on the ACK-based feedback from the cluster. By
employing powerful good codes (e.g., turbo codes, LDPC codes, and raptor codes)
whose performance is characterized by a threshold behavior, our approach
improves the reliability of a multi-hop routing through not only cooperation
diversity benefit but also a coding advantage. The study of the diversity and
the coding gain of the proposed scheme is based on a new simple threshold bound
on the frame-error rate (FER) of maximum likelihood decoding. A average FER
upper bound and its asymptotic (in large SNR) version are derived as a function
of the average fading channel SNRs and the code threshold.

generalization of the CR complex analiticity conditions to the noncommutative
algebra of biquaternions. Any biquaternionic field possesses natural twistor
structure and, in the Minkowski space, gives rise to a shear-free null
congruence of rays and to a set of gauge fields associated with it. In the
paper we develop the algebrodynamical scheme in the complex extension of
Minkowski space-time -- in the full vector space of biquaternion algebra. This
primodial space dynamically reduces to the 6D ``observable'' space-time of the
complex null cone which in turn decomposes into the 4D physical space-time and
the 2D internal ``spin space''. A set of identical point charges
(``duplicons'') -- focal points of the congruence -- arises in the procedure.
Temporal dynamics of individual duplicons is strongly correlated via
fundamental twistor field of the congruence. We briefly discuss some new
notions inevitably arising in the considered algebrodynamical scheme, namely
those of ``complex time'' and of ``evolutionary curve'', as well as their
hypothetical links to the quantum uncertainty phenomenon.

the role of this scale in the matrix elements of the twist-4 and 3 quark-gluon
operators determining the leading power (1/Q^2-) corrections to the moments of
the nucleon spin structure functions. We argue that the flavor-nonsinglet
twist-4 matrix element, f_2^{u - d}, has a sizable negative value of the order
rho^{-2}, due to the presence of sea quarks with virtualities ~ rho^{-2} in the
proton wave function. The twist-3 matrix element, d_2, is not related to the
scale rho^{-2}. Our arguments support the results of previous calculations of
the matrix elements in the instanton vacuum model. We show that this

weighted integrals of the squared distance between the empirical characteristic
function of the standardized data and the characteristic function of the
standard symmetric stable distribution with the characteristic exponent
$\alpha$ estimated from the data. We treat $\alpha$ as an unknown parameter,
but for theoretical simplicity we also consider the case that $\alpha$ is
fixed. For estimation of parameters and the standardization of data we use
maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and an equivariant integrated squared error
estimator (EISE) which minimizes the weighted integral. We derive the
asymptotic covariance function of the characteristic function process with
parameters estimated by MLE and EISE. For the case of MLE, the eigenvalues of
the covariance function are numerically evaluated and asymptotic distribution
of the test statistic is obtained using complex integration. Simulation studies
show that the asymptotic distribution of the test statistics is very accurate.
We also present a formula of the asymptotic covariance function of the
characteristic function process with parameters estimated by an efficient
estimator for general distributions.

Evidence for a similar relationship between phage promoters and downstream

soliton energy of translocation provides a novel dynamical picture of sliding:
steep potential gradients correspond to deterministic motion, while ``flat''

side-effect of strong selection for fertility. These theories are
well-developed mathematically, but fit poorly with emerging experimental data.
The data suggest that aging is an adaptation, selected for its own sake. But
aging contributes only negatively to fitness of the individual. What kind of
selection model would permit aging to emerge as a population-level adaptation?
I explore the thesis that population dynamics is inherently chaotic, and that
aging is selected for its role in smoothing demographic fluctuations. The
logistic equation provides a natural vehicle for this model because it has
played a central role in two sciences: Population growth in a resource-limited
niche has long been modeled by the differential LE; and, as a difference
equation, the LE is a canonical example of the emergence of chaos. Suppose that
feedback about depleted resources generally arrives too late to avoid a wave of
unsupportable population growth; then logistic population dynamics is subject

unitary group U(d). Consider a pure state that lies in the irreducible
representation U_{mu+nu} for Young diagrams mu and nu. U_{mu+nu} is contained
in the tensor product of U_mu and U_nu; let xi be the state obtained by tracing
out U_nu. We show that xi is close to a convex combination of states Uv, where
U is in U(d) and v is the highest weight vector in U_mu. When U_{mu+nu} is the
symmetric representation, this yields the conventional quantum de Finetti
theorem for symmetric states, and our method of proof gives near-optimal bounds
for the approximation of xi by a convex combination of product states. For the
class of symmetric Werner states, we give a second de Finetti-style theorem
(our 'half' theorem); the de Finetti-approximation in this case takes a
particularly simple form, involving only product states with a fixed spectrum.
Our proof uses purely group theoretic methods, and makes a link with the
shifted Schur functions. It also provides some useful examples, and gives some
insight into the structure of the set of convex combinations of product states.

with greatly reduced group velocity on two time scales. We discuss ongoing

the power of the read-out optical beam. We analyse the maximum number of
encoding possibilities at the shot noise limit. In addition, we show that using
squeezed light, the shot noise limit can be overcome and the number of encoding
possibilities increased. We discuss a possible application of our phase coding
scheme for increasing the capacities of optical storage devices.

We demonstrate that, for high reservoir temperatures, the short time behaviour

to manipulate the decay rate of the system and to observe a controlled
continuous passage from decay suppression to decay acceleration using
engineered reservoirs in the trapped ion context .

entanglement is highly persistent, and that through local measurements, a large
amount of entanglement may be established between spatially-separated parties
for subsequent use in distributed quantum computation.
