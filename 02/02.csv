  Journal","Astrophys.J. 643 (2006) 1065-1080","10.1086/503093",,"astro-ph",,"  We consider the effects of ""photon bubble"" shock trains on the vertical
structure of radiation pressure-dominated accretion disks. These density
inhomogeneities are expected to develop spontaneously in radiation-dominated
accretion disks where magnetic pressure exceeds gas pressure, even in the
presence of magnetorotational instability. They increase the rate at which
radiation escapes from the disk, and may allow disks to exceed the Eddington
limit by a substantial factor. We first generalize the theory of photon bubbles
to include the effects of finite optical depths and radiation damping.
Modifications to the diffusion law at low optical depth tend to fill in the
low-density regions of photon bubbles, while radiation damping inhibits the
formation of photon bubbles at large radii, small accretion rates, and small
heights above the equatorial plane. Accretion disks dominated by photon bubble
transport may reach luminosities of 10 to >100 times the Eddington limit (L_E),
depending on the mass of the central object, while remaining geometrically
thin. However, photon bubble-dominated disks with alpha-viscosity are subject
to the same thermal and viscous instabilities that plague standard radiation
pressure-dominated disks, suggesting that they may be intrinsically unsteady.
Photon bubbles can lead to a ""core-halo"" vertical disk structure. In
super-Eddington disks the halo forms the base of a wind, which carries away
substantial energy and mass, but not enough to prevent the luminosity from
exceeding L_E. Photon bubble-dominated disks may have smaller color corrections
than standard accretion disks of the same luminosity. They remain viable
contenders for some ultraluminous X-ray sources and may play a role in the
rapid growth of supermassive black holes at high redshift.

wavelet scale of 5 degrees the Higher Criticism of the WMAP map drops from a
value above the 99% c.l. to a value below the 68% c.l. when corrected by the

its ability to locate the pixels that account for the deviation from
Gaussianity. The analysis of the uncorrected WMAP data pointed to a cold spot
in the southern hemisphere centered at (l,b)~ (209, -57). The Higher Criticism
of the Bianchi corrected map indicates that this spot remains prominent, albeit
at a level completely consistent with Gaussian statistics. Consequently, it is
debatable how much emphasis should be placed on this residual feature, but we
consider the effect of modestly increasing the scaling of the template. A
factor of only 1.2 renders the spot indistinguishable from the background

the low-l anomalies, large-scale power asymmetry or wavelet kurtosis. A trivial

five-dimensional PDF for the magnitude and direction of the kick velocity
imparted to pulsar B at birth, the mass of pulsar B's pre-supernova helium star
progenitor, and the pre-supernova orbital separation, and on the adopted prior
assumptions. The priors consist of the transverse systemic velocity, the age of
the system, and the treatment of the unknown radial velocity. Since the latter
cannot be determined from observation, we adopt a statistical approach and use
theoretical radial-velocity distributions obtained from population synthesis
calculations for coalescing double neutron stars. We find that the prior
assumptions about the pre-supernova helium star mass affect the derived most
likely parameters significantly: when the minimum helium star mass required for
neutron star formation is assumed to be 2.1Msun, the most likely kick velocity
ranges from 70-180km/s; when masses lower than 2.1Msun are assumed to allow
neutron star formation, the most likely kick velocity can be as low as a few
km/s, although the majority of the considered models still yield most likely
kick velocities of 50-170km/s. We also show that the proximity of the double
pulsar to the Galactic plane and the small proper motion do not pose stringent
constraints on the kick velocity and progenitor mass of pulsar B. Instead, the
constraints imposed by the orbital dynamics of asymmetric supernova explosions
turn out to be much more restrictive. We conclude that the currently available
observational constraints cannot be used to favor a specific core-collapse and
neutron star formation mechanism. (abridged)

color-M/L relations to near-infrared and optical photometry. We find that the
radial profile of the baryonic-to-dark-matter ratio is self-similar for all
galaxies, when scaled to the radius where the contribution of the baryonic mass
to the rotation curve equals that of the dark matter (R_X). We argue that this
is due to the quasi-exponential nature of disks and rotation curves that are
nearly flat after an initial rise. The radius R_X is found to correlate most
strongly with baryonic rotation speed, such that galaxies with R_X measurements
that lie further out in their disks rotate faster. This quantity also
correlates very strongly with stellar mass, Hubble type, and observed rotation
speed; B-band central surface brightness is less related to R_X than these
other galaxy properties. Most of the galaxies in our sample appear to be close
to maximal disk. For these galaxies, we find that maximum observed rotation
speeds are tightly correlated with maximum rotation speeds predicted from the
baryon distributions, such that one can create a Tully-Fisher relation based on
surface photometry and redshifts alone. Finally, we compare our data to the NFW
parameterization for dark matter profiles with and without including adiabatic
contraction as it is most commonly implemented. Fits are generally poor, and
all but 2 galaxies are better fit if adiabatic contraction is not performed. In
order to have better fits, and especially to accommodate adiabatic contraction,
baryons would need to contribute very little to the total mass in the inner
parts of galaxies, seemingly in contrast with other observational constraints.

with sizes ranging from several to tens of nanometers. We investigate the
possibility of detecting the electric dipole emission produced by these
nanoparticles as they spin at thermal rates (tens of GHz) in cold gas. We show
that such emission peaks in the microwave range and dominates over the thermal
disk emission at \nu < 50 GHz typically by a factor of several if > 5 % of the

change their directions. When the rotation is slow and the magnetic field is
relatively strong, the direction of the rotation axis changes to align with the
magnetic field, as shown earlier by Matsumoto & Tomisaka. When the magnetic
field is weak and the rotation is relatively fast, the magnetic field inclines
to become perpendicular to the rotation axis. In other words, the evolution of
the magnetic field and rotation axis depends on the relative strength of the
rotation and magnetic field. Magnetic braking acts to align the rotation axis
and magnetic field, while the rotation causes the magnetic field to incline
through dynamo action. The latter effect dominates the former when the ratio of
the angular velocity to the magnetic field is larger than a critical value

variables in the class. Despite (or perhaps because of) its apparently simple
oscillation spectrum, it has been challenging and controversial to identify
this star's pulsation mode and constrain its physical parameters seismically.
Broadband time-resolved photometry of delta Ceti spanning 18.7 days with a duty
cycle of about 65% obtained by the MOST (Microvariability & Oscillations of
STars) satellite -- the first scientific observations ever obtained by MOST --
reveals that the star is actually multiperiodic. Besides the well-known
dominant frequency of f1 = 6.205886/d, we have discovered in the MOST data its
first harmonic 2f1 and three other frequencies (f2 = 3.737/d, f3 = 3.673/d and
f4 = 0.318/d), all detected with S/N > 4. In retrospect, f2 was also present in
archival spectral line profile data but at lower S/N. We present seismic models
whose modes match exactly the frequencies f1 and f2. Only one model falls
within the common part of the error boxes of the star's observed surface
gravity and effective temperature from photometry and spectroscopy. In this

Delta Scuti star FG Vir is examined. In this star, three frequencies show
strong amplitude and phase variations. In the power spectrum, these frequencies
also show up as frequency doublets. However, since true amplitude variability
of a single frequency can also lead to (false) frequency doublets in the power
spectrum, a specific test examining in detail the observed amplitude and phase
variations of an assumed single frequency is applied. For the frequencies at
12.15 and 23.40 cycle/day it is shown that amplitude variability of a single
mode can be ruled out. In particular, an important property of beating between
two modes is fulfilled: the amplitude and phase vary synchronously with a phase
shift close to 90 degrees. The origin of the amplitude variability of a third
mode, viz. near 19.86 c/d, is not clear due to the long beat period of 20+
years, for which the amplitude/phase test suffers from gaps in the coverage.
However, even for this frequency the amplitude variations can be expressed well
by a mathematical two-mode model.
  If we examine these three close frequency pairs together with other (usually
more widely separated) close frequencies in FG Vir, 18 pairs of frequencies
with separations closer than 0.10 c/d have been detected. It is shown that the
majority of the pairs occur near the theoretically expected frequencies of
radial modes. Mode identifications are available for only a few modes: the only
detected radial mode at 12.15 c/d is part of a close pair.
  It is shown that accidental agreements between the frequencies of excited
modes can be ruled out because of the large number of detected close frequency
doublets.

and assumes that it is contained in a rigid spherical domain. The temperature
field along with the rotation of the system generate the baroclinic flow.
  Results: We manage to give an analytical solution to the asymptotic problem
at small Ekman and Prandtl numbers. We show that, provided the Brunt-Vaisala
frequency profile is smooth enough, differential rotation of a stably
stratified envelope takes the form a fast rotating pole and a slow equator
while it is the opposite in a convective envelope. We also show that at low
Prandtl numbers and without $\mu$-barriers, the jump in viscosity at the
core-envelope boundary generates a shear layer staying along the tangential
cylinder of the core. Its role in mixing processes is discussed.
  Conclusions: Such a model provides an interesting tool for investigating the
fluid dynamics of rotating stars in particular for the study of the various
instabilities affecting baroclinic flows or, even more, of a dynamo effect.

visible pre-main sequence stars obtained with a variety of observational
techniques, from measurements of scattered light at visual and infrared
wavelengths to mid-infrared spectroscopy and millimeter interferometry. A
general result is that grains in disks are on average much larger than in the
diffuse interstellar medium (ISM). In many disks, there is evidence that a
large mass of dust is in grains with millimeter and centimeter sizes, more
similar to ""sand and pebbles"" than to grains. Smaller grains (with
micron-sizes) exist closer to the disk surface, which also contains much
smaller particles, e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. There is some
evidence of a vertical stratification, with smaller grains closer to the
surface. Another difference with ISM is the higher fraction of crystalline
relative to amorphous silicates found in disk surfaces. There is a large
scatter in dust properties among different sources, but no evidence of
correlation with the stellar properties, for samples that include objects from
intermediate to solar mass stars and brown dwarfs. There is also no apparent
correlation with the age of the central object, over a range roughly between 1
and 10 Myr. This suggests a scenario where significant grain processing may
occur very early in the disk evolution, possibly when it is accreting matter
from the parental molecular core. Further evolution may occur, but not
necessarily rapidly, since we have evidence that large amounts of grains, from
micron to centimeter size, can survive for periods as long as 10 Myr.

times (a few tens of hours). We show that such mergers of unevolved low--mass
stars with evolved high--mass stars result in little mass loss ($\sim0.01$
M$_{\odot}$) and can deliver sufficient fresh hydrogen to the core of the
collision product to allow the collision product to burn for several million
years. We find that grazing encounters enter a common--envelope phase which may
expel the envelope of the merger product. The deposition of energy in the
envelopes of our merger products causes them to swell by factors of $\sim100$.
If these remnants exist in very densely-populated environments
($n\gtrsim10^{7}$ pc$^{-3}$), they will suffer further collisions which may
drive off their envelopes, leaving behind hard binaries. We show that the
products of collisions have cores rotating sufficiently rapidly to make them
candidate hypernova/gamma--ray burst progenitors and that $\sim0.1%$ of massive

the entropy profile, and the presence of inhomogeneities. The mass accretion
rate determines the energy injected by the black hole back to the ICM. These
active galactic nucleus (AGN) outbursts not only heat the ICM, but also change
the entropy profile in the cluster and cause inhomogeneities that are the seeds

general decline in brightness of the exciting source of McNeil's nebula (V1647

mags since Feb 2004. The optical/NIR photometric data also show a significant
variation in the mags (Delta V = 0.78 mag, Delta R = 0.44 mag, Delta I = 0.21
mag, Delta J = 0.24 mag and Delta H = 0.20 mag) of V1647 Ori within a period of
one month, which is possibly undergoing a phase similar to eruptive variables,
like EXors or FUors. The optical spectra show a few features such as strong
Halpha emission with blue-shifted absorption and the CaII IR triplet (8498A,
8542A and 8662A) in emission. As compared to the period just after outburst,
there is a decrease in the depth and extent of the blue-shifted absorption
component, indicating a weakening in the powerful stellar wind. The presence of
the CaII IR triplet in emission confirms that V1647 Ori is a PMS star. The
long-term, post-outburst photometric observations of V1647 Ori suggest an EXor,
rather than an FUor event. An optical/IR comparison of the region surrounding
McNeil's nebula shows that the optical nebula is more widely and predominantly
extended to the north, whereas the IR nebula is relatively confined (dia ~ 60
arcsec), but definitely extended, to the south, too.

planetesimals of different sizes. For various stellar mass ratios and binary
orbital parameters we determine regions where dv exceed planetesimal escape
velocities v_esc (thus preventing runaway accretion) or even the threshold
velocity v_ero for which erosion dominates accretion. Gaseous friction has two
crucial effects on the velocity distribution: it damps secular perturbations by
forcing periastron alignment of orbits, but at the same time the
size--dependence of this orbital alignment induces a significant dv increase
between bodies of different sizes. This differential phasing effect proves very
efficient and almost always increases dv to values preventing runaway
accretion, except in a narrow domain of almost circular companion orbits. The
erosion threshold dv>v_ero is reached in a wide (ab,eb) space for small (<10km)
planetesimals, but in a much more limited region for bigger ~50km objects. In

fact which resembles results for discrete quantum carpets. Moreover, depending
on the initial excitation site we find that the coherent transport to certain
nodes of the dendrimer has a very low probability. When the initial excitation
starts from the central node, the problem can be mapped onto a line which
simplifies the computational effort. Furthermore, the long time average of the
quantum mechanical transition probabilities between pairs of nodes show
characteristic patterns and allow to classify the nodes into clusters with
identical limiting probabilities. For the (space) average of the quantum
mechanical probability to be still or again at the initial site, we obtain,
based on the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, a simple lower bound which depends only
on the eigenvalue spectrum of the Hamiltonian.

coexistence properties of polydisperse fluid mixtures by Monte Carlo simulation
within the grand canonical ensemble. The first method determines the chemical
potential distribution $\mu(\sigma)$ (with $\sigma$ the polydisperse attribute)
under the constraint that the ensemble average of the particle density
distribution $\rho(\sigma)$ matches a prescribed parent form. Within the region
of phase coexistence (delineated by the cloud curve) this leads to a
distribution of the fluctuating overall particle density n, p(n), that
necessarily has unequal peak weights in order to satisfy a generalized lever
rule. A theoretical analysis shows that as a consequence, finite-size
corrections to estimates of coexistence properties are power laws in the system
size. The second method assigns $\mu(\sigma)$ such that an equal peak weight
criterion is satisfied for p(n)$ for all points within the coexistence region.
However, since equal volumes of the coexisting phases cannot satisfy the lever
rule for the prescribed parent, their relative contributions must be weighted
appropriately when determining $\mu(\sigma)$. We show how to ascertain the
requisite weight factor operationally. A theoretical analysis of the second
method suggests that it leads to finite-size corrections to estimates of
coexistence properties which are {\em exponentially small} in the system size.
The scaling predictions for both methods are tested via Monte Carlo simulations
of a novel polydisperse lattice gas model near its cloud curve, the results
showing excellent quantitative agreement with the theory.

uniformly accelerated particles in de Sitter universe are defined and described
in a number of coordinate frames, some of them being of cosmological
significance, the other are tied naturally to the particles. The scalar and
electromagnetic fields due to the accelerated charges are constructed by using
conformal relations between Minkowski and de Sitter space. The properties of
the generalized `cosmological' Born solutions are analyzed and elucidated in
various coordinate systems. In particular, a limiting procedure is demonstrated
which brings the cosmological Born fields in de Sitter space back to the
classical Born solutions in Minkowski space. In an extensive Appendix, which
can be used independently of the main text, nine families of coordinate systems
in de Sitter spacetime are described analytically and illustrated graphically
in a number of conformal diagrams.

parity doubled states should decouple from pions. We discuss other explanations
including connections to chiral invariant short distance physics motivated by
large $N_{c}$ arguments as suggested by Shifman and others, and intrinsic
deformation of relatively rigid highly excited hadrons, leading to parity
doubling on the leading Regge trajectory. Finally we review the spectroscopic
consequences of chiral symmetry using a formalism introduced by Weinberg, and
use it to describe two baryons of opposite parity.

is stable only if its angular momentum was less than a critical value of $P_c$.
In this paper we investigate the properties of the giant graviton in the
electric/magnetic Melvin geometries of deformed $AdS_5 \times S^5$ spacetime
which was obtained in our previous paper (hep-th/0512117, Phys. Rev. D73 (2006)

lower energy than the point-like graviton. Also, the critical value of the
angular momentum is an increasing function of the magnetic field flux $B$. In
particular, it is seen that while increasing the angular momentum the radius of
giant graviton is initially an increasing function, then, after it reach its
maximum value it becomes a decreasing function of the angular momentum. During
these regions the giant graviton is still a stable configuration, contrast to
that in the undeformed theory. Finally, beyond the critical value of angular
momentum the giant graviton has higher energy than the point-like graviton and
it eventually becomes unstable. Our analyses show that the electric Melvin
field will always render the giant graviton unstable.

acoustic waves of the well AIG10 between 689 and 1004 meters in depth (Corinth
Golf). This borehole crosses competent sedimentary formations (mainly
limestone), and the active Aigion fault between 769 and 780 meters in depth.
This study is the application of two methods previously described by the author
who shows the relationships between in situ horizontal stresses, and (i) the
presence or absence of double body waves, (ii) the amplitude ratios between S
and P waves (Rousseau, 2005a,b). The full waveforms of this well exhibit two
distinct domains separated by the Aigion fault. Within the upper area the three
typical waves (P, S and Stoneley) may appear, but the S waves are not numerous,
and there is no double body wave, whereas within the lower area there are
sometimes double P waves, but no S waves. From those observations, we conclude
that the stress domain is isotropic above the Aigion fault, and anisotropic
below, which is consistent with conclusions drawn by authors from other kinds
of data. The calculation applied to the characteristics of the double P waves
suggests that this horizontal stress anisotropy is very high, up to 190 % with
the maximum horizontal stress superior to 100 MPa and the minimum horizontal
stress close to zero at 939 meters in depth. The amplitude ratios between the S
and P wave indicate a very strong compression - which is isotropic - above the
Aigion fault.

  impact variable and permanent or fixed and temporary?","10 pages, 4 figures",,,,"physics.soc-ph q-fin.TR",,"  In this comment we discuss the problem of reconciling the linear efficiency
of price returns with the long-memory of supply and demand. We present new
evidence that shows that efficiency is maintained by a liquidity imbalance that
co-moves with the imbalance of buyer vs. seller initiated transactions. For
example, during a period where there is an excess of buyer initiated
transactions, there is also more liquidity for buy orders than sell orders, so
that buy orders generate smaller and less frequent price responses than sell
orders. At the moment a buy order is placed the transaction sign imbalance
tends to dominate, generating a price impact. However, the liquidity imbalance
rapidly increases with time, so that after a small number of time steps it
cancels all the inefficiency caused by the transaction sign imbalance, bounding
the price impact. While the view presented by Bouchaud et al. of a fixed and
temporary bare price impact is self-consistent and formally correct, we argue
that viewing this in terms of a variable but permanent price impact provides a
simpler and more natural view. This is in the spirit of the original conjecture
of Lillo and Farmer, but generalized to allow for finite time lags in the build
up of the liquidity imbalance after a transaction. We discuss the possible
strategic motivations that give rise to the liquidity imbalance and offer an
alternative hypothesis. We also present some results that call into question
the statistical significance of large swings in expected price impact at long
times.

variations in the results of measurements of the processes of different nature
(in other words, the fine structure of the dispersion of results or the pattern
of the corresponding histograms) is subject to macroscopic fluctuations,
changing regularly with time. These changes indicate that the dispersion of
results that remains after all artifacts are excluded inevitably accompanies
any measurements and reflects very basic features of our world. In our
research, we have come to the conclusion that this dispersion of results is the
effect of space-time fluctuations, which, in their turn, are caused by the
movement of the measured object in an anisotropic gravitational field. Among
other things, this conclusion means that the examination of the detailed
pattern of distributions obtained from the results of measurement of the
dynamics of processes of different nature discovers laws, which cannot be
revealed with traditional methods for the analysis of time series. These
assertions are based on the results of long-term experimental investigations
conducted for many decades. The major part of these results, starting with
1958, is published in Russian. The goal of this paper is to give a brief review
of those results and provide corresponding references. The most general
conclusion of our research is the evidence that the fine structure of
stochastic distributions is not accidental. In other words, noncasual is the
pattern of histograms plotted from a rather small number of the results of
measurement of the dynamics of processes of different nature, from the
biochemical reactions and noise in the gravitational antenna to the

established that for continuous variable systems, the Wigner function of a pure

mixed states, it might be surmised that only convex combinations of stabilizer
states give rise to non-negative Wigner distributions. We refute this

rates. Here, by calculating explicitly the computational complexity with the
channel transmission, we show that under high loss rate it is hard to distill
the secret key in present continuous variable scheme and one of its advantages,
the potential of providing high secret key rate, may therefore be limited.

calculations of eigenvalues of the spherically confined isotropic harmonic
oscillator with impenetrable boundaries. The energy of the confined state is
found to be equal to that of the unconfined state when the radius of
confinement is suitably chosen as the location of the radial nodes in the
unconfined state. This incidental degeneracy condition is numerically shown to
be valid in general. Further, the full set of pairs of confined states defined
by the quantum numbers [(n+1, \ell) ; (n, \ell+2)], n = 1,2,.., and with the
radius of confinement {(2 \ell +3)/2}^{1/2} a.u., which represents the single
node in the unconfined (1, \ell) state, is found to display a constant energy
level separation exactly given by twice the oscillator frequency. The results
of similar numerical studies on the confined Davidson oscillator with
impenetrable boundary as well as the confined isotropic harmonic oscillator
with finite potential barrier are also reported .The significance of the
numerical results are discussed.

mechanics and electromagnetism, such as Schroedinger's equation, Dirac's
equation and the Maxwell equations. It is shown that they can be derived in a
striking simple way from a common root. This root is the relativistic
fourvector formulation of the momentum conservation law. This is shown to be a
more attractive starting-point than Einstein's energy relationship for moving
particles, which is commonly used for the purpose. The theory developed gives a
new interpretation for the origin of antiparticles.

singly-ionized double-donor structure in the semiconductor host under the
influence of two strongly detuned laser pulses. This structure can be used as a
charge qubit where the logical states are defined by the lowest two energy
states of the remaining valence electron localized around one or another donor.
The quantum operations are performed via Raman-like transitions between the
localized (qubit) states and the manyfold of states delocalized over the
structure. The possibility of realization of arbitrary single-qubit rotations,
including the phase gate, the NOT gate, and the Hadamard gate, is demonstrated.
The advantages of the off-resonant driving scheme for charge qubit
manipulations are discussed in comparison with the resonant scheme proposed
earlier.

compared to the semiclassical description of this optical Ramsey
interferometer. Using two-channel recurrence relations we are able to express
the double-laser scattering amplitudes by means of the single-laser ones and to
give explicit analytical results. When considering slower and slower atoms, the
transmission probability of the system changes considerably from an
interference behavior to a regime where scattering resonances prevail. This may
be understood in terms of different families of trajectories that dominate the
overall transmission probability in the weak field or in the strong field
limit.

such that each integral curve of the current crosses each hypersurface of the

hypersurfaces that are not spacelike everywhere. The generalization to the
many-particle case is also possible.

on average half a quantum of superfluid flow, it is possible to create a
multiparticle superposition of all the particles rotating and all the particles
stationary. Under certain conditions it is possible to scale up the number of
particles to form a macroscopic superposition. The simplicity of the model has
allowed us to study macroscopic superpositions at an atomic level for different
variables. Here we concentrate on the tunnelling strength between the
potentials. Further investigation remains important, because it could lead us
to making an ultra-precise quantum-limited gyroscope.

states when only a single copy is available and the parties are restricted to
local operations and classical communication, but with the additional
requirement that entanglement must be preserved in the process. Several general
theorems aimed at characterizing sets of states with which the parties can
succeed in such a task are proven. These include (1) a maximum for the number
of states when the Schmidt rank of every outcome must be at least a given
minimum; (2) an upper bound (equal to the dimension of Hilbert space if
entanglement need not be preserved) for the sum over Schmidt ranks of the
initial states when only one-way classical communication is allowed; and (3)
separately, a necessary and a sufficient condition on the states such that
their original Schmidt ranks can always be preserved. It is shown that our
bound on the sum of Schmidt ranks can be exceeded if two-way communication is
permitted, and this includes the case that entanglement need not be preserved,
so that this sum can exceed the dimension of Hilbert space. Such questions,
concerning how the various results are effected by the resources used by the
parties are addressed for each theorem. This subject is closely related to the
problem of locally purifying an entangled state from a mixed state, which is of
direct relevance to teleportation and dense coding using a mixed-state
resource. In an appendix, I give an extremely simple and transparent proof of
""non-locality without entanglement"", a phenomenon originally discussed by
Bennett and co-workers several years ago.

isotropic Heisenberg interaction is studied, as a model for the spin
decoherence in quantum dots. The time-dependent polarization of the central
spin is calculated as a function of the bath-spin distribution and the
polarizations of the initial bath state. For short times, the polarization of
the central spin shows a gaussian decay, and at later times it revives
displaying nonmonotonic time dependence. The decoherence time scale dep ends on
moments of the bath-spin distribuition, and also on the polarization strengths
in various bath-spin channels. The bath polarizations have a tendency to
increase the decoherence time scale. The effective dynamics of the central spin
polarization is shown to be describ ed by a master equation with non-markovian
features.
