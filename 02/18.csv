the Bayesian complexity. We demonstrate that the Bayesian complexity can be
used to assess how many effective parameters a set of data can support and that
it is a useful complement to the model likelihood (the evidence) in model
selection questions. We apply this approach to recent measurements of cosmic
microwave background anisotropies combined with the Hubble Space Telescope
measurement of the Hubble parameter. Using mildly non-informative priors, we
show how the 3-year WMAP data improves on the first-year data by being able to
measure both the spectral index and the reionization epoch at the same time. We
also find that a non-zero curvature is strongly disfavored. We conclude that
although current data could constrain at least seven effective parameters, only
six of them are required in a scheme based on the Lambda-CDM concordance
cosmology.

spherical Mexican hat wavelet and the spherical butterfly wavelet. We examine
the possibility of foreground contamination and systematics in the WMAP data
and conclude that these factors are not responsible for the signal that we
detect. The wavelet analysis inherently enables us to localise on the sky those
regions that contribute most strongly to the correlation. On removing these
localised regions the correlation that we detect is reduced in significance, as
expected, but it is not eliminated, suggesting that these regions are not the
sole source of correlation between the data. This finding is consistent with
predictions made using the ISW effect, where one would expect weak correlations
over the entire sky. In a flat universe the detection of the ISW effect
provides direct and independent evidence for dark energy. We use our detection
to constrain dark energy parameters by deriving a theoretical prediction for
the directional wavelet covariance statistic for a given cosmological model.
Comparing these predictions with the data we place constraints on the
equation-of-state parameter $w$ and the vacuum energy density $\Omega_\Lambda$.
We also consider the case of a pure cosmological constant, i.e. $w=-1$. For
this case we rule out a zero cosmological constant at greater than the 99.9%

magnetar candidate SGR 1806-20. In the months preceding this flare, the
persistent X-ray emission from this object began to undergo significant
changes. Here, we report on the evolution of key spectral and temporal
parameters prior to and following this giant flare. Using the Rossi X-ray
Timing Explorer, we track the pulse frequency of SGR 1806-20 and find that the
spin-down rate of this SGR varied erratically in the months before and after
the flare. Contrary to the giant flare in SGR 1900+14, we find no evidence for
a discrete jump in spin frequency at the time of the December 27th flare
(|dnu/nu| < 5 X 10^-6). In the months surrounding the flare, we find a strong
correlation between pulsed flux and torque consistent with the model for
magnetar magnetosphere electrodynamics proposed by Thompson, Lyutikov &
Kulkarni (2002). As with the flare in SGR 1900+14, the pulse morphology of SGR
1806-20 changes drastically following the flare. Using the Chandra X-ray
Observatory and other publicly available imaging X-ray detector observations,
we construct a spectral history of SGR 1806-20 from 1993 to 2005. The usual
magnetar persistent emission spectral model of a power-law plus a blackbody
provides an excellent fit to the data. We confirm the earlier finding by
Mereghetti et al. (2005) of increasing spectral hardness of SGR 1806-20 between
1993 and 2004. Contrary to the direct correlation between torque and spectral
hardness proposed by Mereghetti et al., we find evidence for a sudden torque
change that triggered a gradual hardening of the energy spectrum on a timescale
of years. Interestingly, the spectral hardness, spin-down rate, pulsed, and
phase-averaged of SGR 1806-20 all peak months before the flare epoch.

Ly-alpha emission. H2 emission is not detected from the WTTS V410 Tau. The
fluorescent H2 emission appears to be common to circumstellar environments
around all CTTSs, but high spectral and spatial resolution STIS observations

from TW Hya, DF Tau, and V836 Tau is centered at the radial velocity of the

RU Lupi, DF Tau, and T Tau also have excess blueshifted H2 emission that
extends to as much as -100 km/s. The strength of this blueshifted component
from DF Tau and T Tau depends on the upper level of the transition. In all

restricts the H2 emission to be formed close to the star. The Ly-alpha and the
H2 emission blueshifted by 15 km/s relative to RU Lupi are extended to the SW

results in $\gb$, $\rb$, $\ib$ and $\zb$ bands show the same behavior. Using

evolution of equal-mass models, starting with primordial binary fractions of 0
- 100 %, with values of N ranging from 256 to 16384. This allows us to
extrapolate the main features of the evolution to systems comparable in

radius to half-mass radius that follows qualitatively the analytical estimate
by Vesperini & Chernoff (1994), although the N dependence is steeper than
expected. Interestingly, for an initial binary fraction f greater than 10%, the
binary heating in the core during the post collapse phase almost saturates
(becoming nearly independent of f), and so little variation in the structural
properties is observed. Thus, although we observe a significantly lower binary
abundance in the core with respect to the Fokker-Planck simulations by Gao et
al. (1991), this is of little dynamical consequence. At variance with the study
of Gao et al. (1991), we see no sign of gravothermal oscillations before 150
halfmass relaxation times. At later times, however, oscillations become
prominent. We demonstrate the gravothermal nature of these oscillations.

particles that are necessary to model globular clusters. We characterize the
steady-state `deuterium main sequence' phase in which primordial binaries are
depleted in the core in the process of `gravitationally burning'. In this phase
we find that the ratio of the core to half-mass radius, r_c/r_h, is similar to
that measured for isolated systems. In addition to the generation of energy due
to hardening and depletion of the primordial binary population, the overall
evolution of the star clusters is driven by a competing process: the tidal
disruption of the system. We find that the depletion of primordial binaries
before tidal dissolution of the system is possible only if the initial number
is below 0.05 N, in the case of a King model with W_0=7 and N=4096 (which is
one of our longest living models). We compare our findings, obtained by means

fitting the multi-color lightcurves of Type Ia supernovae, first introduced in
Wang et al. (2003). CMAGIC takes advantage of the remarkably simple behavior of
Type Ia supernovae on color-magnitude diagrams, and has several advantages over
current techniques based on maximum magnitudes. Among these are a reduced
sensitivity to host galaxy dust extinction, a shallower luminosity-width
relation, and the relative simplicity of the fitting procedure. This allows us
to provide a cross check of previous supernova cosmology results, despite the
fact that current data sets were not observed in a manner optimized for CMAGIC.
We describe the details of our novel blindness procedure, which is designed to
prevent experimenter bias. The data are broadly consistent with the picture of
an accelerating Universe, and agree with a flat Universe within 1.7\sigma,
including systematics. We also compare the CMAGIC results directly with those
of a maximum magnitude fit to the same SNe, finding that CMAGIC favors more
acceleration at the 1.6\sigma level, including systematics and the correlation
between the two measurements. A fit for w assuming a flat Universe yields a

data is divided into two bins corresponding to different angular scales.
Modeling the observed excess power as a flat band of average multipole ell=

T_1^2 >0 muK^2 with 94.7% confidence. In a second band with average multipole
of ell = 8748, we find Delta T_2^2 consistent with zero, and an upper limit 880

observations with the VLA provide strong evidence against systematic errors or
radio point sources being the source of the observed excess power. The dominant
source of anisotropy on these scales is expected to arise from the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect in a population of distant galaxy clusters. If
the excess power is due to the SZ effect, we can place constraints on the
normalization of the matter power spectrum sigma_8 = 1.03^{+0.20}_{-0.29} at
68% confidence. The distribution of pixel fluxes in the BIMA images are found
to be consistent with simulated observations of the expected SZ background and
rule out instrumental noise or radio sources as the source of the observed
excess power with similar confidence to the detection of excess power.
Follow-up optical observations to search for galaxy over-densities

that all the evolutions of the mass density $\Omega_{m} $, the radiation

Therefore it is deserved to study observational constraints on the bending

itself may behave differently from general relativity on the largest scales, in
such a way as to produce acceleration. The alternative approach of modified
gravity also faces severe difficulties, but does provide a new angle on the

YBCO coated conductors. A 10 mm wide YBCO coated conductor was subdivided into
20 filaments by laser cutting. The separation of coupling loss from the total
is possible because the energy loss per cycle in samples with electrically
insulated filaments has a very small frequency dependence. We measured the
frequency dependence of the total losses in the frequency range between 0.1 Hz
and 500 Hz. The coupling loss was obtained from the total by subtracting the
hysteresis loss. The latter was measured at low frequencies since only
hysteresis loss is non-negligible at frequencies below 1 Hz. The transverse
resistivity was determined from the coupling losses; it was assumed that the
sample length is equal to half of the twist pitch. The values of transverse
resistivity deduced from the loss data were compared with those obtained by the
four-point measurements with current flowing perpendicular to the filaments.
Preliminary results indicate that the current method of laser ablation creates
electrical contacts between the superconducting filaments and the substrate.
This was also confirmed by the Hall probe mapping of the magnetic field in the
vicinity of the tape. The measured transverse resistivity was close to the
resistivity of the substrate (Hastelloy).

lossless channels with low bit rates, in which a vital message needs to be
transmitted prior to termination of communications. This paradigm can be
applied to Alfred Renyi's secondhand account of an ancient siege in which a spy
was sent to scout the enemy but was captured. After escaping, the spy returned
to his base in no condition to speak and unable to write. His commander asked
him questions that he could answer by nodding or shaking his head, and the
fortress was defended with this information. Renyi told this story with
reference to prefix coding, but maximizing probability of survival in the siege
scenario is distinct from yet related to the traditional source coding
objective of minimizing expected codeword length. Rather than finding a code
minimizing expected codeword length $\sum_{i=1}^n p(i) l(i)$, the siege problem
involves maximizing $\sum_{i=1}^n p(i) \theta^{l(i)}$ for a known $\theta \in
(0,1)$. When there are no restrictions on codewords, this problem can be solve
using a known generalization of Huffman coding. The optimal solution has coding
bounds which are functions of Renyi entropy; in addition to known bounds, new
bounds are derived here. The alphabetically constrained version of this problem
has applications in search trees and diagnostic testing. A novel dynamic
programming algorithm -- based upon the oldest known algorithm for the
traditional alphabetic problem -- optimizes this problem in $O(n^3)$ time and
$O(n^2)$ space, whereas two novel approximation algorithms can find a
suboptimal solution faster: one in linear time, the other in $O(n \log n)$.
Coding bounds for the alphabetic version of this problem are also presented.

it is transparent how the superconformal structure of the effective 4D actions
is inherited from the one of the original 5D supergravity. We consider both
ungauged and gauged 5D supergravities. This includes compactifications in
unwarped geometries, generalizations of the supersymmetric Randall-Sundrum (RS)
model as well as 5D heterotic M-theory. In the unwarped case, after obtaining
the effective Kaehler potentials and superpotentials, we demonstrate that the
tree-level 4D potentials have flat and/or tachyonic directions. One-loop

suitable tools for moduli stabilization to be discussed in subsequent work.
Turning to the RS-like models, we obtain a master formula for the Kaehler

time, the controlled process is approximated by sequences of controlled Markov
chains, thus discretising time and space. A new feature in this context is to
allow for delay in the dynamics. The existence of an optimal strategy with
respect to the cost functional can be guaranteed in the class of relaxed
controls. Weak convergence of the approximating extended Markov chains to the
original process together with convergence of the associated optimal strategies

eigenvalue problem defined by two self-adjoint operators with a positive
essential spectrum and a finite number of isolated eigenvalues. The generalized
eigenvalue problem determines spectral stability of nonlinear waves in a
Hamiltonian dynamical system. The theory is based on the Pontryagin's Invariant
Subspace theorem in an indefinite inner product space but it extends beyond the
scope of earlier papers of Pontryagin, Krein, Grillakis, and others. Our main
results are (i) the number of unstable and potentially unstable eigenvalues
{\em equals} the number of negative eigenvalues of the self-adjoint operators,
(ii) the total number of isolated eigenvalues of the generalized eigenvalue
problem is {\em bounded from above} by the total number of isolated eigenvalues
of the self-adjoint operators, and (iii) the quadratic form defined by the
indefinite inner product is strictly positive on the subspace related to the
absolutely continuous part of the spectrum of the generalized eigenvalue
problem. Applications to solitons and vortices of the nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger

fields has been studied in the geometry of a mechanically driven, spherical
dynamo experiment, using a three dimensional numerical computation. A simple
impeller model drives a flow which can generate a growing magnetic field,
depending upon the magnetic Reynolds number, Rm, and the fluid Reynolds number.
When the flow is laminar, the dynamo transition is governed by a simple
threshold in Rm, above which a growing magnetic eigenmode is observed. The
eigenmode is primarily a dipole field tranverse to axis of symmetry of the
flow. In saturation the Lorentz force slows the flow such that the magnetic
eigenmode becomes marginally stable. For turbulent flow, the dynamo eigenmode
is suppressed. The mechanism of suppression is due to a combination of a time
varying large-scale field and the presence of fluctuation driven currents which
effectively enhance the magnetic diffusivity. For higher Rm a dynamo reappears,
however the structure of the magnetic field is often different from the laminar
dynamo; it is dominated by a dipolar magnetic field which is aligned with the
axis of symmetry of the mean-flow, apparently generated by fluctuation-driven
currents. The fluctuation-driven currents have been studied by applying a weak
magnetic field to laminar and turbulent flows. The magnetic fields generated by
the fluctuations are significant: a dipole moment aligned with the symmetry
axis of the mean-flow is generated similar to those observed in the experiment,
and both toroidal and poloidal flux expulsion are observed.

subjected to a sequence of observations. These measurements occur randomly at a
given rate and can be of a very general form. As an example, we analyse the
effects of these measurements on the evolution of a two-level atom driven by an
electromagnetic field. For the associated quantum trajectories we find Rabi
oscillations, Zeno-effect type behaviour and random telegraph evolution spawned
by mini quantum jumps as we change the rates and strengths of measurement.

A 364, 3463--3476 (2006)","10.1098/rsta.2006.1894",,"quant-ph",,"  A general formalism of the relation between geometric phases produced by
circularly evolving interacting spin systems and their criticality behavior is
presented. This opens up the way for the use of geometric phases as a tool to
study regions of criticality without having to undergo a quantum phase
transition. As a concrete example a spin-1/2 chain with XY interactions is
presented and the corresponding geometric phases are analyzed. The
generalization of these results to the case of an arbitrary spin system
provides an explanation for the existence of such a relation.

"quant-ph/0602155","Yuri I. Ozhigov","Yuri Ozhigov","Simulation of quantum dynamics via classical collective behavior",,,,,"quant-ph",,"  The simple algorithm for the simulation and visualization of non relativistic
quantum dynamics is proposed that is based on a collective behavior of
classical particles. Any quantum particle is represented as the swarm of its
classical samples which interact by simple rules including emission and
absorption of samples of tied photons. The quantum dynamics results from the
collective behavior of such a swarm where the eigenstates are treated as the
equilibrium states relatively to emission-absorption of photons. The
entanglement is treated as a correlation between samples of the different
swarms that is stored in the space-time part of the model inaccessible for a
user. The amplitude is always grained. The Coulomb field between quantum
particles is simulated, analogously to free flow of quantum package, by the
point wise interaction between its samples and scalar photon samples which
propagate by diffusion. It gives square root speedup in comparison to
each-with-each method. This method obviously includes decoherence and admits
the natural generalization on the QED of many particles with the linear
computational cost.

developing of programs intended for execution on a quantum computer. We look at
programming in the context of formal methods of program development, or
programming methodology. Our work is based on probabilistic predicative
programming, a recent generalisation of the well-established predicative
programming. It supports the style of program development in which each
programming step is proven correct as it is made. We inherit the advantages of
the theory, such as its generality, simple treatment of recursive programs,
time and space complexity, and communication. Our theory of quantum programming
provides tools to write both classical and quantum specifications, develop
quantum programs that implement these specifications, and reason about their
comparative time and space complexity all in the same framework.

  Comments are welcome",,,,"quant-ph",,"  This report surveys quantum error-correcting codes. As Preskill claimed, 21st
century would be the golden age of quantum error correction. Quantum channels
behave differently from classical channels, so researchers face difficulties in
developing robust quantum codes. Fortunately, the classical error control
methods have been well developed. If we can learn many lessons from classical
coding theory, we can expedite the development of quantum codes. Scientists
have discovered that quantum error correction shares many concepts with
classical counterpart. Both quantum and classical coding schemes add redundancy
to information to protect against noises. They also have similar conditions for
error detectability and correctability.

and the two agents, Bob and Charlie code their information on their photons
with four local unitary operations, which makes this scheme more convenient for
the agents than others. This scheme has a high intrinsic efficiency for qubits
and a high capacity.
