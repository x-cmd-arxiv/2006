around strongly magnetized neutron stars -- magnetars. The starquakes of a
magnetar shear its external magnetic field, which becomes non-potential and is
threaded by an electric current. Once twisted, the magnetosphere cannot untwist
immediately because of its self-induction. The self-induction electric field
lifts particles from the stellar surface, accelerates them, and initiates
avalanches of pair creation in the magnetosphere. The created plasma corona
maintains the electric current demanded by curl(B) and regulates the
self-induction e.m.f. by screening. This corona persists in dynamic
equilibrium: it is continually lost to the stellar surface on the
light-crossing time of 10^{-4} s and replenished with new particles. In
essence, the twisted magnetosphere acts as an accelerator that converts the
toroidal field energy to particle kinetic energy. Using a direct numerical
experiment, we show that the corona self-organizes quickly (on a millisecond
timescale) into a quasi-steady state, with voltage ~1 GeV along the magnetic
lines. The heating rate of the corona is ~10^{36} erg/s, in agreement with the
observed persistent, high-energy output of magnetars. We deduce that a static
twist that is suddenly implanted into the magnetosphere will decay on a
timescale of 1-10 yrs. The particles accelerated in the corona impact the solid
crust, knock out protons, and regulate the column density of the hydrostatic
atmosphere of the star. The transition layer between the atmosphere and the
corona is the likely source of the observed 100-keV emission from magnetars.
The corona emits curvature radiation and can supply the observed IR-optical
luminosity. (Abridged)

frequency radio survey (AMI), a high resolution ground-based multiband survey
(SPT), and the Planck all-sky survey. These surveys are not purely flux
limited, and they loose completeness significantly before their point-source
detection thresholds. Contamination remains relatively low at <5% (less than
30%) for a detection threshold set at S/N=5 (S/N=3). We identify photometric
recovery as an important source of catalog uncertainty: dispersion in recovered
flux from multiband surveys is larger than the intrinsic scatter in the Y-M
relation predicted from hydrodynamical simulations, while photometry in the
single frequency survey is seriously compromised by confusion with primary
cosmic microwave background anisotropy. The latter effect implies that
follow-up observations in other wavebands (e.g., 90 GHz, X-ray) of single
frequency surveys will be required. Cluster morphology can cause a bias in the
recovered Y-M relation, but has little effect on the scatter; the bias would be
removed during calibration of the relation. Point source confusion only
slightly decreases multiband survey completeness; single frequency survey
completeness could be significantly reduced by radio point source confusion,
but this remains highly uncertain because we do not know the radio counts at
the relevant flux levels.

and hence exhibit strong clustering. We argue that a valuable tool for
measuring these clustering properties is the cross-correlation of sub-mm
galaxies with faint optically-selected sources. We analyze populations of
SCUBA-detected and optical galaxies in the GOODS-N survey area. Using
optical/IR photometric-redshift information, we search for correlations induced
by two separate effects: (1) cosmic magnification of background sub-mm sources
by foreground dark matter haloes traced by optical galaxies at lower redshifts;
and (2) galaxy clustering due to sub-mm and optical sources tracing the same
population of haloes where their redshift distributions overlap. Regarding
cosmic magnification, we find no detectable correlation. Our null result is
consistent with a theoretical model for the cosmic magnification, and we show
that a dramatic increase in the number of sub-mm sources will be required to
measure the effect reliably. Regarding clustering, we find evidence at the
3.5-sigma level for a cross-correlation between sub-mm and optical galaxies
analyzed in identical photometric redshift slices. The data hint that the
sub-mm sources have an enhanced bias parameter compared to the
optically-selected population (with a significance of 2-sigma). The next
generation of deep sub-mm surveys can potentially perform an accurate
measurement of each of these cross-correlations, adding a new set of
diagnostics for understanding the development of massive structure in the
Universe.

stars and collisionless stellar systems. A barotropic star that minimizes the
energy functional at fixed mass is a nonlinearly dynamically stable stationary
solution of the Euler-Poisson system. Formally, this minimization problem is
similar to a condition of ``canonical stability'' in thermodynamics. A stellar
system that maximizes an H-function at fixed mass and energy is a nonlinearly
dynamically stable stationary solution of the Vlasov-Poisson system. Formally,
this maximization problem is similar to a condition of ``microcanonical
stability'' in thermodynamics. Using a thermodynamical analogy, we provide a
derivation and an interpretation of the nonlinear Antonov first law in terms of
``ensembles inequivalence'': a spherical stellar system with f=f(epsilon) and
f'(epsilon)<0 is nonlinearly dynamically stable with respect to the
Vlasov-Poisson system if the corresponding barotropic star with the same
equilibrium density distribution is nonlinearly dynamically stable with respect
to the Euler-Poisson system. This is similar to the fact that ``canonical
stability implies microcanonical stability'' in thermodynamics. The converse is
wrong in case of ``ensembles inequivalence'' which is generic for systems with
long-range interactions like gravity. We show that criteria of nonlinear
dynamical stability can be obtained very simply from purely graphical
constructions by using the method of series of equilibria and the turning point
argument of Poincare, as in thermodynamics.

event is a polar crown filament that erupted on 15 Oct. 2002. The filament
clearly exhibited oscillatory motion in the slow-rising, pre-eruption phase.
The amplitude of the oscillation was larger than 20 km/s, and the motion was
predominantly horizontal. The period was about 2 hours and seemed to increase
during the oscillation, indicating weakening of restoring force. These results
strongly indicate that, even in the slow-rise phase before the eruption, the
filament retained equilibrium and behaved as an oscillator, and the equilibrium
is stable to nonlinear perturbation. Moreover, the transition from such
nonlinear stability to either instabilities or a loss of equilibrium that leads
to the eruption occurred in the Alfven time scale. This suggests that the onset
of the eruption was triggered by a fast magnetic reconnection that stabilized
the pre-eruption magnetic configuration, rather than by the slow shearing
motion at the photosphere.

input. We find that at R_2500 the mass profile obtained via a direct
application of the hydrostatic equilibrium equation is consistent within 1
sigma with the actual mass; although we notice this estimator shows high
statistical errors due to high level of Chandra background. Instead, the
poorness of the beta-model in describing the gas density profile makes the
evaluated masses to be underestimated by \sim 40 per cent with respect to the
true mass, both with an isothermal and a polytropic temperature profile. We
also test ways to recover the mass by adopting an analytic mass model, such as
those proposed by Navarro et al. (1997) and Rasia et al. (2004), and fitting
the temperature profile expected from the hydrostatic equilibrium equation to
the observed one. These methods and the one of the hydrostatic equilibrium
equation provide a more robust mass estimation than the ones based on the
beta-model. In the present work the main limitation for a precise mass
reconstruction is to ascribe to the relatively high level of the background
chosen to reproduce the Chandra one. After artificially reducing it by a factor
of 100, we find that the estimated mass significantly underestimates the true
mass profiles. This is manly due (i) to the neglected contribution of the gas
bulk motions to the total energy budget and (ii) to the bias towards lower
values of the X-ray temperature measurements because of the complex thermal
structure of the emitting plasma.

constants in magnetic field is positive, i.e., MD=0.05, when T<55K, but
negative with a maximum of MD=-0.14 when 55K<T<190K. The magnetodielectric
effect appears a sign change at 55K, which is due to transition from
antiferromagnetic to weak ferromagnetic; and vanishes abruptly around 190K,
which is thought to be associated with order-disorder transition of iron ion at
B site of perovskite structures. The ultra-low-field magnetodielectric
behaviour of Bi6Fe2Ti3O18 film has been discussed in the light of
quasi-two-dimension unique nature of local spin order in ferroelectric film.
Our results allow expectation on low-cost applications of detectors and
switches for extremely weak magnetic fields in a wide temperature range
55K-190K.

Using the formalism, it is demonstrated that the one-particle spectral
intensity in the two-dimensional Hubbard model at half-filling exhibits the
pseudo-gap behavior in the central coherent quasiparticle peak due to the
critical antiferromagnetic fluctuation. The specific heat is considerably
enhanced by the short-range order, which assists a tendency of the Mott
localization showing the reduction of the double occupancy. We briefly discuss
a formulation for the superconducting transition temperature in the present

one can impart functional groups of sufficient density and stability for
uniform and conformal ALD of high k dielectrics on SWNTs with thickness down to
2-3nm. This enables approaching the ultimate vertical scaling limit of nanotube

attention for sensor network applications because of their simplicity and
robustness in noisy and uncertain environments. However, gossip algorithms can
waste significant energy by essentially passing around redundant information
multiple times. For realistic sensor network model topologies like grids and
random geometric graphs, the inefficiency of gossip schemes is caused by slow
mixing times of random walks on those graphs. We propose and analyze an
alternative gossiping scheme that exploits geographic information. By utilizing
a simple resampling method, we can demonstrate substantial gains over
previously proposed gossip protocols. In particular, for random geometric
graphs, our algorithm computes the true average to accuracy $1/n^a$ using
$O(n^{1.5}\sqrt{\log n})$ radio transmissions, which reduces the energy
consumption by a $\sqrt{\frac{n}{\log n}}$ factor over standard gossip

belief-propagation (BP) decoding of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes over
the BEC can be characterized in terms of stopping sets. We describe turbo
decoding on the BEC which is simpler than turbo decoding on other channels. We
then adapt the concept of stopping sets to turbo decoding and state an exact
condition for decoding failure. Apply turbo decoding until the transmitted
codeword has been recovered, or the decoder fails to progress further. Then the
set of erased positions that will remain when the decoder stops is equal to the
unique maximum-size turbo stopping set which is also a subset of the set of
erased positions. Furthermore, we present some improvements of the basic turbo
decoding algorithm on the BEC. The proposed improved turbo decoding algorithm
has substantially better error performance as illustrated by the given
simulation results. Finally, we give an expression for the turbo stopping set
size enumerating function under the uniform interleaver assumption, and an
efficient enumeration algorithm of small-size turbo stopping sets for a
particular interleaver. The solution is based on the algorithm proposed by
Garello et al. in 2001 to compute an exhaustive list of all low-weight
codewords in a turbo code.

Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), use of optical cavities with
non-spherical mirrors supporting flat-top (""mesa"") beams, potentially capable
of mitigating the thermal noise of the mirrors, has recently drawn a
considerable attention. To reduce the severe tilt-instability problems
affecting the originally conceived nearly-flat, ""Mexican-hat-shaped"" mirror
configuration, K. S. Thorne proposed a nearly-concentric mirror configuration
capable of producing the same mesa beam profile on the mirror surfaces.
Subsequently, Bondarescu and Thorne introduced a generalized construction that
leads to a one-parameter family of ""hyperboloidal"" beams which allows
continuous spanning from the nearly-flat to the nearly-concentric mesa beam
configurations. This paper is concerned with a study of the analytic structure
of the above family of hyperboloidal beams. Capitalizing on certain results
from the applied optics literature on flat-top beams, a physically-insightful
and computationally-effective representation is derived in terms of
rapidly-converging Gauss-Laguerre expansions. Moreover, the functional relation
between two generic hyperboloidal beams is investigated. This leads to a
generalization (involving fractional Fourier transform operators of complex
order) of some recently discovered duality relations between the nearly-flat
and nearly-concentric mesa configurations. Possible implications and
perspectives for the advanced LIGO optical cavity design are discussed.

demonstrated that this effect does not disappear even if the medium refractive
index is assumed to be equal to unity. The rate obtained strongly depends on
the polarization states of the particles involved. This leads to evident
spatial asymmetries, which may have certain consequences observable in
astrophysical and cosmological studies.

order of 1 fb. However, the background from the Standard Model single top-quark
production makes it difficult to detect the flavor-changing Z' signal unless
with a decent charm tagging method. On the other hand, at the ILC, the
production cross section at the resonance energy of \sqrt{s} \approx M_{Z'} can
reach a size of more than 100 fb. Even away from the resonance, the cross
section at ILC is shown to be larger than the threshold of observability of

suitable for infinite or externally bound systems, they are determined as
expectation values of appropriate intrinsic operators, dependent on the
relative coordinates and momenta (Jacobi variables) and acting on intrinsic
wavefunctions of nuclear states. Thus, translational invariance (TI) is
respected. When handling such intrinsic quantities, we use an algebraic
technique based upon the Cartesian representation, in which the coordinate and
momentum operators are linear combinations of the creation and annihilation
operators a^+ and a for oscillator quanta. Each of the relevant multiplicative
operators can then be reduced to the form: one exponential of the set {a^+}
times other exponential of the set {a}. In the course of such a normal-ordering
procedure we offer a fresh look at the appearance of ""Tassie-Barker"" factors,
and point out other model-independent results. The intrinsic wavefunction of
the nucleus in its ground state is constructed from a
nontranslationally-invariant (nTI) one via existing projection techniques. As
an illustration, the one-body and two-body momentum distributions (MDs) for the

10^{20}eV$ or higher would not be reaching the earth. However some such events
seem to have been observed. This has lead to phenomenological models in which
there is a small violation of the Lorentz symmetry or the velocity of light.
However recent Quantum Gravity and String Theory approaches which no longer
consider a differentiable spacetime manifold already predict such violations.
Similarly there are other theoretical reasons which also point to this. We
briefly discuss the various possibilities.

Lopez-Rios","Controlling Strong Electromagnetic Fields at a Sub-Wavelength Scale","5 pages, 4 figures, submitted to PRL",,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.036405",,"physics.optics",,"  We investigate the optical response of two sub-wavelength grooves on a
metallic screen, separated by a sub-wavelength distance. We show that the
Fabry-Perot-like mode, already observed in one-dimensional periodic gratings
and known for a single slit, splits into two resonances in our system : a
symmetrical mode with a small Q-factor, and an antisymmetric one which leads to
a much stronger light enhancement. This behavior results from the near-field
coupling of the grooves. Moreover, the use of a second incident wave allows to
control the localization of the photons in the groove of our choice, depending
on the phase difference between the two incident waves. The system exactly acts
as a sub-wavelength optical switch operated from far-field.

external electric field are investigated. A general expression for the power
spectrum of fluctuations is derived within the long-range expansion. It is
found that in the whole measured frequency band, the power spectrum of
fluctuations exhibits an inverse frequency dependence. A general argument is
given showing that for all practically relevant values of the electric field,
the power spectrum of induced fluctuations is proportional to the field
strength squared. As an illustration, the power spectrum is calculated
explicitly using the kinetic model with the relaxation-type collision term.
Finally, it is shown that the magnitude of fluctuations produced by a sample
generally has a Gaussian distribution around its mean value, and its dependence
on the sample geometry is determined. In particular, it is demonstrated that
for geometrically similar samples, the power spectrum is inversely proportional
to the sample volume. Application of the obtained results to the problem of
flicker noise is discussed.
