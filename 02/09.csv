  Reionization","submitted to ApJ letters, 4 pages emulateapj text plus 5 figures",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The Local Group contains some dwarf galaxies that apparently formed all their
stars early, lost their gas to winds or ionization, and survive today as
``fossils'' from the epoch of reionization. This study presents new models of
these objects based on the hierarchical chemical evolution framework of
Tumlinson (2006). The model accurately reproduces the observed
luminosity-metallicity relation of fossil dwarf galaxies with minimal free
parameters. When calibrated to this relation, the models show that small dark
matter ``minihalos'' formed 2 - 8% of their baryonic mass into stars prior
during reionization. By tracking the chemical enrichment of these early halos
the models specify that metal-free first stars contributed approximately 5 - 10
% of the ionizing photons generated by these small halos and so did not
dominate reionization. Models that allow for larger relative contributions from
metal-free stars may not generate enough total ionizing photons for early
reionization. As significant star formation in early minihalos is a requirement
of many successful models for the IGM reionization, these models can be
considered to pass a key test of their validity. It appears we have as much to
learn about reionization from the universe at z = 0 as at z = 6.

NGC 4051 as observed during two XMM-Newton observations. The data show evidence
for a neutral and constant reflection component and for constant emission from
photoionized gas, which are included in all spectral models. The nuclear
emission can be modelled both in terms of a ``standard model'' (pivoting power
law plus a black body component for the soft excess) and of a two--component
one (power law plus ionized reflection from the accretion disc). The standard
model results indicate that the soft excess does not follow the standard black
body law. Moreover, although the spectral slope is correlated with flux, which
is consistent with spectral pivoting, the hardest photon indexes are so flat as
to require rather unusual scenarios. These problems can be solved in terms of
the two-component model in which the soft excess is not thermal, but due to the
ionized reflection component. The variability of the reflection component from
the inner disc closely follows the predictions of the light bending model,
suggesting that most of the primary nuclear emission is produced in the very
innermost regions, only a few gravitational radii from the central black hole.

measure four key age, metallicity and abundance ratio sensitive indices from
the Lick/IDS system over a two-dimensional field extending up to approximately
one effective radius. We modify the classical Fe5270 index to define a new
index, Fe5270S, which maximizes the usable spatial coverage of SAURON. Maps of
Hbeta, Fe5015, Mgb and Fe5270S are presented for each galaxy. We use the maps
to compute average line strengths integrated over circular apertures of
one-eighth effective radius, and compare the resulting relations of index
versus velocity dispersion with previous long-slit work. The metal line
strength maps show generally negative gradients with increasing radius roughly
consistent with the morphology of the light profiles. Remarkable deviations
from this general trend exist, particularly the Mgb isoindex contours appear to
be flatter than the isophotes of the surface brightness for about 40% of our
galaxies without significant dust features. Generally these galaxies exhibit
significant rotation. We infer from this that the fast-rotating component
features a higher metallicity and/or an increased Mg/Fe ratio as compared to
the galaxy as a whole. The Hbeta maps are typically flat or show a mild
positive outwards radial gradient, while a few galaxies show strong central
peaks and/or elevated overall Hbeta-strength likely connected to recent
star-formation activity. For the most prominent post-starburst galaxies even
the metal line strength maps show a reversed gradient. (abridged)

Gaussian velocity distribution (kurtosis -0.6). However, if subhalos are
required to exceed a minimal mass before accretion onto the host, the velocity
bias becomes negligible and the velocity distribution is close to Gaussian
(kurtosis -0.15). Recently it has been shown that the latter criterion results
in subhalo samples that agree well with the observed number-density profiles of
galaxies in clusters. Therefore we argue that the velocity distributions of
galaxies in clusters are essentially un-biased. The comparison of the galaxy
velocity distribution and the sound speed, derived from scaling relations of
X-ray observations, results in an average Mach number of 1.24. Altogether 65%
of the galaxies move supersonically and 8% have Mach numbers larger than 2 with

Abell 2065 with the ACIS-I detector. Previous observations with ROSAT and ASCA
provided evidence for an ongoing merger, but also suggested that there were two
surviving cooling cores, which were associated with the two cD galaxies in the
center of the cluster. The Chandra observation reveals only one X-ray surface
brightness peak, which is associated with the more luminous, southern cD
galaxy. The gas related with that peak is cool and displaced slightly from the
position of the cD. The data suggest that this cool material has formed a cold
front. On the other hand, in the higher spatial resolution Chandra image, the
second feature to the north is not associated with the northern cD; rather, it
appears to be a trail of gas behind the main cD. We argue that only one of the
two cooling cores has survived the merger, although it is possible that the
northern cD may not have possessed a cool core prior to the merger. We use the
cool core survival to constrain the kinematics of the merger and we find an
upper limit of ~< 1900 km/s for the merger relative velocity. A surface
brightness discontinuity is found at ~140 kpc from the southern cD; the Mach
number for this feature is ${\cal M} = 1.66^{+0.24}_{-0.32}$, although its
nature (shock or cold front) is not clear from the data. We argue that Abell
2065 is an example of an unequal mass merger. The more massive southern cluster
has driven a shock into the ICM of the infalling northern cluster, which has
disrupted the cool core of the latter, if one existed originally. We estimate
that core crossing occurred a few hundred Myr ago, probably for the first time.

distributions of SHBs observed by Swift/HETE II. The Swift/HETE II SHB sample
is incompatible with SHB population that follows the star formation rate.
However, it is compatible with a distribution of delay times after the SFR.
This would be the case if SHBs are associated with binary neutron star mergers.
The implied SHB rates that we find range from \sim 8 to \sim
30h_{70}^3Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}. This rate is a much higher than what was previously
estimated and, when beaming is taken into account, it is comparable to the rate
of neutron star mergers estimated from statistics of binary pulsars. If GRBs
are produced in mergers the implied rate practically guarantees detection by
LIGO II and possibly even by LIGO I, if we are lucky. Our analysis, which is
based on observed short hard burst is limited to bursts with luminosities above
10^{49}erg/sec. Weaker bursts may exist but if so they are hardly detected by

narrow region near the bifurcation point and a simple analytical formula for
the limiting case of moderately strong modulation. The present theory yields
analytical description for the retardation of the exponential growth of the
escape rate enhancement (i.e., transition from a log-linear regime to more
moderate growth and even reverse behavior). The theory is developed for an
arbitrary potential with an activation barrier but is exemplified by the cases
of cubic (metastable) and quartic (bistable) potentials.

  We consider a special case of the general n-channel symmetric

work on two-channel MD-LVQ showed that the distortions of the side quantizers
can be expressed through the normalized second moment of a sphere. We show here
that this is also the case for three-channel MD-LVQ. Furthermore, we conjecture
that this is true for the general n-channel MD-LVQ.
  For given source, target rate and packet-loss probabilities we find the
optimal number of descriptions and construct the MD-LVQ system that minimizes
the expected distortion. We verify theoretical expressions by numerical

the authors advance the concept that the polarization effects can be accounted

differently than the u and d, except that it is required to have been created

parameters are extracted from p-p elastic scattering using a previous model and
these are used to predict the Lambda polarization from the p-p data. Remarkably
good agreement is obtained, raising the possibility that the large hyperon
polarizations are no more of a mystery than the p-p polarization itself and
that, at least at small pt, the two may be simply related. This concept is
extended in an attempt to explain the polarizations observed in other inclusive
hyperon processes with the finding that hyperon and elastic polarizations,
which previously seemed almost unrelated, may have a simple and common origin.

marginal boundary deformation. In recent years this deformation has been
studied in the context of rolling tachyons and S-branes in string theory. Here
we study the problem directly from an open string point of view, at one loop.
We formulate the theory of the Z_2 reflection orbifold. To do so, we extend
fermionization techniques originally introduced by Polchinski and Thorlacius.
We also explain how to perform the open string computations at arbitrary
(rational) radius, by consistently constructing the corresponding shift
orbifold, and show in what sense these are related to known boundary states. In
a companion paper, we use these results in a cosmological context involving
decaying branes.

radii'' extracted from two-particle correlations measured at the Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) is known as the ``RHIC HBT Puzzle.'' Most comparisons
between models and experiment exploit the fact that for Gaussian sources the
HBT radii agree with certain combinations of the space-time widths of the
source which can be directly computed from the emission function, without
having to evaluate, at significant expense, the two-particle correlation
function. We here study the validity of this approach for realistic emission
function models some of which exhibit significant deviations from simple
Gaussian behaviour. By Fourier transforming the emission function we compute
the 2-particle correlation function and fit it with a Gaussian to partially
mimic the procedure used for measured correlation functions. We describe a
novel algorithm to perform this Gaussian fit analytically. We find that for
realistic hydrodynamic models the HBT radii extracted from this procedure agree
better with the data than the values previously extracted from the space-time
widths of the emission function. Although serious discrepancies between the
calculated and measured HBT radii remain, we show that a more
``apples-to-apples'' comparison of models with data can play an important role
in any eventually successful theoretical description of RHIC HBT data.

both the exponential behavior of the $\Omega$ spectrum in $p_T$ and the

system: leaders -individuals getting a large payoff who are imitated by a
considerable fraction of the population-, conformists -unsatisfied cooperative
agents that keep cooperating-, and exploiters -Defectors with a payoff larger
than the average one obtained by Cooperators. The dynamics generates a social
network that can have the topology of a small world network. The network has a
strong hierarchical structure in which the leaders play an essential role
sustaining a highly cooperative stable regime. The social structure is shown to
be very sensitive to perturbations acting on the leaders. Such perturbations
produce social crisis described as dynamical cascades that propagate through
the network.

interpretation. Herein, we analyze carefully the possible mathematical meanings
of those terms used in analysis of EPR's contention, that Quantum Mechanics is
incomplete, as well as Bell's work descendant therefrom. As a result, many
inconsistencies and errors in contemporary discussions of nonlocality, as well
as in Bell's Ansatz with respect to the laws of probability, are identified.
Evading these errors precludes serious conflicts between Quantum Mechanics and
both Special Relativity and Philosophy.

diffusion rate in the quantum delta kicked rotor system for small numbers of
kicks. We show development of diffusion resonances from two to five kicks, and
of multiple resonances for high kick strengths. Furthermore, we show that, in
contrast to classical predictions, the results are purely periodic in the kick
period, and reproduce the predicted quantum- and diffusion resonances.

presented. The method that was used was to replace the Weyl-Heisenberg algebra
by other dynamical algebra of low dimension that admits infinite-dimensional
irreducible representations with naturally defined generalized coherent states.
We have selected the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{su}(1,1)$, due to that this algebra
posses the necessary characteristics for to realize the hypercomputation and
also due to that such algebra has been identified as the dynamical algebra
associated to many relatively simple quantum systems. In addition to an
algebraic adaptation of KHQA over the algebra $\mathfrak{su}(1,1)$, we
presented an adaptations of KHQA over some concrete physical referents: the
infinite square well, the infinite cylindrical well, the perturbed infinite
cylindrical well, the P{\""o}sch-Teller potentials, the Holstein-Primakoff
system, and the Laguerre oscillator. We conclude that it is possible to have
many physical systems within condensed matter and quantum optics on which it is
possible to consider an implementation of KHQA.
