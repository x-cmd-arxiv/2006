quintessence and phantom which involves the participation of two reals scalar
fields playing the roles of those two types of dark energy. In that framework
we examine from a dynamical systems perspective the possibility that those
fields are coupled among them by considering an exponential potential with an
interesting functional dependence similar but not identical to others studied
before. The model we consider represents a counterexample to the typical
behavior of quintom models with exponential potentials because it admits either
tracking attractors ($w=0$), or phantom attractors ($w<-1$).

L(IR) in the samples considered extends from ~1e10 to >1e12 Lsun, with a mean
of 2e11 Lsun. Using 24 micron observations to infer dust extinction in high

the Pop III stars could initially have prevented the pre-Galactic halo from
cooling, which thereby delayed the collapse and inhibited further star
formation. During this period, however, the nucleosynthesis products of the
first supernovae (SNe) had time to mix with the halo gas. As a result, the

the kinematics and spatial distribution of the very hot plasma around O stars.
In this paper we apply several analysis techniques to the emission lines in the
Chandra HETGS spectrum of the late-O supergiant zeta Ori (O9.7 Ib), including
the fitting of a simple line-profile model. We show that there is distinct
evidence for blue shifts and profile asymmetry, as well as broadening in the
X-ray emission lines of zeta Ori. These are the observational hallmarks of a
wind-shock X-ray source, and the results for zeta Ori are very similar to those
for the earlier O star, zeta Pup, which we have previously shown to be well-fit
by the same wind-shock line-profile model. The more subtle effects on the
line-profile morphologies in zeta Ori, as compared to zeta Pup, are consistent
with the somewhat lower density wind in this later O supergiant. In both stars,
the wind optical depths required to explain the mildly asymmetric X-ray line
profiles imply reductions in the effective opacity of nearly an order of
magnitude, which may be explained by some combination of mass-loss rate
reduction and large-scale clumping, with its associated porosity-based effects
on radiation transfer. In the context of the recent reanalysis of the
helium-like line intensity ratios in both zeta Ori and zeta Pup, and also in
light of recent work questioning the published mass-loss rates in OB stars,
these new results indicate that the X-ray emission from zeta Ori can be
understood within the framework of the standard wind-shock scenario for hot
stars.

seen to be well-correlated with HI filaments that pervade the galactic disks,
suggesting that they form from pre-existing HI structures. Virial estimates of
the ratio of CO line strength to H2 column density, XCO, suggests that a value
of 4 x 10^20 cm^-2 (K km/s)^-1 is a good value to use in most galaxies (except
the SMC) if the GMCs are virialized. However, if the clouds are only marginally
self-gravitating, as appears to be the case judging from their appearance, half
the virial value may be more appropriate. There is no clear trend of XCO with
metallicity. The clouds within a galaxy are shown to have the about the same H2
surface density and differences between galaxies seem to be no more than a
factor of ~2. We show that hydrostatic pressure appears to be the main factor
in determining what fraction of atomic gas is turned into molecules. In the
high-pressure regions often found in galactic centers, the observed properties
of GMCs appear to be different from those in the found in the Local Group. From
the association of tracers of star formation with GMCs in the LMC, we find that
about 1/4 of the GMCs exhibit no evidence of star formation and we estimate
that the lifetime of a typical GMC in these galaxies is 20--30 Myr.

very sensitive to stellar abundances. Their measurement in Lyman-break galaxies
is compromised by the strong interstellar absorption features, allowing in some
cases only upper limits. The derived C and N abundances in the LBGs are no
higher than half solar (scaled to oxygen abundance for comparison with
emission-line analyses), independent of the strength of Lyman alpha emission. P
V absorption indicates abundances as low as 0.1 solar, with an upper limit near
0.4 solar in the reddest and weakest-emission galaxies. Unresolved interstellar
absorption components would further lower the derived abundances. Trends of
line strength, and derived abundances, are stronger with mid-UV luminosity than
with Lyman-alpha strength. H2 absorption in the Lyman and Werner bands is very
weak in the LBGs. Template H2 absorption spectra convolved to appropriate

this constraint, and a variety of SSP models, we determine a photometric mass
of M_{GC}=(3.0+-0.5)*10^7, somewhat depending on the SSP models used, the
metallicity and age adopted and the IMF representation. This mass, and its
relatively small uncertainties, make this object the most massive star cluster
of any age in the Local Group. Assuming that the photometric mass estimate thus
derived is fairly close to its dynamical mass, we predict that this GC has a
(one-dimensional) velocity dispersion of order (72+-13)km/s. As a surviving
""super"" star cluster, this object is of prime importance for theories aimed at
describing massive star cluster evolution.

young pulsars, MSPs emit a relativistic wind, which interacting with the
interstellar medium and/or a binary companion can significantly contribute to
the non-pulsed emission of these pulsars. An application and extension of a
simple model developed for young pulsars is applied to the old recycled MSP
B1957+20. It is found that the pulsar wind can, indeed, contribute to both the
resolved and unresolved X-ray emission. For other MSP in the Galactic field
where the spectral index of the non-pulsed component has been measured (i.e.,
PSR B1937+21, J0218+4232) the contribution of the pulsar wind to the non-pulsed
X-ray luminosity is estimated. For the MSPs in the core regions of globular
clusters, the pulsar wind nebula is likely affected by its interaction with the
dense stellar environment, possibly leading to a diminished contribution to the
total X-ray emission. In this case, the existence of non-thermal non-pulsed
X-ray emission is more likely for binary rather than isolated MSPs with the
emission arising from the interaction of the relativistic pulsar wind with a
binary companion. Our study suggests that the magnetization parameter in the
pulsar wind nebulae of MSPs is significantly larger than that of the Crab
nebula by about a factor of 10. The emission from MSPs moving at high
velocities may appear spatially extended with a tail-like morphology, which may
contribute to the faint filamentary X-ray source subpopulation in the Galaxy.

suggest a simple inside-out growth scenario for larger LCBGs with a disk-like

Except for a ~16 kpc shift of the X-ray center of the R=45-60 kpc annulus,
A2589 possesses a remarkably symmetrical X-ray image and is therefore an
exceptional candidate for precision studies of its mass profile by applying
hydrostatic equilibrium. The total gravitating matter profile is well described
by the NFW model (fractional residuals <~10%) with c_vir=6.1 +/- 0.3 and M_vir
= 3.3 +/- 0.3 x 10^{14} M_sun (r_vir = 1.74 +/- 0.05 Mpc) in excellent
agreement with LCDM. When the mass of the hot ICM is subtracted from the
gravitating matter profile, the NFW model fitted to the resulting dark matter
(DM) profile produces essentially the same result. However, if a component
accounting for the stellar mass (M_*) of the cD galaxy is included, then the
NFW fit to the DM profile is substantially degraded in the central r ~50 kpc
for reasonable M_*/L_V. Modifying the NFW DM halo by adiabatic contraction
arising from the early condensation of stellar baryons in the cD galaxy further
degrades the fit. The fit is improved substantially with a Sersic-like model
recently suggested by high resolution N-body simulations but with an inverse
Sersic index, alpha ~0.5, a factor of ~3 higher than predicted. We argue that
neither random turbulent motions nor magnetic fields can provide sufficient
non-thermal pressure support to reconcile the XMM mass profile with adiabatic
contraction of a CDM halo assuming reasonable M_*/L_V. Our results support the
scenario where, at least for galaxy clusters, processes during halo formation
counteract adiabatic contraction so that the total gravitating mass in the core
approximately follows the NFW profile.

Subaru Deep Field. A photometric sample of 89 LAE candidates is constructed
from narrow-band (NB816) data down to NB816 = 26.0 (AB) in a continuous 725
arcmin^2 area. Spectra of 39 objects satisfying the photometric selection
criteria for LAEs were obtained with Subaru and Keck II Telescopes, among which
28 were confirmed LAEs, one was a nearby galaxy, and eight were unclassified.
We also obtained spectra of another 24 NB816-excess objects in the field,
identifying six additional LAEs. We find that the Ly Alpha luminosity function
derived from the photometric sample is reproduced well by a Schechter function
with L* = (7.9+3.0-2.2) x 10^42 erg/s and phi* = (6.3+3.0-2.0) x 10^-4 Mpc^-3
for alpha = -1.5 (fixed) over the whole luminosity range of L ~= 3x10^42 -

the confirmed LAEs, to find that the median among the 28 objects satisfying the
photometric selection criteria is W_0^i = 233 A. We infer that 30% - 40% of
LAEs at z=5.7 exceed W_0^i = 240 A. These large-EW objects probably cannot be
accounted for by ordinary star-forming populations with a Salpeter IMF. We also
find that LAEs with fainter far-UV luminosities have larger EWs. Finally, we
derive the far-UV luminosity function of LAEs down to M_UV ~= -19.6 using the
photometric sample, and compare it with that of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs). We
find that as high as about 80% of LBGs at z ~ 6 have W_0^i >= 100 A, in sharp

concerning the aggregation of dust in protoplanetary disks, as the initial step
toward planet formation. Small particles easily stick when they collide and
form aggregates with an open, often fractal structure, depending on the growth
process. Larger particles are still expected to grow at collision velocities of
about 1m/s. Experiments also show that, after an intermezzo of destructive
velocities, high collision velocities above 10m/s on porous materials again
lead to net growth of the target. Considerations of dust-gas interactions show
that collision velocities for particles not too different in surface-to-mass
ratio remain limited up to sizes about 1m, and growth seems to be guaranteed to
reach these sizes quickly and easily. For meter sizes, coupling to nebula
turbulence makes destructive processes more likely. Global aggregation models
show that in a turbulent nebula, small particles are swept up too fast to be
consistent with observations of disks. An extended phase may therefore exist in
the nebula during which the small particle component is kept alive through
collisions driven by turbulence which frustrates growth to planetesimals until
conditions are more favorable for one or more reasons.

comparison, we also obtained similar spectra of 35 diskless objects. The
results show that emission in these lines is only seen in stars with disks, and
can be used as an indicator of accretion. However, the converse does not hold,

solutions of mean-field equations for the local magnetizations. Two different
equations are studied: the TAP equations which are exact for the SK model, and
the simpler `naive-mean-field' (NMF) equations. The free-energy landscapes that
emerge are very different. For the TAP equations, the numerical studies confirm
the analytical results of Aspelmeier et al., which predict that TAP states
consist of close pairs of minima and index-one (one unstable direction) saddle
points, while for the NMF equations saddle points with large indices are found.
For TAP the barrier height between a minimum and its nearby saddle point scales
as (f-f_0)^{-1/3} where f is the free energy per spin of the solution and f_0
is the equilibrium free energy per spin. This means that for `pure states', for
which f-f_0 is of order 1/N, the barriers scale as N^{1/3}, but between states
for which f-f_0 is of order one the barriers are finite and also small so such
metastable states will be of limited physical significance. For the NMF
equations there are saddles of index K and we can demonstrate that their
complexity Sigma_K scales as a function of K/N. We have also employed an
iterative scheme with a free parameter that can be adjusted to bring the system
of equations close to the `edge of chaos'. Both for the TAP and NME equations
it is possible with this approach to find metastable states whose free energy
per spin is close to f_0. As N increases, it becomes harder and harder to find
solutions near the edge of chaos, but nevertheless the results which can be
obtained are competitive with those achieved by more time-consuming computing
methods and suggest that this method may be of general utility.

constructed by including the effect of a crystalline electric field (CEF)

we collect all the terms up to the first order of $1/\lambda$. Solving the
effective model, we show the results of the CEF states for each case of

exponent $\phi+1/2$, where $\phi >0$. This generalizes previous studies
performed only with $\phi=0$ (with a truncation at an integral scale), by
showing that multifractality holds over a remarkably large range of
dimensionless scales for $\phi>0$. The intermittency multifractal coefficient
can be tuned continuously as a function of the deviation $\phi$ from 1/2 and of
another parameter $\sigma^2$ embodying information on the short-range amplitude
of the memory kernel, the ultra-violet cut-off (``viscous'') scale and the
variance of the white-noise innovations. In these processes, both a viscous
scale and an integral scale naturally appear, bracketing the ``inertial''
scaling regime. We exhibit a surprisingly good collapse of the multifractal
spectra $\zeta(q)$ on a universal scaling function, which enables us to derive
high-order multifractal exponents from the small-order values and also obtain a
given multifractal spectrum $\zeta(q)$ by different combinations of $\phi$ and
$\sigma^2$.

single coherent system as a whole rather than a weakly-coupled set of two
independent systems, which makes conventional tunnelling theories inapplicable.
In this paper, we develop a theory of interlayer tunnelling in coherent exciton
condensates of bilayer quantum Hall systems at total filling factor $\nu_T=1$.
One of the most important consequences of our theory is that the zero-bias
interlayer tunnelling conductance peak is strongly enhanced, but fundamentally
finite even at zero temperature. We explicitly compute the height of the
conductance peak as a function of interlayer distance, which is compared with
experiment. It is emphasized that the interlayer distance dependence of the
conductance peak is one of the key properties distinguishing between the
spontaneous coherence due to many-body effects of the Coulomb interaction and
the induced coherence due to the single-particle tunnelling gap. It is also
emphasized that, though the strongly enhanced tunnelling conductance originates
from the interlayer phase coherence, it is not the usual Josephson effect. We
propose an experimental setup for the true Josephson effect in couterflowing
current measurements for a coupled set of two bilayer quantum Hall systems,
which is a more precise analogy with the real Josephson effect in
superconductivity.

the crucial physical feature which determines the magnitude of the terminal
recoil is the presence of a ``burst'' of linear momentum flux emitted slightly
before coalescence. When using the most natural expression for the linear
momentum flux during the plunge, together with a Taylor-expanded $(v/c)^4$
correction factor, we find that the maximum value of the terminal recoil is
$\sim 74$ km/s and occurs for a mass ratio $m_2/m_1 \simeq 0.38$. We comment,
however, on the fact that the above `best bet estimate' is subject to strong
uncertainties because the location and amplitude of the crucial peak of linear
momentum flux happens at a moment during the plunge where most of the
simplifying analytical assumptions underlying the Effective One Body approach
are no longer justified. Changing the analytical way of estimating the linear
momentum flux, we find maximum recoils that range between 49 and 172 km/s.

particulate matter could influence the topological properties of space time.
The theory is developed in terms of vector and matrix equations of exterior
differential forms. The topological features and the dynamics of such exterior
differential systems are studied with respect to processes of continuous
topological evolution. The theory starts from the sole postulate that field
properties of a Physical Vacuum (a continuum) can be defined in terms of a
vector space domain, of maximal rank, infinitesimal neighborhoods, that
supports a Basis Frame as a 4 x 4 matrix of C2 functions with non-zero
determinant. The basis vectors of such Basis Frames exhibit differential
closure. The particle properties of the Physical Vacuum are defined in terms of
topological defects (or compliments) of the field vector space defined by those
points where the maximal rank, or non-zero determinant, condition fails. The
topological universality of a Basis Frame over infinitesimal neighborhoods can
be refined by particular choices of a subgroup structure of the Basis Frame,
[B]. It is remarkable that from such a universal definition of a Physical
Vacuum, specializations permit the deduction of the field structures of all
four forces, from gravity fields to Yang Mills fields, and associate the origin
of topological charge and topological spin to the Affine torsion coefficients
of the induced Cartan Connection matrix [C] of 1-forms.

serve as a basis for the Lagrangian. All physical observables of the model must
therefore be basis-independent. For example, tan(beta)=<Phi_2^0>/<Phi_1^0> is
basis-dependent and thus cannot be a physical parameter of the model. In this
paper, we provide a basis-independent treatment of the Higgs sector with
particular attention to the neutral Higgs boson mass-eigenstates, which
generically are not eigenstates of CP. We then demonstrate that all physical
Higgs couplings are indeed independent of tan(beta). In specialized versions of
the 2HDM, tan(beta) can be promoted to a physical parameter of the
Higgs-fermion interactions. In the most general 2HDM, the Higgs-fermion

an explanation of the observed fermion masses and mixings, we discuss an
extension of the standard model (SM) where the flavor structure for both quarks
and leptons is determined by a spontaneously broken S4 and the requirement that
its particle content is embeddable simultaneously into the conventional SO(10)
grand unified theory (GUT) and a continuous flavor symmetry G_f like SO(3)_f or
SU(3)_f. We explicitly provide the Yukawa and the Higgs sector of the model and
show its viability in two numerical examples which arise as small deviations
from rank one matrices. In the first case, the corresponding mass matrix is
democratic and in the second one only its 2-3 block is non-vanishing. We
demonstrate that the Higgs potential allows for the appropriate vacuum
expectation value (VEV) configurations in both cases, if CP is conserved. For
the first case, the chosen Yukawa couplings can be made natural by invoking an
auxiliary Z2 symmetry. The numerical study we perform shows that the best-fit
values for the lepton mixing angles theta_12 and theta_23 can be accommodated
for normal neutrino mass hierarchy. The results for the quark mixing angles
turn out to be too small. Furthermore the CP-violating phase delta can only be
reproduced correctly in one of the examples. The small mixing angle values are
likely to be brought into the experimentally allowed ranges by including
radiative corrections. Interestingly, due to the S4 symmetry the mass matrix of
the right-handed neutrinos is proportional to the unit matrix.

progress in extracting phenomenological predictions from string theory -- such

of the cosmological constant, and so forth -- can be achieved through
statistical studies of these vacua. To date, most of the efforts in these
directions have focused on Type I vacua. In this note, we present the first
results of a statistical study of the heterotic landscape, focusing on more
than 10^5 explicit non-supersymmetric tachyon-free heterotic string vacua and
their associated gauge groups and one-loop cosmological constants. Although
this study has several important limitations, we find a number of intriguing
features which may be relevant for the heterotic landscape as a whole. These
features include different probabilities and correlations for different
possible gauge groups as functions of the number of orbifold twists. We also
find a vast degeneracy amongst non-supersymmetric string models, leading to a
severe reduction in the number of realizable values of the cosmological
constant as compared with naive expectations. Finally, we also find strong
correlations between cosmological constants and gauge groups which suggest that
heterotic string models with extremely small cosmological constants are
overwhelmingly more likely to exhibit the Standard-Model gauge group at the
string scale than any of its grand-unified extensions. In all cases, heterotic
worldsheet symmetries such as modular invariance provide important constraints
that do not appear in corresponding studies of Type I vacua.

Double-Step Parallel Gap (DSPG) multipliers and THick Gas Electron Multipliers

CO2+TEA, though with different emission spectra. We observed the characteristic
wave-length emission of N2 and of TEA and used a polymer wave-length shifter to

extending previous work by Chou and Lakatos, we find that the location and

single slow codon with the system boundary. We focus in detail on ribosome
density profiles and provide a simple explanation for the length scale which

  auditory cortex: MEG evidence","47 pages, 8 figures",,,,"q-bio.NC",,"  A natural sound can be described by dynamic changes in envelope (amplitude)
and carrier (frequency), corresponding to amplitude modulation (AM) and
frequency modulation (FM) respectively. Although the neural responses to both
AM and FM sounds are extensively studied in both animals and humans, it is
uncertain how they are co-represented when changed simultaneously but
independently, as is typical for ecologically natural signals. This study
elucidates the neural coding of such sounds in human auditory cortex using
magnetoencephalography (MEG). Using stimuli with both sinusoidal modulated
envelope (f_{AM}, 37 Hz) and carrier frequency (f_{FM}, 0.3 - 8 Hz), it is
demonstrated that AM and FM stimulus dynamics are co-represented in the neural
code of human auditory cortex. The stimulus AM dynamics are represented
neurally with AM encoding, by the auditory Steady State Response (aSSR) at
f_{AM}. For sounds with slowly changing carrier frequency ((f_{FM} < 5 Hz), it
is shown that the stimulus FM dynamics are tracked by the phase of the aSSR,
demonstrating neural phase modulation (PM) encoding of the stimulus carrier
frequency. For sounds with faster carrier frequency change ((f_{FM} >= 5 Hz),
it is shown that modulation encoding of stimulus FM dynamics persists, but the
neural encoding is no longer purely PM. This result is consistent with the
recruitment of additional neural AM encoding over and above the original neural
PM encoding, indicating that both the amplitude and phase of the aSSR at f_{AM}
track the stimulus FM dynamics. A neural model is suggested to account for
these observations.

single dominant quasispecies, unless the mutation rate is too high, in which
case the populations of different genotypes becomes de-localized. We introduce
a more macroscopic picture of genotypic evolution wherein a random replication

state $\rho$ by invoking a sufficiently large subset of all possible
entanglement witnesses given the expected value of each element of a set of
mutually orthogonal observables. We review the concept of an entanglement
witness from the geometrical point of view and use this geometry to show that
the set of separable states is not a polytope and to characterize the class of
entanglement witnesses (observables) that detect entangled states on opposite
sides of the set of separable states. All this serves to motivate a classical
algorithm which, given the expected values of a subset of an orthogonal basis
of observables of an otherwise unknown quantum state, searches for an
entanglement witness in the span of the subset of observables. The idea of such
an algorithm, which is an efficient reduction of the quantum separability
problem to a global optimization problem, was introduced in PRA 70 060303(R),
where it was shown to be an improvement on the naive approach for the quantum
separability problem (exhaustive search for a decomposition of the given state
into a convex combination of separable states). The last section of the paper
discusses in more generality such algorithms, which, in our case, assume a
subroutine that computes the global maximum of a real function of several
variables. Despite this, we anticipate that such algorithms will perform
sufficiently well on small instances that they will render a feasible test for
separability in some cases of interest (e.g. in 3-by-3 dimensional systems).
