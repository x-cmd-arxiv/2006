1E0102.2-7219 in the SMC. The FUSE observations cover three regions with
significantly different optical [O III] intensities, all associated with the
relatively bright part of the X-ray ring. Emission lines of O VI 1032, 1038 are
clearly detected in the FUSE spectra. By combining this O VI doublet emission
with the O VII triplet and O VIII Lyalpha fluxes from the XMM-Newton spectra
and assuming a non-equilibrium ionization model with a single ionization
timescale for the spectra, we are able to find a narrow range of temperatures
and ionization timescales that are consistent with the respective line ratios.
However, if we assume a plane-parallel shock model with a distribution of
ionization timescales, the O VI emission appears to be inconsistent with O VII
and O VIII in X-rays. We also analyze the total XMM-Newton EPIC-MOS 1/2 spectra
for the three regions. The X-ray spectra are dominated by strong emission lines
of O, Ne, and Mg, however, we detect an emission component that accounts for 14
- 25% of the flux and can be attributed to shocked ISM. We find that there is
no consistent set of values for the temperature and ionization timescale which
can explain the observed line ratios for O, Ne, and Mg. This would be
consistent with a structured distribution of the ejecta as the O, Ne, Mg would
have interacted with the reverse shock at different times.

carry information from remote sites in space and time. This information can be

material that, unlike traditional cryptographic keys, is (1) not reproducible
precisely and (2) not distributed uniformly. We propose two primitives: a
""fuzzy extractor"" reliably extracts nearly uniform randomness R from its input;
the extraction is error-tolerant in the sense that R will be the same even if
the input changes, as long as it remains reasonably close to the original.
Thus, R can be used as a key in a cryptographic application. A ""secure sketch""
produces public information about its input w that does not reveal w, and yet
allows exact recovery of w given another value that is close to w. Thus, it can
be used to reliably reproduce error-prone biometric inputs without incurring
the security risk inherent in storing them.
  We define the primitives to be both formally secure and versatile,
generalizing much prior work. In addition, we provide nearly optimal
constructions of both primitives for various measures of ``closeness'' of input
data, such as Hamming distance, edit distance, and set difference.

  Florida, Jan. 2006",,,,"cs.CC",,"  We consider the tile self-assembly model and how tile complexity can be
eliminated by permitting the temperature of the self-assembly system to be
adjusted throughout the assembly process. To do this, we propose novel
techniques for designing tile sets that permit an arbitrary length $m$ binary
number to be encoded into a sequence of $O(m)$ temperature changes such that
the tile set uniquely assembles a supertile that precisely encodes the
corresponding binary number. As an application, we show how this provides a
general tile set of size O(1) that is capable of uniquely assembling
essentially any $n\times n$ square, where the assembled square is determined by
a temperature sequence of length $O(\log n)$ that encodes a binary description
of $n$. This yields an important decrease in tile complexity from the required
$\Omega(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n})$ for almost all $n$ when the temperature of
the system is fixed. We further show that for almost all $n$, no tile system
can simultaneously achieve both $o(\log n)$ temperature complexity and
$o(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n})$ tile complexity, showing that both versions of
an optimal square building scheme have been discovered. This work suggests that
temperature change can constitute a natural, dynamic method for providing input
to self-assembly systems that is potentially superior to the current technique
of designing large tile sets with specific inputs hardwired into the tileset.

weighted structures and take into account not only the shortest, but also all
other connections, which is desirable in many applications. To apply these
proximity measures to unweighted structures, every edge should be assigned the
same weight which determines the proportion of taking account of two routes,
from which one is one edge longer than the other. Among the proximity measures
we consider path accessibility, route accessibility, relative forest
accessibility along with its components, accessibility via dense forests, and
connection reliability. A number of characteristic conditions is introduced and
employed to characterize the proximity measures. A topological interpretation
is obtained for the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of the Laplacian matrix

rotation of galaxies to it. Using Lagrangian Mechanics we then can find the
equations governing the rotation of a galaxy. We find in this way the azimuthal
equation, and we find its first integral. Then we derive from it the law of
differrential rotation of galaxies, and we plot it. We also present the
resulting flat rotation curve, which is found to resemble remarkably the
observed rotation curves.

  quant-ph/0611216, quant-ph/0611217",,,,"quant-ph math-ph math.MP",,"  By splitting a Hamiltonian into two parts, using the solvability of
eigenvalue problem of one part of the Hamiltonian, proving a useful identity
and deducing an expansion formula of power of operator binomials, we obtain an
explicit and general form of time evolution operator in the representation of
solvable part of the Hamiltonian. Further we find out an exact solution of
Schr\""{o}dinger equation in a general time-independent quantum system, and
write down its concrete form when the solvable part of this Hamiltonian is
taken as the kinetic energy term. Comparing our exact solution with the usual
perturbation theory makes some features and significance of our solution clear.
Moreover, through deriving out the improved forms of the zeroth, first, second
and third order perturbed solutions including the partial contributions from
the higher order even all order approximations, we obtain the improved
transition probability. In special, we propose the revised Fermi's golden rule.
Then we apply our scheme to obtain the improved forms of perturbed energy and
perturbed state. In addition, we study an easy understanding example to
illustrate our scheme and show its advantage. All of this implies the physical
reasons and evidences why our exact solution and perturbative scheme are
formally explicit, actually calculable, operationally efficient, conclusively
more accurate. Therefore our exact solution and perturbative scheme can be
thought of theoretical developments of quantum dynamics. Further applications
of our results in quantum theory can be expected.

"quant-ph/0602056","Takayuki Miyadera","Takayuki Miyadera","Entangled Markov Chains generated by Symmetric Channels",,"Infinite Dimensional Analysis, Quantum Probability and Related
  Topics,, Vol. 8, No. 3 (2005) 497-504",,,"quant-ph",,"  A notion of entangled Markov chain was introduced by Accardi and Fidaleo in
the context of quantum random walk. They proved that, in the finite dimensional
case, the corresponding states have vanishing entropy density, but they did not
prove that they are entangled.
  In the present note this entropy result is extended to the infinite
dimensional case under the assumption of finite speed of hopping. Then the
entanglement problem is discussed for spin 1/2, entangled Markov chains
generated by a binary symmetric channel with hopping probability $1-q$. The von
Neumann entropy of these states, restricted on a sublattice is explicitly
calculated and shown to be independent of the size of the sublattice. This is a
new, purely quantum, phenomenon.
  Finally the entanglement property between the sublattices ${\cal
A}(\{0,1,...,N\})$ and ${\cal A}(\{N+1\})$ is investigated using the PPT
criterium. It turns out that, for $q\neq 0,1,{1/2}$ the states are non
separable, thus truly entangled, while for $q=0,1,{1/2}$, they are separable.

  Merging many-body perturbation theory with QED",,,"10.1103/PhysRevA.73.062502",,"quant-ph",,"  A formalism for energy-dependent many-body perturbation theory (MBPT),
previously indicated in our recent review articles (Lindgren et al., Phys.Rep.
389,161(2004), Can.J.Phys. 83,183(2005)), is developed in more detail. The
formalism allows for a mixture of energy-dependent (retarded) and
energy-independent (instantaneous) interactions and hence for a merger of QED
and standard (relativistic) MBPT. This combination is particularly important
for light elements, such as light heliumlike ions, where electron correlation
is pronounced. It can also be quite significant in the medium-heavy mass range,
as recently discussed by Fritzsche et al. (J.Phys. B38,S707(2005)), with the
consequence that the effects might be significant also in analyzing the data of
experiments with highly charged ions. A numerical procedure for treating the
combined effect is described, and some preliminary numerical results are given
for heliumlike ions. This represent the first numerical evaluation of effects
beyond two-photon exchange involving a retarded interaction. It is found that
for heliumlike neon the effect of one retarded photon (with Coulomb
interactions of all orders) represents about 99% of the non-radiative effects
beyond energy-independent MBPT.
