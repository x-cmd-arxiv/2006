merging galaxies containing central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and having
a spatial resolution of only a few parsecs. Strong gas inflows associated with
equal-mass mergers produce non-axisymmetric nuclear disks with masses of order
$10^9 M_{\odot}$, resolved by about $10^6$ SPH particles. Such disks have sizes
of several hundred parsecs but most of their mass is concentrated within less
than $50$ pc. We find that a close SMBH pair forms after the merger. The
separation of the two SMBHs then shrinks further owing to dynamical friction
against the predominantly gaseous background. The orbits of the SMBHs decay
down to the minimum resolvable scale in a few million years for an ambient gas
temperature and density typical of a region undergoing a starburst. These
results suggest the initial conditions necessary for the eventual coalescence
of the two holes arise naturally from the merging of two equal-mass galaxies
whose structure and orbits are consistent with the predictions of the
$\Lambda$CDM model. Our findings have important implications for planned
gravitational wave detection experiments such as {\it LISA}.

shallower sampling. All 72 clusters in a well-defined sample limited by
redshift (ensuring good sampling) and X-ray flux (excluding superpositions)
show infall patterns sufficient to apply the caustic technique. This sample is
by far the largest sample of cluster mass profiles extending to large radii to

observations than in simulations. Further work is needed to determine the
source of this difference. We use the infall patterns to compute mass profiles

using caustic masses agree well with those using X-ray or virial mass

conclusion of CAIRNS that cluster infall regions are well fit by NFW and
Hernquist profiles and poorly fit by singular isothermal spheres. This much

that the bolometric temperature is not always a reliable measure of the

emission lines seen in Chandra spectra of early-type supergiant stars could be
explained by a possibly porous nature of their spatially structured stellar
winds. Such porosity could effectively reduce the bound-free absorption of
X-rays emitted by embedded wind shocks, and thus allow a more similar
transmission of red- vs. blue-shifted emission from the back vs. front
hemispheres. For a medium consisting of clumps of size l and volume filling
factor f, in which the `porosity length' h=l/f increases with local radius as h
= h' r, we find that a substantial reduction in wind absorption requires a
quite large porosity scale factor h' > 1, implying large porosity lengths h >
r. The associated wind structure must thus have either a relatively large scale
l~ r, or a small volume filling factor f ~ l/r << 1, or some combination of
these. The relatively small-scale, moderate compressions generated by intrinsic
instabilities in line-driving seem unlikely to give such large porosity
lengths, leaving again the prospect of instead having to invoke a substantial

ejected in the explosion when it was heated to a mildly relativistic
temperature at a distance from the center of explosion of order the
deceleration radius. Both of these bursts exhibit rapidly declining early X-ray
afterglow lightcurves; this emission is from the same source that produced the

makes no assumption about any particular model for gamma-ray generation except
that the basic radiation mechanism is some combination of synchrotron and
inverse-Compton processes in a relativistic outflow. For GRB 050219A we can
rule out the possibility that energy from the explosion is carried outward by
magnetic fields, and that the dissipation of this field produced the

forming regions. We find that more actively star forming galaxies show higher
dust opacities, in line with previous results. We find that the local
star-forming galaxies have lower F(205um)/F(UV) ratio, by two-three orders of
magnitude than the submillimeter-selected galaxies, and may have similar or
somewhat higher F(205um)/F(UV) than Lyman Break Galaxies. The F(205um)/F(UV)

that the products of the caustic-crossing timescale, $\Delta t$, and the cosine
of the caustic incidence angle of the source trajectory, $\kappa$, of the
individual caustic crossings are different for events involving an elliptical
source, while the products are the same for events associated with a circular
source. The product $\Delta t_\perp =\Delta t \cos\kappa$ corresponds to the
caustic-crossing timescale when the incidence angle of the source trajectory is
$\kappa=0$. For the unique determination of the source ellipticity, resolutions
of at least three caustic crossings are required. Although this requirement is
difficult to achieve under the current observational setup based on
alert/follow-up mode, it will be possible with the advent of future lensing
experiments that will survey wide fields continuously at high cadence. For
typical Galactic bulge events, the difference in $\Delta t_\perp$ between
caustic crossings is of the order of minutes depending on the source
orientations and ellipticities. Considering the monitoring frequency of the
future lensing surveys of $\sim 6$ times/hr and the improved photometry

symmetric compression wave into the core. The rapid increase in external
pressure could arise because the core has recently been assimilated by the
Coalsack cloud complex, or because the Coalsack has recently been created by
two large-scale converging flows. The resulting compression wave has not yet
converged on the centre of the core, so there is a central rarefaction. The
compression wave has increased the density in the swept-up gas by about a
factor of ten, and accelerated it inwards to speeds of order $0.4 {\rm km} {\rm
s}^{-1}$. It is shown that even small levels of initial turbulence destroy the
ring seen in projection almost completely. In the scenario of strong external
compression that we are proposing this implies that the initial turbulent
energy in this globule is such that $E_{{\rm turb}} / E_{{\rm grav}} \le 2 %$.
Protostar formation should occur in about $40,000 {\rm years}$.

amorphous ferro-magnesian silicate, of olivine composition, following thermal
annealing under vacuum. Annealing under vacuum was performed at temperatures
ranging from 870 to 1020 K. After annealing spheroidal metallic nano-particles
(2-50 nm) are found within the silicate films. We interpret this microstructure
in terms of a reduction of the initial amorphous silicate FeO component,
because of the carbon-rich partial pressure in the furnace due to pumping
mechanism. Annealing in a controlled oxygen-rich atmosphere confirms this
interpretation. The observed microstructures closely resemble those of the GEMS
(Glass with Embedded Metal and Sulphides) found in chondritic IDPs
(Interplanetary Dust Particles). Since IDPs contain abundant carbonaceous
matter, a solid-state reduction reaction may have occurred during heating in
the hot inner regions of the proto-solar disc. Related to this, the presence of

including new optical spectroscopy plus a deep Very Large Array (VLA) radio
continuum observation. These are combined with optical imaging from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to assess the activity and properties of member
galaxies. Prior X-ray studies have suggested A2111 is a head-on cluster merger,
a dynamical state which might be connected to the high level of activity
inferred from its blue fraction. We are able to directly assess this claim,
using our spectroscopic data to identify 95 cluster members among 196 total
galaxy spectra. These galaxy velocities do not themselves provide significant
evidence for the merger interpretation, however they are consistent with it
provided the system is viewed near the time of core passage and at a viewing
angle >~30 degrees different from the merger axis. The SDSS data allow us to
confirm the high blue fraction for A2111, f_b = 0.15 +/- 0.03 based on
photometry alone and f_b = 0.23 +/- 0.03 using spectroscopic data to remove
background galaxies. We are able to detect 175 optical sources from the SDSS in
our VLA radio data, of which 35 have redshift information. We use the SDSS
photometry to determine photometric redshifts for the remaining 140
radio-optical sources. In total we identify up to 26 cluster radio galaxies, 14
of which have spectroscopic redshifts. The optical spectroscopy and radio data
reveal a substantial population of dusty starbursts within the cluster. The
high blue fraction and prevalence of star formation is consistent with the
hypothesis that dynamically-active clusters are associated with more active
member galaxies than relaxed clusters.

calculated exactly for small systems, allowing the atoms to occupy several
Landau levels. Two vortex-like states and two strongly correlated states (the
Pfaffian and Laughlin) are considered in detail. In particular, their critical
rotation frequencies and energy gaps are determined as a function of particle
number, interaction strength, and the number of Landau levels occupied (up to
three). For the vortex-like states, the Lowest Landau level (LLL) approximation
is justified only if the interaction strength decreases with the number of
particles; nevertheless, the constant of proportionality increases rapidly with
the angular momentum per particle. For the strongly correlated states, however,
the interaction strength can increase with particle number without violating
the LLL condition. The results suggest that in large systems, the Pfaffian and
Laughlin states might be stabilized at rotation frequencies below the
centrifugal limit for sufficiently large interaction strengths, with energy
gaps a significant fraction of the trap energy.

mapping from an excited-state density to the external potential. This is the
excited-state counterpart of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, where instead of the
ground-state density the density of the excited-state gives the true many-body

define states on spacelike surfaces and their unitary evolution between them.
Quantum theory has changed as our conceptions of space and time have evolved.
But quantum mechanics needs to be generalized further for quantum gravity where
spacetime geometry is fluctuating and without definite value. This paper
reviews a fully four-dimensional, sum-over-histories, generalized quantum
mechanics of cosmological spacetime geometry. This generalization is
constructed within the framework of generalized quantum theory. This is a
minimal set of principles for quantum theory abstracted from the modern quantum
mechanics of closed systems, most generally the universe. In this
generalization, states of fields on spacelike surfaces and their unitary
evolution are emergent properties appropriate when spacetime geometry behaves
approximately classically. The principles of generalized quantum theory allow
for the further generalization that would be necessary were spacetime not
fundamental. Emergent spacetime phenomena are discussed in general and
illustrated with the example of the classical spacetime geometries with large
spacelike surfaces that emerge from the `no-boundary' wave function of the
universe. These must be Lorentzian with one, and only one, time direction. The
essay concludes by raising the question of whether quantum mechanics itself is
emergent.

representative mass distributions, or templates, are constructed from simulated

baryon density sectors, which are exponentially suppressed with increasing
volume. The Polyakov loop shows a different behaviour: for all temperatures and
volumes, its expectation value is exactly zero in the canonical formulation,
whereas it is always non-zero in the commonly used grand-canonical formulation.

supernova core, neutrino flavor evolution is affected by coherent
neutrino-neutrino scattering. It has been recently suggested that many-particle
quantum entanglement effects may play an essential role in these systems,
potentially invalidating the traditional description in terms of a set of
single-particle evolution equations. We model the neutrino system by a system
of interacting spins, following an earlier work which showed that such a spin
system can in some cases be solved exactly. We extend this work by constructing
an exact analytical solution to a more general spin system, including initial
states with asymmetric spin distribution and, moreover, not necessarily aligned
along the same axis. Our solution exhibits a rich set of behaviors, including
coherent oscillations and dephasing and a transition from the classical to
quantum regimes. We argue that the classical evolution of the spin system
captures the entire coherent behavior of the neutrino system, while the quantum
effects in the spin system capture some, but not all, of the neutrino
incoherent evolution. By comparing the spin and neutrino systems, we find no
evidence for the violation of the accepted one-body description, though the
argument involves some subtleties not appreciated before. The analysis in this
paper may apply to other two-state systems beyond the neutrino field.

pi^0 pi^0 pi^0 decay data below threshold are used instead. For this decay,
there are very large theoretical uncertainties above threshold due to
cancellations and data above threshold cannot be used to get the scattering
lenghts. All the numbers we present are in the isospin limit apart of two-pion
phase space factors which are physical. We compare our results for the cusp
effect with Cabibbo and Isidori's results and discuss the differences and
agreements.

that is exactly supersymmetric (susy). It is expected that the nucleation rate
of critically sized susy bubbles will be enhanced in regions of high density
such as in degenerate stars. The consequent release of energy stored in Pauli
towers provides a possible model for gamma ray bursts. Whether or not all or
any of the currently observed bursts are due to this mechanism, it is important
to define the signatures of this susy phase transition. After such a burst, due
to the lifting of degeneracy pressure, the star would be expected to collapse
into a black hole even though its mass is below the Chandrasekhar limit.
Previous studies have treated the star as fully releasing its stored energy
before the collapse. In this article we make an initial investigation of the
effects of the collapse during the gamma ray emission.

probability intervals of the CMSSM parameters are: 0.52 TeV < m_{1/2} < 1.26
TeV, m_0 <2.10 TeV, -0.34 TeV < A_0 < 2.41 TeV and 38.5< tan(beta) <54.6.
Generally, large fractions of high probability ranges of the superpartner
masses will be probed at the LHC. We highlight a complementarity between LHC

further expose a number of correlations among the observables, in particular
between BR(B_s \to \mu^+ \mu^-) and BR({\bar B}\to X_s\gamma) or sigma_p^{SI}.
Once SUSY is discovered, this and other correlations may prove helpful in
distinguishing the CMSSM from other supersymmetric models. The robustness of
our results is investigated in terms of the assumed ranges of CMSSM parameters
and the effect of the (g-2)_mu anomaly which shows some tension with the other

emission angles in a narrow angular cone and a relatively concentrated outgoing

higher than in SM. However,these rates are still not observable for the near

loop induced FCNC decays $b^\prime\to bZ, bH, bg, b\gamma$, as well as
$t^\prime\to tZ,\tH, tg, t\gamma$. If $|V_{cb'}|$ is of order $|V_{cb}| \simeq
0.04$, tree level $b^\prime\to cW$ decay would dominate, posing a challenge
since $b$-tagging is less effective. For $|V_{cb'}| \ll |V_{cb}|$, $b'\to tW$
would tend to dominate, while $b'\to t^\prime W^*$ could also open for heavier
$b'$, leading to thepossibility of quadruple-$W$ signals via $b'\bar b'\to
b\bar b W^+W^-W^+W^-$. The FCNC $b'\to bZ, bH$ decays could still dominate if
$m_{b'}$ is just above 200 GeV. For the case of $t'$, ingeneral $t^\prime\to
bW$ would be dominant, hence it behaves like a heavy top. For both $b'$ and
$t'$, except for the intriguing light $b'$ case, FCNC decays are in the
$10^{-4} -10^{-2}$ range, and are quite detectable at the LHC.For a possible
future ILC, we find the associated production of FCNC $e^+e^-\to b\bar s$,
$t\bar c$ are below sensitivity, while $e^+e^-\to b^\prime\bar b$
and$t^\prime\bar t$ can be better probed.Tevatron Run-II can still probe the
lighter $b'$ or $t'$ scenario. LHC would either discover the fourth generation
and measure the FCNC rates, or rule out the fourth generation conclusively.

regulated by replacing p^+ integrals with discretized sums omitting the p^+=0
terms in each sum. We also employ a novel ultraviolet regulator that is
convenient for the light-cone worldsheet description of planar Feynman
diagrams. The helicity conserving scattering amplitudes are divergent in the
infra-red. The infrared divergences in the elastic one-loop amplitude are shown
to cancel, in their contribution to cross sections, against ones in the cross
section for unseen bremsstrahlung gluons. We include here the explicit
calculation of the latter, because it assumes an unfamiliar form due to the
peculiar way discretization of p^+ regulates infrared divergences. In resolving
the infrared divergences we employ a covariant definition of jets, which allows
a transparent demonstration of the Lorentz invariance of our final results.
Because we use an explicit cutoff of the ultraviolet divergences in exactly 4
space-time dimensions, we must introduce explicit counterterms to achieve this
final covariant result. These counter-terms are polynomials in the external
momenta of the precise order dictated by power-counting. We discuss the
modifications they entail for the light-cone worldsheet action that reproduces
the ``bare'' planar diagrams of the gluonic sector of QCD. The simplest way to
do this is to interpret the QCD string as moving in six space-time dimensions.

The set of equivalence classes forms the category of algorithms. Although the

trivial already the three dimensional case has a rich structure with
connections to Schnyder woods, planar graphs and 3-polytopes.
  Our objective is to detect more of the structure of orthogonal surfaces in

non-generic orthogonal surfaces have a polytopal structure.
  We study characteristic points and the cp-orders of orthogonal surfaces,
i.e., the dominance orders on the characteristic points. In the generic case
these orders are (almost) face lattices of polytopes. Examples show that in
general cp-orders can lack key properties of face lattices. We investigate
extra requirements which may help to have cp-orders which are face lattices.
  Finally, we turn the focus and ask for the realizability of polytopes on
orthogonal surfaces. There are criteria which prevent large classes of
simplicial polytopes from being realizable. On the other hand we identify some
families of polytopes which can be realized on orthogonal surfaces.

investigated. For the purely hydrodynamic case, it is known that large-scale
perturbations tend to the minima of a Ginzburg-Landau free-energy functional
with a double-well (fourth-order) potential. The dynamics of the relaxation
process is ruled by a one-dimensional Cahn--Hilliard equation that dictates the
hyperbolic tangent profiles of kink-antikink structures and their mutual
interactions. For the viscoelastic case, we found that the dynamics still
admits a formulation in terms of a Ginzburg--Landau free-energy functional. For
sufficiently small elasticities, the phenomenology is very similar to the
purely hydrodynamic case: the free-energy functional is still a fourth-order
potential and slightly perturbed kink-antikink structures hold. For
sufficiently large elasticities, a critical point sets in: the fourth-order
term changes sign and the next-order nonlinearity must be taken into account.
Despite the double-well structure of the potential, the one-dimensional nature
of the problem makes the dynamics sensitive to the details of the potential. We
analysed the interactions among these generalized kink-antikink structures,
demonstrating their role in a new, elastic instability. Finally, consequences
for the problem of polymer drag reduction are presented.

either irrelevant or incorrect. We first clarify what the security of a
physically secure layer means. The idealized Kirchoff-loop-Johnson-like-noise
(KLJN) scheme is totally secure therefore it is more secure than idealized
quantum communication schemes which can never be totally secure because of the
inherent noise processes in those communication schemes and the statistical
nature of eavesdropper detection based on error statistics. On the other hand,
with sufficient resources, a practical/non-ideal realization of the KLJN cipher
can arbitrarily approach the idealized limit and outperform even the idealized
quantum communicator schemes because the non-ideality-effects are determined
and controlled by the design. The cable resistance issue analyzed by Scheuer
and Yariv is a good example for that because the eavesdropper has insufficient
time window to build a sufficient statistics and the actual information leak
can be designed. We show that Scheuer's and Yariv's numerical result of 1%
voltage drop supports higher security than that of quantum communicators.
Moreover, choosing thicker or shorter wires can arbitrarily reduce this voltage
drop further; the same conclusion holds even according to the equations of
Scheuer and Yariv.

Particular emphasis is put on the buckling transition of the shells, that is a
strong preference of the shell shapes to 'buckle out' in spatial regions close
to the pentagonal disclinations for certain range of the elastic parameters of
the problem. The transition effectively increases the mean square aspherity of
shapes, making them look more like an icosahedron, rather than a sphere which
is a preferred shape prior to the onset of the transition. The properties of
the buckling transition are studied in cases when (i) the total volume enclosed
by the elastic shell has to be fixed and when (ii) there is an internal
pressure acting on the shell. This may be related to maturation process in
non-enveloped dsDNA viruses, where the insertion of the genetic material in a
pre-formed protein shell (viral coating) may effectively impose the fixed
volume and/or pressure constraint. Several scenarios that may explain the
experimentally observed feature of mature viruses being more aspherical

atomic-orbital methods within the generalized gradient approximation for the
exchange and correlation to study the interactions in the bare and hydrogenated
platinum clusters. The minimum-energy structures, binding energies, relative
stabilities, vibrational frequencies and the highest occupied and lowest
unoccupied molecular-orbital gaps of Pt_nH_m (n=1-5, m=0-2) clusters are
calculated and compared with previously studied pure platinum and hydrogenated
platinum clusters. We investigate any magic behavior in hydrogenated platinum
clusters and find that Pt_4H_2 is more stable than its neighboring sizes. Our
results do not agree with a previous conclusion that 3D geometries of Pt
tetramer and pentamer are unfavored. On the contrary, the lowest energy
structure of Pt_4 is found to be a distorted tetrahedron and that of Pt_5 is
found to be a bridge site capped tetrahedron which is a new global minimum for
Pt_5 cluster. The successive addition of H atoms to Pt_n clusters leads to an
oscillatory change in the magnetic moment of Pt_3 - Pt_5 clusters.

schemes for a variety of energy ranges, from GeV down to the neV scale. The
isotopes are produced using beam of the AGOR cyclotron at KVI. They are
separated from the primary beam by a magnetic separator. A crucial part of such
a facility is the ability to stop and extract isotopes into a low energy
beamline which guides them to the experiment. In particular we are
investigating stopping in matter and buffer gases. After the extraction the
isotopes can be stored in neutral atoms or ion traps for experiments. Our
research includes precision studies of nuclear $\beta$-decay through
$\beta$-$\nu$ momentum correlations as well as searches for permanent electric

comparisons of recent measurements of chemical concentration. These comparisons
are described quantitatively by the chemotactic response function, which we
expect to optimize chemotactic behavioral performance. We identify two
independent chemotactic performance criteria: in the short run, a favorable
response function should move bacteria up chemoattractant gradients, while in
the long run, bacteria should aggregate at peaks of chemoattractant
concentration. Surprisingly, these two criteria conflict, so that when one
performance criterion is most favorable, the other is unfavorable. Since both
types of behavior are biologically relevant, we include both behaviors in a
composite optimization that yields a response function that closely resembles
experimental measurements. Our work suggests that the bacterial chemotactic
response function can be derived from simple behavioral considerations, and
sheds light on how the response function contributes to chemotactic
performance.

former experiment and the huge rate was attributed to the dipole-dipole

the experiment there is practically no effect. Consequently it seems that the
dipole-dipole interaction can be ruled out as a possible explanation for the
huge rates reported in the experiment.

oracles. In this limit, the problem of finding the optimal query algorithm can
be mapped into the problem of finding shortest paths on a manifold. The study
of these shortest paths leads to lower bounds of the original unitary oracle
problem. A number of example Hamiltonian oracles are studied in this paper,
including oracle interrogation and the problem of computing the XOR of the
hidden bits. Both of these problems are related to the study of geodesics on
spheres with non-round metrics. For the case of two hidden bits a complete
description of the geodesics is given. For n hidden bits a simple lower bound
is proven that shows the problems require a query time proportional to n, even
in the continuum limit. Finally, the problem of continuous Grover search is
reexamined leading to a modest improvement to the protocol of Farhi and
