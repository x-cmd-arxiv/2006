060210, for which we have obtained well-sampled optical light curves. Our data,
combined with early optical data reported in the literature, shows unusual
behavior for both afterglows. In R-band GRB 060206 (z=4.045) experienced a slow
early decay, followed by a rapid increase in brightness by factor ~2.5 about 1
hour after the burst. Its afterglow then faded in a broken power-law fashion,
with a smooth break at t_b=0.6 days, but with additional, less dramatic (~10%)
``bumps and wiggles'', well detected in the densely sampled light curve. The
R-band afterglow of GRB 060210 (z=3.91) is also unusual: the light curves was
more or less flat between 60 and 300 sec after the burst, followed by ~70%
increase at ~600 sec after the burst, after which the light curve declined as a
t^{-1.3} power-law. Despite earlier reports to the contrary, we find that for
GRB 060206 X-rays also more or less follow the optical decay, but with
significant variations on short timescales. However, the X-ray afterglow is
contaminated by a nearby, variable source, which especially at late times
obscures the behavior of the X-ray afterglow. We argue that ``anomalous''
optical afterglows are likely to be the norm, and that the rapid variations
often seen in Swift-XRT data would also be seen in the optical light curves,
given good enough sampling. As a result, some of the often employed procedures,
such as deriving the jet opening angle using a smooth broken power-law fit to
the optical light curves, in many cases might have a poor statistical
significance. We argue that the early increase in brighness for both bursts
might be due to the turn-on of the external shock. Existence of such features
could provide valuable additional information about the burst. (Abridged)

get important constraints on the physical scenario, on the dynamics of the

a spatially resolved spectral analysis of a set of homogeneous regions. The
X-ray spectrum of W49B is characterized by strong K emission lines from Si, S,
Ar, Ca and Fe. In all the regions studied, the X-ray spectrum is dominated by
the emission from the ejecta and there is no indication of radial
stratification of the elements. A high overabundance of Ni
(Ni/Ni_sun=10^{+2}_{-1}) is required in the bright central region and the
previous detection of Cr and Mn line emission is confirmed. Spectra are well
described by two thermal components in collisional ionization equilibrium. We
observe spatial variations in the temperature, with the highest temperature
found in the east and the lowest in the west. Our results support a scenario in
which the X-ray emission comes from ejecta interacting with a dense belt of
ambient material, but another possibility is that the remnant is the result of
an asymmetric bipolar explosion with the eastern jet being hotter and more
Fe-rich than the western jet. The eastern jet is confined by interaction with
ambient molecular clouds. Comparison of the observed abundances with yields for
hypernova and supernova nucleosynthesis does not directly support the
association of W49B with a gamma-ray burst, although it remains possible.

obtain good agreement for the LBGs at the bright-end of the luminosity function
(LF). Our simulations also suggest that the cosmic star formation rate density
has a peak at z= 5-6, and that the current LBG surveys at z=6 are missing a
significant number of faint galaxies that are dimmer than the current magnitude
limit. Together, our results suggest that the universe could be reionized at
z=6 by the Pop II stars in ordinary galaxies. We also estimate the LF of
Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) at z=6 by relating the star formation rate in the
simulation to the Ly-alpha luminosity. We find that the simulated LAE LFs agree
with the observed data provided that the net escape fraction of Ly-alpha photon
is f_{Ly-alpha} <= 0.1. We investigate two possible scenarios for this effect:
(1) all sources in the simulation are uniformly dimmer by a factor of 10

shows that the OVI lines are double-peaked and symmetrical about the systemic
velocity of the galaxy, with a separation of 210 km/s. A LWRS observation 30""
from the center failed to show additional OVI emission. For NGC 5846, three

contained in the sum of the smaller apertures, with most of the flux in a

the emission consists of a blue and red peak. For both galaxies, the OVI
velocity structure is similar to that of the optical [NII] emission and is

have a serial of broad ""puny"" flares on a timescale of hours to days on the top
of a decaying outburst in March 2003. In the flares, the spectra are softened
and the pulse profiles become more sinusoidal. The frequency of kilohertz
quasi-periodic oscillation (kHz QPO) is found to be positively related to the
X-ray count rate in the flares. These features observed in the flares could be
due to the accreting flow inhomogeneities. It is noticed that the fractional
pulse amplitude increases with the flare intensities in a range of $\sim
2%-14%$, comparable to those observed in the thermonuclear bursts of the
millisecond X-ray pulsar XTE J1814--338, whereas it remains at about 6.5% in

of dust continuum, dust emission features (SiC, MgS) and molecular absorption
bands (C2H2, HCN). A set of four narrow bands, dubbed the Manchester system, is
used to define the infrared continuum for dusty carbon stars. The relations
between the continuum colours and the strength of the dust and molecular
features are studied, and are compared to Galactic stars of similar colours.
The circumstellar 7-micron C2H2 band is found to be stronger at lower
metallicity, from a comparison of stars in the Galaxy, the LMC and the SMC.
This is explained by dredge-up of carbon, causing higher C/O ratios at low
metallicity (less O). A possible 10-micron absorption feature seen in our
spectra may be due to C3. This band has also been identified with interstellar
silicate or silicon-nitrite dust. The line-to-continuum ratio of theSiC and MgS
bands shows some indication of being lower at low metallicity. The MgS band is
only seen at dust temperatures below 600 K. We discuss the selection of carbon
versus oxygen-rich AGB stars using the J-K vs. K-A colours, and show that these
colours are relatively insensitive to chemical type. Metal-poor carbon stars
form amorphous carbon dust from self-produced carbon. The formation efficiency
of oxygen-rich dust depends more strongly on metallicity. We suggest that in
lower-metallicity environments, the dust input into the Interstellar Medium by
AGB stars is efficient but may be strongly biassed towards carbonaceous dust,
as compare to the Galaxy.

degree of the Galactic Center undergo extreme diffractive scattering. However,
problems arise when standard (``Kolmogorov'') models of electron density
fluctuations are employed to interpret the observations of scattering in
conjunction with those of free-free radio emission. Specifically, the outer
scale of a Kolmogorov spectrum of electron density fluctuations is constrained
to be so small that it is difficult to identify an appropriate astronomical
setting. Moreover, an unacceptably high turbulent heating rate results if the
outer scale of the velocity field coincides with that of the density
fluctuations. We propose an alternative model based on folded magnetic field
structures that have been reported in numerical simulations of small-scale
dynamos. Nearly isothermal density variations across thin current sheets
suffice to account for the scattering. There is no problem of excess turbulent
heating because the outer scale for the velocity fluctuations is much larger
than the widths of the current sheets. We speculate that interstellar magnetic
fields could possess geometries that reflect their origins: fields maintained
by the galactic dynamo could have large correlation lengths, whereas those
stirred by local energetic events might exhibit folded structures.

Each height series covered 8 different heights beginning at 3800 km above the

been covered. The total time duration of each height series was 7 s. We found
that nearly 20% of measured height series show a periodic spatial distribution
of Doppler velocities. We suggest that this spatial periodicity in Doppler
velocity is caused by propagating kink waves in spicules. The wave length is
found to be $\sim$ 3500 km. However the wave length tends to be $\sim$ 1000 km
at the photosphere due to the height variation of the kink speed. This probably
indicates to a granular origin for the waves. The period of waves is estimated
to be in the range of 35-70 s. These waves may carry photospheric energy into
the corona, therefore can be of importance in coronal heating.

features in the polarized Galactic radio background that arise from propagation
effects in the random (turbulent) interstellar medium. The canals are
especially striking among them, a random network of very dark, narrow regions
clearly visible in many directions against a bright polarized Galactic
synchrotron background. There are no obvious physical structures in the ISM
that may have caused the canals, and so they have been called Faraday ghosts.
They evidently carry information about interstellar turbulence but only now is
it becoming clear how this information can be extracted. Two theories for the
origin of the canals have been proposed; both attribute the canals to Faraday
rotation, but one invokes strong gradients in Faraday rotation in the sky plane
(specifically, in a foreground Faraday screen) and the other only relies on
line-of-sight effects (differential Faraday rotation). In this review we
discuss the physical nature of the canals and how they can be used to explore
statistical properties of interstellar turbulence. This opens studies of
magnetized interstellar turbulence to new methods of analysis, such as contour
statistics and related techniques of computational geometry and topology. In
particular, we can hope to measure such elusive quantities as the Taylor
microscale and the effective magnetic Reynolds number of interstellar MHD
turbulence.

examined by means of a simplified model. Here, we use realistic N-body
simulations to better describe the effect, and to confirm that the signal has a
characteristic quadrupole structure. From the amplitude of the signal obtained,
we conclude that it is necessary to combine several cluster mergers in order to
achieve a detection. Using the extended Press-Schechter formalism, we
characterized the expected distribution of the parameters describing the
mergers, and we used these results to generate realistic mock catalogues of
cluster mergers. To optimize the extraction of the RS signal, we developed an
extension of the spatial filtering method described in Haehnelt & Tegmark
(1996). This extended filter has a general definition, so it can be applied in
many other fields, such as gravitational lensing of the CMB or lensing of
background galaxies. It has been applied to our mock catalogues, and we show
that with the announced sensitivities of future experiments like the Atacama

composed of the eigenstates of the universal Hamiltonian in the absence of
spin-orbit scattering. We introduce a complete labelling of this good-spin
basis and use angular momentum algebra to calculate in closed form the matrix
elements of the spin-orbit interaction in this basis. Spin properties, such as
the ground-state spin distribution and the spin excitation function, are easily

regime successfully; at the same time, the leading- and next-to-leading order
expansion formulas for the susceptibility fail. In these cases, one can derive
a Cole-Cole law for the susceptibilities; and this law accounts for the
dynamics for frequencies below the band of microscopic excitations and above
the high-frequency part of the alpha-peak. It is shown that this scenario
explains the optical-Kerr-effect data measured for salol and benzophenone
(BZP). For BZP it is inferred that the depolarized light-scattering spectra
exhibit a wing for the alpha-peak within the Gigahertz band. This wing results
from the crossover of the von Schweidler-law part of the alpha-peak to the
high-frequency part of the Cole-Cole peak; and this crossover can be described
quantitatively by the leading-order formulas of MCT for the modulus.

their capacity-approaching performance. The iterative message-passing algorithm
is a widely adopted decoding algorithm for LDPC codes \cite{Kschischang01}. An
important design issue for LDPC codes is designing codes with fast decoding
speed while maintaining capacity-approaching performance. In another words, it
is desirable that the code can be successfully decoded in few number of
decoding iterations, at the same time, achieves a significant portion of the
channel capacity. Despite of its importance, this design issue received little
attention so far. In this paper, we address this design issue for the case of
binary erasure channel.
  We prove that density-efficient capacity-approaching LDPC codes satisfy a so
called ""flatness condition"". We show an asymptotic approximation to the number
of decoding iterations. Based on these facts, we propose an approximated
optimization approach to finding the codes with good decoding speed. We further
show that the optimal codes in the sense of decoding speed are
""right-concentrated"". That is, the degrees of check nodes concentrate around
the average right degree.

$f_{\pi}$ only, thus realizing the program proposed by Migdal some time ago.

possible scale of supersymmetry already at the present level of accuracy. We
update the present-day sensitivities of precision data using the new
experimental top-quark mass, m_t = 172.7 \pm 2.9 GeV, within the constrained
minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (CMSSM), in which there
are three independent soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters m_{1/2}, m_0 and
A_0. In addition to M_W and sin^2 theta_eff, the analysis is based on
(g-2)_\mu, BR(b -> s gamma) and the lightest MSSM Higgs boson mass, M_h.
Assuming initially that the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is a
neutralino, we display the CMSSM results as functions of m_{1/2}, fixing m_0 so
as to obtain the cold dark matter density allowed by WMAP and other
cosmological data for specific values of A_0, tan_beta and mu > 0. For a sample
value of tan_beta we analyze how the global chi^2 function would change
following a possible future evolution of the experimental central value of m_t
and its error. In a second step, we extend the analysis to other constrained
versions of the MSSM: the NUHM in which the soft supersymmetry-breaking
contributions to the Higgs masses are independent and the Higgs mixing
parameter mu and the pseudoscalar Higgs mass M_A become additional free
parameters compared to the CMSSM, a VCMSSM in which the bilinear soft
supersymmetry breaking parameter B_0 = A_0 - m_0, and the GDM in which the LSP
is the gravitino. In all scenarios we find indications for relatively light
soft supersymmetry-breaking masses, offering good prospects for the LHC and the
ILC, and in some cases also for the Tevatron.

deuteron and its spin-singlet partner are tuned to zero and the triton has
infinitely many excited states with an accumulation point at the three-nucleon

consider random fields of the form $f_p=F(y_1(p),...,y_k(p))$ for $F\in
C^2(\mathbb{R}^k;\mathbb{R})$ and $(y_1,...,y_k)$ a vector of $C^2$ i.i.d.
centered, unit-variance Gaussian fields. The analogue of the Weyl--Steiner
formula for such Gaussian-related fields involves a power series expansion for
the Gaussian, rather than Lebesgue, volume of tubes: that is, power series
expansions related to the marginal distribution of the field $f$. The formal
expansions of the Gaussian volume of a tube are of independent geometric
interest. As in the classical Weyl--Steiner formulae, the coefficients in these
expansions show up in a kinematic formula for the expected Euler
characteristic, $\chi$, of the excursion sets $M\cap f^{-1}[u,+\infty)=M\cap
y^{-1}(F^{-1}[u,+\infty))$ of the field $f$. The motivation for studying the
expected Euler characteristic comes from the well-known approximation
$\mathbb{P}[\sup_{p\in M}f(p)\geq u]\simeq\mathbb{E}[\chi(f^{-1}[u,+\infty))]$.

  currently under review. 4 Figures, 31 references",,"10.1063/1.2430294",,"nlin.CD",,"  In the analysis of complex, nonlinear time series, scientists in a variety of
disciplines have relied on a time delayed embedding of their data, i.e.
attractor reconstruction. The process has focused primarily on heuristic and
empirical arguments for selection of the key embedding parameters, delay and
embedding dimension. This approach has left several long-standing, but common
problems unresolved in which the standard approaches produce inferior results
or give no guidance at all. We view the current reconstruction process as
unnecessarily broken into separate problems. We propose an alternative approach
that views the problem of choosing all embedding parameters as being one and
the same problem addressable using a single statistical test formulated
directly from the reconstruction theorems. This allows for varying time delays
appropriate to the data and simultaneously helps decide on embedding dimension.
A second new statistic, undersampling, acts as a check against overly long time
delays and overly large embedding dimension. Our approach is more flexible than
those currently used, but is more directly connected with the mathematical
requirements of embedding. In addition, the statistics developed guide the user
by allowing optimization and warning when embedding parameters are chosen
beyond what the data can support. We demonstrate our approach on uni- and
multivariate data, data possessing multiple time scales, and chaotic data. This
unified approach resolves all the main issues in attractor reconstruction.

ejections (ICMEs) and their preceding shocks are often characterized by plasma
depletion and mirror wave structures, analogous to planetary magnetosheaths. A
case study of these signatures in the sheath of a magnetic cloud (MC) shows
that a plasma depletion layer (PDL) coincides with magnetic field draping
around the MC. In the same event, we observe an enhanced thermal anisotropy and
plasma beta as well as anti-correlated density and magnetic fluctuations which
are signatures of mirror mode waves. We perform a superposed epoch analysis of
ACE and Wind plasma and magnetic field data from different classes of ICMEs to
illuminate the general properties of these regions. For MCs preceded by shocks,
the sheaths have a PDL with an average duration of 6 hours (corresponding to a
spatial span of about 0.07 AU) and a proton temperature anisotropy ${T_{\perp
p}\over T_{\parallel p}}\simeq 1.2$ -1.3, and are marginally unstable to the
mirror instability. For ICMEs with preceding shocks which are not MCs, plasma
depletion and mirror waves are also present but at a reduced level. ICMEs
without shocks are not associated with these features. The differences between
the three ICME categories imply that these features depend on the ICME geometry
and the extent of upstream solar wind compression by the ICMEs. We discuss the
implications of these features for a variety of crucial physical processes
including magnetic reconnection, formation of magnetic holes and energetic
particle modulation in the solar wind.

$P_o(x)$ indicates a clear power law $P_o(x)\propto 1/x$, where $x$ represents

"physics/0602166","Larry Velasco Dr","A. D. Boardman, Larry Velasco","Gyroelectric cubic-quintic dissipative solitons",,,,,"physics.optics cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  The influence of an externally applied magnetic field upon classic cubic
quintic dissipative solitons is investigated using both exact simulations and a
Lagrangian technique. The basic approach is to use a spatially inhomogeneous
magnetic field and to consider two important geometries, namely the Voigt and
the Faraday effects. A layered structure is selected for the Voigt case with
the principal aim being to demonstrate non-reciprocal behaviour for various
classes of spatial solitons that are known to exist as solutions of the complex
Ginzburg-Landau cubic-quintic envelope equation under dissipative conditions.
The system is viewed as dynamical and an opportunity is taken to display the
behaviour patterns of the spatial solitons in terms of two-dimensional
dynamical plots involving the total energy and the peak amplitude of the
spatial solitons. This action this leads to limit cycle plots that beautifully
reveal the behaviour of the solitons solutions at all points along the
propagation axis. The closed contour that exists in the absence of a magnetic
field is opened up and a limit point is exposed. The onset of chaos is revealed
in a dramatic way and it is clear that detailed control by the external
magnetic field can be exercised. The Lagrangian approach is adjusted to deal
with dissipative systems and through the choice of particular trial functions,
aspects of the dynamic behaviour of the spatial are predicted by this approach.
Finally, some vortex dynamics in the Faraday configuration are investigated.

serious efforts of the scientists to establish a ranking of honors in order to
get funds or to control the academic and higher education institutions, the
Science doesn't exists in itself, but different kinds of knowledge. Therefore,
the scientists don't control the Science; they are mere experts in a field of
knowledge, which could be expressed in many valid ways. This variety determines
the existence of many models of academic curricula, based on heterogeneous ways
of valuation that change along the History.

when transverse isotropy is reached. The analysis accounts for the variety of
very recent experimental beam transverse observations.

for identifying neutrino charged current events while rejecting neutral current
