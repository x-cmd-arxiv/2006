account, computed for a metallicity Z = 10^{-8} on the chemical evolution of
the earliest phases of the Milky Way. These models are computed under the
assumption that the ratio of the initial rotation velocity to the critical
velocity of stars is roughly constant with metallicity. This naturally leads to
faster rotation at lower metallicity, as metal poor stars are more compact than
metal rich ones. We find that the new Z = 10^{-8} stellar yields have a
tremendous impact on the interstellar medium nitrogen enrichment for
log(O/H)+12 < 7 (or [Fe/H]< -3).We show that upon the inclusion of the Z =
10^{-8} stellar yields in chemical evolution models, both high N/O and C/O

produced, at least in part, by scale-free accretion processes that build up

  Methods: We analyse 63 supernovae which have occurred within galaxies from
our H alpha survey of the local Universe. Three statistical tests are used,
based on pixel statistics, H alpha radial growth curves, and total galaxy
emission-line fluxes.
  Results: Many more type II supernovae come from regions of low or zero
emission line flux than would be expected if the latter accurately traces
high-mass star formation. We interpret this excess as a 40% `Runaway' fraction
in the progenitor stars. Supernovae of types Ib and Ic do appear to trace star
formation activity, with a much higher fraction coming from the centres of
bright star formation regions than is the case for the type II supernovae. Type
Ia supernovae overall show a weak correlation with locations of current star
formation, but there is evidence that a significant minority, up to about 40%,
may be linked to the young stellar population. The radial distribution of all
core-collapse supernovae (types Ib, Ic and II) closely follows that of the line
emission and hence star formation in the their host galaxies, apart from a
central deficiency which is less marked for supernovae of types Ib and Ic than
for those of type II. Core-collapse supernova rates overall are consistent with
being proportional to galaxy total luminosities and star formation rates;
however, within this total the type Ib and Ic supernovae show a moderate bias
towards more luminous host galaxies, and type II supernovae a slight bias
towards lower-luminosity hosts.

and construct six composite H-alpha+[NII] spectra from all of the objects in
each bin. We estimate the mean oxygen abundance in each bin from the
[NII]/H-alpha ratio, and find a monotonic increase in metallicity with
increasing stellar mass, from 12+log(O/H) < 8.2 for galaxies with <M_star> =
2.7e9 Msun to 12+log(O/H) = 8.6 for galaxies with <M_star> = 1e11 Msun. We use
the empirical relation between star formation rate density and gas density to
estimate the gas fractions of the galaxies, finding an increase in gas fraction
with decreasing stellar mass. These gas fractions combined with the observed
metallicities allow the estimation of the effective yield y_eff as a function
of stellar mass; in constrast to observations in the local universe which show
a decrease in y_eff with decreasing baryonic mass, we find a slight increase.
Such a variation of metallicity with gas fraction is best fit by a model with
supersolar yield and an outflow rate ~4 times higher than the star formation
rate. We conclude that the mass-metallicity relation at high redshift is driven
by the increase in metallicity as the gas fraction decreases through star
formation, and is likely modulated by metal loss from strong outflows in
galaxies of all masses. There is no evidence for preferential loss of metals
from low mass galaxies as has been suggested in the local universe. [Abridged]

are probably too weak as to be detected by current and forthcoming
millimeter-telescope facilities. We extend our estimates of spectral-spatial

regime extending from low magnetization (low-sigma_o), almost thermally-driven
winds to high magnetization (high-sigma_o), relativistic Poynting-flux
dominated outflows. We compute the angular momentum and rotational energy loss
rates as a function of sigma_o and compare with analytic expectations from the
classical theory of pulsars and magnetized stellar winds. In the case of the
monopole, our high-sigma_o calculations asymptotically approach the analytic
force-free limit. If we define the spindown rate in terms of the open magnetic
flux, we similarly reproduce the spindown rate from recent force-free
calculations of the aligned dipole. However, even for sigma_o as high as ~20,
we find that the location of the Y-type point (r_Y), which specifies the radius
of the last closed field line in the equatorial plane, is not the radius of the
light cylinder R_L = c/omega (R = cylindrical radius), as has previously been
assumed in most estimates and force-free calculations. Instead, although the
Alfven radius at intermediate latitudes quickly approaches R_L as sigma_o
exceeds unity, r_Y remains significantly less than R_L. Because r_Y < R_L, our
calculated spindown rates thus exceed the classic ``vacuum dipole'' rate. We
discussthe implications of our results for models of rotation-powered pulsars

the spherically-symmetric Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) models. It has been
claimed that the central observer in these models can observe a local
acceleration, which would contradict general theorems. We resolve the
contradiction by noting that many of the models that have been explored contain
a weak singularity at the location of the observer which makes them unphysical.
In the absence of this singularity, we show that LTB models must have a
positive central deceleration parameter $q_{0}$, in agreement with the general
theorems. We also show that it is possible to achieve a negative apparent
deceleration parameter at nonzero redshifts in LTB models that do not contain
this singularity. However, we find other singularities that tend to arise in
LTB models when attempting to match luminosity distance data, and these
generally limit the range of redshifts for which these models can mimic
observations of an accelerating Universe. Exceptional models do exist that can
extend to arbitrarily large redshift without encountering these pathologies,
and we show how these may be constructed. These special models exhibit regions
with negative effective equation of state parameter, which may fall below
negative one, but we have failed to find any singularity-free models that agree
with observations. Moreover, models based on dust-filled LTB metrics probably
fail to reproduce observed properties of large scale structure.

known. Our goal is to use the Class 0 protostar IRAS 4A, which is undergoing
collapse in the active molecular cloud NGC 1333, to set constraints on this
process. In particular we want to measure the mass infall rate and investigate
whether the collapse could have been triggered by a strong external
perturbation. We analyze existing continuum observations to derive the density
structure of the envelope, and use our new molecular line observations done
with the IRAM 30m telescope to probe its velocity structure. We perform a
detailed comparison of this set of data with a numerical model of collapse
triggered by a fast external compression. Both the density and velocity
structures of the envelope can be well fitted by this model of collapse induced
by a fast external compression for a time elapsed since point mass formation of
1-2 x 10**4 yr. We deduce a large mass infall rate of 0.7-2 x 10**-4 Msun/yr.
The momentum required for the perturbation to produce this large mass infall
rate is of the same order as the momenta measured for the NGC 1333 numerous
outflows. Our analysis shows also that the turbulence is highly non uniform in
the envelope, dropping from supersonic to subsonic values toward the center.
The inner subsonic turbulence is most likely a relic of the conditions
prevailing in the dense core before the onset of collapse. The vigorous
collapse undergone by IRAS 4A was triggered by a fast external compression,
probably related to the expansion of a nearby cavity, which could have
triggered the collapse of the nearby Class 0 protostar IRAS 4B simultaneously.
This cavity could have been generated by an outflow but we have not found a
good protostellar candidate yet.

neutrino transport suggest that the bulk of the early neutrino-heated ejecta is

proton-capture (rp) process takes place in such proton-rich environments by
bypassing the waiting point nuclei with the beta-lives of a few minutes via the
faster capture of neutrons continuously supplied from the neutrino absorption
by protons. In this study, the nucleosynthesis calculations are performed with
the wide ranges of the neutrino luminosities and the electron fractions (Ye),
using the semi-analytic models of proto-neutron star winds. The masses of
proto-neutron stars are taken to be 1.4 Msolar and 2.0 Msolar, where the latter
is regarded as the test for somewhat high entropy winds (about a factor of
two). For Ye > 0.52, the neutrino-induced rp-process takes place in many wind
trajectories, and the p-nuclei up to A ~ 130 are synthesized with interesting

enhanced by the nuclear flows in the vicinity of the abundant 90Zr that
originates from the alpha-process at higher temperature. The nucleosynthetic
yields are averaged over the ejected masses of winds, and further the Ye
distribution predicted by the recent hydrodynamic simulation of a core-collapse
supernova. Comparison of the mass-Ye-averaged yields to the solar compositions
implies that the neutrino-driven winds can be potentially the origin of light

with XRT data indicate that an absorbed broken powerlaw is often a better fit

that data extend beyond $z \sim 1$. Surveys with the precision anticipated for

transition occurring at a redshift as low as $\sim 0.17$ could still remain
undistinguishable from a standard cosmological constant. The addition of a
prior on the matter density $\Omega_\MAT = 0.3$ only modestly improves the

which allow accelerated or decelerated system relaxation, or suppression of

the resulting optimal differential system is solved numerically. As an
application, we study the dynamics of a spin-boson model in the strong coupling

searches in lattices can be performed as non-binary belief propagation on
associated TGs; soft-information output is naturally generated in the process;
the algorithm requires no backtrack (cf. classic sphere decoding), and extracts
extrinsic information. A lattice's coding gain enables equivalence relations
between lattice points, which can be thereby partitioned in cosets. Total and
extrinsic a posteriori probabilities at the detector's output further enable
the use of soft detection information in iterative schemes. The algorithm is
illustrated via two scenarios that transmit a 32-point, uncoded
super-orthogonal (SO) constellation for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
channels, carved from an 8-dimensional non-orthogonal lattice (a direct sum of
two 4-dimensional checkerboard lattice): it achieves maximum likelihood
performance in quasistatic fading; and, performs close to interference-free
transmission, and identically to list sphere decoding, in independent fading
with coordinate interleaving and iterative equalization and detection. Latter
scenario outperforms former despite the absence of forward error correction
coding---because the inherent lattice coding gain allows for the refining of
extrinsic information. The lattice constellation is the same as the one
employed in the SO space-time trellis codes first introduced for 2-by-2 MIMO by

equivalence principle, distort the motions of the planets in the Solar System.
Since no anomalous motion of the planets has been detected, it is generally
believed that the Pioneer anomaly can not originate from a gravitational source
in the Solar System. However, this conclusion becomes less obvious when
considering models that either imply modifications to gravity at long range or
gravitational sources localized to the outer Solar System, given the
uncertainty in the orbital parameters of the outer planets. Following the
general assumption that the Pioneer spacecraft move geodesically in a
spherically symmetric spacetime metric, we derive the metric disturbance that
is needed in order to account for the Pioneer anomaly. We then analyze the
residual effects on the astronomical observables of the three outer planets
that would arise from this metric disturbance, given an arbitrary metric theory
of gravity. Providing a method for comparing the computed residuals with actual
residuals, our results imply that the presence of a perturbation to the
gravitational field necessary to induce the Pioneer anomaly is in conflict with
available data for the planets Uranus and Pluto, but not for Neptune. We
therefore conclude that the motion of the Pioneer spacecraft must be
non-geodesic. Since our results are model independent within the class of
metric theories of gravity, they can be applied to rule out any model of the
Pioneer anomaly that implies that the Pioneer spacecraft move geodesically in a
perturbed spacetime metric, regardless of the origin of this metric
disturbance.

characterized by thirteen nonzero form factors, which are given in complete
generality for unbroken gauge theory at one loop. The results are given in $d$
dimensions using both dimensional regularization and dimensional reduction,
including the effects of massless gluons and arbitrary representations of
massive gauge bosons, fermions, and scalars. We find interesting relations
between the functional forms of the contributions from gauge bosons, fermions,
and scalars. These relations hold only for the gauge-invariant pinch technique
vertex and are d-dimensional incarnations of supersymmetric nonrenormalization
theorems which include finite terms. The form factors are shown to simplify for
$N=1,2$, and 4 supersymmetry in various dimensions. In four-dimensional
non-supersymmetric theories, eight of the form factors have the same functional
form for massless gluons, quarks, and scalars, when written in a physically
motivated tensor basis. For QCD, these include the tree-level tensor structure
which has prefactor $\beta_0=(11N_c-2N_f)/3$, another tensor with prefactor
$4N_c-N_f$, and six tensors with $N_c-N_f$. In perturbative calculations our
results lead naturally to an effective coupling for the three-gluon vertex
which depends on three momenta and gives rise to an effective scale which
governs the behavior of the vertex. The effects of nonzero internal masses are
important and have a complicated threshold and pseudo-threshold structure. The
results of this paper are an important part of a gauge-invariant dressed
skeleton expansion and a related multi-scale analytic renormalization scheme.
In this approach the scale ambiguity problem is resolved since physical
kinematic invariants determine the arguments of the couplings.

physics of right handed neutrino sector with the low energy neutrino data. In
the light of current neutrino oscillation data we studied the bound on the mass
scale ($M_1$) of lightest right handed neutrino ($N_1$) as well as their mass
hierarchy ($M_2/M_1$ and $M_3/M_1$) from the leptogenesis constraint which we
discussed in two different parts of the thesis. In part-I, we studied the
canonical leptogenesis in a {\it thermal} scenario and hence the bound on
$M_1$. It is shown that the mass scale of $N_1$ must satisfy the constraint
$M_1\geq 10^8$ GeV in order to produce the adequate lepton asymmetry. We then
led to propose a model where this bound can be relaxed to TeV scale. In
part-II, we studied the formation and evolution of topological defects which
are non-thermal objects and are expected to be formed during the early Universe
phase transitions. In particular, we considered $B-L$ cosmic strings and their
effect on leptogenesis and hence the bound on the mass scale of $N_1$. It is
shown that for the $B-L$ symmetry breaking scale $\eta_{B-L}>10^{11}$GeV, in

conjecture, the background is dual to pure N=1 SYM in the IR coupled to a KK
sector whose dynamics is altered by a dipole deformation that is proportional
to the deformation parameter gamma. Thus, the deformation serves to identify
the aspects of the gravity backgrounds that bear the effects of the KK sector,
hence non-universal in the dual gauge theory. We make this idea concrete by
studying a Penrose limit of the deformed MN theory. We obtain an exactly
solvable pp-wave that is conjectured to describe the IR dynamics of KK-hadrons
in the field theory. The spectrum, the thermal partition function and the
Hagedorn temperature are calculated. The Hagedorn temperature turns out to be
independent of the deformation parameter.

Zeeman-Hamilton operators of free charged particles. These manifolds can be
considered as prototypes of the so called Zeeman manifolds. This observation
allows to develop a spectral theory both on open Z-manifolds and their compact
submanifolds. The theory on open manifolds leads to a new nonperturbative
approach to the infinities of QED. This idea exploits that the quantum Hilbert
space decomposes into subspaces (Zeeman zones) which are invariant under the
actions both of this Zeeman-Laplace operator and the natural complex Heisenberg
group representation. Thus a well defined particle theory and zonal geometry
can be developed on each zone separately. The most surprising result is that
quantities divergent on the global setting are finite on the zonal setting.
Even the zonal Feynman integral is well defined. The results include explicit
computations of objects such as the zonal spectra, the waves defining the zonal
point-spreads, the zonal Wiener-Kac resp. Dirac-Feynman flows, and the
corresponding partition functions.
  The observation adds new view-point also to the problem of finding
intertwining operators by which isospectral pairs of metrics with different
local geometries on compact submanifolds can be constructed. Among the examples
the author constructed the most surprising are the isospectrality families
containing both homogeneous and locally inhomogeneous metrics. The observation

we consider for this analysis is neither a weighted supremum norm nor an

hence can be seen as a type of 1-Wasserstein distance. This turns out to be a
suitable approach for infinite-dimensional spaces where the usual Harris or
Doeblin conditions, which are geared toward total variation convergence, often
fail to hold. In the first part of this paper, we consider semigroups that have
uniform behavior which one can view as the analog of Doeblin's condition. We
then proceed to study situations where the behavior is not so uniform, but the
system has a suitable Lyapunov structure, leading to a type of Harris
condition. We finally show that the latter condition is satisfied by the
two-dimensional stochastic Navier--Stokes equations, even in situations where
the forcing is extremely degenerate. Using the convergence result, we show that
the stochastic Navier--Stokes equations' invariant measures depend continuously
on the viscosity and the structure of the forcing.

observation of $X_{t_k}$. Then, one constructs a particle system with
observation-dependent branching and $n$ initial particles whose empirical
measure at time $t$, $\mu_t^n$, closely approximates $\mu_t$. Each particle
evolves independently of the other particles according to the law of the signal
between observation times $t_k$, and branches with small probability at an
observation time. For filtering problems where $\epsilon$ is very small, using
the algorithm considered in this paper requires far fewer computations than
other algorithms that branch or interact all particles regardless of the value
of $\epsilon$. We analyze the algorithm on L\'{e}vy-stable signals and give
rates of convergence for $E^{1/2}\{\|\mu^n_t-\mu_t\|_{\gamma}^2\}$, where

Annalen",,,,"math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The general aim of this paper is to study which are the solvable Lie groups
admitting an Einstein left invariant metric. The space N of all nilpotent Lie
brackets on R^n parametrizes a set of (n+1)-dimensional rank-one solvmanifolds,
containing the set of all those which are Einstein in that dimension. The
moment map for the natural GL(n)-action on N evaluated in a point of N encodes
geometric information on the corresponding solvmanifold, allowing us to use
strong and well-known results from geometric invariant theory. For instance,
the functional on N whose critical points are precisely the Einstein
solvmanifolds is the square norm of this moment map. We also use a
GL(n)-invariant stratification for the space N following essentially a
construction given by F. Kirwan and show that there is a strong interplay
between the strata and the Einstein condition on the solvmanifolds. As
applications, we obtain several examples of graded (even 2-step) nilpotent Lie
algebras which are not the nilradicals of any standard Einstein solvmanifold,
as well as a classification in the 7-dimensional 6-step case and an existence
result for certain 2-step algebras associated to graphs.

investigation extends an earlier study of the perturbative convergence of the

energies. As the cutoff is lowered using renormalization-group or model-space
techniques, the evolution of nonperturbative features at large cutoffs from
strong short-range repulsion and the iterated tensor interaction are monitored
via the complex Weinberg eigenvalues. When all eigenvalues lie within the unit
circle, the expansion of the scattering amplitude in terms of the interaction
is perturbative, with the magnitude of the largest eigenvalue setting the rate
of convergence. Major decreases in the magnitudes of repulsive eigenvalues are
observed as the Argonne v18, CD-Bonn or Nijmegen potentials are evolved to low
momentum, even though two-body observables are unchanged. For chiral EFT
potentials, running the cutoff lower tames the impact of the tensor force and
of new nonperturbative features entering at N3LO. The efficacy of separable
approximations to nuclear interactions derived from the Weinberg analysis is
studied as a function of cutoff, and the connection to inverse scattering is
demonstrated.

molecular states and recently developed atom counting techniques, a detection
scheme for sound waves in dilute Bose-Einstein condensates is proposed whose
accuracy might reach down to the level of a few or even single phonons. This
scheme could open up a new range of applications including the experimental
observation of quantum radiation phenomena such as the Hawking effect in sonic

understanding quantum mechanics are discussed. It is shown that the basic
mathematical structure of quantum mechanics like the probability amplitudes,
Born rule, commutation and uncertainty relations, probability density current,
momentum operator, rules for including the scalar and vector potentials and
antiparticles can be obtained from the probabilistic description of results of
measurement of the space coordinates and time. Equations of motion of quantum
mechanics, the Klein-Gordon equation, Schrodinger equation and Dirac equation
are obtained from the requirement of the relativistic invariance of the
space-time Fisher information. The limit case of the delta-like probability
densities leads to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of classical mechanics. Many
particle systems and the postulates of quantum mechanics are also discussed.

state and are subsequently ionized with a tailored electric field pulse. This
pulse selectively ionizes only atoms in e.g. the 54d state and not in the 53d
state. The released electrons are detected after a slow flight towards a micro
channel plate. From the time of flight of the electrons the position of the
atoms is deduced. The state selectivity is about 20:1 when comparing 54d with
53d and the one-dimensional position resolution ranges from 6 to 40 $\mu$m over
a range of 300 $\mu$m. This state selectivity and position resolution are
sufficient to allow for the observation of coherent quantum excitation
transport.

system against a quantum verifier. The key of the proof is the construction of

amplification of QMA proof systems.
  This manuscript presents a new and simpler construction of a simulator. In
