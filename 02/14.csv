protons and electrons accelerated by large scale structure formation shocks,
galactic winds, or active galactic nuclei. Furthermore, gamma rays may be
produced in dark matter particle annihilation processes at the cluster cores.
We report on observations of the galaxy clusters Perseus and Abell 2029 using
the 10 m Whipple Cherenkov telescope during the 2003-2004 and 2004-2005
observing seasons. We apply a two-dimensional analysis technique to scrutinize
the clusters for TeV emission. In this paper we first determine flux upper
limits on TeV gamma-ray emission from point sources within the clusters.
Second, we derive upper limits on the extended cluster emission. We
subsequently compare the flux upper limits with EGRET upper limits at 100 MeV
and theoretical models. Assuming that the gamma-ray surface brightness profile
mimics that of the thermal X-ray emission and that the spectrum of cluster
cosmic rays extends all the way from thermal energies to multi-TeV energies
with a differential spectral index of -2.1, our results imply that the cosmic
ray proton energy density is less than 7.9% of the thermal energy density for
the Perseus cluster.

with masses <~2x10^6 Msun could have acquired most of their present mass by an

we focus on power-law luminosity decay (as identified in candidate tidal

self-consistent and follow from one another as predicted by the merger

merger rates as a function of stellar mass. We use this to predict the merging
galaxy LF in several observed wavebands, color-magnitude relations, mass

whether young planets are faint or bright compared with low-mass young brown

of short period planets and argue that substantial mass loss may have occurred
for these objects. Concerning star formation, geometrical effects in protostar
core collapse are examined by comparing 1D and 3D calculations. Spherical
collapse is shown to overestimate the core inner density and temperature and
thus to yield incorrect initial conditions for PMS or young brown dwarf
evolution. Accretion is also shown to occur over a very limited fraction of the
protostar surface. Accretion affects the evolution of young brown dwarfs and
yields more compact structures for a given mass and age, thus fainter
luminosities. This can lead to severe misinterpretations of the mass and/or age
of young accreting objects from their location in the HR diagram. We argue that
newborn stars and brown dwarfs should appear rapidly over an extended area in
the HR diagram, depending on their accretion history, rather than on a well
defined birth line. Finally, we suggest that the distinction between planets
and brown dwarfs be based on an observational diagnostic, reflecting the
different formation mechanisms between these two distinct populations, rather
than on an arbitrary, confusing definition.

in the inner disk is a distinct secondary disk inclined by ~5 deg from the main
disk. The main disk's northeast extension is linear from 80 to 250 AU, but the
southwest extension is distinctly bowed with an amplitude of ~1 AU over the

collinear, from 80 to 150 AU. Within ~120 AU of the star, the main disk is ~50%

spine of the main disk are fitted with four distinct radial power laws between
40 and 250 AU, while those of the secondary disk between 80 and 150 AU are
fitted with single power laws. These discrepancies suggest that the two disks
have different grain compositions or size distributions. The F606W/F435W and

stars display a central absorption that is typically redshifted by ~0.1 km/s
relative to the emission, but the nature of this velocity gradient remains
unknown. The FWHM of the H and K lines increase with stellar luminosity,
reminiscent of the Wilson-Bappu effect in FGK-type stars. Both the equivalent
widths and FWHM exhibit modest temporal variability in individual stars. At a
given value of M_v, stars exhibit a spread in both the equivalent width and
FWHM of Ca II H and K, due both to a spread in fundamental stellar parameters
including rotation rate, age, and possibly metallicity, and to the spread in
stellar mass at a given M_v. The K line is consistently wider than the H line,
as expected, and its central absorption is more redshifted, indicating that the
H and K lines form at slightly different heights in the chromosphere where the
velocities are slightly different. The equivalent width of H-alpha correlates
with Ca II H and K only for stars having Ca II equivalent widths above ~2
angstroms, suggesting the existence of a magnetic threshold above which the

galaxy has been imaged in two filters, closely resembling the Sloan g and z
passbands, using the Advanced Camera for Surveys on board the Hubble Space
Telescope.
  Dust and complex morphological structures are common, with kiloparsec-scale
stellar disks, bars, and nuclear stellar disks seen in 60% of galaxies with
intermediate luminosity (-20 < M_B < -17), and dust seen in 42% of galaxies
brighter than M_B = -18.9 mag. Dust morphologies range from faint wisps and
patches on tens of parsec scales, to regular, highly organized kpc-scale dust
disks, often showing evidence of recent star formation.
  Surface brightness profiles and isophotal parameters are derived typically
within 8 kpc from the center for the brightest galaxies, and 1.5 kpc for the
faintest systems, with a resolution (FWHM) of 7 pc. Based on a parametrization
of the surface brightness profiles in terms of a Sersic or core-Sersic model,
we find that 1) there is no evidence of a bimodal behavior of the slope, gamma,
of the profile in the innermost regions; 2) although the brightest galaxies
have shallow inner profiles, the shallowest profiles (lowest gamma values) are

and high density winds, responsible for the observed high mass-loss rates.
Although presenting high luminosities, radiation pressure on dust particles is
not sufficient to explain the wind acceleration process. Among the possible
solutions to this still unsolved problem, Alfven waves are, probably, the most
interesting for their high efficiency in transfering energy and momentum to the
wind. Typically, models of Alfven wave driven winds result in high velocity
winds if they are not highly damped. In this work we determine
self-consistently the magnetic field geometry and solve the momentum, energy
and mass conservation equations, to demonstrate that even a low damped Alfven
wave flux is able to reproduce the low velocity wind. We show that the magnetic
fluxtubes expand with a super-radial factor S>30 near the stellar surface,
larger than that used in previous semi-empirical models. The rapid expansion
results in a strong spatial dilution of the wave flux. We obtained the wind
parameter profiles for a typical supergiant star of 16 M_sun. The wind is
accelerated in a narrow region, coincident with the region of high divergence
of the magnetic field lines, up to 100 km/s. For the temperature, we obtained a
slight decrease near the surface for low damped waves, because the wave heating
mechanism is less effective than the radiative losses. The peak temperature
occurs at 1.5 r_0 reaching 6000 K. Propagating outwards, the wind cools down
mainly due to adiabatic expansion.

and a surrounding misaligned accretion disc. We use a simplified set of
equations, that describe the evolution of the system in the case where the
propagation of warping disturbances in the accretion disc occurs diffusively, a
situation likely to be common in the thin discs in Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN). We also allow the direction of the hole spin to move under the action of
the disc torques. In such a way, the evolution of the hole-disc system is
computed self-consistently. We consider a number of different situations and we
explore the relevant parameter range, by varying the location of the warp
radius $R_{\rm w}$ and the propagation speed of the warp. We find that the
dissipation associated with the twisting of the disc results in a large
increase in the accretion rate through the disc, so that AGN accreting from a
misaligned disc are likely to be significantly more luminous than those
accreting from a flat disc. We compute explicitly the time-scales for the
warping of the disc and for the alignment process and compare our results with
earlier estimates based on simplified steady-state solutions. We also confirm
earlier predictions that, under appropriate circumstances, accretion can
proceed in a counter-aligned fashion, so that the accreted material will
spin-down the hole, rather than spinning it up. Our results have implication in
a number of different observational features of AGN such as the orientation and
shape of jets, the shape of X-ray iron lines, and the possibility of
obscuration and absorption of X-ray by the outer disc as well as the general

Radio-Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN). The jet was observed in only one
of six epochs of MERLIN imaging of the source during a phase of repeated X-ray
spectral transitions in 2004 Jan--Feb, and this epoch corresponded to the
softest 1.5-12 keV X-ray spectrum. With only a single epoch revealing the jet,
we cannot formally constrain its velocity. Nevertheless, several lines of
reasoning suggest that the jet was probably launched 0.5-4.0 days before this
brightening, corresponding to projected velocities of 0.2c < v_app < 1.6c, and
an intrinsic velocity of > 0.3c. We also report the occurrence of a major radio
flare from Cyg X-1, reaching a flux density of ~120 mJy at 15 GHz, and yet not
associated with any resolvable radio emission, despite a concerted effort with
MERLIN. We discuss the resolved jet in terms of the recently proposed 'unified
model' for the disc-jet coupling in black hole X-ray binaries, and tentatively
identify the 'jet line' for Cyg X-1. The source is consistent with the model in
the sense that a steady jet appears to persist initially when the X-ray
spectrum starts softening, and that once the spectral softening is complete the
core radio emission is suppressed and transient ejecta / shock observed.
However, there are some anomalies, and Cyg X-1 clearly does not behave like a
normal black hole transient in progressing to the canonical soft / thermal
state once the ejection event has happened.

not 1/2 does not necessarily imply long time correlations like those found in
fractional Brownian motion. We construct a large set of scaling solutions of
Fokker-Planck partial differential equations where H is not 1/2. Thus Markov
processes, which by construction have no long time correlations, can have H not
equal to 1/2. If a Markov process scales with Hurst exponent H then it simply
means that the process has nonstationary increments. For the scaling solutions,
we show how to reduce the calculation of the probability density to a single
integration once the diffusion coefficient D(x,t) is specified. As an example,
we generate a class of student-t-like densities from the class of quadratic
diffusion coefficients. Notably, the Tsallis density is one member of that
large class. The Tsallis density is usually thought to result from a nonlinear
diffusion equation, but instead we explicitly show that it follows from a
Markov process generated by a linear Fokker-Planck equation, and therefore from
a corresponding Langevin equation. Having a Tsallis density with H not equal to
1/2 therefore does not imply dynamics with correlated signals, e.g., like those
of fractional Brownian motion. A short review of the requirements for
fractional Brownian motion is given for clarity, and we explain why the usual
simple argument that H unequal to 1/2 implies correlations fails for Markov
processes with scaling solutions. Finally, we discuss the question of scaling
of the full Green function g(x,t;x',t') of the Fokker-Planck pde.

been proposed based on quantum hydrodynamics and elasticity theory: (a) using
the current as basic variable (C-TDDFT) [G. Vignale, C. A. Ullrich, and S.

a framework for the design of more efficient algorithms to simulate complex

excess of low-frequency, collective excitations seen in the vibrational
spectrum. This anomalous feature becomes more pronounced closest to the jamming
transition, such that $S(0) \to 0$ at the transition point. We introduce an
appropriate dispersion relation that accounts for these phenomena that leads us
to relate these structural features to characteristic length scales associated
with the low-frequency vibrational modes of these systems. When the particles
are frictional, this anomalous behavior is suppressed providing yet more
evidence that jamming transitions of frictional spheres lie at lower packing

the SCBA solves a boson-holon model, where a holon couples to phonons and
magnons. Comparison with exact diagonalization results for the t-J model
suggests that the SCBA describes the electron-phonon interaction fairly
accurately over a substantial range of J/t values. Exact diagonalization of the
boson-holon model shows that the deviations are mainly due to the neglect of
vertex corrections for small J/t and due to the replacement of the t-J model by
the boson-holon model for large J/t. For typical values of J/t, the
electron-phonon part Sigma_ep of the electron self-energy has comparable
contributions from the second order diagram in the electron-phonon interaction
and a phonon induced change of magnon diagrams. A very simple approximation to
Sigma_ep gives a rather accurate effective mass. Using this approximation, we
study the factors influencing the electron-phonon interaction. Typically, we
find that the magnons nominally have a stronger coupling to the holon than the
phonons. The phonons, nevertheless, drive the formation of small polarons
(self-localization) due to important differences between the character of the
phonon and magnon couplings.

inject spin into a semiconductor with 100% efficiency if either the ferromagnet
is an ideal half metal with 100% spin polarization, or there exists a suitable
tunnel barrier at the interface. In this paper, we show that, at absolute zero
temperature, 100% spin injection efficiency from a non-ideal metal ferromagnet
into a semiconductor quantum wire can be reached at certain injection energies,
without a tunnel barrier, provided there is an axial magnetic field along the
direction of current flow as well as a spin orbit interaction in the
semiconductor. At these injection energies, spin is injected only from the
majority spin band of the ferromagnetic contact, resulting in 100% spin
injection efficiency. This happens because of the presence of antiresonances in
the transmission coefficient of the minority spins when their incident energies
coincide with Zeeman energy states in the quantum wire.
  At absolute zero and below a critical value of the axial magnetic field,
there are two distinct Zeeman energy states and therefore two injection
energies at which ideal spin filtering is possible; above the critical magnetic
field there is only one such injection energy. The spin injection efficiency
rapidly decreases as the temperature increases. The rate of decrease is slower
when the magnetic field is above the critical value. The appropriate choice of
semiconductor materials and structures necessary to maintain a large spin
injection efficiency at elevated temperatures is discussed.

for building the receiver using traditional belief propagation or tree search

focus is on the low SNR and low outage probability regime, where the adverse
impact of fading is greatest but so are the potential gains from cooperation.
We showed that while the standard Amplify-Forward protocol performs very poorly

protocol is optimal and achieves the outage capacity of the network. Moreover,
this performance can be achieved without a priori channel knowledge at the

creation of data storage systems of the next generation. ORM starts from the
requirement that information in a relational database is represented by a set
of relation values. Accordingly, it is assumed that the information about any
entity of an enterprise must also be represented as a set of relation values
(the ORM main requirement). A system of types is introduced, which allows one
to fulfill the main requirement. The data are represented in the form of
complex objects, and the state of any object is described as a set of relation
values. Emphasize that the types describing the objects are encapsulated,
inherited, and polymorphic. Then, it is shown that the data represented as a
set of such objects may also be represented as a set of relational values
defined on the set of scalar domains (dual data representation). In the general
case, any class is associated with a set of relation variables (R-variables)
each one containing some data about all objects of this class existing in the
system. One of the key points is the fact that the usage of complex (from the
user's viewpoint) refined names of R-variables and their attributes makes it
possible to preserve the semantics of complex data structures represented in
the form of a set of relation values. The most important part of the data
storage system created on the approach proposed is an object-oriented
translator operating over a relational DBMS. The expressiveness of such a
system is comparable with that of OO programming languages.

$\Psi_{2} \sim t^{-(\ell + 1/2)} \sin{m t}$, while at asymptotically late times

decay for high enough $m$. Numerical and analytical results are found for these

Yang-Mills field theories in four dimensional Lorentz curved spacetimes. Each
one of these tetrads diagonalizes separately and explicitly each term of the
Yang-Mills stress-energy tensor. Therefore, three pairs of planes also known as
blades, can be defined, and make up the underlying geometrical structure, at
each point. These tetrad vectors are gauge dependent on one hand, and also in
their definition, there is an additional inherent freedom in the choice of two
vector fields. In order to get rid of the gauge dependence, another set of
tetrads is defined, such that the only choice we have to make is for the two
vector fields. A particular choice is made for these two vector fields such
that they are gauge dependent, but the transformation properties of these
tetrads are analogous to those already known for curved spacetimes where only
electromagnetic fields are present. This analogy allows to establish group
isomorphisms between the local gauge group SU(2), and the tensor product of the
groups of local Lorentz tetrad transformations, either on blade one or blade
two. These theorems show explicitly that the local internal groups of
transformations are isomorphic to local spacetime groups of transformations. As
an example of application of these new tetrads, we exhibit three new gauge
invariant objects, and using these objects we show how to diagonalize the
Yang-Mills stress-energy tensor in a gauge invariant way.

D74 (2006) 025012","10.1103/PhysRevD.74.025012",,"hep-th astro-ph cond-mat.other",,"  A classical analysis suggests that an external magnetic field can cause
trajectories of charge carriers on a superconducting domain wall or cosmic
string to bend, thus expelling charge carriers with energy above the mass
threshold into the bulk. We study this process by solving the Dirac equation
for a fermion of mass $m_f$ and charge $e$, in the background of a domain wall
and a magnetic field of strength $B$. We find that the modes of the charge
carriers get shifted into the bulk, in agreement with classical expectations.
However the dispersion relation for the zero modes changes dramatically --
instead of the usual linear dispersion relation, $\omega_k =k$, the new
dispersion relation is well fit by $\omega \approx m_f tanh(k/k_*)$ where
$k_*=m_f$ for a thin wall in the weak field limit, and $k_*=eBw$ for a thick
wall of width $w$. This result shows that the energy of the charge carriers on
the domain wall remains below the threshold for expulsion even in the presence
of an external magnetic field. If charge carriers are expelled due to an
additional perturbation, they are most likely to be ejected at the threshold
energy $\sim m_f$.

partition of a relativistic QFT system is established by using methods of the

payed to the subleading terms in the entropy in different dimensions and to
behaviour in different states. It is conjectured, on the base of relation
between the entropy and the action, that in a fundamental theory the ground
state entanglement entropy per unit area equals $1/(4G_N)$, where $G_N$ is the
Newton constant in the low-energy gravity sector of the theory. The conjecture
opens a new avenue in analogue gravity models. For instance, in higher
dimensional condensed matter systems, which near a critical point are described
by relativistic QFT's, the entanglement entropy density defines an effective
gravitational coupling. By studying the properties of this constant one can get
new insights in quantum gravity phenomena, such as the universality of the

integral representation of the matrix permanent some explicit results are
provided for several random matrix ensembles. When compared with the

striking similarities and interesting differences. Based on these findings, we
conjecture the asymptotic forms of the density of permanental roots in the

robust method proposed here is a cross-validation method that discounts the
extreme prediction errors. In large samples the robust method chooses
consistent bandwidths, and the consistency of the method is practically
independent of the form in which extreme prediction errors are discounted.
Additionally, evaluation of the method's finite sample behavior in a simulation
demonstrates that the proposed method performs favorably. This method can also
be applied to other problems, for example, model selection, that require

The high density equation of state can be probed in HI collisions and applied
to the hot protoneutron star formed in core collapse supernovae. The Parity
Radius Experiment (PREX) aims to accurately measure the neutron radius of
$^{208}$Pb with parity violating electron scattering. This determines the
pressure of neutron rich matter and the density dependence of the symmetry
energy. Competition between nuclear attraction and coulomb repulsion can form
exotic shapes called nuclear pasta in neutron star crusts and supernovae. This
competition can be probed with multifragmentation HI reactions. We use large
scale semiclassical simulations to study nonuniform neutron rich matter in
supernovae. We find that the coulomb interactions in astrophysical systems
suppress density fluctuations. As a result, there is no first order liquid
vapor phase transition. Finally, the virial expansion for low density matter
shows that the nuclear vapor phase is complex with significant concentrations
of alpha particles and other light nuclei in addition to free nucleons.

introducing general projection operators for hard and soft quark and gluon

such as the Hard Thermal Loop/ Hard Dense Loop Effective Theories as well as
the High Density Effective Theory by Hong and Schaefer. I then apply the
effective theory to cold and dense quark matter and show how it can be utilized
to simplify the weak-coupling solution of the color-superconducting gap
equation. In general, one considers as relevant quark degrees of freedom those
within a thin layer of width 2 Lambda_q around the Fermi surface and as
relevant gluon degrees of freedom those with 3-momenta less than Lambda_gl. It
turns out that it is necessary to choose Lambda_q << Lambda_gl, i.e.,
scattering of quarks along the Fermi surface is the dominant process. Moreover,
this special choice of the two cutoff parameters Lambda_q and Lambda_gl
facilitates the power-counting of the numerous contributions in the
gap-equation. In addition, it is demonstrated that both the energy and the
momentum dependence of the gap function has to be treated self-consistently in
order to determine the imaginary part of the gap function. For quarks close to

that the distribution of log-returns is Laplacian $f_Z(z) \sim

More recently, localization of polar excitations in nanostructured
metal-dielectric films (also known as random planar composite) has been subject
of intense studies. Potential applications of planar composites include local
near-field microscopy and spectroscopy. A number of previous studies have
relied on the quasistatic approximation and a direct analogy with localization
of electrons in disordered solids. Here I consider the localization problem
without the quasistatic approximation. I show that localization of polar
excitations is characterized by algebraic rather than by exponential spatial
confinement. This result is also valid in two and three dimensions. I also show
that the previously used localization criterion based on the gyration radius of
eigenmodes is inconsistent with both exponential and algebraic localization. An
alternative criterion based on the dipole participation number is proposed.
Numerical demonstration of a localization-delocalization transition is given.
Finally, it is shown that, contrary to the previous belief, localized modes can
be effectively coupled to running waves.

conspecifics can raise their tail, which is very similar to a morphine-induced
Straub tail response. Since this response is a typical index of opiate
activation, it has been proposed that the opioidergic systems of such mice are
chronically activated. This activation appeared to be a potent factor, which
leads to addiction to aggression. To check this hypothesis, we exposed the mice
who had won 20 fights in succession with conspecifics to a behavioral
sensitization procedure. The effects of the mu-opioid receptor agonist morphine
(10 mg/kg, i.p.) on the behavior of winners were examined in an open-field test
before and after 5- and 14-day deprivation of aggression. Morphine had a much
stronger stimulating effect on the open-field behavior of 60 % of the winners
deprived of aggression for 14 days than on that of the control mice. Morphine
did not stimulate behavioral activity in the winners before or after
deprivation for 5 days. The aggression level in the winners was higher after
than before deprivation. It has been concluded that, in the winners, the
mu-opioid receptors became tolerant to the effects of morphine and became
sensitized after long aggression deprivation. The development of addiction to
aggression due to repeated victories is discussed in the light of the theory of

suppresses the explosion of the growth rate which occurs in the deterministic
counterpart. Instead, in different parameter regimes populations will grow with
``anomalous'' stochastic rates and (i) stabilise at ``random carrying
capacities'', or (ii) go extinct in random times. Using logistic fits to
reconstruct the simulated data, we find that even highly significant
estimations do not recover or reflect information about the deterministic part
of the process. Therefore, the logistic interpretation is not biologically
meaningful. These results have implications for distinct model-aided
calculations in biological situations because these kinds of estimations could
lead to spurious conclusions.

sn(y,m) is a Jacobi elliptic function with modulus parameter m, and there are
four real parameters a,b,f,g. First, we derive two new duality relations which,
when coupled with a previously obtained duality relation, permit us to relate
the band edge eigenstates of the 24 potentials obtained by permutations of the
four parameters a,b,f,g. Second, we pose and answer the question: how many
independent potentials are there with a finite number ""a"" of band gaps when
a,b,f,g are integers? For these potentials, we clarify the nature of the band
edge eigenfunctions. We also obtain several analytic results when at least one
of the four parameters is a half-integer. As a by-product, we also obtain new
solutions of Heun's differential equation.

subjected to a sequence of periodic pulses from an external, parabolic,
magnetic field. We show that, for experimentally reasonable parameters, a pair
of counter-propagating coherent states are ejected from the centre of the
chain. We find an illuminating correspondence with the quantum time evolution
of the well-known paradigm of quantum chaos, the Quantum Kicked Rotor (QKR).
  From this we can analyse the entanglement production and interpret the
ejected coherent states as a manifestation of so-called `accelerator modes' of
a classically chaotic system.

"quant-ph/0602107","Hugo Cable","Hugo Cable","Localising Relational Degrees of Freedom in Quantum Mechanics","PhD thesis, 130 pages",,,,"quant-ph",,"  This thesis presents a wide-ranging study of localising relational degrees of
freedom. Three physical systems are studied in depth, each built upon a simple
measurement-based process. For each physical system - light from independent
sources leaking onto a beam splitter monitored by photodetectors, spatially
interfering Bose-Einstein condensates extracted from separate preparation
procedures, and delocalised massive particles or mirrors scattering light which
is detected in the far-field - the thesis investigates the key features of the
underlying process of localisation, and explores the properties of the induced
post-measurement states of the system. A range of analytical and numerical
methods are used. Many new results are presented - for example, cases of mixed
initial states are considered in addition to the more commonly considered pure
states. Up to now there has been little attempt to develop in detail the themes
common to studies concerned with specific physical examples. This thesis
addresses this, and sets out a ""modus operandi"" that can be applied widely. A
variety of specific applications are considered - both in the context of
controlled laboratory experiments, and with a view to understanding processes
occurring in nature. The thesis is introduced and summarised in Chapter 1.
Chapter 2 studies localising relative optical phase in the canonical
interference process. This discussion is extended and applied in Chapter 3.
Chapter 4 discusses localising relative atomic phase in interference
experiments with Bose-Einstein condensates. The emergence of relative positions
between particles scattering light is explored in Chapter 5. The thesis
concludes with an Outlook, Chapter 6.

the asymptotic framework. The degree of the security has not been discussed in
the finite coding-length framework, sufficiently. However, to guarantee any
implemented QKD system requires, it is needed to evaluate a protocol with a
finite coding-length. For this purpose, we derive a tight upper bound of the
eavesdropper's information. This bound is better than existing bounds. We also
obtain the exponential rate of the eavesdropper's information. Further, we
approximate our bound by using the normal distribution.
