Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys High Resolution Camera to account for
host-galaxy starlight contamination of measured AGN luminosities. We measure
the host-galaxy starlight contribution to the continuum luminosity at 5100 A
through the typical ground-based slit position and geometry used in the
reverberation-mapping campaigns. We find that removing the starlight
contribution results in a significant correction to the luminosity of each AGN,
both for lower luminosity sources, as expected, but also for the higher
luminosity sources such as the PG quasars. After accounting for the host galaxy
starlight, we revisit the well-known broad-line region radius--luminosity
relationship for nearby AGN. We find the power-law slope of the relationship
for the H beta line to be 0.518 +/- 0.039, shallower than previously reported
and consistent with the slope of 0.5 expected from the naive theoretical
assumption that all AGN have, on average, the same ionizing spectrum and the
same ionization parameter and gas density in the H beta line-emitting region.

method in the framework of classical statistical mechanics and then we show how

The formalism of two-time Green functions in classical statistical mechanics is
presented in a form parallel to the well known quantum counterpart, focusing on
the spectral properties which involve the important concept of spectral
density. Furthermore, the general ingredients of the classical spectral density
method (CSDM) are presented with insights for systematic nonperturbative
approximations to study conveniently the macroscopic properties of a wide
variety of classical many-body systems also involving phase transitions. The
method is implemented by means of key ideas for exploring the spectrum of
elementary excitations and the damping effects within a unified formalism.
Then, the effectiveness of the CSDM is tested with explicit calculations for
the classical $d$-dimensional spin-$S$ Heisenberg ferromagnetic model with
long-range exchange interactions decaying as $r^{-p}$ ($p>d$) with distance $r$
between spins and in the presence of an external magnetic field. The analysis
of the thermodynamic and critical properties, performed by means of the CSDM to
the lowest order of approximation, shows clearly that nontrivial results can be
obtained in a relatively simple manner already to this lower stage. The basic
spectral density equations for the next higher order level are also presented
and the damping of elementary spin excitations in the low temperature regime is
studied. The results appear in reasonable agreement with available exact ones
and Monte Carlo simulations and this supports the CSDM as a promising method of
investigation in classical many-body theory.

turbulence with periodic boundary conditions in all directions and a volume
forcing of the temperature field by a mean gradient, has a family of exact,
exponentially growing, separable solutions of the full non-linear system of
equations. These solutions are clearly manifest in numerical simulations above
a computable critical value of the Rayleigh number. In our numerical
simulations they are subject to secondary numerical noise and resolution
dependent instabilities that limit their growth to produce statistically steady
turbulent transport.

  precursor method","6 pages, 5 figures",,,,"physics.chem-ph",,"  Mg-Cu-Zn ferrite was prepared through a wet synthetic method by a
self-combustion reaction directly from a citrate precursor. The as-synthesized
powders were sintered at for only 2h. XRD patterns and FTIR spectra confirm the
formation of single phase Mg-Cu-Zn ferrite after combustion. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first time that Mg-Cu-Zn ferrite is sintered at such low
temperature. The sintering process increased the crystallinity of the solid and
the domain sizes.
