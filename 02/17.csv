follow the formation of disk galaxies with rotational velocities between 135

star formation, the effects of a uniform UV background and a physically
motivated description of feedback from supernovae. The host dark matter halos
have a spin and last major merger redshift typical of galaxy sized halos as
measured in recent large scale N--Body simulations. The simulated galaxies form
rotationally supported disks with realistic exponential scale lengths and fall
on both the I-band and baryonic Tully Fisher relations. An extended stellar
disk forms inside the Milky Way sized halo immediately after the last major
merger. The combination of UV background and SN feedback drastically reduces
the number of visible satellites orbiting inside a Milky Way sized halo,
bringing it in fair agreement with observations. Our simulations predict that
the average age of a primary galaxy's stellar population decreases with mass,
because feedback delays star formation in less massive galaxies. Galaxies have
stellar masses and current star formation rates as a function of total mass
that are in good agreement with observational data. We discuss how both high
mass and force resolution and a realistic description of star formation and
feedback are important ingredients to match the observed properties of
galaxies.

are essential to test the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. The cosmological
model predicts a universal shape for the density profile in all halos,
independent of halo mass. Its profile has a `cuspy' centre, with no evidence
for the constant density core. In this paper we carry out a careful analysis of
twelve galaxy clusters, using Chandra data to compute the mass distribution in
each system under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. Due to their low
concentration, clusters provide ideal objects for studying the central cusps in
dark matter halos. The majority of the systems are consistent with the CDM
model, but 4 objects exhibit flat inner density profiles. We suggest that the
flat inner profile found for these clusters is due to an underestimation of the
mass in the cluster centre (rather than any problem with the CDM model), since
these objects also have a centrally peaked gas mass fraction. We discuss
possible causes for erroneously low mass measurements in the cores of some
systems.

about a decade larger or with comparable radio-luminosities but redshifts
around z~0.4. These samples are used to investigate the possible evolution of
depolarisation and rotation measure properties with redshift and radio
luminosity independently. I use the \citet{kat97} model with 3 flux
measurements to estimate the density of the source environment, source age and
jet power. Depolarisation and variations in the rotation measure were found to
be insensitive to changes in the density of the source environment. This
indicates that depolarisation and variations in the rotation measure are not
density indicators but map how the disorder in the magnetic field changes with
redshift. The model is then used on a larger set of FRII sources taken from the
complete 3CRR, 6CE and 7C III samples. I find that the density of the source
environment is a strong function of the source radio-luminosity but is
insensitive to changes in redshift. The jet power is also a strong function of
radio-luminosity but also a weak function of redshift. This indicates that the
mass of the black-hole powering FRII sources is epoch dependent. In general, I
find that the source environment is dominated by changes in the
radio-luminosity but is relatively unaffected by changes in cosmic epoch.

reionization (EoR), corresponding to the formation epoch of the first luminous
objects. Studies of Gunn-Peterson (GP) absorption, and related phenomena,
suggest a qualitative change in the state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at
$z \sim 6$, indicating a rapid increase in the neutral fraction of the IGM,
from $x_{HI} < 10^{-4}$ at $z \le 5.5$, to $x_{HI} > 10^{-3}$, perhaps up to
0.1, at $z \ge 6$. Conversely, transmission spikes in the GP trough, and the
evolution of the \lya galaxy luminosity function indicate $x_{HI} < 0.5$ at
$z\sim 6.5$, while the large scale polarization of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) implies a significant ionization fraction extending to higher
redshifts, $z \sim 11 \pm 3$. The results suggest that reionization is less an
event than a process, with the process beginning as early as $z \sim 14$, and
with the 'percolation', or 'overlap' phase ending at $z \sim 6$. The data are
consistent with low luminosity star forming galaxies as being the dominant
sources of reionizing photons. Low frequency radio telescopes currently under
construction should be able to make the first direct measurements of HI 21cm
emission from the neutral IGM during the EoR, and upcoming measurements of
secondary CMB temperature anisotropy will provide fine details of the dynamics
of the reionized IGM.

energy within a finite volume is taken into account. For the Virgo cluster, we
find that the AGN power derived from the effervescent heating model is in good
agreement with the observed jet power.

radio-FIR correlation is clearly better than the correlation of the cold gas
tracers with either the radio or the FIR emission. For the LMC as a whole,
there is a tight correlation between the radio and FIR emission on spatial
scales above ~50 pc. By decomposing the radio emission into thermal and
non-thermal components, however, we show that the scale on which the radio-FIR
correlation breaks down is inversely proportional to the thermal fraction of
the radio emission: regions that show a strong correlation to very small scales
are the same regions where the thermal fraction of the radio emission is high.
Contrary to previous studies of the local radio-FIR correlation in the LMC, we
show that the slope of the relation between the radio and FIR emission is
non-linear. In bright star-forming regions, the radio emission increases faster
than linearly with respect to the FIR emission (power-law slope of ~1.2),
whereas a flatter slope of ~0.6-0.9 applies more generally across the LMC. Our
results are consistent with a scenario in which the UV photons and cosmic rays
in the LMC have a common origin in massive star formation, but the cosmic rays
are able to diffuse away from their production sites. Our results do not
provide direct evidence for coupling between the magnetic field and the local
gas density, but we note that synchrotron emission may not be a good tracer of
the magnetic field if cosmic rays can readily escape the LMC.

This evolution is driven by the explosions of Type II and Type Ia supernovae,
whose different contribution is explicity taken into account in our models. We
compare our results with detailed observations of the Draco galaxy. We assume
star formation histories consisting of a number of instantaneous burst
separated by quiescent periods. Because of the large effectiveness of the
radiative losses and the extended dark matter halo, no galactic wind develops,
despite the total energy released by the supernovae is much larger than the
binding energy of the gas. This explains why the galaxy is able to form stars
for a long period (> 3 Gyr), consistently with observations. In this picture,
the end of the star formation and gas removal must result from external
mechanisms, such as ram pressure and/or tidal interaction with the Galaxy. The
metallicity distributions of the stars found in our models agree very well with
the observed one. We find a mean value <[Fe/H]>=-1.65 with a spread of ~1.5
dex. The chemical properties of the stars derive by the different temporal
evolution between Type Ia and Type II supernova rate, and by the different
mixing of the metals produced by the two types of SNe. We reproduce
successfully the observed [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] diagram. However, our interpretation of
this diagram differs from that generally adopted by previous chemical models.
In fact, we find that the chemical properties of the stars derive, besides the
different temporal evolution of the SNe II and SNe Ia rates, from the spatial
inhomogeneous chemical enrichment due to the different dynamical behaviour
between the remnants of the two types of supernovae.

self-consistently the latest prescriptions for the transport of angular
momentum by meridional circulation and shear turbulence in stellar interiors as
well as the associated mixing processes for chemicals computed from the ZAMS to
the upper RGB. We discuss in details the uncertainties associated with the
physical description of the rotational mixing and study carefully their effects
on the rotation profile, diffusion coefficients, structural evolution,
lifetimes and chemical signatures at the stellar surface. We focus in
particular on the various assumptions concerning the rotation law in the
convective envelope, the initial rotation velocity distribution, the presence
of mean molecular weight gradients and the treatment of the horizontal and
vertical turbulence. This exploration leads to two main conclusions : (1) After
the completion of the first dredge-up, the degree of differential rotation (and
hence mixing) is maximised in the case of a differentially rotating convective
envelope (i.e., j_CE(r) = cst), as anticipated in previous studies. (2) Even
with this assumption, and contrary to some previous claims, the present
treatment for the evolution of the rotation profile and associated meridional
circulation and shear turbulence does not lead to enough mixing of chemicals to
explain the abundance anomalies in low-metallicity field and globular cluster
RGB stars observed around the bump luminosity. This study raises questions that
need to be addressed in a near future. These include for example the
interaction between rotation and convection and the trigger of additional
hydrodynamical instabilities.

We obtain the best energy resolution ever achieved with APDs, 6.4 % for 5.9 keV
X-rays, and obtain the energy threshold as low as 0.5 keV measured at -20deg.
Thanks to its fast timing response, signal carriers in the APD device are
collected within a short time interval of 1.9 nsec (FWHM). This type of APDs
can therefore be used as a low-energy, high-counting particle monitor onboard
the forthcoming Pico-satellite Cute1.7. As a scintillation photon detector,
reverse-type APDs have a good advantage of reducing the dark noise
significantly. The best FWHM energy resolutions of 9.4+-0.3 % and 4.9+-0.2 %
were obtained for 59.5 keV and 662 keV Gamma-rays, respectively, as measured
with a CsI(Tl) crystal. Combination of APDs with various other scintillators
(BGO, GSO, and YAP) also showed better results than that obtained with a
photomultiplier tube (PMT). These results suggest that APD could be a promising
device for replacing traditional PMT usage in some applications. In particular

a wide-band X-ray and Gamma-ray imaging detector in future space research and

that in most cases the power law relationship between the pulse width and

check this prediction with two GRB samples which contain well identified
pulses. A power law anti-correlation between the full pulse width and energy
and a power law correlation between the pulse width ratio and energy are seen
in the light curves of the majority (around 65%) of bursts of the two samples
within the energy range of BATSE, suggesting that these bursts are likely to
arise from the emission associated with the shocks occurred on a
relativistically expanding fireball surface. For the rest of the bursts, the
relationships between these quantities were not predicted previously. We
propose to consider other spectral evolutionary patterns or other radiation
mechanisms such as a varying synchrotron or Comptonized spectrum to check if
the observed relationships for these rest bursts can also be accounted for by
the Doppler model. In addition, we find that the upper limits of the width
ratio for the two samples do not exceed 0.9, in agrement with what predicted
previously by the Doppler model. The plateau/power law/plateau and the peaked
features predicted and detected previously by Qin et al. are generally
observed, with the exceptions being noticed only in a few cases. According to
the distinct values of two power law indices of FWHM and ratio and energy, we
divide the bursts into three subsets which are located in different areas of

point. They characterize the structure of the correlated liquid and provide
information on quantum effects present in this Bose fluid. Numerical
calculations employ Correlated Density-Matrix(CDM)theory and Path-Integral
Monte-Carlo(PIMC)simulations. A comparison of these theoretical results
demonstrates the accuracy of CDM theory. This algorithm therefore permits a
fast and efficient quantitative analysis of the normal phase of liquid
para-hydrogen.We compare and discuss the theoretical results with available

fixed unknown distribution law P called a stochastic language, an usual goal in
Grammatical Inference is to infer an estimate of P in some class of
probabilistic models, such as Probabilistic Automata (PA). Here, we study the
class of rational stochastic languages, which consists in stochastic languages
that can be generated by Multiplicity Automata (MA) and which strictly includes
the class of stochastic languages generated by PA. Rational stochastic
languages have minimal normal representation which may be very concise, and
whose parameters can be efficiently estimated from stochastic samples. We
design an efficient inference algorithm DEES which aims at building a minimal
normal representation of the target. Despite the fact that no recursively
enumerable class of MA computes exactly the set of rational stochastic
languages over Q, we show that DEES strongly identifies tis set in the limit.
We study the intermediary MA output by DEES and show that they compute rational
series which converge absolutely to one and which can be used to provide
stochastic languages which closely estimate the target.

decay of the massive inflaton particles, which is necessary for the transition
to radiation domination. We found that typically the trilinear term is
subdominant during early stages of preheating, but it actually amplifies
parametric resonance driven by the four-legs interaction. In cases where the
trilinear term does dominate during preheating, the process occurs through
periodic tachyonic amplifications with resonance effects, which is so effective
that preheating completes within a few inflaton oscillations. We develop an
analytic theory of this process, which we call tachyonic resonance. We also
study numerically the influence of trilinear interactions on the dynamics after
preheating. The trilinear term eventually comes to dominate after preheating,
leading to faster rescattering and thermalization than could occur without it.
Finally, we investigate the role of non-renormalizable interaction terms during
preheating. We find that if they are present they generally dominate (while
still in a controllable regime) in chaotic inflation models. Preheating due to
these terms proceeds through a modified form of tachyonic resonance.

Au + Au data at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV is found in a Relativistic Diffusion Model
with three sources for particle production. Only the midrapidity source comes
very close to local equilibrium, whereas the analyses of the overall
pseudorapidity distributions show that the systems remain far from statistical
equilibrium.

However, with the continuously increasing precision of the data, some of its
functionality has become insufficient. One of the requirements is the
implementation of decays into five mesons plus a neutrino with a realistic
decay amplitude. This note describes a step into this direction. For the 2pi-
pi+ 2pi0 mode the three decay chains tau- --> a_1- nu --> rho- (--> pi- pi0)
omega (--> pi- pi+ pi0) nu, tau- --> a_1- nu --> a_1- (--> 2pi- pi+) f_0 (-->
2pi0) nu, and tau- --> a_1- nu --> a_1- (--> pi- 2pi0) f_0 (--> pi + pi-) nu
are introduced with simple assumptions about the couplings and propagators of
the various resonances. Similar amplitudes (without the rho omega
contributions) are adopted for the pi- 4pi0 and 3pi- 2pi+ modes.
  The five-pion amplitude is thus based on a simple model, which, however, can
be considered as a first realistic example. Phase-space generation includes the
possibility of presampling the omega and a_1 resonances, in one channel only,
however. This is probably sufficient for the time being, both for physics
applications and for tests.
  The technical test of the new part of the generator is performed by comparing
Monte Carlo and analytical results. To this end a non-realistic, but easy to
calculate, purely scalar amplitude for the decay into five massless pions was
used.

relate the analytic Dirac index with a topological index, which can be

representations V(p), with p any positive integer. Then, the notion of Wigner
Quantum Oscillators (WQOs) is recalled. In these quantum oscillator models, the
unitary representations of gl(1|DN) are physical state spaces of the N-particle
D-dimensional oscillator. So far, physical properties of gl(1|DN) WQOs were
described only in the so-called Fock spaces W(p), leading to interesting
concepts such as non-commutative coordinates and a discrete spatial structure.
Here, we describe physical properties of WQOs for other unitary
representations, including certain representations V(p) of gl(1|DN). These new
solutions again have remarkable properties following from the spectrum of the
Hamiltonian and of the position, momentum, and angular momentum operators.
Formulae are obtained that give the angular momentum content of all the
representations V(p) of gl(1|3N), associated with the N-particle 3-dimensional
WQO. For these representations V(p) we also consider in more detail the
spectrum of the position operators and their squares, leading to interesting
consequences. In particular, a classical limit of these solutions is obtained,

Fisher proposed for inductive reasoning the use of the fiducial distribution, a
parameter-space distribution of epistemological probability transferred
directly from limiting relative frequencies rather than computed according to
the Bayes update rule. The proposal is developed as follows using the
confidence measure of a scalar parameter of interest. (With the restriction to
one-dimensional parameter space, a confidence measure is essentially a fiducial
probability distribution free of complications involving ancillary statistics.)
  A betting game establishes a sense in which confidence measures are the only
reliable inferential probability distributions. The equality between the
probabilities encoded in a confidence measure and the coverage rates of the
corresponding confidence intervals ensures that the measure's rule for
assigning confidence levels to hypotheses is uniquely minimax in the game.
  Although a confidence measure can be computed without any prior distribution,
previous knowledge can be incorporated into confidence-based reasoning. To
adjust a p-value or confidence interval for prior information, the confidence
measure from the observed data can be combined with one or more independent
confidence measures representing previous agent opinion. (The former confidence
measure may correspond to a posterior distribution with frequentist matching of
coverage probabilities.) The representation of subjective knowledge in terms of
confidence measures rather than prior probability distributions preserves
approximate frequentist validity.

hadrons at high baryon and isospin densities reached in heavy ion collisions.
We focus our attention on the role played by the nucleon symmetry energy at
high density.In this respect the inclusion of a scalar isovector meson, the
\delta-coupling, in the Hadron Lagrangian appears rather important. We study in
detail the formation of a drop of quark matter in the mixed phase, and we
discuss the effects on the quark drop nucleation probability of the finite size
and finite time duration of the high density region. We find that, if the
parameters of quark models are fixed so that the existence of quark stars is
allowed, then the density at which a mixed phase starts forming drops
dramatically in the range Z/A \sim 0.3--0.4. This opens the possibility to
verify the Witten-Bodmer hypothesis on absolute stability of quark matter using
ground-based experiments in which neutron-rich nuclei are employed. These
experiments can also provide rather stringent constraints on the Equation of
State (EoS) to be used for describing the pre-Supernova gravitational collapse.
Consistent simulations of neutron rich heavy ion collisions are performed in

phase noise spectral density, and as a floor on the Allan variance plot,
originates from two basic phenomena, namely: (1) the 1/f phase noise turned
into 1/f frequency noise via the Leeson effect, and (2) the 1/f fluctuation of
the resonator natural frequency. The discussion on which is the dominant
effect, thus on how to improve the stability of the oscillator, has been going
on for years without giving a clear answer. This article tackles the question
by analyzing the phase noise spectrum of several commercial oscillators and
laboratory prototypes, and demonstrates that the fluctuation of the resonator
natural frequency is the dominant effect. The investigation method starts from
reverse engineering the oscillator phase noise in order to show that if the
Leeson effect was dominant, the resonator merit factor Q would be too low as
compared to the available technology.

related to a global gauge symmetry of the Klein-Gordon fields whose gauge group
is U(1) for rational a and the multiplicative group of positive real numbers

from the fact that the probability current density for free scalar fields is
