nearly exact likelihood functions can be written down for galaxy cluster

simplifications that are not possible for galaxy surveys. An application to

cloud. Nearly 11 square degrees, including all of the area in the cloud with
visual extinction more than 3 magnitudes, was mapped at 1.1 mm with Bolocam on
the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO). By design, the map also covers the
region mapped in the infrared with the Spitzer Space Telescope. We detect 44
definite sources, and a few likely sources are also seen along a filament in
the eastern streamer. The map indicates that dense cores in Ophiuchus are very
clustered and often found in filaments within the cloud. Most sources are
round, as measured at the half power point, but elongated when measured at
lower contour levels, suggesting spherical sources lying within filaments. The
masses, for an assumed dust temperature of 10 K, range from 0.24 to 3.9 solar
masses, with a mean value of 0.96 solar masses. The total mass in distinct
cores is 42 solar masses, 0.5 to 2% of the total cloud mass, and the total mass
above 4 sigma is about 80 solar masses. The mean densities in the cores are
quite high, with an average of 1.6 x 10^6 per cc, suggesting short free-fall
times. The core mass distribution can be fitted with a power law with slope of
2.1 plus or minus 0.3 for M>0.5 solar masses, similar to that found in other
regions, but slightly shallower than that of some determinations of the local
IMF. In agreement with previous studies, our survey shows that dense cores
account for a very small fraction of the cloud volume and total mass. They are
nearly all confined to regions with visual extinction at least 9 mag, a lower
threshold than found previously.

inclined to the line-of-sight direction could cause systematic variations in

the phases and impair the coherence of acoustic waves (known as ""showerglass
effect""). We examine how these affect time-distance helioseismology
measurements. It is confirmed that the inclined magnetic field could cause
variations in acoustic travel times inside sunspot penumbra, however,
inversions of the measured times show that this effect only slightly shifts the
location of negative sound-speed variations near the solar surface, but does
not change the inverted deeper interior structures. Regarding to the
showerglass effect, we find that outgoing and incoming travel time
perturbations through sunspots are significantly smaller than those reported
from helioseismic holography. In addition, our second-skip cross-correlation
experiments demonstrate that inside sunspots, the half of the double-skip
travel times are very similar to the mean single-skip travel times. We conclude
that these surface magnetism effects do not cause considerable systematic
errors in time-distance helioseismology of active regions.

the approximation behavior of their elements using Local Fourier bases. In
analogy to the Local Fourier bases, we show that the modulation spaces can also
be characterized by the approximation behavior of their elements using Gabor
frames. We derive direct and inverse approximation theorems that describe the
best approximation by linear combinations of N terms of a given function using
its modulates and translates.

and the Hardy-Sobolev class as its special examples. Then, using these results,
we prove a Taikov type inequality, and calculate the exact values of

Under certain
conditions, the generalized functions can produce unpredictable dynamics. We
use the properties of the generalized functions to show that certain dynamical
systems can generate random dynamics. For instance, the chaotic Chua's circuit
coupled to a circuit with a non-invertible I-V characteristic can generate
unpredictable dynamics. In general, a nonperiodic time-series with truncated
exponential behavior can be converted into unpredictable dynamics using
non-invertible transformations. Using a new theoretical framework for chaos and
randomness, we investigate some classes of coupled map lattices. We show that,
in some cases, these systems can produce completely unpredictable dynamics. In
a similar fashion, we explain why some wellknown spatiotemporal systems have
been found to produce very complex dynamics in numerical simulations. We
discuss real physical systems that can generate random dynamics.

aspects of multi-partite entanglement. At the same time, they can be described
by a number of parameters that grows only moderately with the system size. They
have a variety of applications in quantum information theory, most prominently
as algorithmic resources in the context of the one-way quantum computer, but
also in other fields such as quantum error correction and multi-partite quantum
communication, as well as in the study of foundational issues such as
non-locality and decoherence. In this review, we give a tutorial introduction
into the theory of graph states. We introduce various equivalent ways how to
define graph states, and discuss the basic notions and properties of these
states. The focus of this review is on their entanglement properties. These
include aspects of non-locality, bi-partite and multi-partite entanglement and
its classification in terms of the Schmidt measure, the distillability
properties of mixed entangled states close to a pure graph state, as well as
the robustness of their entanglement under decoherence. We review some of the
known applications of graph states, as well as proposals for their experimental
implementation.
