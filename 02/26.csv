early (z approx 13) or late (z approx 8) depending on the Initial Mass Function

explored. For each of these models we produce synthetic HI 21 cm emission maps
by convolving the simulation outputs with the provisional LOFAR sampling
function in the frequency range 76-140 MHz. If reionization occurs late, LOFAR
will be able to detect individual HI structures on arcmin scales, emitting at a
brightness temperature of approx 35 mK as a 3-sigma signal in about 1000 hours
of observing time. In the case of early reionization, the detection would be
unlikely, due to decreased sensitivity and increased sky temperatures. These
results assume that ionospheric, interference and foreground issues are fully
under control.

algorithm. However, there is still room for improvement and exploration
regarding variants of the Huffman problem. Length-limited Huffman coding,
useful for many practical applications, is one such variant, for which codes
are restricted to the set of codes in which none of the $n$ codewords is longer
than a given length, $l_{\max}$. Binary length-limited coding can be done in
$O(n l_{\max})$ time and O(n) space via the widely used Package-Merge algorithm
and with even smaller asymptotic complexity using a lesser-known algorithm. In
this paper these algorithms are generalized without increasing complexity in
order to introduce a minimum codeword length constraint $l_{\min}$, to allow
for objective functions other than the minimization of expected codeword
length, and to be applicable to both binary and nonbinary codes; nonbinary
codes were previously addressed using a slower dynamic programming approach.
These extensions have various applications -- including fast decompression and
a modified version of the game ``Twenty Questions'' -- and can be used to solve
the problem of finding an optimal code with limited fringe, that is, finding
the best code among codes with a maximum difference between the longest and
shortest codewords. The previously proposed method for solving this problem was
nonpolynomial time, whereas solving this using the novel linear-space algorithm
requires only $O(n (l_{\max}- l_{\min})^2)$ time, or even less if $l_{\max}-
l_{\min}$ is not $O(\log n)$.

holographically dual to QCD (AdS/QCD). With the assumption that such a dual

asymptotically linear m^2 spectrum translates into a strong constraint on the

the fractal nature of sample trajectories is closely related to the fact that
the forward and backward time derivatives are different for these diffusions. A
new variational approach to stochastic mechanics based on trace dynamics is
introduced. It is shown that Yasue's method and Guerra and Morato's method can
both be generalized to allow for any diffusion constant in a stochastic model
of Schrodinger's equation, and that they can all also describe dissipative
diffusion. Then it is shown that the trace dynamical theory seems to only
describe dissipative diffusion unless an extra quantum mechanical potential
term is added to the Hamiltonian.
  The differential space theory of Wiener and Siegel is reconsidered as a
useful tool in this framework, and is generalized to stochastic processes
instead of deterministic ones for the hidden trajectories of observables. It is
