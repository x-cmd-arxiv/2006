relatively narrow cores to the iron K-alpha emission lines in active galactic
nuclei (AGN). Plausible origins for this core emission include the outer
regions of an accretion disk, a pc-scale molecular torus, and the optical
broad-line region (BLR). Using data from the literature it is shown that no
correlation exists between the Fe K-alpha core width and the BLR (specifically
H-beta) line width. This shows that in general the iron K-alpha core emission
does not arise from the BLR. There is a similar lack of correlation between the
width of the Fe K-alpha core and black hole mass. The average K-alpha width is
about a factor of two lower than the H-beta width. It therefore seems likely
that in many cases the narrow core arises in the torus. There is a very wide
range of observed Fe K-alpha core widths, however, and this argues for multiple
origins. The simplest explanation for the observed line profiles in AGN is that
they are due to a mixing of very narrow emission from the inner edge of the
torus, and broadened emission from the accretion disk, in varying proportions
from object-to-object.

approximated as a composite of several spectra, each produced by a plane

these spectra over the stellar surface, and hence the inferred effective
temperature and luminosity, will be dependent on the inclination of the
rotation axis of the star with respect to the observer, as well as the
temperature and gravity distribution on the stellar surface. Here we calculate
the surface conditions of rapidly rotating stars with a 2D stellar structure
and evolution code and compare the effective temperature distribution to that
predicted by von Zeipel's law. We calculate the composite spectrum for a
deformed star by interpolating within a grid of intensity spectra of plane
parallel model atmospheres and integrating over the surface of the star. Using
this method, we find that the deduced variation of effective temperature with
inclination can be as much as 3000 K for an early B star, depending on the
details of the underlying model.

The O VI systems unambiguously trace hot gas only in one case. For the 4 other
O VI systems, photoionization and collisional ionization models are viable
options to explain the observed column densities of the O VI and the other
ions. If the O VI systems are mostly photoionized, only a fraction of the
observed O VI will contribute to the baryonic density of the warm-hot ionized
medium (WHIM) along this line of sight. Combining our results with previous
ones, we show that there is a general increase of N(O VI) with increasing b(O
VI). Cooling flow models can reproduce the N-b distribution but fail to
reproduce the observed ionic ratios. A comparison of the number of O I, O II, O
III, O IV, and O VI systems per unit redshift show that the low-z IGM is more
highly ionized than weakly ionized. We confirm that photoionized O VI systems
show a decreasing ionization parameter with increasing H I column density. O VI
absorbers with collisional ionization/photoionization degeneracy follow this
relation, possibly suggesting that they are principally photoionized. We find
that the photoionized O VI systems in the low redshift IGM have a median
abundance of 0.3 solar. We do not find additional Ne VIII systems other than
the one found by Savage et al., although our sensitivity should have allowed
the detection of Ne VIII in O VI systems at T~(0.6-1.3)x10^6 K (if CIE
applies). Since the bulk of the WHIM is believed to be at temperatures T>10^6

the volume-averaged star-formation rate density since z ~ 1 is a result of
declining star-formation in disk galaxies rather than a disappearing population

explained by a doubling in the number of spheroidal galaxies since z ~ 1.2.

strong correlation between the 0.1-20 Hz frequencies of quasiperiodic
oscillations (QPOs) and the spectral index. Presence of two spectral phases
(states) are clearly seen in the data when the spectral indices saturate at low
and high values of QPO frequencies. This saturation effect was discovered
earlier in a number of black hole candidate (BHC) sources and now we strongly
confirm this phenomenon in Cyg X-1. In the soft state this index-QPO frequency
correlation shows a saturation of the photon index Gamma ~ 2.1 at high values
of the low frequency \nu_{L}. The saturation level of Gamma~ 2.1 is the lowest
value found yet in BHCs. The bolometric luminosity does not show clear
correlation with the index. We also show that Fe K_{\alpha} emission line
strength (equivalent width, EW) correlates with the QPO frequency. The EW
increases from 200 eV in the low/hard state to 1.5 keV in the high/soft state.
The observational correlations revealed compel us to propose a scenario for the
spectral transition and iron line formation which occur in BHC sources. We also

Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. For an assumed neutralino mass of 10 GeV and beam
size of 1'', the SZ temperature decrement is of the order of nano-Kelvin for
dSph models with a soft core. By contrast, it is of the order of micro-Kelvin
for the strongly cusped dSph models favoured by some cosmological simulations.
Although this is out of reach of current instruments, it may well be detectable
by future mm telescopes, such as ALMA. We also show that the upscattered CMB
photons have energies within reach of upcoming X-ray observatories, but that
the flux of such photons is too small to be detectable soon. Nonetheless, we
conclude that searching for the dark matter induced Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect is
a promising way of constraining the dark distribution in dSphs, especially if
the particles are light.

P03018 (2006)","10.1088/1742-5468/2006/03/P03018",,"cond-mat.other cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  We introduce an algorithm to systematically improve the efficiency of
parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations by optimizing the simulated
temperature set. Our approach is closely related to a recently introduced
adaptive algorithm that optimizes the simulated statistical ensemble in
generalized broad-histogram Monte Carlo simulations. Conventionally, a
temperature set is chosen in such a way that the acceptance rates for replica
swaps between adjacent temperatures are independent of the temperature and
large enough to ensure frequent swaps. In this paper, we show that by choosing
the temperatures with a modified version of the optimized ensemble feedback
method we can minimize the round-trip times between the lowest and highest
temperatures which effectively increases the efficiency of the parallel
tempering algorithm. In particular, the density of temperatures in the
optimized temperature set increases at the ""bottlenecks'' of the simulation,
such as phase transitions. In turn, the acceptance rates are now temperature
dependent in the optimized temperature ensemble. We illustrate the
feedback-optimized parallel tempering algorithm by studying the two-dimensional
Ising ferromagnet and the two-dimensional fully-frustrated Ising model, and
briefly discuss possible feedback schemes for systems that require
configurational averages, such as spin glasses.

measure exhibiting a power law spectrum given by stable laws of free random

(and correcting) the method by Bouchaud and Cizeau (BC), and of free random
Levy (FRL) rotationally invariant matrices by adapting results of free
probability calculus. We compare the two types of eigenvalue spectra. Both
ensembles are spectrally stable with respect to the matrix addition. The
discussed ensemble of FRL matrices is maximally random in the sense that it
maximizes Shannon's entropy. We find a perfect agreement between the
numerically sampled spectra and the analytical results already for matrices of
dimension N=100. The numerical spectra show very weak dependence on the matrix
size N as can be noticed by comparing spectra for N=400. After a pertinent
rescaling spectra of Wigner-Levy matrices and of symmetric FRL matrices have
the same tail behavior. As we discuss towards the end of the paper the
correlations of large eigenvalues in the two ensembles are however different.
We illustrate the relation between the two types of stability and show that the
addition of many randomly rotated Wigner-Levy matrices leads by a matrix
central limit theorem to FRL spectra, providing an explicit realization of the

the atomic sites are vertices of a rhombus tiling with edge 2.45 A. This phase
is found to be dominated by 13 A diameter decagon-shaped clusters, each with a
pentagon of Co atoms at the center. These, and another smaller cluster,
decorate vertices of a ``binary tiling'' with rhombus edge 10.4 A. Further
simulations with a restricted site list show that Al arrangements on the
borders of the 13 A decagon cluster form Hexagon, Boat, and Star tiles with
edge 2.45 A; they indicate specific sites for Co versus Ni atoms, and how the
structure adapts to small composition changes. In the second half of the paper,
relaxation (augmented by molecular dynamics annealing) is used to obtain
realistic structures. The dominant new feature is a set of linear ``channels''
attractive to Al atoms and running transverse to the layers. Each is typically
occupied by three atoms in four layers, implying puckering and a spontaneous
period doubling to c $\approx$ 8 A. Puckering favors pentagonal long range
order of the cluster orientations. Our simulation captures most features of the

bumps of the bimodal distribution correspond to different excitation energies
and similar temperatures. It is also shown that it is possible to correlate the
bimodality signal with a change in the distribution of the heaviest fragment
charge and a peak in potential energy fluctuations. All together, this set of
data is coherent with what would be expected in a finite system if the
corresponding system in the thermodynamic limit exhibits a first order phase
transition.

although he intended to defend what seemed to him to be orthodoxy, he himself
became a heterodox. I suggest that Wigner's conjectures on the role of
consciousness in physical phenomena were not fruitful and were discarded, being
today part of the history of physics rather than physics proper. However, his
ideas and actions left an indelible mark on the physics of the second half of
the 20th century. Namely, he formulated his ideas in opposition to the
Copenhagen monocracy, which held a stronghold on the interpretation of quantum
physics until the late 1960s; he stressed the unsolved status of the
measurement problem; and he effectively defended his ideas and supported those
who were willing to investigate the foundations of quantum physics. He thus
contributed to the creation of a new field of physical research, that of the
foundations of quantum physics, which attributed a higher scientific status to
the old controversy on the interpretations and foundations of this theory. This
new field has had to deal with important theoretical, experimental, and

groups of functionally associated proteins, often referred to as modules. In a
protein assocation network modules appear as groups of densely interconnected

the modules (overlaps). We introduce CFinder, a fast program locating and

graphs, and allowing the user to easily navigate between the original graph and
the web of these groups. We show that in gene (protein) association networks
CFinder can be used to predict the function(s) of a single protein and to
discover novel modules. CFinder is also very efficient for locating the cliques
