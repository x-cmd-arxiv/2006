star relevant for GRBs, XRFs and asymmetric supernovae. We apply Lynden-Bell's
magnetic tower scenario to the interior of a massive rotating star after the
core has collapsed to form a black hole with an accretion disk or a millisecond
magnetar acting as a central engine. We solve the force-free Grad-Shafranov
equation to calculate the magnetic structure and growth of a tower embedded in
a stellar environment. The pressure of the toroidal magnetic field,
continuously generated by differential rotation of the central engine, drives a
rapid expansion which becomes vertically collimated after lateral force balance
with the surrounding gas pressure is reached. The collimation naturally occurs
because hoop stress concentrates magnetic field toward the rotation axis and
inhibits lateral expansion. This leads to the growth of a self-collimated
magnetic tower. When embedded in a massive star, the supersonic expansion of
the tower drives a strong bow shock behind which an over-pressured cocoon
forms. The cocoon confines the tower by supplying collimating pressure and
provides stabilization against disruption due to MHD instabilities. Because the
tower consists of closed field lines starting and ending on the central engine,
mixing of baryons from the cocoon into the tower is suppressed. The channel
cleared by the growing tower is thus plausibly free of baryons and allows the
escape of magnetic energy from the central engine through the star. While
propagating down the stellar density gradient, the tower accelerates and
becomes relativistic. During the expansion, fast collisionless reconnection
becomes possible resulting in dissipation of magnetic energy which may be
responsible for GRB prompt emission.

efficient booster in jets. This effect is purely hydrodynamical and occurs when
large velocities tangential to a discontinuity are present in the flow,
yielding Lorentz factors $\Gamma \sim 10^2-10^3$ or larger in flows with

this effect can be explained easily through the most elementary hydrodynamical

Method: Absorption line study of the GRB afterglow spectrum. Results: We
determine the redshift of the GRB to be z=4.04795+/-0.00020. Based on the
measurement of the neutral hydrogen column density from the damped Lyman-alpha
line and the metal content from weak, unsaturated Sii lines we derive a
metallicity of [S/H] =-0.84+/-0.10. This is one of the highest metallicities
measured from absorption lines at z~4. From the very high column densities for
the forbidden Siii*, Oi*, and Oi** lines we infer very high densities and low
temperatures in the system. There is evidence for the presence of H$_2$
molecules with logN(H_2) ~ 17.0, translating into a molecular fraction of logf
\~ -3.5 with f=2N(H_2)/(2N(H_2)+ N(Hi)). Even if GRBs are only formed by single
massive stars with metallicities below ~0.3Z(solar), they could still be fairly
unbiased tracers of the bulk of the star formation at z>2. Hence, metallicities
as derived for GRB060206 here for a complete sample of GRB afterglows will

some of the most fundamental problems in star formation. The low-mass stellar
populations of OB associations provide a snapshot of the fossil star-formation
record of giant molecular cloud complexes. Large scale surveys have identified
hundreds of members of nearby OB associations, and revealed that low-mass stars
exist wherever high-mass stars have recently formed. The spatial distribution
of low-mass members of OB associations demonstrate the existence of significant
substructure (""subgroups""). This ""discretized"" sequence of stellar groups is
consistent with an origin in short-lived parent molecular clouds within a Giant
Molecular Cloud Complex. The low-mass population in each subgroup within an OB
association exhibits little evidence for significant age spreads on time scales
of ~10 Myr or greater, in agreement with a scenario of rapid star formation and
cloud dissipation. The Initial Mass Function (IMF) of the stellar populations
in OB associations in the mass range 0.1 ~< M ~< 1 Msun is largely consistent
with the field IMF, and most low-mass pre-main sequence stars in the solar
vicinity are in OB associations. These findings agree with early suggestions
that the majority of stars in the Galaxy were born in OB associations. The most

discovered a new candidate binary system, V410-Xray3, resulting in a binary
fraction of 9+/-5% at separations >4 AU. Both binary systems are tight (<10 AU)
and they possess mass ratios of 0.75 and 0.46, respectively. The binary

the binary frequency is higher for very low mass stars and high-mass brown

or a shift to smaller separations for the lowest mass binaries. Combining these
results with multiplicity statistics for higher-mass Taurus members suggests a
gradual decline in binary frequency and separation toward low masses. The
implication is that the distinct binary properties of very low-mass systems are
set during formation and that the formation process is similar to the process
which creates higher-mass stellar binaries, but occurs on a smaller scale. We
show that there are no planets or very low-mass brown dwarfs with mass >3 M_J

remained hitherto unexplained. Here we show that all four problems are resolved
simultaneously if 10-30 percent of the stars in many galaxies at z ~ 3-4 are

models of hierarchical galaxy formation assume efficient intra--galactic metal
mixing, and therefore do not predict metal-free star formation at redshifts

mass x-ray binary systems are influenced by the presence of central magnetic
moments. Similar features shown by the galactic black hole candidates (GBHC)
strongly suggest that their compact cores might be intrinsically magnetic as
well. We show that the existence of intrinsically magnetic GBHC is consistent
with a new class of solutions of the Einstein field equations of General
Relativity. These solutions are based on a strict adherence to the Strong
Principle of Equivalence (SPOE) requirement that the world lines of physical
matter must remain timelike in all regions of spacetime. The new solutions
emerge when the structure and radiation transfer properties of the energy
momentum tensor on the right hand side of the Einstein field equations are
appropriately chosen to dynamically enforce this SPOE requirement of timelike
world line completeness. In this context, we find that the Einstein field
equations allow the existence of highly red shifted, Magnetospheric, Eternally
Collapsing Objects (MECO). MECO necessarily possess intrinsic magnetic moments
and they do not have trapped surfaces that lead to event horizons and curvature
singularities. Their most striking features are equipartition magnetic fields,
pair plasma atmospheres and extreme gravitational redshifts. Since MECO
lifetimes are orders of magnitude greater than a Hubble time, they provide an
elegant and unified framework for understanding a broad range of observations
of GBHC and active galactic nuclei. We examine their spectral, timing and jet
formation properties and discuss characteristics that might lead to their
confirmation.

mapped large-scale magnetic fields in four Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) in the
Galactic disk: NGC 6334, the Carina Nebula, G333.6-0.2 and G331.5-0.1. We find
a statistically significant correlation of the inferred field directions with
the orientation of the Galactic plane. Specifically, three of the four GMCs
(NGC 6334 is the exception) have mean field directions that are within 15
degrees of the plane. The simplest interpretation is that the field direction
tends to be preserved during the process of GMC formation. We have also carried
out an analysis of published optical polarimetry data. For the closest of the
SPARO GMCs, NGC 6334, we can compare the field direction in the cloud as
measured by SPARO with the field direction in a larger region surrounding the
cloud, as determined from optical polarimetry. For purposes of comparison, we
also use optical polarimetry to determine field directions for other regions of
similar size and distance. Overall, the results from this optical polarimetry
analysis are consistent with our suggestion that field direction tends to be
preserved during GMC formation. Finally, we compare the disorder in our
magnetic field maps with the disorder seen in magnetic field maps derived from
MHD turbulence simulations. We conclude from these comparisons that the
magnetic energy density in our clouds is comparable to the turbulent energy
density.

In the mathematical aspect, the EOS, the scalar field potential $V(\phi)$, and

are due to a simple form invariance of the equation inherited which determines
the Hubble parameter. From the physical point of view, this dynamical equation
can be regarded as the $\Lambda$CDM model with bulk viscosity, an existence
content in the universe. We employ the SNe Ia data with the parameter
$\mathcal{A}$ measured from the SDSS data and the shift parameter $\mathcal{R}$

that the contribution of the bulk viscosity, accumulated as an effective dark

approximately ten percent to that of the cosmological constant.

the history of galaxy formation consistently indicate that a wide interval of
cosmic epochs between z~0.7 to z~2 brackets the main evolutionary phases. The
rate of the integrated galaxy mass growth indicated by the IR-based comoving
SFR appears consistent with the observed decrease of the stellar mass densities
with redshift. There are also indications that the evolution with z of the
total population depends on galaxy mass, being stronger for moderate-mass, but
almost absent up to z=1.4 for high-mass galaxies, thus confirming previous
evidence for a ""downsizing"" effect in galaxy formation. The most massive
galaxies appear already mostly in place by z~1. Although a precise matching of
this galaxy build-up with the growth of nuclear super-massive black-holes is
not possible with the present data (due to difficulties for an accurate census
of the obscured AGN phenomenon), some preliminary indications reveal a similar
mass/luminosity dependence for AGN evolution as for the hosting galaxies.

and a warmer, thicker inner layer seen in [Fe II] 16435. The thin H2 skin hints
that the most important mass loss during the 19th century eruption had a very
short duration of less than 5 yr. H2 emission traces the majority of the mass
in the nebula, and has an average density of order 10^6.5 cm-3. This emission,
in turn, yields our first definitive picture of the exact shape of the nebula,
plus a distance of 2350pm50 pc and an inclination angle of 41deg (the polar
axis is tilted 49deg from the plane of the sky). The distribution of the H2
emission provides the first measure of the latitude dependence of the speed,
mass loss, and kinetic energy associated with eta Car's 19th century explosion.
Almost 75 percent of the total mass and more than 90 percent of the kinetic
energy in the ejecta were released at high latitudes. This rules out a model
for the bipolar shape wherein an otherwise spherical explosion was pinched at
the waist by a circumstellar torus. Also, the ejecta could not have been
deflected toward polar trajectories by a companion star, since the kinetic
energy of the polar ejecta is greater than the binding energy of the putative
binary system. Instead, most of the mass appears to have been directed poleward
by the explosion itself. [abridged]

expansion in which all free energies and correlation functions are expressed
diagrammatically as functionals of single-molecule correlation functions of
non-interacting molecules. Topological reduction yields several renormalized
expansions for collective correlation functions of all orders as functionals of

the runaway renormalization flow of coupling into a first (I) order phase

for the bottom and top layer separately in order to break apart the evolution

in the bilayer is increased significantly from that of the monolayer- which

case) of satisfied constraints. This problem is NP-hard in general, and,
therefore, it is natural to study how restricting the allowed types of

that any MAX CSP problem with a finite set of allowed constraint types, which
includes all fixed-value constraints (i.e., constraints of the form x=a), is
either solvable exactly in polynomial-time or else is APX-complete, even if the
number of occurrences of variables in instances are bounded. Moreover, we
present a simple description of all polynomial-time solvable cases of our

for a_mu includes contributions from virtual QED, weak, and hadronic processes.
While the QED processes account for most of the anomaly, the largest
theoretical uncertainty, ~0.55 ppm, is associated with first-order hadronic
vacuum polarization. Present standard model evaluations, based on e+e- hadronic
cross sections, lie 2.2 - 2.7 standard deviations below the experimental

theories described by local, Lorentz-invariant Lagrangians, secretly exhibit
macroscopic non-locality and cannot be embedded in any UV theory whose S-matrix
satisfies canonical analyticity constraints. The obstruction involves the signs
of a set of leading irrelevant operators, which must be strictly positive to
ensure UV analyticity. An IR manifestation of this restriction is that the
""wrong"" signs lead to superluminal fluctuations around non-trivial backgrounds,
making it impossible to define local, causal evolution, and implying a
surprising IR breakdown of the effective theory. Such effective theories can
not arise in quantum field theories or weakly coupled string theories, whose
S-matrices satisfy the usual analyticity properties. This conclusion applies to
the DGP brane-world model modifying gravity in the IR, giving a simple
explanation for the difficulty of embedding this model into controlled stringy
backgrounds, and to models of electroweak symmetry breaking that predict
negative anomalous quartic couplings for the W and Z. Conversely, any
experimental support for the DGP model, or measured negative signs for
anomalous quartic gauge boson couplings at future accelerators, would
constitute direct evidence for the existence of superluminality and macroscopic
non-locality unlike anything previously seen in physics, and almost
incidentally falsify both local quantum field theory and perturbative string
theory.

exists an extensive literature on the components approach to extended
supersymmetric theories in $d=1$ while the manifestly supersymmetric
formulation in terms of properly constrained superfields is much less known.
Nevertheless, we believe that just such formulations are preferable.

terms of symmetry considerations by means of a differential renormalization

the general N-layer model provides us with the possibility to consider the
dependence of the vortex dynamics on the number of layers. The Lagrangians are
distinguished according to the number of zero eigenvalues of their mass
matrices. The number of layers is found to be decisive with respect to the
phase structure of the N-layer models, with neighbouring layers being coupled
by terms quadratic in the field variables. It is shown that the LSG model with
N layers undergoes a Kosterlitz--Thouless type phase transition at the critical
value of the parameter \beta^2_{c} = 8 N \pi. In the limit of infinitely many
layers the LSG model can be considered as the discretized version of the
three-dimensional sine-Gordon model which has been shown to have a single phase
within the local potential approximation. The infinite critical value of the

of our model is that the action splits {\bf automatically} into two parts

automatically the self-dual and anti-self-dual equations without solving the

resolve the nearly singular behavior of the Euler equations. Our numerical
results demonstrate that the maximum vorticity does not grow faster than double
exponential in time, up to $t=19$, beyond the singularity time $t=18.7$
predicted by Kerr's computations \cite{Kerr93,Kerr04}. The velocity, the
enstrophy and enstrophy production rate remain bounded throughout the
computations. As the flow evolves, the vortex tubes are flattened severely and
turned into thin vortex sheets, which roll up subsequently. The vortex lines
near the region of the maximum vorticity are relatively straight. This local
geometric regularity of vortex lines seems to be responsible for the dynamic
depletion of vortex stretching.

  kernels and well defined zonal Feynman integrals","68 pages, submitted",,,,"math.SP math-ph math.MP",,"  The problem of infinities (divergent integrals) appearing in quantum field
theory or elementary particle physics are treated by renormalization in the
current theories. By this perturbative tool the desired finite quantities are
produced by differences of infinities. This paper gives a new non-perturbative
approach to this problem. Namely, the Hilbert space on which the quantum
Hamilton operator $H$ is acting, is decomposed into subspaces, called Zeeman
zones, which are invariant under the actions both of $H$ and the natural
complex Heisenberg group representation. Thus well defined particle theory and
zonal geometry can be developed on each zone separately. One of the most
surprising result is that the quantities which appear as infinities on the
global setting become well defined finite ones on the zonal setting. For
instance, both the Wiener-Kac and the Dirac-Feynman kernels become of the trace
class on the zones, both defining the corresponding zonal measures on the
path-spaces rigorously.
  The Hamilton operators, $H$, considered in this paper are those corresponding
to electrons orbiting in a constant magnetic field. This is one of the most
important Hamiltonians, introduced for explaining the Zeeman effect. This
Hamiltonian is identified with the Laplacian of certain Riemannian,so called
Zeeman manifolds. The spectral Zeeman zone decomposition is introduced, by one
of the definitions, by the spectrum of the angular momentum operator. Thus a
zone exhibits the magnetic state of the particle occupying the zone. All the
important spectral theoretical objects are explicitly established. They include
the spectrum, the zonal projection operators, the zonal Wiener-Kac and
Dirac-Feynman kernels, and the zonal partition functions.

Rota-Baxter words are words formed by concatenating generators and images of
words under Rota-Baxter operators. Under suitable conditions, they form
canonical bases of free Rota-Baxter algebras and are studied recently in
relation to combinatorics, number theory, renormalization in quantum field
theory, and operads. Enumeration of a basis is often a first step to choosing a
data representation in implementation. Our method applies some simple ideas
from formal languages and compositions (ordered partitions) of an integer. We
first settle the case of one generator and one operator where both have
exponent 1 (the idempotent case). Some integer sequences related to these sets
of Rota-Baxter words are known and connected to other combinatorial sequences,
such as the Catalan numbers, and others are new. The recurrences satisfied by
the generating series of these sequences prompt us to discover an efficient
algorithm to enumerate the canonical basis of certain free Rota-Baxter
algebras. More general sets of Rota-Baxter words are enumerated with summation
techniques related to compositions of integers.

required to sort binary and ternary strings, with polynomial-time algorithms

points of our problem. The problem is generalised in the sense that smaller
primary is supposed to be an oblate spheroid. The bigger primary is considered
as radiating. The equations of motion are affected by radiation pressure force,
oblateness and P-R drag. All classical results involving photogravitational and
oblateness in restricted three body problem may be verified from this result.
With the help of characteristic equation, we discussed the stability. Finally
we conclude that triangular equilibrium points are unstable.

respect to waiting time distribution, velocity distribution and
autocorrelation. Logdifferences of velocity records reveal non-normal,
obviously leptocurtic distribution. Further, linear and nonlinear phase-plane

final stage of scattering. The wave function for the whole ensemble of
scattering particles can be uniquely presented as the sum of two isometrically
evolved wave packets to describe the (to-be-)transmitted and (to-be-)reflected
subensembles of particles at all stages of scattering. A noninvasive
Larmor-clock timing procedure adapted to either subensemble shows that namely
the dwell time gives the time spent, on the average, by a particle in the
barrier region, and it denies the Hartman effect. As regards the group time, it
cannot be measured and hence it cannot be accepted as a measure of the
tunneling time. We argue that nonlocality of entangled states appears in
quantum mechanics due to inconsistency of its superposition principle with the
corpuscular properties of a particle. For example, this principle associates a
1D completed scattering with a single (one-way) process, while a particle, as
an indivisible object, cannot take part in transmission and reflection,
simultaneously.

"quant-ph/0602173","Nikolai Chuprikov","N. L. Chuprikov","Quantum Mechanics without Nonlocality","Latex, 8 pages, no figures; the text is thoroughly rewritten",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We argue that quantum nonlocality of entangled states is not an actual
phenomenon. It appears in quantum mechanics as a consequence of the
inconsistency of its superposition principle with the corpuscular properties of
a quantum particle. In the existing form, this principle does not distinguish
between macroscopically distinct states of a particle and their superpositions:
it implies introducing observables for a particle, even if it is in an
entangled state. However, a particle cannot take part simultaneously in two or
more alternative macroscopically distinct sub-processes. Thus, calculating the
expectation values of the one-particle's observables, for entangled states, is
physically meaningless: Born's formula is not applicable to such states. The
same concerns the entangled states of compound quantum systems. In the {\it
existing} quantum mechanics, introducing Bell's inequalities is fully legal.
However, these inequalities imply averaging over an entangled state, and,
hence, they have no basis for their clear physical interpretation. Experiments
to confirm the violation of Bell's inequalities do not prove the existence of
nonlocality in microcosm. They confirm only that correlations introduced in the
existing theory of entangled states have no physical sense, for they contradict
special relativity.
