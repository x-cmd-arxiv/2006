the choice of methods by which the problem should be addressed. Here we
quantify the redshift sensitivities offered by different techniques. We focus
on the three methods most adept at constraining w, namely supernovae, cosmic
shear, and baryon oscillations. For each we provide insight into the family of
w(z) models which are permitted for a particular constraint on either w=w0 or
w=w0+wa(1-a). Our results are in the form of ""weight functions"", which describe
the fitted model parameters as a weighted average over the true functional
form. For example, we find the recent best-fit from the Supernovae Legacy
Survey (w=-1.023) corresponds to the average value of w(z) over the range
0<z<0.4. Whilst there is a strong dependence on the choice of priors, each
cosmological probe displays distinctive characteristics in their redshift
sensitivities. In the case of proposed future surveys, a SNAP-like supernova
survey probes a mean redshift of z ~ 0.3, with baryon oscillations and cosmic
shear at z ~ 0.6. If we consider the evolution of w, sensitivities shift to
slightly higher redshift. Finally, we find that the weight functions may be
expressed as a weighted average of the popular ""principal components"".

re-examine this question and find new evidence that supports this argument.
Using VLBA flux densities and angular motions in jets, I show that the central
engine of quasars and BL Lac objects appears to be a good radio standard
candle. Using this information, relative distances are calculated and absolute
radio distances are then obtained by referencing to a source whose true
distance has been obtained using Cepheid variables. The results reveal that in

continuum maps toward 38 IRDCs reveal extended cold dust emission to be
associated with each of the IRDCs. IRDCs range in morphology from filamentary
to compact and have masses of 120 to 16,000 Msun, with a median mass of ~940
Msun. Each IRDC contains at least one compact (<=0.5 pc) dust core and most
show multiple cores. We find 140 cold millimeter cores unassociated with MSX
8um emission. The core masses range from 10 to 2,100 Msun, with a median mass
of ~120 Msun. The slope of the IRDC core mass spectrum (alpha ~ 2.1 +/- 0.4) is
similar to that of the stellar IMF. Assuming that each core will form a single
star, the majority of the cores will form OB stars. IRDC cores have similar
sizes, masses, and densities as hot cores associated with individual, young
high-mass stars, but they are much colder. We therefore suggest that IRDC
represent an earlier evolutionary phase in high-mass star formation. In
addition, because IRDCs contain many compact cores, and have the same sizes and
masses as molecular clumps associated with young clusters, we suggest that
IRDCs are the cold precursors to star clusters. Indeed, an estimate of the star
formation rate within molecular clumps with similar properties to IRDCs (~2
Msun/yr) is comparable to the global star formation rate in the Galaxy,
supporting the idea that all stars may form in such clumps.

examined under a fully special relativistic treatment, taking into account
radiation transfer. The flow was assumed to be vertical, and the gravity, the
gas pressure, and the viscous heating were ignored. In order to construct the
boundary condition at the flow top, the magic speed above the flat source was
re-examined, and it was found that the magic speed above a moving source can
exceed that above a static source ($\sim 0.45~c$). Then, the radiatively driven
flow in a luminous disk was numerically solved, from the flow base (disk
``inside''), where the flow speed is zero, to the flow top (disk ``surface''),
where the optical depth is zero. For a given optical depth and appropriate
initial conditions at the flow base, where the flow starts, a loaded mass in
the flow was obtained as an eigenvalue of the boundary condition at the flow
top. Furthermore, a loaded mass and the flow final speed at the flow top were
obtained as a function of the radiation pressure at the flow base; the flow
final speed increases as the loaded mass decreases. Moreover, the flow velocity
and radiation fields along the flow were obtained as a function of the optical
depth. Within the present treatment, the flow three velocity $v$ is restricted
to be within the range of $v < c/\sqrt{3}$, which is the relativistic sound
speed, due to the relativistic effect.

of the speed of light. When the gaseous flow is radiatively accelerated up to

direction of the flow. As a result, the radiative diffusion may become {\it
anisotropic} in the comoving frame of the gas. Hence, in a flow that is
accelerated from subrelativistic to relativistic regimes, the Eddington factor
should be different from 1/3 even in the diffusion limit. As a simple form, the
velocity-dependent Eddington factor may be written as $f(\beta) =
1/3+(2/3)\beta$, where $\beta=v/c$. Using the velocity-dependent Eddington
factor, we can solve the rigorous equations of the relativistic radiative flow

be anti-ferromagnetic with spin-orbit coupling included (AFM-SO). At the ground
state, the magnetic moment of fcc Am (001) surface is predicted to be zero. Our
current study predicts the semi-infinite surface energy and the work function
for fcc Am (001) surface at the ground state to be approximately 0.82 J/m2 and
2.93 eV respectively. In addition, the quantum size effects of surface energy
and work function on the fcc Am (001) surface have been examined up to 7 layers
at various theoretical levels. Results indicate that a three layer film surface
model may be sufficient for future atomic and molecular adsorption studies on
the fcc Am (001) surface, if the primary quantity of interest is the
chemisorption energy.

matter content is minimal. This is not true if there is a large A term for the

supersymmetric theories and identify low energy spectra that do not lead to
severe fine-tuning. Characteristic features of these spectra are: a large A
term for the top squarks, small top squark masses, moderately large tan\beta,
and a small \mu parameter. There are classes of theories leading to these
features, which are discussed. In one class, which allows a complete
elimination of fine-tuning, the Higgsinos are the lightest among all the
superpartners of the standard model particles, leading to three nearly
degenerate neutralino/chargino states. This gives interesting signals at the
LHC -- the dilepton invariant mass distribution has a very small endpoint and
shows a particular shape determined by the Higgsino nature of the two lightest
neutralinos. We demonstrate that these signals are indeed useful in realistic
analyses by performing Monte Carlo simulations, including detector simulations
and background estimations. We also present a method that allows the
determination of all the relevant superparticle masses without using input from
particular models, despite the limited kinematical information due to short
cascades. This allows us to test various possible models, which is demonstrated
in the case of a model with mixed moduli-anomaly mediation. We also give a
simple derivation of special renormalization group properties associated with
moduli mediated supersymmetry breaking, which are relevant in a model without

multiplied by universal non-trivial functions of the common modulus $\sigma$

interest, including the transition between deceleration and acceleration
phases. By considering some phenomenologically motivated ansatzs for one of the
scalars and/or the scale factor (of the universe), we also construct a number
of interesting inflationary potentials. In all examples under consideration, we
find that the model leads only to a standard inflation ($w \geq -1$) when the
numerical coefficient $\delta$ associated with modulus-GB coupling is positive,
while the model can lead also to a non-standard inflation ($w<-1$), if $\delta$
is negative. In the absence of (or trivial) coupling between the GB term and
the scalars, there is no crossing between the $w< -1$ and $w> -1$ phases, while
this is possible with non-trivial GB couplings, even for constant dilaton phase
of the standard picture. Within our model, after a sufficient amount of e-folds
of expansion, the rolling of both fields $\phi$ and $\sigma$ can be small. In
turn, any possible violation of equivalence principle or deviations from the
standard general relativity may be small enough to easily satisfy all
astrophysical and cosmological constraints.

which recovers the usual Bekenstein-Hawking form, but the characteristic
angular velocity and temperature are identified with those of the inner

temperature has a $negative$ value, due to an upper bound of mass as in spin
systems, and the angular velocity has a $lower$ bound. I show that one can
obtain the same entropy formula from a conformal field theory computation,

with detailed proofs, while the other are cited without proofs but with
references to the original papers.
  The content is briefly as follows. Starting with basic properties of
algebraic homogeneous spaces and related objects, such as induced
representations, we focus the attention on homogeneous spaces of reductive
groups and introduce two important invariants, called complexity and rank. For
the embedding theory it is important that homogeneous spaces of small
complexity admit a transparent combinatorial description of their equivariant
embeddings. We consider the Luna-Vust theory of equivariant embeddings, paying
special attention to the case of complexity not greater than one. A special
chapter is devoted to spherical varieties (= embeddings of homogeneous spaces
of complexity zero), due to their particular importance and ubiquity. A
relation between equivariant embedding theory and equivariant symplectic
geometry is also discussed. The book contains several classification results
(homogeneous spaces of small complexity, etc).

This article uses a nonparametric approach with the mean integrated squared
error (MISE) criterion. It solves a long-standing problem, formulated two
decades ago by Mark Pinsker, about estimation of a nonparametric error density
in a nonparametric regression setting with the accuracy of an oracle that knows
the underlying regression errors. The solution implies that, under a mild
assumption on the differentiability of the design density and regression
function, the MISE of a data-driven error density estimator attains minimax
rates and sharp constants known for the case of directly observed regression
errors. The result holds for error densities with finite and infinite supports.
Some extensions of this result for more general heteroscedastic models with
possibly dependent errors and predictors are also obtained; in the latter case
the marginal error density is estimated. In all considered cases a
blockwise-shrinking Efromovich--Pinsker density estimate, based on plugged-in
residuals, is used. The obtained results imply a theoretical justification of a
customary practice in applied regression analysis to consider residuals as
proxies for underlying regression errors. Numerical and real examples are
presented and discussed, and the S-PLUS software is available.

a Hilbert space. In particular we suppose that we are given a quantum system in
either the state \psi_{1}, where \psi_{1} can be any state in the subspace
S_{1}, or \psi_{2}, where \psi_{2} can be any state in the subspace S_{2}, and
our task is to determine in which of the subspaces the state of our quantum
system lies. We do not want to make a mistake, which means that our procedure
will sometimes fail if the subspaces are not orthogonal. This is a special case
of the unambiguous discrimination of mixed states. We present the POVM that
solves this problem and several applications of this procedure, including the
discrimination of multipartite states without classical communication.

investigate the scaling behavior of the block entropy in critical and
non-critical phases. The scaling of the block entropy crucially depends on the
nature of the excitation spectrum of the system and on the topology of the
Fermi surface. Noticeably, in the critical phases the scaling violates the area
law and acquires a logarithmic correction \emph{only} when a well defined Fermi
surface exists in the system. When the area law is violated, we accurately
verify a conjecture for the prefactor of the logarithmic correction, proposed
by D. Gioev and I. Klich [quant-ph/0504151].

state is obtained at the postulation that the coherent information is convex or
concave at its vicinity. When the input energy tends to infinitive, it is
verified by perturbation theory that the coherent information reaches its
maximum at the product of identical thermal state input. The quantum capacity
is obtained for lower noise channel and it is equal the one shot capacity.
