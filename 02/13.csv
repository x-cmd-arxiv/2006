been used for almost 50 years, but there is still no general agreement on their
interpretation. We try to quantify which properties of underlying turbulent
velocity fields can be derived from centroid velocity maps, and we test
conditions under which the scaling behaviour of the centroid velocities matches
the scaling of the three-dimensional velocity field. Using fractal cloud models
we study systematically the relation between three-dimensional density and
velocity fields and the statistical properties of the produced line centroid
maps. We put special attention to cases with large density fluctuations
resembling supersonic interstellar turbulence. Starting from the Delta-variance
analysis we derive a new tool to compute the scaling behaviour of the
three-dimensional velocity field from observed intensity and centroid velocity
maps. We provide two criteria to decide whether the information from the
centroid velocities directly reflects the properties of the underlying velocity
field. Applying these criteria allows to understand the different results found
so far in the literature on the interpretation of the statistics of velocity
centroids. A new iteration scheme can be used to derive the three-dimensional
velocity scaling from centroid velocity maps for arbitrary density and velocity
fields, but it requires an accurate knowledge of the average density of the
considered interstellar cloud.

Newtonian theory tidal stresses are finite at saddle points, they are expected
to diverge in MOND, and to remain distinctly large inside a sizeable oblate
ellipsoid around the saddle point. We work out the MOND effects using the
nonrelativistic limit of the T$e$V$e$S theory, both in the perturbative nearly
Newtonian regime and in the deep MOND regime. While strong MOND behavior would
be a spectacular ``backyard'' vindication of the theory, pinpointing the
MOND-bubbles in the setting of the realistic solar system may be difficult.

possible common origin of the absorber. Compared to lower-redshift samples at
z<2, there is an extension, or a systematic shift, toward higher values in the
intrinsic NH distribution at z>4, and an increase of the fraction of radio-loud
quasars showing X-ray absorption toward high redshifts. These results indicate
a cosmic evolution effect, which seems to be the strongest at redshifts around

and atomic diffusion, we find that two distinct solutions reproduce all
existing asteroseismic and non-asteroseismic observational constraints well: a
main-sequence model with a mass of 1.28 +- 0.03 Msun and an age t = 3.24 +-
0.20 Gyr, or a model in the post-main sequence phase of evolution with a lower
mass of 1.21 +- 0.02 Msun and an age t = 4.01 +- 0.30 Gyr. The small spacings
and the ratio between small and large spacings are sensitive to the differences
in the structure of the central layers between these two solutions and are also
sensitive to the structural changes due to the rotational mixing. They can
therefore be used to unambiguously determine the evolutionary state of beta Vir
and to study the effects of rotation on the inner structure of the star.
Unfortunately, existing asteroseismic data do not enable such precise
determination. We also show that the scatter in frequencies introduced by the
rotational splittings can account for the larger dispersion of the observed
large spacings for the non-radial modes than for the radial modes.

sources exhibits the puzzling feature of a power-law behaviour up to very large
(almost 10 degrees) angular scales which cannot be accounted for in the
standard hierarchical clustering scenario for any realistic redshift
distribution of such sources. After having discarded the possibility that the
signal can be explained by a high density local source population, we find no
alternatives to assuming that - at variance with all the other extragalactic
populations studied so far, and in particular with optically selected quasars -
radio sources responsible for the large-scale clustering signal were
increasingly less clustered with increasing look-back time, up to at least z=1.
The data are accurately accounted for in terms of a bias function which
decreases with increasing redshift, mirroring the evolution with cosmic time of
the characteristic halo mass, M_{star}, entering the non linear regime. In the
framework of the `concordance cosmology', the effective halo mass controlling
the bias parameter is found to decrease from about 10^{15} M_{sun}/h at z=0 to
the value appropriate for optically selected quasars, 10^{13} M_{sun}/h, at
z=1.5. This suggests that, in the redshift range probed by the data, the
clustering evolution of radio sources is ruled by the growth of large-scale
structure, and that they are associated with the densest environments
virializing at any cosmic epoch. The data provide only loose constraints on
radio source clustering at z>1 so we cannot rule out the possibility that at
these redshifts the clustering evolution of radio sources enters a different
regime, perhaps similar to that found for optically selected quasars. The
dependence of w(theta) on cosmological parameters is also discussed.

divergence is proportional to the Laplace pressure, normal to the surface,
maintaining the constraint on the volume. It is shown that this source itself
can be expressed as the divergence of a position-dependent surface stress. As a
consequence, the equilibrium can be described in terms of a conserved
`effective' surface stress. Various non-trivial geometrical consequences of
this identification are explored. In a cylindrical geometry, the cross-section
can be viewed as a closed planar Euler elastic curve. With respect to an
appropriate centre the effective stress itself vanishes; this provides a
remarkably simple relationship between the curvature and the position along the

the contact line moves along the wall. A classical problem in continuum
hydrodynamics is the incompatibility between the moving contact line and the
no-slip boundary condition, as the latter leads to a non-integrable
singularity. The recently discovered generalized Navier boundary condition
(GNBC) offers an alternative to the no-slip boundary condition which can
resolve the moving contact line conundrum. We present a variational derivation
of the GNBC through the principle of minimum energy dissipation (entropy
production), as formulated by Onsager for small perturbations away from the
equilibrium. Through numerical implementation of a continuum hydrodynamic
model, it is demonstrated that the GNBC can quantitatively reproduce the moving
contact line slip velocity profiles obtained from molecular dynamics
simulations. In particular, the transition from complete slip at the moving
contact line to near-zero slip far away is shown to be governed by a power-law
partial slip regime, extending to mesoscopic length scales. The sharp

general implications of slip versus no-slip, are discussed.

susceptibility of a normal metal-superconductor ($NS$) structure in weak
magnetic fields at millikelvin temperatures. The effect was discovered
experimentally by A.C. Mota et al \cite{10}. In cylindrical superconducting
samples covered with a thin normal pure metal layer, the susceptibility
exhibited a reentrant effect: it started to increase unexpectedly when the
temperature lowered below 100 mK. The effect was observed in mesoscopic $NS$
structures when the $N$ and $S$ metals were in good electric contact. The
theory proposed is essentially based on the properties of the Andreev levels in
the normal metal. When the magnetic field (or temperature) changes, each of the
Andreev levels coincides from time to time with the chemical potential of the
metal. As a result, the state of the $NS$ structure experiences strong
degeneracy, and the quasiparticle density of states exhibits resonance spikes.
This generates a large paramagnetic contribution to the susceptibility, which
adds up to the diamagnetic contribution thus leading to the reentrant effect.
The explanation proposed was obtained within the model of free electrons. The
theory provides a good description for experimental results [10].

this leads to non-trivial physics. Writing the solution of the equations and
the partition function in terms of a functional integral over supervectors and
averaging over fluctuating fields we come to an effective field theory
describing the spin excitations. In some respects, the theory is similar to
bosonization but also includes the ``ghost'' excitations which prevents
overcounting of the degrees of freedom. Expansion in the interaction reveals
logarithmic in temperature corrections. This enables us to suggest a
renormalization group scheme and derive renormalization group equations.

thermodynamics of the Hubbard model can be thought of in terms of gapped
charged excitations with an effective dispersion and spin degrees of freedom

using its mean and variance. Starting from the extreme pixel values at both
ends of the histogram plot, the algorithm is applied recursively on sub-ranges
computed from the previous step, so as to find a threshold level and a new
sub-range for the next step, until no significant improvement in image quality
can be achieved. The method makes use of the fact that a number of
distributions tend towards Dirac delta function, peaking at the mean, in the
limiting condition of vanishing variance. The procedure naturally provides for
variable size segmentation with bigger blocks near the extreme pixel values and
finer divisions around the mean or other chosen value for better visualization.
Experiments on a variety of images show that the new algorithm effectively
segments the image in computationally very less time.

the way we view nature. We conclude (a) that what functionalism calls the
special sciences (sciences other than physics) do indeed study autonomous laws
and furthermore that those laws pertain to real higher level entities but (b)
that interactions among such higher-level entities is epiphenomenal in that
they can always be reduced to primitive physical forces. In other words,
epiphenomena, which we will identify with emergent phenomena, do real
higher-level work. The proposed perspective provides a framework for
understanding many thorny issues including the nature of entities, stigmergy,
the evolution of complexity, phase transitions, supervenience, and downward

read-out with new transducers and high sensitivity dc-SQUID, the
Explorer-Nautilus have improved the bandwidth ($\sim 20$ Hz) at the sensitivity

presented with an example of GW signals -- stellar quasi-normal modes, by

  Biomedicine",,,,"q-bio.BM q-bio.QM",,"  Protein folding is a problem of large interest since it concerns the
mechanism by which the genetic information is translated into proteins with
well defined three-dimensional (3D) structures and functions. Recently
theoretical models have been developed to predict the protein folding rate
considering the relationships of the process with tolopological parameters
derived from the native (atomic-solved) protein structures. Previous works
classified proteins in two different groups exhibiting either a
single-exponential or a multi-exponential folding kinetics. It is well known
that these two classes of proteins are related to different protein structural
features. The increasing number of available experimental kinetic data allows
the application to the problem of a machine learning approach, in order to
predict the kinetic order of the folding process starting from the experimental
data so far collected. This information can be used to improve the prediction
of the folding rate. In this work first we describe a support vector
machine-based method (SVM-KO) to predict for a given protein the kinetic order
of the folding process. Using this method we can classify correctly 78% of the
folding mechanisms over a set of 63 experimental data. Secondly we focus on the
prediction of the logarithm of the folding rate. This value can be obtained as
a linear regression task with a SVM-based method. In this paper we show that
linear correlation of the predicted with experimental data can improve when the
regression task is computed over two different sets, instead of one, each of
them composed by the proteins with a correctly predicted two state or
multistate kinetic order.

Lorentzians. Non-resonant transitions are included in the model. In all cases
non-Markovian behaviour for the atomic system can be found, such as oscillatory
decay for the high-Q cavity case and population trapping for the photonic
band-gap case. In the master equation approaches, the atomic system is
augmented by a small number of pseudomodes or quasimodes, which in the
quasimode approach themselves undergo Markovian relaxation into a flat
reservoir of continuum quasimodes. Results from these methods are found to be
identical to those from the Laplace transform method including two-photon

complicated non-Markovian decays of an atomic system into structured EM field
