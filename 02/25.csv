confirming the weak luminosity dependence of Q_z recently seen by other

find it to be consistent within the full jack-knife error estimates. However,
we find these errors are significantly increased by the presence of the ``Sloan

of these higher-order correlation functions to large-scale structures in the

Q_z(s,q,theta) as one expects this measurement to depend on scale if the large
scale structure in the Universe has grown via gravitational instability from
Gaussian initial conditions. On small scales (s <= 6h^-1 Mpc), we see some
evidence for shape-dependence in Q_z, but at present our measurements are

relativistic jets. The jet powers, inferred from the energies and timescales
required to inflate the cavities observed in the surrounding X-ray emitting
gas, can be related to the accretion rates by a power law model. A significant
fraction (2.2^{+1.0}_{-0.7} per cent, for P_jet=10^{43} erg/s) of the energy
associated with the rest mass of material entering the accretion radius
eventually emerges in the jets. The data also hint that this fraction may rise
slightly with increasing jet power. Our results have significant implications
for studies of accretion, jet formation and galaxy formation. The tight
correlation between P_Bondi and P_jet suggests that the Bondi formulae provide
a reasonable description of the accretion process, despite the likely presence
of magnetic pressure and angular momentum in the accreting gas, and that the
accretion flows are approximately stable over timescales of a few million
years. Our results show that the black hole `engines' at the hearts of large
elliptical galaxies and groups can feed back sufficient energy to stem cooling
and star formation, leading naturally to the observed exponential cut off at
the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function.

the hardest X-ray spectra are also the X-ray weakest, consistent with the
interpretation that intrinsic absorption is the primary cause of X-ray weakness
in this class of quasars as a whole. Furthermore, the observed trend is not
consistent with simple neutral absorption, supporting findings from
spectroscopic observations of individual targets that BAL quasars typically
exhibit complex X-ray absorption (e.g., partially covering or ionized
absorbers). In sum, high-ionization BAL quasars are typically neither
intrinsically X-ray weak nor suffer from Compton-thick absorption. In general,
we find no evidence for correlations between X-ray weakness and UV
absorption-line properties, with the exception of a likely correlation between
the maximum outflow velocity of CIV absorption and the magnitude of X-ray
weakness. We discuss the implications of our results for disk-wind models of

system (ESS) and the methods used to determine them. We compare them to the
inventory for a uniform galactic production model. Within a factor of two,
observed abundances of several isotopes are compatible with this model. I-129
is an exception, with an ESS inventory much lower than expected. The isotopes
Pd-107, Fe-60, Ca-41, Cl-36, Al-26, and Be-10 require late addition to the
solar nebula. Be-10 is the product of particle irradiation of the solar system
as probably is Cl-36. Late injection by a supernova (SN) cannot be responsible
for most short-lived nuclei without excessively producing Mn-53; it can be the
source of Mn-53 and maybe Fe-60. If a late SN is responsible for these two
nuclei, it still cannot make Pd-107 and other isotopes. We emphasize an AGB
star as a source of nuclei, including Fe-60 and explore this possibility with
new stellar models. A dilution factor of about 4e-3 gives reasonable amounts of
many nuclei. We discuss the role of irradiation for Al-26, Cl-36 and Ca-41.
Conflict between scenarios is emphasized as well as the absence of a global
interpretation for the existing data. Abundances of actinides indicate a
quiescent interval of about 1e8 years for actinide group production in order to
explain the data on Pu-244 and new bounds on Cm-247. This interval is not
compatible with Hf-182 data, so a separate type of r-process is needed for at
least the actinides, distinct from the two types previously identified. The
apparent coincidence of the I-129 and trans-actinide time scales suggests that
the last actinide contribution was from an r-process that produced actinides
without fission recycling so that the yields at Ba and below were governed by
fission.

only 2.0 arcmin away, is to a V = 19.5 QSO at z = 1.026. Its spectrum shows
broad Fe II absorption lines, asymmetric with red wings broader than blue. The
similarity of these profiles to those seen in the SM star, which is 2.8 arcmin

the far side of SN 1006. The Fe II equivalent widths in the QSO spectrum are ~
50% greater than in the SM star, suggesting that somewhat more iron may be

this is still far short of what most SNIa models require. The absorption
spectrum against a brighter z = 0.337 QSO seen at 57% of the shell radius shows
broad silicon absorption lines but no iron other than narrow, probably
interstellar lines. The cold iron expanding in this direction must be confined
within v <~ 5200 km/s, also consistent with a high-velocity bulge on the far
side only. The broad silicon lines indicate that the silicon layer has expanded
beyond this point, and that it has probably been heated by a reverse shock.

the magnetogram signal into different ranges allowed us to distinguish between
the contrast of different magnetic structures. We find that the contrast

of time with a 10% precision, when measured during the rising phase of solar

traced down to T_C* = 25 mK at x = 0.87, locating the critical concentration

by the -log(T/T_0) dependence of C_m/T, which transforms into a T^-q (~0.5) one

instability revealed by a deviation from Vegard's law (at x_V~0.75) and
increasing hybridization effects on high temperature \chi_dc and \rho.

the MV component, which becomes dominant at the CeRh limit. In contrast to

feasible in canted antiferromagnets through photomagnetic instantaneous pulses
[A.V. Kimel {\it et al.}, Nature {\bf 435}, 655 (2005)]. In this experiment
circularly polarized femtosecond laser pulses set up a strong magnetic field
along the wave vector of the radiation through the inverse Faraday effect,
thereby exciting non-thermally the spin dynamics of dysprosium orthoferrites. A
theoretical study is performed by using a model for orthoferrites based on a
general form of free energy whose parameters are extracted from experimental
measurements. The magnetization dynamics is described by solving coupled
sublattice Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations whose damping term is associated
with the scattering rate due to magnon-magnon interaction. Due to the inverse
Faraday effect and the non-thermal excitation, the effect of the laser is
simulated by magnetic field Gaussian pulses with temporal width of the order of
hundred femtoseconds. When the field is along the z-axis, a single resonance
mode of the magnetization is excited. The amplitude of the magnetization and
out-of-phase behavior of the oscillations for fields in z and -z directions are
in good agreement with the cited experiment. The analysis of the effect of the
temperature shows that magnon-magnon scattering mechanism affects the decay of
the oscillations on the picosecond scale. Finally, when the field pulse is
along the x-axis, another mode is excited, as observed in experiments. In this
case the comparison between theoretical and experimental results shows some
discrepancies whose origin is related to the role played by anisotropies in
orthoferrites.

the emission spectra are the same during resin curing and upon heating of the

  (Nova Science)",,,"IGPG-06/2-2, AEI-2006-009","gr-qc hep-th",,"  Black Holes have always played a central role in investigations of quantum
gravity. This includes both conceptual issues such as the role of classical
singularities and information loss, and technical ones to probe the consistency
of candidate theories. Lacking a full theory of quantum gravity, such studies
had long been restricted to black hole models which include some aspects of
quantization. However, it is then not always clear whether the results are
consequences of quantum gravity per se or of the particular steps one had
undertaken to bring the system into a treatable form. Over a little more than
the last decade loop quantum gravity has emerged as a widely studied candidate
for quantum gravity, where it is now possible to introduce black hole models
within a quantum theory of gravity. This makes it possible to use only quantum
effects which are known to arise also in the full theory, but still work in a
rather simple and physically interesting context of black holes. Recent
developments have now led to the first physical results about non-rotating
quantum black holes obtained in this way. Restricting to the interior inside
the Schwarzschild horizon, the resulting quantum model is free of the classical
singularity, which is a consequence of discrete quantum geometry taking over
for the continuous classical space-time picture. This fact results in a change
of paradigm concerning the information loss problem. The horizon itself can
also be studied in the quantum theory by imposing horizon conditions at the
level of states. Thereby one can illustrate the nature of horizon degrees of
freedom and horizon fluctuations. All these developments allow us to study the
quantum dynamics explicitly and in detail which provides a rich ground to test
the consistency of the full theory.

investigated. We consider the quantum dynamics of a real massless scalar field
coupled to gravity in this framework. A Hamiltonian operator for the scalar
field can be well defined in the coupled diffeomorphism invariant Hilbert
space, which is both self-adjoint and positive. On the other hand, the
Hamiltonian constraint operator for the scalar field coupled to gravity can be
well defined in the coupled kinematical Hilbert space. There are 1-parameter
ambiguities due to scalar field in the construction of both operators. The
results heighten our confidence that there is no divergence within this
background independent and diffeomorphism invariant quantization approach of
matter coupled to gravity. Moreover, to avoid possible quantum anomaly, the
master constraint programme can be carried out in this coupled system by
employing a self-adjoint master constraint operator on the diffeomorphism
invariant Hilbert space.

exactly the same microphysics as that of the observable particles, then the
primordial nucleosynthesis constraints require that the temperature of the
cosmic background of mirror relic photons should be smaller than that of the
ordinary relic photons, T'/T < 0.5 or so. On the other hand, the present
experimental and astrophysical limits allow a rather fast neutron - mirror
neutron oscillation in vacuum, with an oscillation time $\tau \sim 1$ s, much
smaller than the neutron lifetime. We show that this could provide a very
efficient mechanism for transporting ultra high energy protons at large
cosmological distances. The mechanism operates as follows: a super-GZK energy
proton scatters a relic photon producing a neutron that oscillates into a
mirror neutron which then decays into a mirror proton. The latter undergoes a
symmetric process, scattering a mirror relic photon and producing back an
ordinary nucleon, but only after traveling a distance $(T/T')^{3}$ times larger
than ordinary protons. This may relax or completely remove the GZK-cutoff in
the cosmic ray spectrum and also explain the correlation between the observed
ultra high energy protons and far distant sources as are the BL Lacs.

that both data sets can be well described by a QCD analysis in which point-like
parton distributions, evolving according to the next-leading DGLAP equations,
are assigned to the leading and sub-leading Regge exchanges. For present data
from H1 and ZEUS the gluon distributions are found to be quite different and we
give the corresponding sets of quark and gluon parton distributions for the

range is compared with CDF data on single diffraction. Conclusions on
factorization breaking between HERA and Tevatron critically depend on whether
H1 (strong violation) or ZEUS (compatibility at low $\beta$) fits are taken
into account. Using the double Pomeron formulation in central diffractive dijet
production we show that the Tevatron mass fraction is much sensitive to the
high $\beta$ tail of the gluon in the Pomeron, suggesting a new way of handling
the otherwise badly known gluon distribution in the Pomeron. Extrapolation of

those with R X S^3 boundary and 2) those with one dimensional light-like

asymptotic characteristics of the solutions, which in part specify the global
charges defining the geometry. We analyze each of these classes in some detail

place $\infty$ of $k$ a $C^*$-dynamical system $(C_{k,\infty},\sigma_t)$ that
is analogous to the Bost-Connes system associated to $\QQ$ and its archimedian
place. Our construction relies on Hayes' explicit class field theory in terms
of sign-normalized rank one Drinfel'd modules. We show that $C_{k,\infty}$ has
a faithful continuous action of $\Gal(K/k)$, where $K$ is a certain field
constructed by Hayes, such that $k^\abi\subset K\subset k^\ab$, where $k^\abi$
is the maximal abelian extension of $k$ that is totally split at $\infty$. We
classify the extremal KMS$_\beta$ states of $(C_{k,\infty},\sigma_t)$ at any
temperature $0<1/\beta<\infty$ and show that a phase transition with
spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs at temperature $1/\beta=1$. At high
temperature $1/\beta\geqslant 1$, there is a unique KMS$_\beta$ state. At low
temperature $1/\beta<1$, the space of extremal KMS$_\beta$ states is principal
homogeneous under $\Gal(K/k)$. Each such state is of type $\I_\infty$ and the
partition function is the Dedekind zeta function $\zeta_{k,\infty}$. Moreover,
we construct a ""rational"" *-subalgebra $\HH$, we give a presentation of $\HH$
and of $C_{k,\infty}$, and we show that the values of the low-temperature
extremal KMS$_\beta$ states at certain elements of $\HH$ are related to special
values of partial zeta functions.\n
  Erratum: This article wrongly claims that at high temperature
$1/\beta\geqslant 1$, the unique KMS$_\beta$ state is of type
$\III_{q^{-\beta}}$, where $q$ is the cardinal of the constant subfield of $k$.

is $\III_{q^{-\beta d_\infty}}$ where $d_\infty$ is the degree of the place

support) from few linear measurements of f (inner products with some fixed
vectors). A nice and intuitive reconstruction by Linear Programming has been
advocated since 80-ies by Dave Donoho and his collaborators. Namely, one can
relax the reconstruction problem, which is highly nonconvex, to a convex
problem -- and, moreover, to a linear program. However, when is exactly the
reconstruction problem equivalent to its convex relaxation is an open question.
Recent work of many authors shows that the number of measurements k(r,n) needed
to exactly reconstruct any r-sparse signal f of length n (a vector in R^n of
support r) from its linear measurements with the convex relaxation method is
usually O(r polylog(n)). However, known estimates of the number of measurements
k(r,n) involve huge constants, in spite of very good performance of the
algorithms in practice. In this paper, we consider random Gaussian measurements
and random Fourier measurements (a frequency sample of f). For Gaussian
measurements, we prove the first guarantees with reasonable constants: k(r,n) <
12 r (2 + log(n/r)), which is optimal up to constants. For Fourier
measurements, we prove the best known bound k(r,n) = O(r log(n) . log^2(r)
log(r log n)), which is optimal within the log log n and log^3 r factors. Our
arguments are based on the technique of Geometric Functional Analysis and
Probability in Banach spaces.

In contrast to the
standard distance in connected graphs, it takes into account all paths between
vertices. Formally, it is defined as d(i,j)=q_{ii}+q_{jj}-q_{ij}-q_{ji}, where
q_{ij} is the (i,j)-entry of the {\em relative forest accessibility matrix}
Q(\epsilon)=(I+\epsilon L)^{-1}, L is the Laplacian matrix of the (weighted)
(multi)graph, and \epsilon is a positive parameter. By the matrix-forest
theorem, the (i,j)-entry of the relative forest accessibility matrix of a graph
provides the specific number of spanning rooted forests such that i and j
belong to the same tree rooted at i. Extremely simple formulas express the
modification of the proposed distance under the basic graph transformations. We
give a topological interpretation of d(i,j) in terms of the probability of
unsuccessful linking i and j in a model of random links. The properties of this
metric are compared with those of some other graph metrics. An application of
this metric is related to clustering procedures such as ""centered partition.""
In another procedure, the relative forest accessibility and the corresponding
distance serve to choose the centers of the clusters and to assign a cluster to
each non-central vertex. The notion of cumulative weight of connections between
two vertices is proposed. The reasoning involves a reciprocity principle for
weighted multigraphs. Connections between the resistance distance and the
forest distance are established.

adjacency matrix and D(G) is the diagonal matrix of vertex degrees. According
to the Matrix-Tree Theorem, the number of spanning trees in G is equal to any
cofactor of an entry of L(G). A rooted forest is a union of disjoint rooted
trees. We consider the matrix W(G)=I+L(G) and prove that the (i,j)-cofactor of
W(G) is equal to the number of spanning rooted forests of G, in which the
vertices i and j belong to the same tree rooted at i. The determinant of W(G)
equals the total number of spanning rooted forests, therefore the (i,j)-entry
of the matrix W^{-1}(G) can be considered as a measure of relative
''forest-accessibility'' of the vertex i from j (or j from i). These results
follow from somewhat more general theorems we prove, which concern weighted
multigraphs. The analogous theorems for (multi)digraphs are established. These
results provide a graph-theoretic interpretation for the adjugate to the
Laplacian characteristic matrix.

dependence of the observed J/psi suppression in Pb+Pb collisions at the SPS

the assumptions of a color singlet or color octet production mechanism. A more
recent analytic calculation [Fujii:2003fq], which includes incoherent
final-state re-scatterings with explicit momentum transfer fluctuations in
three dimensions, indicates much less suppression and little sensitivity to the

incoherent momentum transfer fluctuations in two dimensions, which is more
appropriate for the heavy-ion collision kinematics. Our analytic and

each individual is represented by a node of the transmission network and the
edges are the connections between individuals along which the infection may

homogeneous but obeys a power-law distribution. Due to the heterogeneity of
activity, the infection can persistently exist at a very low prevalence, which
has been observed in real data but can not be illuminated by previous models
with homogeneous mixing hypothesis. Furthermore, the model displays a clear
picture of hierarchical spread: In the early stage the infection is adhered to
these high-risk persons, and then, diffuses toward low-risk population. The
prediction results show that the development of epidemics can be roughly
categorized into three patterns for different countries, and the pattern of a
given country is mainly determined by the average sex-activity and transmission
probability per sexual partner. In most cases, the effect of HIV epidemics on
demographic structure is very small. However, for some extremely countries,
like Botswana, the number of sex-active people can be depressed to nearly a
half by AIDS.

thermal diffusion in oscillating grids turbulence (Buchholz et al. 2004;

the formation of particle inhomogeneities.

these devices, various quantum coherence phenomena can be observed, e.g., the
perfect quantum state transfer without reflection in a Y-shaped beam, the
multi- mode entanglers of electron wave by star shaped network and Bloch
electron interferometer with the lattice Aharonov-Bohm effects. Behind these

parameters with some specific values, a connected quantum networks can be
reduced into a virtual network, which is a direct sum of some irreducible
subnetworks. Thus, the perfect quantum state transfer in each subnetwork in

motion in these quantum networks by the magnetic flux through some loops of

Schr\""odinger's equation, but also its {\it nonlinear generalizations.} This
coupling with ``nonlinear wave mechanics'' is used to evaluate the small
parameter of PCSFT.
