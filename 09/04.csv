depends crucially on the prescription for the pressure perturbation delta-p.
The pressure perturbation is usually defined using the dark energy rest-frame,
but we show that this frame becomes unphysical at the divide. If the pressure
perturbation is kept finite in any other frame, then the phantom divide can be
crossed. Our findings are important for generalised fluid dark energy used in
data analysis (since current cosmological data sets indicate that the dark
energy is characterised by p ~ -rho so that p < -rho cannot be excluded) as
well as for any models crossing the phantom divide, like some modified gravity,
coupled dark energy and braneworld models. We also illustrate the results by an
explicit calculation for the ""Quintom"" case with two scalar fields.

properties and location within the host galaxy remain prominent puzzles. Most
current models fail to reproduce the globular cluster mass function as a result
of dynamical evolution from an initial power-law, except under very specific
conditions which are not generally consistent with observations. How well do we
actually know the proper initial conditions? The cluster initial mass function
(CIMF) seems to be consistent with a power-law with exponent alpha~ -2 in most
present-day star forming galaxies, but the limits of the mass range over which
this approximation is valid remain poorly constrained both observationally and

CIMFs which deviate from a power-law.

populations around M87 and NGC 4552, another luminous Virgo elliptical in our

coverage out to 0.5 Mpc from the M87 centre. GC candidates were selected by
applying a colour criterion on the B-V and V-I diagram to unresolved objects,
which greatly reduces contamination. The data from control fields taken with
Subaru/Suprime-Cam were also analyzed for subtraction of contamination in the
GC sample. We investigate GC luminosity functions (GCLFs) within 10' (~ 45 kpc)

estimated to be 23.62 +-0.06 mag and 23.56 +- 0.20 mag for the GC population in
M87 and NGC 4552, respectively. The GCLF is found to be a function of GC
colour; V_TO of the red GC subpopulation (V-I > 1.1) is fainter than that of
the blue GC subpopulation (V-I < 1.1) in both M87 and NGC 4552, as expected if
the colour differences are primarily due to a metallicity effect and the mass
functions of the two subpopulations are similar. The radial dependence of the
GCLF is also investigated for the GC population in M87. The GCLF of each
subpopulation at 1' < R < 5' is compared with that at 5' < R < 10' but no

estimate GC specific frequencies (S_N) for M87 and NGC 4552. The S_N of the M87

function of distance from M87 and NGC 4552, another luminous Virgo elliptical
in our survey field, it is found that clear bimodality ((V-I)_peak ~ 1.0 and
1.2) is seen only in the inner regions (< 10 kpc) of the host galaxies and that
it becomes weaker with radius due to the decreasing contribution of the red GC
(V-I > 1.1) subpopulation. It is also found (both around M87 and NGC 4552) that
while the spatial distribution of the red GCs is as centrally concentrated as
the host galaxy halo light distribution, the distribution of the blue GCs (V-I
< 1.1) tends to be more extended. However, the blue GC distribution around M87
is not as extended as the Virgo cluster mass density profile. Based on these
facts, we argue that the contribution of GCs associated with the Virgo cluster
(e.g., intergalactic GCs) is not significant around M87 and is not the primary
reason for the high S_N value of M87. Instead, most of the blue GCs around
luminous ellipticals, as well as the red GCs, are presumed to be associated
with the host galaxy. We model the radial profile of GC surface densities out
to ~ 0.5 Mpc from M87 by a superposition of the GC populations associated with
M87 and with NGC 4552, suggesting the existence of an additional intergalactic
GC (i-GC) population independent of the luminous ellipticals. We obtain a crude
estimate of i-GC specific frequency S_N = 2.9 (+4.2, -1.5), which may indicate
the contribution of tidally captured GCs in the GC population of M87 is low to
be consistent with the high S_N value of M87.

our results are compatible with a simple law similar to the one of Kennicutt
but extending smoothly to lower surface densities, but with considerable
scatter. We do not detect an abrupt break in the UV light at the threshold
radius derived from H-alpha data (at which the H-alpha profile shows a break
and beyond which only a few HII regions are usually found). We interpret the

RC3 and 2MASS catalogues, to construct the largest sample of S0 galaxies ever
used in a study of the TFR. Independent of environment, S0 galaxies are found
to lie systematically below the TFR for nearby spirals in both optical and
infrared bands. This offset can be crudely interpreted as arising from the
luminosity evolution of spiral galaxies that have faded since ceasing star
formation. However, we also find a large scatter in the TFR. We show that most
of this scatter is intrinsic, not due to the observational uncertainties. The
presence of such a large scatter means that the population of S0 galaxies
cannot have formed exclusively by the above simple fading mechanism after all
transforming at a single epoch. To better understand the complexity of the
transformation mechanism, we have searched for correlations between the offset
from the TFR and other properties of the galaxies such as their structural
properties, central velocity dispersions and ages (as estimated from line
indices). For the Fornax Cluster data, the offset from the TFR relates with the
estimated age of the stars in the individual galaxies, in the sense and of the
magnitude expected if S0 galaxies had passively faded since being converted
from spirals. This correlation implies that a significant part of the scatter
in the TFR arises from the different times at which galaxies began their

using HST/ACS imaging for a sample of 79 early-type galaxies (-21.7<M_B<-15.2

KMM mixture modeling algorithm, we find a highly significant correlation,
d(g-z)/dz = -0.037 +- 0.004, between color and magnitude for the subpopulation
of blue GCs in the co-added GC color-magnitude diagram of the three brightest
Virgo galaxies (M49, M87 and M60): brighter GCs are redder than their fainter
counterparts. For the single GC systems of M87 and M60, we find similar
correlations; M49 does not appear to show a significant trend. There is no
correlation between (g-z) and M_z for GCs of the red subpopulation. The
correlation d(g-z)/dg for the blue subpopulation is much weaker than d(g-z)/dz.
Using Monte Carlo simulations, we attribute this to the fact that the blue
subpopulation in M_g extends to higher luminosities than the red subpopulation,
which biases the KMM fits. The correlation between color and M_z thus is a real
effect. This conclusion is supported by biweight fits to the same color
distributions. We identify two environmental dependencies of the
color-magnitude relation: (1) the slope decreases in significance with
decreasing galaxy luminosity; and (2) the slope is stronger for GCs at smaller
galactocentric distances. We examine several mechanisms that might give rise to
the observed color-magnitude relation: (1) presence of contaminators; (2)
accretion of GCs from low-mass galaxies; (3) stochastic effects; (4) capture of
field stars by individual GCs; and (5) GC self-enrichment. We conclude that
self-enrichment and field-star capture, or a combination of these processes,
offer the most promising means of explaining our observations.

the cluster integrated star formation rate (Sigma_SFR) the cluster total
stellar mass (M_star), the fractions of star forming (f_SF) and blue (f_b)
galaxies and other cluster global properties, namely its richness (N_gal, i.e.
the total number of cluster members within the cluster virial radius), velocity
dispersion (sigma_v), virial mass (M_200), and X-ray luminosity (L_X). All
cluster global quantities are corrected for projection effects before the
analysis. Galaxy SFRs and stellar masses are taken from the catalog of
Brinchmann et al. (2004), which is based on SDSS spectra. We only consider
galaxies with M_r <= -20.25 in our analysis, and exclude AGNs. We find that
both Sigma_SFR and M_star are correlated with all the cluster global
quantities. A partial correlation analysis show that all the correlations are
induced by the fundamental one between Sigma_SFR and N_gal, hence there is no
evidence that the cluster properties affect the mean SFR or M_star per galaxy.
The relations between Sigma_SFR and M_star, on one side, and both N_gal and
M_200, on the other side, are linear, i.e. we see no evidence that different
clusters have different SFR or different M_star per galaxy and per unit mass.
The fraction f_SF does not depend on any cluster property considered, while f_b
does depend on L_X. We note that a significant fraction of star-forming cluster
galaxies are red (~25% of the whole cluster galaxy population). We conclude
that the global cluster properties are unable to affect the SF properties of
cluster galaxies, but the presence of the X-ray luminous intra-cluster medium
can affect their colors, perhaps through the ram-pressure stripping mechanism.

for BH growth at high redshift and compared this to the expected LOFAR
sensitivity to these sources. The number of potentially detectable HII regions
does not only depend on the ionisation state of the intergalactic medium and
the decoupling of the spin temperature of the neutral hydrogen from the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) temperature, but is also strongly sensitive to the
rate of growth of BHs at high redshift. If the supermassive BHs at redshift 6
were built up via continuous Eddington-limited accretion from low mass seed BHs
at high redshift, then LOFAR is not expected to detect isolated QSO HII regions
at redshifts much larger than 6, and only if the IGM is still significantly
neutral. If the high-redshift growth of BHs starts with massive seed BHs and is
driven by short-lived accretion events following the merging of BH hosting
galaxies then the detection of HII regions surrounding supermassive BHs may
extend to redshifts as large as 8-9 but is still very sensitive to the redshift
to which the IGM remains significantly neutral. The most optimistic predictions
are for a model where the supermassive BHs at z>6 have grown slowly. HII
regions around supermassive BHs may then be detected to significantly larger
redshifts.

and temperature regime where new quantum collective phenomena emerge. Finding
such physics in systems of photons, however, is problematic, as photons
typically do not interact with each other and can be created or destroyed at
will. Here, we introduce a physical system of photons that exhibits strongly
correlated dynamics on a meso-scale. By adding photons to a two-dimensional
array of coupled optical cavities each containing a single two-level atom in
the photon-blockade regime, we form dressed states, or polaritons, that are
both long-lived and strongly interacting. Our zero temperature results predict
that this photonic system will undergo a characteristic Mott insulator
(excitations localised on each site) to superfluid (excitations delocalised
across the lattice) quantum phase transition. Each cavity's impressive photon
out-coupling potential may lead to actual devices based on these quantum
many-body effects, as well as observable, tunable quantum simulators. We
explicitly show that such phenomena may be observable in micro-machined diamond
containing nitrogen-vacancy colour centres and superconducting microwave
strip-line resonators.

response theory. Some states, satisfying all the physical state conditions,
give the blow-up and damping behavior of the density distributions

identifies the transverse-normal block of an effective gravitational-radiation

picture is considered a faithful representation of the fermionic quantum number
variation. It represents each created fermion by an energy level that crosses
the zero-energy line from below. If several fermions of various masses are
created, the level crossing picture contains several levels that cross the
zero-energy line and cross each other. However, we know from quantum mechanics
that the corresponding levels cannot cross if the different fermions are mixed
via some interaction potential. The simultaneous application of these two
requirements on the level behavior leads to paradoxes. For instance, a naive
interpretation of the resulting level crossing picture gives rise to charge
nonconservation. In this paper, we resolve this paradox by a precise
calculation of the transition probability, and discuss what are the
implications for the electroweak theory. In particular, the nonperturbative
transition probability is higher if top quarks are present in the initial
state.

disjoint disks from a closed surface of genus g. Assuming \chi(\Sigma)<0, we
show that on \Sigma, the set of flat metrics which have the same Laplacian
spectrum of Dirichlet boundary condition is compact in the C^\infty topology.
This isospectral compactness extends the result of Osgood, Phillips, and Sarnak
\cite{OPS3} for type (0,n) surfaces, whose examples include bounded plane
domains.
  Our main ingredients are as following. We first show that the determinant of
the Laplacian is a proper function on the moduli space of geodesically bordered
hyperbolic metrics on \Sigma. Secondly, we show that the space of such metrics
is homeomorphic (in the C^\infty-topology) to the space of flat metrics (on
\Sigma) with constantly curved boundary. Because of this, we next reduce the
complicated degenerations of flat metrics to the simpler and well-known
degenerations of hyperbolic metrics, and we show that determinants of
Laplacians of flat metrics on \Sigma, with fixed area and boundary of constant
geodesic curvature, give a proper function on the corresponding moduli space.
This is interesting because Khuri \cite{Kh} showed that if the boundary length
(instead of the area) is fixed, the determinant is not a proper function when
\Sigma is of type (g, n), g>0; while Osgood, Phillips, and Sarnak \cite{OPS3}
showed the properness when g=0.

changes, involve only a few parameters. In addition, we also point out that
even in systems with a large number of components, only a few may be of

measure of the important collections is inversely proportional to the rank. We
then consider the concept of relative degeneracies coming from change of
resolving power, at various scales, which too would vindicate the procedure of
coarse-graining in building up hierarchical organizations. We suggest that,
similar to the group-theoretical annihilation of dangling tensor indices due to
symmetry to minimize energy, even in more inexact contexts such as in biology

may lead to cluster formation, which are semi-closed, and let leakage

area covered are calculated via a series expansion. The dependence of the final
coverage on the parameters of the model (i.e. the parameters of the
distribution of polymer lengths in the solution) is studied. Various methods
for accelerating the convergence of the resulting infinite series are
considered. To demonstrate the accuracy of the truncated series approach, the
series expansion results are compared with the results of stochastic
simulation.

  molecular phylogenies","13 pages, 7 figures",,,,"q-bio.GN",,"  36 single genes of six plants inferred 18 unique trees using maximum
parsimony. Such incongruence is an important issue and how to reconstruct the
congruent tree still is one of the most challenges in molecular phylogenetics.
For resolving this problem, a genome-wide EST data mining approach was
systematically investigated by retrieving a large size of EST data of 144
shared genes of six green plants from GenBank. The results show that the
concatenated alignments approach overcame incongruence among single-gene
phylogenies and successfully reconstructed the congruent tree of six species
with 100% jackknife support across each branch when 144 genes was used.
Jackknife supports of correct branches increased with number of genes linearly,
but those of wrong branches also increased linearly. For inferring the
congruent tree, the minimum 30 genes were required. This approach may provide
potential power in resolving conflictions of phylogenies.

well.

set of channels which have null quantum capacity is identified. This is done by
exploiting the composition rules of one-mode Gaussian maps and the fact that
anti-degradable channels can not be used to transfer quantum information.

momentum is intrinsic while orbital angular momentum possesses
quasi-intrinsicness only if the vortex-like singularities are present. The
claimed spin to orbital angular momentum conversion is interpreted in terms of
spin redirection geometric phase. It is pointed out that this interpretation
validates our angular momentum holonomy conjecture.

approximation involving only real trajectories propagating in real time to
describe the scattering of a Gaussian wavepacket by a finite square potential
barrier. We show that the approximation describes both tunneling and
interferences very accurately in the limit of small Plank's constant. We use
these results to estimate the tunneling time of the wavepacket and find that,
for high energies, the barrier slows down the wavepacket but that it speeds it
up at energies comparable to the barrier height.

and we analyse the optimal decorrelation map in terms of added noise in the
