(Pointecouteau & Silk 2005) and the validity of GR on cluster scales (Clowe et

bullet cluster is dominated by a collisionless -- most probably non-baryonic --
component in GR as well as in MOND, a result consistent with the dynamics of
many X-ray clusters. Our findings add to the number of known pathologies for a
purely baryonic MOND, including its inability to fit the latest data from the
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. A plausible resolution of all these
issues and standard issues of Cold Dark Matter with galaxy rotation curves is
the ""marriage"" of MOND with ordinary hot neutrinos of 2eV. This prediction is
just within the GR-independent maximum of neutrino mass from current
$\beta$-decay experiments, and is falsifiable by the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino

the large relative velocity of the two clusters comprising the bullet cluster

A 15-20 micron emission hump appears superposed on the dust continuum, and we
attribute this to PAH C-C-C bending modes. We also detect the well-known 11.3
micron PAH C-H bending feature, and find the integrated strength of the 15-20
micron hump about a factor of seven stronger than the 11.3 micron band in the

large-scale, shell-like emission from the remnant, partly due to confusion with
the ambient ISM material. However, we identified several knots of shocked
interstellar gas based on their distinct infrared colors. We discuss the bright

(-9,+13)% for FGK stars using a 15% relative excess threshold. Relative to a
model of decaying excess frequency, the frequency of debris disks around A-type
stars appears marginally low for the cluster's age while that of FGK stars
appears consistent. Scenarios that may qualitatively explain this result are
examined. We conclude that planetesimal activity in the terrestrial region of
FGK stars is common in the first ~50 Myr and decays on timescales of ~100 Myr.

The toroidal fields in the stable layer possess a striking persistent

Ages, metallicities and [alpha/Fe] ratios have been derived through the
comparison of Lick indices measured at different galacto-centric distances with
new SSP models which account for the presence of alpha/Fe enhancement. The SSPs
cover a wide range of ages, metallicities and [alpha/Fe] ratios. To derive the
stellar population parameters we have devised an algorithm based on the
probability density function. We derive a large spread in age ((1-15) Gyrs).
Age does not show any significant trend with central velocity dispersion
sigma_c but E galaxies appear on average older than S0. On the contrary, an
increasing trend of metallicity and [alpha/Fe] with sigma_c is observed,
testifying that the chemical enrichment was more efficient and the duration of
the star formation shorter in more massive galaxies. We have also sought for
possible correlations with the local galaxy density but neither metallicity nor
alpha-enhancement show clear trends. However we find that while low density
environments (LDE) contain very young objects (from 1 to 4 Gyr), none of the
galaxies in the higher density environments (HDE) is younger than 5 Gyrs.
Considering the lack of environmental effect on the [alpha/Fe] ratio and the
high value of [alpha/Fe] in some young massive objects, we argue that young
galaxies in LDE are more likely due to recent rejuvenation episodes. By
comparing the number of rejuvenated objects with the total number of galaxies
in our sample, and by means of simple two-SSP component models, we estimate
that, on average, the rejuvenation episodes do not involve more than 25 % of
the total galaxy mass.

population. For this study we utilise LRGs from the recently completed 2dF-SDSS
LRG and QSO survey (2SLAQ). Equivalent widths of the Hdelta and [OII] lines are
measured and used to define three spectral types, those with only strong Hdelta
absorption (k+a), those with strong [OII] in emission (em) and those with both
(em+a). All other LRGs are considered to have passive star formation histories.
The vast majority of LRGs are found to be passive (~80 per cent), however
significant numbers of k+a (2.7 per cent), em+a (1.2 per cent) and em LRGs (8.6
per cent) are identified. An investigation into the redshift dependence of the
fractions is also performed. A sample of SDSS MAIN galaxies with colours and
luminosities consistent with the 2SLAQ LRGs is selected to provide a low
redshift comparison. While the em and em+a fractions are consistent with the
low redshift SDSS sample, the fraction of k+a LRGs is found to increase
significantly with redshift. This result is interpreted as an indication of an
increasing amount of recent star formation activity in LRGs with redshift. By
considering the expected life time of the k+a phase, the number of LRGs which
will undergo a k+a phase can be estimated. A crude comparison of this estimate
with the predictions from semi-analytic models of galaxy formation shows that
the predicted level of k+a and em+a activity is not sufficient to reconcile the
predicted mass growth for massive early-types in a hierarchical merging
scenario.

formation in HII galaxies, with the aim of detecting episodes of recent star
formation in an early phase of evolution where the first supernovae start to
appear. Our sample consists of 31 HII galaxies, characterized by strong
Hydrogen emission lines, for which low resolution VLA 3.5cm and 6cm
observations were obtained. The radio spectral energy distribution has a range
of behaviours; 1) there are galaxies where the SED is characterized by a
synchrotron-type slope, 2) galaxies with a thermal slope, and, 3) galaxies with
possible free-free absorption at long wavelengths. The latter SEDs were found
in a few galaxies and represent a signature of heavily embedded massive star
clusters closely related to the early stages of massive star formation. Based
on the comparison of the star formation rates determined from the recombination
lines and those determined from the radio emission we find that SFR(Ha) is on
average five times higher than SFR(1.4GHz). We confirm this tendency by
comparing the ratio between the observed flux at 20 cm and the expected one,
calculated based on the Ha star formation rates, both for the galaxies in our
sample and for normal ones. This analysis shows that this ratio is a factor of
2 smaller in our galaxies than in normal ones, indicating that they fall below
the FIR/radio correlation. These results suggest that the emission of these
galaxies is dominated by a recent and massive star formation event in which the
first supernovae (SN) just started to explode. We conclude that the systematic
lack of synchrotron emission in those systems with the largest equivalent width
of Hb can only be explained if those are young starbursts of less than 3.5Myr
of age.

former sample was observed in the XMM-Newton Extended Survey of the Taurus

the latter. We confirm the previously identified peculiar spectrum of DG Tau A
and find similar phenomenology in GV Tau and DP Tau, suggesting a new class of
X-ray spectra. These consist of a lightly absorbed, very soft component and a
strongly absorbed, very hard component. The latter is flaring while little
variability is detected in the former. The absorption of the harder component
is about an order of magnitude higher than expected from the optical extinction
assuming a standard gas-to-dust mass ratio. The flaring hard component
represents active coronal emission. Its strong absorption is attributed to mass
inflow from the accretion disk. The optical extinction is small because the
dust has sublimated at larger distances. The weakly absorbed soft component
cannot originate from the same location. Because the stars drive strong jets,
we propose that the X-rays are generated in shocks in the jets. We find that
for the three peculiar X-ray sources, the luminosity of the soft component
roughly scales with the equivalent width of the [OI] 6300A line formed in the
jets, and with the mass outflow rate. In the more strongly obscured protostars,
the soft component is entirely absorbed, and only the hard, coronal component
penetrates the envelope or the near-edge-on disk.

of 1.3+/-0.03"" for the companion, CHXR 73 B, which corresponds to 210 AU at the
distance of the cluster. A near-infrared spectrum of this source obtained with
CorMASS at the Magellan II telescope exhibits strong steam absorption that
confirms its late-type nature (>=M9.5). In addition, the gravity-sensitive
shapes of the H- and K-band continua demonstrate that CHXR 73 B is a young,
pre-main-sequence object rather than a field star. The probability that CHXR
73A and B are unrelated members of Chamaeleon I is ~0.001. We estimate the
masses of CHXR 73 B and other known substellar companions in young clusters
with a method that is consistent with the dynamical measurements of the
eclipsing binary brown dwarf 2M 0535-0546, which consists of a comparison of
the bolometric luminosities of the companions to the values predicted by the
evolutionary models of Chabrier & coworkers and Burrows & coworkers. We arrive
at mass estimates of 0.003-0.004, 0.024+/-0.012, 0.011+0.01/-0.003, and
0.012+0.008/-0.005 Msun for 2M 1207-3932 B, GQ Lup B, DH Tau B, and CHXR 73 B,

companions to stars outside the solar system that have been detected in direct

planetary companions (M<=0.015 Msun). However, because these two objects (as
well as 2M 1207-3932 B) probably did not form within circumstellar disks around
their primaries, we suggest that they should be viewed as brown dwarf

two choices of the stellar initial mass function: a standard Salpeter IMF, and
a top-heavier IMF. Several of the observational properties of the galaxy
population in nearby clusters are reproduced fairly well by simulations. A
Salpeter IMF is successful in accounting for the slope and the normalization of
the color-magnitude relation for the bulk of the galaxy population. Simulated
clusters have a relation between mass and optical luminosity which generally
agrees with observations, both in normalization and slope. We find that
galaxies are generally bluer, younger and more star forming in the cluster
outskirts, thus reproducing the observational trends. However, simulated
clusters have a total number of galaxies which is significantly smaller than
the observed one, falling short by about a factor 2-3. Finally, the brightest

1.38 solar masses then it can ignite carbon degenerately at its centre. This
can lead to a thermonuclear runaway and thence a supernova explosion. However
if the accretion rate is too high the outer layers of the white dwarf heat up
too much and carbon ignites there non-degenerately. A series of mild carbon
flashes can then propagate inwards and convert the carbon to neon relatively
gently. There is no thermonuclear runaway and no supernova. We have determined
the critical rate for accretion and find it to be generally about two-fifths of

it for low-count data. The performance of $L$ in the model classification and
point estimation problems is explored by Monte-Carlo simulations of Chandra and
XMM X-ray spectra, and is compared to the performances of the binned Poisson
statistic ($C$), Pearson's $\chi^2$ and Neyman's $\chi^2_N$, the Kolmogorov-
Smirnov, and Kuiper' statistics. It is found that the unbinned log likelihood
$L$ performs best with regard to the expected chi-square distance between true
and estimated spectra, the chance of a successful identification among discrete
candidate models, the area under the receiver-operator curve of reduced
(two-model) binary classification problems, and generally also with regard to
the mean square errors of individual spectrum parameters. The $\chi^2$
($\chi^2_{\rm N}$) statistics should only be used if more than 10 (15)
predicted counts per bin are available. From the practical point of view, the
computational cost of evaluating $L$ is smaller than for any of the alternative
methods if the forward model is specified in terms of a Poisson intensity and
normalization is a free parameter. The maximum-$L$ method is applied to 14
observations from the Taurus Molecular Cloud, and the unbinned results are
compared to binned XSPEC results, and found to generally agree, with exceptions
explained by instability under re-binning and by background fine structures.
The maximum-$L$ method has no lower limit on the available counts, and allows
to treat weak sources which are beyond the means of binned methods.

surface. Considering its specific reflectance spectrum showing a sharp edge
around 700 nm, vegetation can be considered as a potential global biomarker.
This work, based on observational data, aims to characterise and to quantify
this signature in the disk-averaged Earth's spectrum. Earthshine spectra have
been used to test the detectability of the ""Vegetation Red Edge"" (VRE) in the
Earth spectrum. We obtained reflectance spectra from near UV (320 nm) to near
IR (1020 nm) for different Earth phases (continents or oceans seen from the
Moon) with EMMI on the NTT at ESO/La Silla, Chile. We accurately correct the
sky background and take into account the phase-dependent colour of the Moon.
VRE measurements require a correction of the ozone Chappuis absorption band and
Rayleigh plus aerosol scattering. Results : The near-UV spectrum shows a dark
Earth below 350 nm due to the ozone absorption. The Vegetation Red Edge is
observed when forests are present (4.0% for Africa and Europe), and is lower
when clouds and oceans are mainly visible (1.3% for the Pacific Ocean). Errors
are typically $\pm0.5$, and $\pm1.5$ in the worst case. We discuss the
different sources of errors and bias and suggest possible improvements. We
showed that measuring the VRE or an analog on an Earth-like planet remains very
difficult (photometric relative accuracy of 1% or better). It remains a small
feature compared to atmospheric absorption lines. A direct monitoring from
space of the global (disk-averaged) Earth's spectrum would provide the best VRE
follow-up.

and period. In the light of recent changes to the theory of nova ignition and
magnetic braking we investigate whether hibernation remains a viable mechanism
for creating cataclysmic variable diversity. We model the ratio of time spent
as dwarf novae (DNe) to nova-like systems (NLs). Above a critical mass-transfer
rate the system is NL and below it a DN. The dominant loss of angular momentum
is by magnetic braking but the rate is uncertain. It is also uncertain what

models of the ratios against the period of the system for different magnetic
braking rates and different ejected masses with the ratio of the number of

in spatial dimension d=1 form universal quantum liquids in the low density
limit: all properties can be related to those of the spinless free Fermi gas.
Previous renormalization group (RG) analyses demonstrated that this
universality is described by an RG fixed point, infrared stable for d<2, of the
zero density gas. We show that for d>2 the same fixed point describes the
universal properties of particles with short-range attractive interactions near
a Feshbach resonance; the fixed point is now infrared unstable, and the
relevant perturbation is the detuning of the resonance. Some exponents are
determined exactly, and the same expansion in powers of (d-2) applies for
scaling functions for d<2 and d>2. A separate exact RG analysis of a field
theory of the particles coupled to `molecules' finds an alternative description
of the same fixed point, with identical exponents; this approach yields a (4-d)
expansion which agrees with the recent results of Nishida and Son
(cond-mat/0604500). The existence of the RG fixed point implies a universal
phase diagram as a function of density, temperature, population imbalance, and
detuning; in particular, this applies to the BEC-BCS crossover of fermions with
s-wave pairing. Our results open the way towards computation of these universal
properties using the standard field-theoretic techniques of critical phenomena,
along with a systematic analysis of corrections to universality. We also
propose a 1/N expansion (based upon models with Sp(2N) symmetry) of the fixed
point and its vicinity, and use it to obtain results for the phase diagram.

array, the SNR gain of the collective array response approaches its local
maximum exhibiting a stochastic resonant behavior. Moreover, the local maximum
SNR gain, at a non-zero optimal array noise intensity, increases as the array

obtained by an infinite array. We suggest that the performance of infinite
arrays can be closely approached by an array of two bistable oscillators

measurements in order to clarify its static and dynamic magnetic properties.
The time spectra of muon spin depolarization suggest that the local fields at
the muon site contain both static and fluctuating components in all ordered
phases down to 0.3 K. In the weak ferromagnetic phase (20 K~$>T>$~9.3 K), the
static component is dominant. On the other hand, upon cooling the fluctuating
component becomes dominant in the incommensurate helix phase (9.3K > T > 1.4K).
The dynamical fluctuations of the local fields persist down to 0.3K, where a
new incommensurate phase (T < 1.4K) is expected to appear. This result suggests
that spins fluctuate even at T \to 0. We propose two possible origins of the
remnant dynamical spin fluctuations: frustration of the exchange interactions
and the dynamic behavior of the soliton lattice.

reaction. For laser energy densities E_{2}\geq E_{Si}, spatially ordered
patterns with periodic length scales L<\Lambda were observed and resulted from
interference of an incident laser beam with a beam transmitted into the Si
substrate. These nanopatterns showed one- as well as two-dimensional spatial
ordering of the nanostructures. The microstructure in this laser energy regime
was dominated by silicide formation. These results suggest that various
nanostructures and microstructures, ranging from nearly pure metal to a Si-rich
silicide phase can be formed by appropriate choice of the laser energy
simultaneous with film growth.

peer selection strategies. Two such strategies have been introduced by the
BitTorrent protocol: the rarest first and choke algorithms. Whereas it is
commonly admitted that BitTorrent performs well, recent studies have proposed
the replacement of the rarest first and choke algorithms in order to improve
efficiency and fairness. In this paper, we use results from real experiments to
advocate that the replacement of the rarest first and choke algorithms cannot
be justified in the context of peer-to-peer file replication in the Internet.
We instrumented a BitTorrent client and ran experiments on real torrents with
different characteristics. Our experimental evaluation is peer oriented,
instead of tracker oriented, which allows us to get detailed information on all
exchanged messages and protocol events. We go beyond the mere observation of
the good efficiency of both algorithms. We show that the rarest first algorithm
guarantees close to ideal diversity of the pieces among peers. In particular,
on our experiments, replacing the rarest first algorithm with source or network
coding solutions cannot be justified. We also show that the choke algorithm in
its latest version fosters reciprocation and is robust to free riders. In
particular, the choke algorithm is fair and its replacement with a bit level
tit-for-tat solution is not appropriate. Finally, we identify new areas of
improvements for efficient peer-to-peer file replication protocols.

users by joint beamforming and scheduling is capable of achieving high
throughput, which grows double logarithmically with the number of users. The
sum rate for channel state information (CSI) feedback, however, increases
linearly with the number of users, reducing the effective uplink capacity. To
address this problem, a novel space division multiple access (SDMA) design is
proposed, where the sum feedback rate is upper-bounded by a constant. This
design consists of algorithms for CSI quantization, threshold based CSI
feedback, and joint beamforming and scheduling. The key feature of the proposed
approach is the use of feedback thresholds to select feedback users with large
channel gains and small CSI quantization errors such that the sum feedback rate
constraint is satisfied. Despite this constraint, the proposed SDMA design is
shown to achieve a sum capacity growth rate close to the optimal one. Moreover,
the feedback overflow probability for this design is found to decrease
exponentially with the difference between the allowable and the average sum
feedback rates. Numerical results show that the proposed SDMA design is capable
of attaining higher sum capacities than existing ones, even though the sum
feedback rate is bounded.

except that of the Hawking radiation (Hawking field), then the black hole
evaporates and the entropy of the black hole decreases. The generalised second
law guarantees the increase of the total entropy of the whole system which
consists of the black hole and the Hawking field. That is, the increase of the
entropy of the Hawking field is faster than the decrease of the black hole
entropy. In naive sense, one may expect that the entropy increase of the
Hawking field is due to the self-interaction among the composite particles of
the Hawking field, and that the ""self""-relaxation of the Hawking field results
in the entropy increase. Then, when one consider a non-self-interacting matter
field as the Hawking field, it is obvious that the self-relaxation does not
take place, and one may think that the total entropy does not increase.
However, using nonequilibrium thermodynamics which has been developed recently,
we find for the non-self-interacting Hawking field that the rate of entropy
increase of the Hawking field (the entropy emission rate by the black hole)
grows faster than the rate of entropy decrease of the black hole along the
black hole evaporation in the empty space. The origin of the entropy increase
of the Hawking field is the increase of the black hole temperature. Hence an
understanding of the generalised second law in the context of the
nonequilibrium thermodynamics is suggested; even if the self-relaxation of the
Hawking field does not take place, the temperature increase of the black hole
during the evaporation process causes the entropy increase of the Hawking field
to result in the increase of the total entropy.

observed baryon-antibaryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) within a generalized
minimal lepton flavour violation (MLFV) framework where we allow for CP
violation both at low and high energies. The generation of BAU is obtained
through radiative resonant leptogenesis (RRL), where starting with three
exactly degenerate right-handed neutrinos at Lambda_GUT, we demonstrate
explicitly within the SM and the MSSM that the splittings between their masses
at the see-saw scale M_nu, generated by renormalization group effects, are
sufficient for a successful leptogenesis for M_nu even as low as 10^6 GeV. The
inclusion of flavour effects plays an important role in this result and can
lead to the observed BAU even in the absence of CP violation beyond the PMNS
phases. The absence of a stringent lower bound on M_nu in this type of
leptogenesis allows to easily satisfy present and near future upper bounds on
mu -> e gamma and other charged lepton flavour violating (LFV) processes even
for Lambda_LFV = O(1 TeV). We find, that the MLFV framework in the presence of
heavy right-handed neutrinos and leptogenesis is not as predictive as MFV in
the quark sector and point out that without a specific MLFV model, there is a
rich spectrum of possibilities for charged LFV processes and for their
correlation with low energy neutrino physics and the LHC physics, even if the
constraint from the observed BAU is taken into account. While certain
qualitative features of our analysis confirm findings of Cirigliano et al., at
the quantitative level we find phenomenologically important differences. We

around the weak scale in the MSSM without conflicting with the SM Higgs mass
bound set by LEP experiment. The essential point is that if the lightest
CP-even Higgs h in the MSSM has only a small coupling to Z boson, g_{ZZh}, LEP
cannot generate the Higgs sufficiently. In the scenario, the SM Higgs mass
bound constrains the mass of the heaviest CP-even Higgs H which has the SM like
g_{ZZH} coupling. However, it is easier to make the heaviest Higgs heavy by the
effect of off-diagonal elements of the mass matrix of the CP-even Higgs because
the larger eigenvalue of 2 times 2 matrix becomes larger by introducing
off-diagonal elements. Thus, the smaller stop masses can be consistent with the
LEP constraints. Moreover, the two excesses observed at LEP Higgs search can
naturally be explained as the signals of the MSSM Higgs h and H in this
scenario. One of the most interesting results in the scenario is that all the
Higgs in the MSSM have the weak scale masses. For example, the charged Higgs
mass should be around 130 GeV. This looks inconsistent with the lower bound
obtained by the b --> s gamma process as m_{H^\pm}>350GeV. However, we show
that the amplitude induced by the charged Higgs can naturally be compensated by
that of the chargino if we take the mass parameters by which the little
hierarchy problem can be solved. The point is that the both amplitudes have the
same order of magnitudes when all the fields in the both loops have the same
order of masses.

statistical mechanics which describes a system of interacting particles hopping
left and right on a one-dimensional lattice of N sites. It is partially
asymmetric in the sense that the probability of hopping left is q times the
probability of hopping right. Additionally, particles may enter from the left
with probability alpha and exit from the right with probability beta.
  It has been observed that the (unique) stationary distribution of the PASEP
has remarkable connections to combinatorics -- see for example the papers of
Derrida, Duchi and Schaeffer, and Corteel. Most recently we proved that in fact
the (normalized) probability of being in a particular state of the PASEP can be
viewed as a certain weight generating function for permutation tableaux of a
fixed shape. (This result implies the previous combinatorial results.) However,
our proof relied on the matrix ansatz of Derrida et al, and hence did not give
an intuitive explanation of why one should expect the steady state distribution
of the PASEP to involve such nice combinatorics.
  In this paper we define a Markov chain -- which we call the PT chain -- on
the set of permutation tableaux which projects to the PASEP in a very strong
sense. This gives a new proof of our previous result which bypasses the matrix
ansatz altogether. Furthermore, via the bijection from permutation tableaux to
permutations, the PT chain can also be viewed as a Markov chain on the
symmetric group. Another nice feature of the PT chain is that it possesses a
certain symmetry which extends the ""particle-hole symmetry"" of the PASEP. More
specifically, this is a graph-automorphism on the state diagram of the PT chain
which is an involution; this has a simple description in terms of permutations.

Relative to offline auctions, there is a greater degree of multiple bidding and
late bidding in online auctions, an empirical finding by some recent research.
These two behaviors (multiple bidding and late bidding) are of ``strategic''
importance to online auctions and hence important to investigate. In this
article we empirically measure the distribution of bid timings and the extent
of multiple bidding in a large set of online auctions, using bidder experience
as a mediating variable. We use data from the popular auction site
\url{www.eBay.com} to investigate more than 10,000 auctions from 15 consumer
product categories. We estimate the distribution of late bidding and multiple
bidding, which allows us to place these product categories along a continuum of
these metrics (the extent of late bidding and the extent of multiple bidding).
Interestingly, the results of the analysis distinguish most of the product
categories from one another with respect to these metrics, implying that
product categories, after controlling for bidder experience, differ in the
extent of multiple bidding and late bidding observed in them. We also find a
nonmonotonic impact of bidder experience on the timing of bid placements.
Experienced bidders are ``more'' active either toward the close of auction or
toward the start of auction. The impact of experience on the extent of multiple
bidding, though, is monotonic across the auction interval; more experienced
bidders tend to indulge ``less'' in multiple bidding.

The main structures of quantum theory (interference of probabilities, Born's
rule, complex probabilistic amplitudes, Hilbert state space, representation of
observables by operators) are present in a latent form in the Kolmogorov model.
In particular, we obtain ``interference of probabilities'' without to appeal to
the Hilbert space formalism. We interpret ``interference of probabilities'' as
a perturbation (by a $\cos$-term) of the conventional formula of total
probability. Our classical derivation of quantum probabilistic formalism can
stimulate applications of quantum methods outside of microworld : in

(1983) 41--55] as central tools to help assess the causal effects of
interventions. Since their introduction more than two decades ago, they have
found wide application in a variety of areas, including medical research,
economics, epidemiology and education, especially in those situations where
randomized experiments are either difficult to perform, or raise ethical
questions, or would require extensive delays before answers could be obtained.
In the past few years, the number of published applications using propensity
score methods to evaluate medical and epidemiological interventions has
increased dramatically. Nevertheless, thus far, we believe that there have been
few applications of propensity score methods to evaluate marketing
interventions (e.g., advertising, promotions), where the tradition is to use
generally inappropriate techniques, which focus on the prediction of an outcome
from background characteristics and an indicator for the intervention using
statistical tools such as least-squares regression, data mining, and so on.
With these techniques, an estimated parameter in the model is used to estimate
some global ``causal'' effect. This practice can generate grossly incorrect
answers that can be self-perpetuating: polishing the Ferraris rather than the
Jeeps ``causes'' them to continue to win more races than the Jeeps
$\Leftrightarrow$ visiting the high-prescribing doctors rather than the
low-prescribing doctors ``causes'' them to continue to write more
prescriptions. This presentation will take ``causality'' seriously, not just as
a casual concept implying some predictive association in a data set, and will
illustrate why propensity score methods are generally superior in practice to
the standard predictive approaches for estimating causal effects.

collection of dopants inside individual droplets in the beam represents a
micro-canonical ensemble, and as such each droplet may be considered an
isolated cryo-reactor. The unique properties of the droplets, namely their low
temperature (0.4 K) and fast cooling rates ($\sim10^{16}$ K s$^{-1}$) provides
novel opportunities for the formation and high-resolution studies of molecular
complexes containing one or more free radicals. The production methods of
radicals are discussed in light of their applicability for embedding the
radicals in helium droplets. The spectroscopic studies performed to date on
molecular radicals and on entrance / exit-channel complexes of radicals with
stable molecules are detailed. The observed complexes provide new information
on the potential energy surfaces of several fundamental chemical reactions and
on the intermolecular interactions present in open-shell systems. Prospects of
further experiments of radicals embedded in helium droplets are discussed,
especially the possibilities to prepare and study high-energy structures and
their controlled manipulation, as well as the possibility of fundamental
physics experiments.

derived from a set of time-shifted, finite Brownian random walks (time-series).
These matrices can be seen as random, real, asymmetric matrices with a special
structure superimposed due to the time-shift. We demonstrate that the
associated eigenvalue spectrum is circular symmetric in the complex plane for
large matrices. This fact allows us to exactly compute the eigenvalue density
via an inverse Abel-transform of the density of the symmetrized problem. We
demonstrate the validity of this approach by numerically computing eigenvalue
spectra of lagged correlation matrices based on uncorrelated, Gaussian
distributed time-series. We then compare our theoretical findings with
eigenvalue densities obtained from actual high frequency (5 min) data of the
S&P500 and discuss the observed deviations. We identify various non-trivial,
non-random patterns and find asymmetric dependencies associated with
eigenvalues departing strongly from the Gaussian prediction in the imaginary
part. For the same time-series, with the market contribution removed, we
observe strong clustering of stocks, i.e. causal sectors. We finally comment on
the time-stability of the observed patterns.

Diffusion in many ways. However, Evolutionary Diffusion allows the formation of
local peaks with a characteristic width that undergo drift, even in the

the effective random walk step size, and obtain the distribution of the peak
width which has a power law tail. We find that independent local mutations act
as a diffusion of interacting particles with increased stepsize.

against time-optimal control is explored and exemplified in numerical and in
algebraic terms: it is the method of choice to govern quantum systems within
subspaces of weak relaxation whenever the drift Hamiltonian would otherwise
drive the system through fast decaying modes. In a standard model system
generalising decoherence-free subspaces to more realistic scenarios,
openGRAPE-derived controls realise a CNOT with fidelities beyond 95% instead of
at most 15% for a standard Trotter expansion. As additional benefit it requires
control fields orders of magnitude lower than the bang-bang decouplings in the
latter.

two copy undistillability of the conjectured family of NPT states. Obviously
the class of NPT bound entangled states belong to the class of conjectured to

successful method to numerically find ground states of quantum spin chains. It
amounts to iteratively locally optimizing matrix-product states, aiming at
better and better approximating the true ground state. To date, both a proof of
convergence to the globally best approximation and an assessment of its
complexity are lacking. Here we establish a result on the computational
complexity of an approximation with matrix-product states: The surprising
result is that when one globally optimizes over several sites of local
Hamiltonians, avoiding local optima, one encounters in the worst case a
computationally difficult NP-hard problem (hard even in approximation). The
proof exploits a novel way of relating it to binary quadratic programming. We
discuss intriguing ramifications on the difficulty of describing quantum
many-body systems.
