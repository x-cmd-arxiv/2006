and characterizing multiple planetary orbits in precision radial velocity data.
The periodogram is powered by a parallel tempering MCMC algorithm which is
capable of efficiently exploring a multi-planet model parameter space. The
periodogram employs an alternative method for converting the time of an
observation to true anomaly that enables it to handle much larger data sets
without a significant increase in computation time. Improvements in the
periodogram and further tests using data from HD 208487 have resulted in the
detection of a second planet with a period of $909_{-92}^{82}$d, an
eccentricity of $0.37_{-0.20}^{0.26}$, a semi-major axis of
$1.87_{-0.14}^{0.13}$ AU and an $M \sin i = 0.45_{-0.11}^{0.13}$ M$_{\rm J}$.
The revised parameters of the first planet are period $= 129.8\pm 0.4$d,
eccentricity $= 0.20\pm 0.09$, semi-major axis $= 0.51\pm0.02$ AU and $M \sin i

calculating the model marginal likelihood which is used to compare the

attributed to circumstellar dust-disks. Combining observations at 2.16$\micron$
(K$_{s}$-band) and 10.2$\micron$ (N-band) we probe a region in the
circumstellar dust-disk from a few stellar radii through the terrestrial planet
zone (0.02-1.0AU). By analyzing the distribution of the $(K_{s}-N)$ color index
with respect to previously measured photometric rotation periods we investigate
what role circumstellar disks play in the rotational evolution of the central
star. The resulting positive correlation between these two variables is
consistent with the notion that a star-disk interaction facilitates the
regulation of angular momentum during the T Tauri stage. We also demonstrate,
how including non-single stars in such an analysis will \textit{weaken} any
correlation in the relation between $(K_{s}-N)$ color and period. To further
understand disk properties we also present SEDs for a few objects with new
ground based M-band $(\lambda_{eff} = 4.8\micron)$ and Q-band $(\lambda_{eff} =

interactions are not likely to have affected its evolution in any way. The
colour-magnitude diagrams of DDO210 show a red giant branch (RGB) population
(with an RGB bump), a bright asymptotic giant branch population, a red clump,
young main sequence stars and blue-loop stars. The youngest stars formed within
the last 60 Myrs and have a distinct radial distribution compared to the main
population. Whereas the overall stellar spatial distribution and HI spatial
distribution are concentric, the young stars are offset from the center of
DDO210 and are coincident with a `dent' in the HI distribution. The implied
recent star formation rate required to form the young population is
significantly higher than the derived current star formation rate, by a factor
of > 10.
  Most of the stars in DDO210 are found in a red clump, and its mean I-band
magnitude suggests that the majority of stars in DDO210 have an average age of
4^{+2}_{-1} Gyr. Given this age, the colour of the RGB implies a mean
metallicity of [Fe/H] ~ -1.3. By comparing the shape of the red clump with
models for a variety of star formation histories, we estimate that an old (> 10
Gyr) stellar population can contribute ~ 20 - 30% of the stars in DDO210 at
most. The unusual star formation history of DDO210, its low mass estimate and
its isolated nature, provide insight into how star formation proceeds in the
lowest mass, unperturbed, dwarf galaxy haloes.

for each trial potential, marginalizing the DF using an infinitely divisible
prior. Alternative approaches, such as the widely used maximum penalized
likelihood method, neglect the huge degeneracies inherent in the problem and
simply identify a single, special DF for each trial potential.
  Using simulated observations of toy galaxies with realistic amounts of noise,
I find that this marginalization procedure yields significantly tighter
constraints on BH masses than the conventional maximum-likelihood method,
although it does pose a computational challenge which might be solved with the
development of a suitable algorithm for massively parallel machines. I show
that in practice the conventional maximum-likelihood method yields reliable BH

to better constrain the maximum temperature in the wind of TW Hya. We find
clear evidence for a wind in the \ion{C}{2} doublet at 1037 \AA and in the

The clear lack of a wind in the \ion{C}{4} line argues that the wind from TW
Hya does not reach the 100,000 K characteristic formation temperature of this

simulations consistently describe the formation of the structure and its
chemical enrichment within a cosmological context. Our results indicate that
the luminosity-metallicity (LZR) and the stellar mass-metallicity (MZR)
relations are naturally generated in a hierarchical scenario. Both relations
are found to evolve with redshift. In the case of the MZR, the estimated
evolution is weaker than that deduced from observational works by approximately
0.10 dex. We also determine a characteristic stellar mass, $M_c \approx 3
\times 10^{10} M_{\odot}$, which segregates the simulated galaxy population
into two distinctive groups and which remains unchanged since $z\sim 3$, with a
very weak evolution of its metallicity content. The value and role played by
$M_c$ is consistent with the characteristic mass estimated from the SDSS galaxy
survey by Kauffmann et al. (2004). Our findings suggest that systems with
stellar masses smaller than $M_c$ are responsible for the evolution of this
relation at least from $ z\approx 3$. Larger systems are stellar dominated and
have formed more than 50 per cent of their stars at $z \ge 2$, showing very
weak evolution since this epoch. We also found bimodal metallicity and age
distributions from $z\sim3$, which reflects the existence of two different
galaxy populations. Although SN feedback may affect the properties of galaxies
and help to shape the MZR, it is unlikely that it will significantly modify
$M_c$ since, from $z=3$ this stellar mass is found in systems with circular
velocities larger than $100 \kms$.

be confined. We present a possible explanation for the formation and
confinement of such rings in optically thin circumstellar disks, without
invoking shepherding planets. If an enhancement of dust grains (e.g., due to a
catastrophic collision) occurs somewhere in the disk, photoelectric emission
from the grains can heat the gas to temperatures well above that of the dust.
The gas orbits with super(sub)-Keplerian speeds inward (outward) of the
associated pressure maximum. This tends to concentrate the grains into a narrow
region. The rise in dust density leads to further heating and a stronger
concentration of grains. A narrow dust ring forms as a result of this
instability. We show that this mechanism not only operates around early-type
stars that have high UV fluxes, but also around stars with spectral types as
late as K. This implies that this process is generic and may have occurred
during the lifetime of each circumstellar disk. We examine the stringent
upper-limit on the H2 column density in the HR 4796A disk and find it to be
compatible with the presence of a significant amount of hydrogen gas in the
disk. We also compute the OI and CII infrared line fluxes expected from various
debris disks and show that these will be easily detectable by the upcoming
Herschel mission. Herschel will be instrumental in detecting and characterizing
gas in these disks.

This sample constitutes the largest ever available for the calibration of the

biases such as incompleteness, finite cluster size, galaxy morphology and
environment. We find evidence for a type-dependent TF slope which is shallower

directly related to the spectrum of initial density fluctuations and thus

BEADS-2D code solves the Boltzmann moment equations up to second order in the
thin-disk approximation. This allows us to obtain the anisotropy of the
velocity ellipsoid and the vertex deviation in the plane of the disk. We study
the time-dependent evolution of exponential stellar disks in the linear regime
and beyond. The disks are initially characterized by different values of the
Toomre parameter Q_s and are embedded in a dark matter halo, yielding a
rotation curve composed of a rigid central part and a flat outer region.
Starting from a near equilibrium state, several unstable modes develop in the
disk. In the early linear phase, the very centre and the large scales are
characterized by growing one-armed and bisymmetric positive density
perturbations, respectively. This is in agreement with expectations from the
swing amplification mechanism of short-wavelength trailing disturbances,
propagating through the disk centre. In the late linear phase, the overall
appearance is dominated by a two-armed spiral structure localized within the
outer Lindblad resonance (OLR). During the non-linear evolutionary phase,
radial mass redistribution due to the gravitational torques of spiral arms
produces an outflow of mass, which forms a ring at the OLR, and an inflow of
mass, which forms a transient central bar. This process of mass redistribution
is self-regulatory and it terminates when spiral arms diminish due to a
shortage of matter. Finally, a compact central disk and a diffuse ring at the
OLR are formed (the abstract is abridged).

indicating that the orbital inclination is less than 88.1 deg for all planets

to occur at lower temperatures in Al--doped clusters. In Li$_{10}$Al$_2$, Al

This causes Al atoms not to `melt' till 800 K, in contrast to the Li atoms

significantly, two impurities results in `surface melting' of Li atoms whose

result, this method avoids an uncontrollable theoretical uncertainty that is
often related to the neglect of some topological diagrams (e.g., exchange and

each of the four data sets, P0 P+-, P0 V+-, V0 P+- and V0 V+-, with
P=pseudoscalar and V=vector, can be used to obtain a value of gamma. Among
neutral decays, only experimental data in the B0, Bs --> P- P+ subsector is

  is established without using renormalization",,,,"math-ph math.MP math.SP",,"  This paper evolves a new non-perturbative theory by which the problem of
infinities appearing in quantum physics can be handled. Its most important
application is an exact derivation of the Lamb shift formula by using no
renormalization. The Lamb shift experiment (1947) gave rise to one of the
greatest challenges whose explanation brought the modern renormalization
technique into life. Since then this is the only tool for handling these
infinities. The relation between this renormalization theory and our
non-perturbative theory is also discussed in this paper.
  Our key insight is the realization that the natural complex Heisenberg group
representation splits the Hilbert space of complex valued functions defined on
an even dimensional Euclidean space into irreducible subspaces (alias zones)
which are invariant also under the action of the Landau-Zeeman operator. After
a natural modification, also the Coulomb operator can be involved into this
zonal theory. Thus these zones can be separately investigated, both from
geometrical and physical point of view. In the literature only the zone spanned
by the holomorphic polynomials has been investigated so far. This zone is the
well known Fock space. This paper explicitly explores also the ignored
(infinitely many) other zones. It turns out that quantities appearing as
infinities on the total Hilbert space are finite in the zonal setting. Even the
zonal Feynman integrals are well defined. In a sense, the desired finite
quantities are provided here by an extended particle theory where these
extended objects show up also on the rigorously developed mathematical level.
Name ""de Broglie geometry"" was chosen to suggest this feature of the zonal
theory.

scattering, where the ions scatter from each other and usually results in beam
growth. An important difference is that in electron cooling the mass of the ion
is different from and much larger than the mass of the electron. This
difference considerably complicates the intrabeam scattering theory. It
introduces a new term in the emittance growth rate, which vanishes when the
particles are identical and their masses are equal, and can give rise to
emittance cooling of the heavier particles . The term that gives rise to beam
growth for the usual intrabeam scattering is also present but is much smaller
than the cooling term when one particle is much heavier than the other. This
paper derives the results found for the emittance cooling rates due to the

viewpoint of our new model of a one-dimensional (1D) completed scattering. Our
study of quantum nonlocality complements those carried out by Volovich and
Khrennikov. They pointed to an unphysical character of nonlocality in Bell's
theorem whose context does not contain the very structure of the space-time.
However, there is another reason leading to nonlocality in QM. The existing
model of a 1D completed scattering evidences that QM, as it stands, even with a
proper space-time context, contradicts special relativity. By our model this
scattering process represents an entanglement of two coherently evolved
alternative sub-processes, transmission and reflection; whose characteristics
are measured well after the scattering event. Quantum nonlocality appears in
this problem due to the inconsistency of the superposition principle with the
corpuscular properties of a particle. It can take part only in one of the
sub-processes. However the superposition principle allows introducing
observables common for them. In the fresh wording, this principle must forbid
introducing observables for entangled states.

several classes of pure and mixed three-mode states that stand out for their
informational and/or entanglement properties. In particular, we introduce a
simple procedure -- based on passive optical elements -- to produce pure
three-mode Gaussian states with {\em arbitrary} entanglement structure (upon
availability of an initial two-mode squeezed state). We analyze in depth the
properties of distributed entanglement and the origin of its sharing structure,
showing that the promiscuity of entanglement sharing is a feature peculiar to
symmetric Gaussian states that survives even in the presence of significant
degrees of mixedness and decoherence. Next, we discuss the suitability of the
considered tripartite entangled states to the implementation of quantum
information and communication protocols with continuous variables. This will
lead to a feasible experimental proposal to test the promiscuous sharing of
continuous-variable tripartite entanglement, in terms of the optimal fidelity
of teleportation networks with Gaussian resources. We finally focus on the
application of three-mode states to symmetric and asymmetric telecloning, and
single out the structural properties of the optimal Gaussian resources for the
latter protocol in different settings. Our analysis aims to lay the basis for a
