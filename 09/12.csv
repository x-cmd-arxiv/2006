cosmological probes if systematics due to our incomplete knowledge of the
intracluster medium (ICM) physics are understood and controlled. In this paper,
we present mock Chandra analyses of cosmological cluster simulations and assess
X-ray measurements of galaxy cluster properties using a model and procedure
essentially identical to that used in real data analysis. We show that
reconstruction of three-dimensional ICM density and temperature profiles is
excellent for relaxed clusters, but still reasonably accurate for unrelaxed
systems. The total ICM mass is measured quite accurately (<6%) in all clusters,
while the hydrostatic estimate of the gravitationally bound mass is biased low
by about 5%-20% through the virial region, primarily due to additional pressure
support provided by subsonic bulk motions in the ICM, ubiquitous in our
simulations even in relaxed systems. Gas fraction determinations are therefore
biased high; the bias increases toward cluster outskirts and depends
sensitively on its dynamical state, but we do not observe significant trends of
the bias with cluster mass or redshift. We also find that different average ICM
temperatures, such as the X-ray spectroscopic Tspec and gas-mass-weighted Tmg,
are related to each other by a constant factor with a relatively small
object-to-object scatter and no systematic trend with mass, redshift or the
dynamical state of clusters. We briefly discuss direct applications of our
results for different cluster-based cosmological tests.

the evolution of pre-main sequence star circumstellar disks. Magnetospheric
accretion models are used to derive values of the mass accretion rates in
objects of very different properties, from brown dwarfs to intermediate-mass
stars; we test the validity of these models in the brown dwarf regime, where
the stellar mass and luminosity, as well as the mass accretion rate, are much
lower than in T Tauri stars. We have measured simultaneously two infrared
hydrogen lines, Pab and Brg, in a sample of 16 objects in the star-forming

and 9 T Tauri stars. Brown dwarfs where both lines are detected have a ratio
Pab/Brg of ~2. Larger values, >=3.5, are only found among the T Tauri stars.
The low line ratios in brown dwarfs indicate that the lines cannot originate in
the column of gas accreting from the disk onto the star along the magnetic
field lines, and we suggest that they form instead in the shocked photosphere,
heated to temperatures of ~3500 K. If so, in analogy to veiling estimates in T
Tauri stars, the hydrogen infrared line fluxes may provide a reliable measure

sets of PMS evolutionary tracks including rotation, non-gray boundary
conditions (BCs) and either low (LCE) or high convection efficiency (HCE).
Using observational data and our theoretical predictions, we aim at
constraining 1) the differences obtained for the rotational evolution of stars
within the ONC by means of these different sets of models; 2) the initial
angular momentum of low mass stars, by means of their templates in the ONC. We
discuss the reliability of current stellar models for the PMS. While the 2D
radiation hydrodynamic simulations predict HCE in PMS, semi-empirical
calibrations either seem to require that convection is less efficient in PMS
than in the following MS phase or are still contradictory. We derive stellar
masses and ages for the ONC by using both LCE and HCE. The resulting mass
distribution for the bulk of the ONC population is in the range 0.2$-$0.3
{\msun} for our non-gray models and in the range 0.1$-$0.3{\msun} for models
having gray BCs. In agreement with Herbst et al. (2002) we find that a large
percentage ($\sim$70%) of low-mass stars (M\simlt 0.5{\msun} for LCE;
M\simlt0.35{\msun} for HCE) in the ONC appears to be fast rotators (P$<$4days).
Three possibilities are open: 1) $\sim$70% of the ONC low mass stars lose their
disk at early evolutionary phases; 2)their locking period is shorter; 3) the
period evolution is linked to a different morphology of the magnetic fields of
the two groups of stars. We also estimate the range of initial angular momentum
consistent with the observed periods. The comparisons made indicate that a
second parameter is needed to describe convection in the PMS, possibly related
to the structural effect of a dynamo magnetic field.

  time delays","A&A accepted",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20065389",,"astro-ph",,"  Gravitational lensing time delays depend upon the Hubble constant and the
density distribution of the lensing galaxies. This allows one to either model
the lens and estimate the Hubble constant, or to use a prior on the Hubble
constant from other studies and investigate what the preferred density
distribution is. Some studies have required compact dark matter halos (constant
M/L ratio) in order to reconcile gravitational lenses with the HST/WMAP value
of the Hubble constant (72 +/- 8 km/s /Mpc and 72 +/- 5 km/s /Mpc,
respectively). This is in direct contradiction with X-ray, stellar dynamical,
and weak lensing studies, which all point towards extended halos and isothermal
density profiles. In this work, we examine an up-to-date sample of 13 lensing
galaxies resulting in a data set consisting of 21 time delays. We select
systems in which there is a single primary lensing galaxy (e.g. excluding
systems undergoing mergers). Analysis is performed using analytic models based
upon a powerlaw density profile (rho \propto r^-n) of which the isothermal
profile is a special case (n = 2). This yields a value of n = 2.11+/-0.12
(3sigma) for the mean profile when modeling with a prior on the Hubble
constant, which is only consistent with isothermality within 3 sigma. Note that
this is a formal error from our calculations, and does not include the impact
of sample selection or simplifications in the lens modeling. We conclude that
time delays are a useful probe of density profiles, in particular as a function
of the environment in which the lens resides, when combined with a prior on the
Hubble constant.

of Fe XVII and XVIII L-lines, higher order transitions of O VIII (3p to 1s and
6p to 1s), and a Ne IX line. From the correlation of the X-ray intensity with
solar-wind flux on time scales of about half a day, and from the short-term
(~10 minutes) variations of the X-ray intensity, these lines most likely arise
from solar-wind heavy ions interacting with neutral material in the Earth's
magnetosheath. A hard power-law component is also necessary to explain the LTE
spectrum. The origin of this component is not yet known. Our results indicate
that solar activity can significantly contaminate Suzaku cosmic X-ray spectra
below ~1 keV. Recommendations are provided for recognizing such contamination

of magnitude below the upper limit on a similar shell in the Crab Nebula. We
find the shell centroid to be offset from the pulsar location. If this neutron

anomalies of the shape and strength of many absorption lines. This is a
signature of large atmospheric chemical gradients produced by the selective
radiative levitation and gravitational settling of chemical species. Here we
present a new approach to mapping the vertical chemical structures in stellar
atmospheres. We have developed a regularized chemical inversion procedure that
uses all information available in high-resolution stellar spectra. The new
technique for the first time allowed us to recover chemical profiles without
making a priori assumptions about the shape of chemical distributions. We have
derived average abundances and applied the vertical inversion procedure to the
high-resolution VLT UVES spectra of the weakly magnetic, cool Ap star HD
133792. Our analysis yielded improved estimates of the atmospheric parameters
of HD 133792. We show that this star has negligible vsini and the mean magnetic
field modulus <B>=1.1+/-0.1 kG. We have derived average abundances for 43 ions
and obtained vertical distributions of Ca, Si, Mg, Fe, Cr, and Sr. All these
elements except Mg show high overabundance in the deep layers and solar or
sub-solar composition in the upper atmosphere of HD 133792. In contrast, the Mg
abundance increases with height. We find that transition from the
metal-enhanced to metal-depleted zones typically occurs in a rather narrow
range of depths in the atmosphere of HD 133792. Based on the derived
photospheric abundances, we conclude that HD 133792 belongs to the rare group

clusters taken from the recent literature. In systems cooler than 4 keV, f_gas
declines as the system temperature decreases. However, in higher temperature

the uncertainty reflects the systematic variations between clusters at r500.

sparsely sampled two-filter (B,R) imaging survey towards the Canis Major
stellar over-density, claimed to be a disrupting Milky Way satellite galaxy.
Utilizing stellar colour-magnitude diagrams reaching to B ~ 22 mag, we provide
a first delineation of its surface density distribution using main sequence
stars. Its projected shape is highly elongated, nearly parallel to the Galactic
plane, with an axis ratio of >~ 5:1, substantially more so than what Martin et
al. originally found. We also provide a first map of a prominent over-density
of blue, presumably younger main sequence stars, which appears to have a
maximum near [l,b = 240,-7 deg]. The young population is markedly more
localized. We estimate an upper limit on the line-of-sight (l.o.s.) depth of
the old population based on the main sequence width, obtaining sigma_los < 1.8
+/- 0.3 kpc, at an adopted D_helio = 7.5 +/- 1 kpc. For the young stellar
population, we find sigma_los < 1.5 kpc. There are different explanations for
the CMa over-density: (a) a partially disrupting dwarf galaxy on a low-latitude
orbit, (b) a projection of the warped outer Galactic disk, and (c) a projection
of an out-of-plane spiral arm. While the data provide no firm arguments against
the less well-defined third scenario, they have clear implications for each of
the others: (a) We infer from the strong elongation in longitude, and
simulations in the literature, that the over-density is unlikely to be a
gravitationally bound system at the present epoch, but may well be just a
recently disrupted satellite remnant. (b) Based on modeling, the line-of-sight
depth of the over-density in old stars is clearly inconsistent with published
locally axi-symmetric descriptions of the warped Galactic disk.

including also the wings. We compare these maps with a previously published
high spatial resolution radio map and find a tight relation between the radio

that the radio-jet plays a fundamental role not only in shaping the NLR but
also in the imprint of its kinematics. Blueshifts of up to 400 km/s and
velocity dispersions of up to 150 km/s are observed in association with the
radio jet at position angle PA=129, which is also the PA of the photometric
major axis of the galaxy. The [FeII] shows the largest blueshifts and velocity
dispersions and its flux distribution is concentrated along the jet, while the
H_2 shows the lowest velocity dispersions and has additional flux contribution
from regions beyond the jet. We use the 2D velocity dispersion maps to estimate
upper limits to the contribution of the radio jet to the excitation of [FeII]

hexagonal symmetry (space group $P6_3/mmc$) to orthorhombic symmetry (space

transition involves a slight tilting of the corner-sharing Mn$_{2}$O$_{9}$

pancake-vortex stacks contributing to damping. The salient feature of this
contribution is its nonmonotonic dependence on the lattice velocity and the

Schalkwijk-Kailath scheme, for communicating reliably over additive white noise
channels in the presence of corrupted feedback. More specifically, we consider
a framework comprising an additive white forward channel and a backward link
which is used for feedback. We consider two types of corruption mechanisms in
the backward link. The first is quantization noise, i.e., the encoder receives
the quantized values of the past outputs of the forward channel. The
quantization is uniform, memoryless and time invariant (that is,
symbol-by-symbol scalar quantization), with bounded quantization error. The
second corruption mechanism is an arbitrarily distributed additive bounded
noise in the backward link. Here we allow symbol-by-symbol encoding at the
input to the backward channel. We propose simple explicit schemes that
guarantee positive information rate, in bits per channel use, with positive
error exponent. If the forward channel is additive white Gaussian then our
schemes achieve capacity, in the limit of diminishing amplitude of the noise
components at the backward link, while guaranteeing that the probability of
error converges to zero as a doubly exponential function of the block length.
Furthermore, if the forward channel is additive white Gaussian and the backward
link consists of an additive bounded noise channel, with signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) constrained symbol-by-symbol encoding, then our schemes are also
capacity-achieving in the limit of high SNR.

significantly reduce the setup assumptions made by the CRS model (as no trusted

seen as a slightly stronger variation of the Bare Public-Key (BPK) model from

  for routing in delay tolerant networks","6 pages",,,,"cs.NI",,"  Prior work on routing in delay tolerant networks (DTNs) has commonly made the
assumption that each pair of nodes shares the same inter-contact time
distribution as every other pair. The main argument in this paper is that
researchers should also be looking at heterogeneous inter-contact time
distributions. We demonstrate the presence of such heterogeneity in the
often-used Dartmouth Wi-Fi data set. We also show that DTN routing can benefit
from knowing these distributions. We first introduce a new stochastic model
focusing on the inter-contact time distributions between all pairs of nodes,
which we validate on real connectivity patterns. We then analytically derive
the mean delivery time for a bundle of information traversing the network for
simple single copy routing schemes. The purpose is to examine the theoretic
impact of heterogeneous inter-contact time distributions. Finally, we show that
we can exploit this user diversity to improve routing performance.

backreaction is taken into account, studying the effect of general static
perturbations of the hole following the approach of Zerilli. The solutions of
the combined Einstein-Maxwell equations for both perturbed gravitational and
electromagnetic fields at first order of the perturbation are exactly
reconstructed by summing all multipoles, and are given explicit closed form
expressions. The existence of a singularity-free solution of the
Einstein-Maxwell system requires that the charge to mass ratios of the black
hole and of the particle satisfy an equilibrium condition which is in general
dependent on the separation between the two bodies. If the black hole is
undercritically charged (i.e. its charge to mass ratio is less than one), the
particle must be overcritically charged, in the sense that the particle must
have a charge to mass ratio greater than one. If the charge to mass ratios of
the black hole and of the particle are both equal to one (so that they are both
critically charged, or ""extreme""), the equilibrium can exist for any separation
distance, and the solution we find coincides with the linearization in the
present context of the well known Majumdar-Papapetrou solution for two extreme
Reissner-Nordstr\""om black holes. In addition to these singularity-free
solutions, we also analyze the corresponding solution for the problem of a
massive particle at rest near a Schwarzschild black hole, exhibiting a strut
singularity on the axis between the two bodies. The relations between our
perturbative solutions and the corresponding exact two-body solutions belonging

the fit to the masses of the tower of excited rho mesons. Formally one should

can isolate the contribution of a Higgs boson $\phi$ in $\gamma\gamma\to f \bar

information on the $\gamma\gamma\phi$ coupling in case $\phi$ is a CP
eigenstate. We also construct CP-violating asymmetries which can probe CP
mixing in case $\phi$ has indeterminate CP. Furthermore, we take the MSSM with
CP violation as an example to demonstrate the potential of these asymmetries in
a numerical analysis. We find that these asymmetries are sensitive to the
presence of a Higgs boson as well as its CP properties over a wide range of
MSSM parameters. In particular, the method suggested can cover the region where
a light Higgs boson may have been missed by LEP due to CP violation in the
Higgs sector, and may be missed as well at the LHC.

the signal received at the spacetime point x_r due to an impulse emitted at the
spacetime point x_e. Such processes are highly idealized since no signal can be
emitted or received at a precise point in space and at a precise time. We
propose a simple and compact model for extended emitters and receivers by
continuing P_0 to an analytic function P(z_r - z_e), where z_e=x_e+iy_e
represents a circular pulsed-beam emitting antenna centered at x_e and
radiating in the spatial direction of y_e while z_r=x_r-iy_r represents a
circular pulsed-beam receiving antenna centered at x_r and receiving from the
spatial direction of y_r. The space components of y_e and y_r give the spatial
orientations and radii of the antennas, while their time components s_e, s_r
represent the time a signal takes to propagate along the antennas between the
center and the boundary. The analytic propagator P(z_r - z_e) represents the
transmission amplitude, forming a communication channel. Causality requires
that the extension/orientation 4-vectors y_e and y_r belong to the future cone
V, so that z_e and z_r belong to the future tube and the past tube in complex
spacetime, respectively. The invariance of P(z_r - z_e) under imaginary

deformed by imposing external boundary conditions, which model engineering
experiments such as shear and compression. We propose a two-dimensional network
model of such deformations. The model takes into account elastic interparticle
interactions and incorporates geometric impenetrability constraints. The
effects of friction are neglected. In our model, a granular packing is
represented by a spring-lattice network, whereby the particle centers
correspond to vertices of the network, and interparticle contacts correspond to
the edges. When the network deforms, each spring either preserves its length
(this corresponds to a solid-like contact), or expands (this represents a
broken contact). We prove that under certain geometric conditions on the
network, in the energy-minimizing configuration there are at least two
non-stretched springs attached to each node, which means that every particle
has at least two solid-like contacts. This eliminates micro-avalanches as a
mechanism for structural weakening in small shear deformation.

regularity properties of the critical circles and the related functions. Using
a Fourier analysis method developed by R. de la Llave and one of the authors,
we compute numerically the Holder regularities of these functions. Our
computations show that -- withing their numerical accuracy -- these

scaling behavior of the iterates on the critical invariant circle (discovered
by Kadanoff and Shenker); (b) to some characteristics of the singular invariant
measures connected with the distribution of iterates. Some of the functions
studied have pointwise Holder regularity that is different at different points.

integrators. The spatial representation of DMV integrators are Poisson with
respect to a Lie-Poisson bracket for the semi-direct product Lie algebra.
Numerical results are presented which confirm the conservative properties and

that (1) the range of their flow dimension is rather wider than their random

measuring the efficiency of networks or that of the individual nodes. The
findings are illustrated using three urban street networks (two in the Europe

  Quantum Dynamics","submitted to Phys. Rev. E",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.75.021103",,"quant-ph",,"  This paper develops the theoretical foundations for the ability of a control
field to cooperate with noise in the manipulation of quantum dynamics. The
noise enters as run-to-run variations in the control amplitudes, phases and
frequencies with the observation being an ensemble average over many runs as is
commonly done in the laboratory. Weak field perturbation theory is developed to
show that noise in the amplitude and frequency components of the control field
can enhance the process of population transfer in a multilevel ladder system.
The analytical results in this paper support the point that under suitable
conditions an optimal field can cooperate with noise to improve the control
outcome.

in the optimal control of quantum dynamics. Simulations of the processes are
performed on several multilevel quantum systems with the goal of population
transfer. Optimal control fields are shown to be capable of cooperating or
fighting with observations to achieve a good yield, and the nature of the
observations may be optimized to more effectively control the quantum dynamics.
Quantum observations also can break dynamical symmetries to increase the
controllability of a quantum system. The quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects
induced by observations are the key operating principles in these processes.
The results indicate that quantum observations can be effective tools in the
control of quantum dynamics.

them an attractive area of study for devising quantum algorithms for well-known
classical problems as well as those arising in the field of quantum computing.
In this work we propose a novel scheme for the physical implementation of a
discrete-time quantum random walk using laser excitations of the electronic
states of an array of quantum dots. These dots represent the discrete nodes of
the walk, while transitions between the energy levels inside each dot
correspond to the required coin operation and stimulated Raman adiabatic
passage (STIRAP) processes are employed to induce the steps of the walk. The
quantum dot design is tailored in such a way as to enable selective coupling of
the energy levels. Our simulation results show a close agreement with the ideal
quantum walk distribution as well as modest robustness towards noise
disturbance.

beam-splitting attack, but which can be detected by a careful analysis of the
detection statistics. These results stress the importance of testing several
statistical parameters in order to achieve higher rates of secret bits.

Here the number of the negative eigenvalues of K(T)(the partial transposition
of K) is considered carefully when K is a two-partite state. There are strong
evidences to show that the number of negative eigenvalues of K(T) is N(N-1)/2
at most when K is a state in Hilbert space N*N. For the special case, 2*2
system(two qubits), we use this result to give a partial proof of the
conjecture sqrt(K(T))(T)>=0. We find that this conjecture is strongly connected
with the entanglement of the state corresponding to the negative eigenvalue of
K(T) or the negative entropy of K.

  In the intrinsic frame of reference of an isolated, macroscopic system,

satisfy Schr\""{o}dinger equation.
  A process of collision-type interaction between a microscopic system and a
macroscopic system is studied in an auxiliary frame of reference.
  In transforming the statevector of the two systems obtained in the auxiliary
frame of reference to the intrinsic frame of reference of the macroscopic
system, the above first assumption requires a discontinuous change of the
statevector. A probabilistic interpretation is given to the statevector for the
discontinuous change. For the microscopic system, the density matrix given in
the theory here is equal to the reduced density matrix given in the usual
