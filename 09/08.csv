for which we measure R-K=6.2 mag. This is only the second GRB host to date,
which is classified as an ERO. The spectral energy distribution is typical of a
dusty starburst galaxy, with a redshift, z~1.9, a luminosity, L~5L*, and an
inferred stellar mass of ~10^11-10^12 Msun, two orders of magnitude more
massive than typical GRB hosts. A comparison to the z~2 mass-metallicity (M-Z)
relation indicates that the host metallicity is about 0.5 Zsun. This result
shows that at least some GRBs occur in massive, metal-enriched galaxies, and
that the proposed low metallicity bias of GRB progenitors is not as severe as
previously claimed. Instead we propose that the blue colors and sub-L*
luminosities of most GRB hosts reflect their young starburst populations. This,
along with the locally increased fraction of starbursts at lower stellar mass,
may in fact be the underlying reason for the claimed low metallicity bias of
z<0.2 GRB hosts. Consequently, GRBs and their host galaxies may serve as a
reliable tracer of cosmic star formation, particularly at z>1 where the M-Z
relation is systematically lower, and the star formation rate is dominated by
sub-L* galaxies.

distributions of star clusters, denoted here by phi(L), psi(M), and chi(tau),
respectively. Of these, phi(L) is the easiest to determine observationally,
whereas psi(M) and chi(tau) are more informative about formation and disruption
processes. For populations of young clusters, with a relatively wide range of
ages, phi(L) depends on both psi(M) and chi(tau) and thus cannot serve as a
proxy for psi(M) in general. We demonstrate this explicitly by four
illustrative examples with specific forms for either psi(M) or chi(tau). In the
special case in which psi(M) is a power law and is independent of chi(tau),
however, phi(L) is also a power law with the same exponent as psi(M). We
conclude that this accounts for the observed similarity between phi(L) and
psi(M) for the young clusters in the Antennae galaxies. This result reinforces
our picture in which clusters form with psi(M) propto M^{-2} and are then
disrupted rapidly at a rate roughly independent of their masses. The most
likely disruptive process in this first stage is the removal of interstellar
matter by the energy and momentum input from young stars (by photoionization,
winds, jets, and supernovae). The few clusters that avoid this ""infant
mortality"" are eventually disrupted in a second stage by the evaporation of
stars driven by two-body relaxation, a process with a strong dependence on
mass. We suspect this picture may apply to many, if not all, populations of
star clusters, but this needs to be verified observationally by determinations
of psi(M) and chi(tau) in more galaxies.

consequence of rotational splitting, mode interaction or sinusoidal amplitude
variations. In this paper we examine the phenomenon of (nearly) equidistant
triplets, which are unlikely to be caused by rotational splitting, in different
types of pulsating stars: a Delta Scuti variable (1 Mon), an RR Lyrae variable
(RR Lyr) and a short-period Cepheid (V743 Lyr). We examine the hypothesis that
one of the modes forming the triplet results from a combination of the other
two modes. The analyses were carried out on recent data sets by using
multiple-frequency analyses and statistics with the package PERIOD04. In
particular, the small departures from equidistance were calculated for the
three selected stars. For the Delta Scuti variable 1 Mon, the departure from
equidistance is only 0.000079 +- 0.000001 c/d (or 0.91 +- 0.01 nHz). For 1 Mon
the Combination Mode Hypothesis with a mode excited by resonance is the most
probable explanation. For the star RR Lyr, the hypothesis of resonance through
a combination of modes should be considered. The results for the best-studied
cepheid with a Blazhko period (V743 Lyr) are inconclusive because of an
unfavorable period of 1.49d and insufficient data.

Based on our measurements and those presented in the literature, we perform
preliminary orbital analyses for DF Tau, ZZ Tau, Elias 12 Na-Nb, and T Tau

a sufficient portion of the orbit, we are not able to find definitive orbit
solutions. By using a Monte Carlo search technique, we explored the orbital
parameter space allowed by the current set of data available for each binary.
We constructed weighted distributions for the total mass of the binaries
derived from a large sample of possible orbits that fit the data. These mass
distributions show that the total mass is already well-defined. We compute
total mass estimates of 0.78 (+0.25/-0.15) Msun, 0.66 (+0.15/-0.11) Msun, 1.13

occultation measurement, we also find a likely orbit solution for ZZ Tau, with
a period of ~ 32 years. With additional measurements to continue mapping the
orbits, the derived dynamical masses will be useful in constraining the
theoretical tracks of pre-main sequence evolution.

a hot thermal plasma with T$\sim$180 $\times10^{6}$K. X-ray spectral analysis
from 0.8--200 keV with the X-Ray Telescope and BAT in the next two orbits
reveals evidence for a thermal component (T$>$80 $\times10^{6}$K) and Fe K 6.4

extremely high temperature thermal plasma (T$\sim3\times10^{8}$K) or power-law
emission. Based on analogies with solar flares, we attribute the excess
continuum emission to nonthermal thick-target bremsstrahlung emission from a
population of accelerated electrons. We estimate the radiated energy from
0.01--200 keV to be $\sim6\times10^{36}$ erg, the total radiated energy over
all wavelengths $\sim10^{38}$ erg, the energy in nonthermal electrons above 20
keV $\sim3\times10^{40}$ erg, and conducted energy $<5\times10^{43}$ erg. The
nonthermal interpretation gives a reasonable value for the total energy in
electrons $>$ 20 keV when compared to the upper and lower bounds on the thermal
energy content of the flare. This marks the first occasion in which evidence
exists for nonthermal hard X-ray emission from a stellar flare. We investigate
the emission mechanism responsible for producing the 6.4 keV feature, and find
that collisional ionization from nonthermal electrons appears to be more
plausible than the photoionization mechanism usually invoked on the Sun and

  changed",,,,"astro-ph",,"  I review the physical properties of pair-production supernovae (PPSNe) as
well as the prospects for them to be constrained observationally. In very
massive (140-260 solar mass) stars, much of the pressure support comes from the
radiation field, meaning that they are loosely bound, with an adiabatic
coefficient that is close to the minimum stable value. Near the end of C/O
burning, the central temperature increases to the point that photons begin to
be converted into electron-positron pairs, softening gamma below this critical
value. The result is a runaway collapse, followed by explosive burning that
completely obliterates the star. While these explosions can be up to 100 times
more energetic that core collapse and Type Ia supernovae, their peak
luminosities are only slightly greater. However, due both to copious Ni-56
production and hydrogen recombination, they are brighter much longer, and
remain observable for ~ 1 year. Since metal enrichment is a local process,
PPSNe should occur in pockets of metal-free gas over a broad range of
redshifts, greatly enhancing their detectability, and distributing their
nucleosyntehtic products about the Milky Way. This means that measurements of
the abundances of metal-free stars should be thought of as directly
constraining these objects. It also means that ongoing supernova searches,
already provide weak constraints for PPSN models. A survey with the NIRCam
instrument on JWST, on the other hand, would be able to extend these limits to
z ~ 10. Observing a 0.3 deg^2 patch of sky for one week per year for three
consecutive years, such a program would either detect or rule out the existence
of these remarkable objects.

stellar halo. To search for such a halo in the LMC we have obtained
low-resolution spectra for 100 LMC RR Lyrae stars, of which 87 are in the field
and 13 in the clusters NGC1835 and NGC2019. We measured radial velocities for
87 LMC RR Lyrae stars, and metallicities for 78 RR Lyrae stars, nearly tripling
the previous sample. These targets are located in 10 fields covering a wide
range of distances, out to 2.5 degrees from the center of the LMC. Our main
result is that the mean velocity dispersion for the LMC RR Lyrae stars is
50+-2km/s. This quantity does not appear to vary with distance from the LMC
center. The metallicity shows a Gaussian distribution, with mean
[Fe/H]=-1.53+-0.02dex, and dispersion 0.20 dex in the Harris metallicity scale,
confirming that they represent a very homogeneous metal-poor population. There
is no dependence between the kinematics and metallicity of the field RR Lyrae
star population. Using good quality low-resolution spectra from FORS1, FORS2
and GEMINI-GMOS we have found that field RR Lyrae stars in the LMC show a large
velocity dispersion and that this indicate the presence of old and metal-poor
stellar halo. All the evidence so far for the halo, however, is from the
spectroscopy of the inner LMC regions, similar to the inner flattened halo in
our Galaxy. Further study is necessary to confirm this important result.

10^{13}-3x10^{14}/cm^2, while the bolometric luminosity varies by a factor of
only four. We show that the gas in ULIRG outflows is likely to be in
photoionization equilibrium. The very small ULIRG sample of Goldader et al.
demonstrates that the ratio of ultraviolet flux to far infrared flux varies by
a factor $\sim100$ from object to object. While the Goldader sample does not
overlap with those of Rupke et al. and Martin, we show that such a large
variation in ultraviolet flux will produce a similar variation in the column of
neutral sodium for a fixed mass flux and density. However, if the cold gas is
in pressure equilibrium with a hot outflow with a mass loss rate similar to the
star formation rate, the range of ionization state is significantly smaller.
Measurements of the UV flux for objects in the Martin and Rupke et al. catalogs
will definitively determine if photoionization effects are responsible for the
wide variation seen in the sodium columns. If they are, a determination of the

diffuse X-rays (GCDX). The XIS found many emission lines in the GCDX near the
energy of K-shell transitions of iron and nickel. The most pronounced features
are FeI K alpha at 6.4 keV and K-shell absorption edge at 7.1 keV, which are
from neutral and/or low ionization states of iron, and the K-shell lines at 6.7
keV and 6.9 keV from He-like (FeXXV K alpha) and hydrogenic (FeXXVI Ly alpha)
ions of iron. In addition, K alpha lines from neutral or low ionization nickel
(NiI K alpha) and He-like nickel (NiXXVII K alpha), and FeI K beta, FeXXV K
beta, FeXXVI Ly beta, FeXXV K gamma and FeXXVI Ly gamma are detected for the
first time. The line center energies and widths of FeXXV K alpha and FeXXVI Ly
alpha favor a collisional excitation (CE) plasma for the origin of the GCDX.
The electron temperature determined from the line flux ratio of FeXXV K alpha /
FeXXV K beta is similar to the ionization temperature determined from that of
FeXXV K alpha /FeXXVI Ly alpha. Thus it would appear that the GCDX plasma is
close to ionization equilibrium. The 6.7 keV flux and temperature distribution
to the galactic longitude is smooth and monotonic,in contrast to the integrated
point source flux distribution. These facts support the hypothesis that the
GCDX is truly diffuse emission rather than the integration of the outputs of a
large number of unresolved point sources. In addition, our results demonstrate
that the chemical composition of Fe in the interstellar gas near the GC is
constrained to be about 3.5 times solar.

  of the Early Earth from UV radiation?",,,"10.1017/S1473550406003478",,"astro-ph",,"  We propose that the photochemical smog mechanism produced substantial ozone
(O3) in the troposphere during the Proterozoic, which contributed to
ultraviolet (UV) radiation shielding hence favoured the establishment of life.
The smog mechanism is well-established and is associated with pollution hazes
which sometimes cover modern cities. The mechanism proceeds via the oxidation
of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as methane (CH4) in the presence of
UV radiation and nitrogen oxides (NOx). It would have been particularly
favoured during the Proterozoic given the high levels of CH4 (up to 1000 ppm)
recently suggested. Proterozoic UV levels on the surface of the Earth were
generally higher compared with today, which would also have favoured the
mechanism. On the other hand, Proterozoic O2 required in the final step of the
smog mechanism to form O3 was less abundant compared with present times.
Further, results are sensitive to Proterozoic NOx concentrations, which are
challenging to predict, since they depend on uncertain quantities such as NOx
source emissions and OH concentrations. We review NOx sources during the
Proterozoic and apply a photochemical box model having methane oxidation with
NOx, HOx and Ox chemistry to estimate the O3 production from the smog
mechanism. Runs suggest the smog mechanism during the Proterozoic can produce
about double present day ozone columns for NOx levels of 1.53 10-9 by volume
mixing ratio, which was attainable according to our NOx source analysis, with 1
per-cent present atmospheric levels (PALs) of O2. Clearly, forming ozone in the
troposphere is a trade-off for survivability. On the one hand harmful UV is
blocked, but on the other hand ozone is a respiratory irratant, which becomes
fatal at concentrations exceeding about 1 ppmv.

not fully understood: they can form from stellar collisions, or through mass
transfer in isolated, primordial binaries (PBs). In this paper we use the
radial distribution of BSS observed in four GCs (M3, 47Tuc, NGC6752 and omega
Cen) to investigate which formation process prevails. We find that both
channels co-exist in all the considered GCs. The fraction of mass-transfer
(collisional) BSS with respect to the total number of BSS is around ~0.4-0.5
(~0.5-0.6) in M3, 47Tuc, and NGC6752. The case of omega Cen is peculiar with an
underproduction of collisional BSS. The relative lack of collisional BSS in
omega Cen can be understood if mass segregation has not yet driven to the core
a sizeable number of PBs, which dominate stellar collisions through three- and
four-body processes. The spatial distribution of BSS provides strong hints to
their origin: the BSS in the cluster outskirts form almost exclusively from
mass transfer in PBs, whereas the BSS found close to the cluster core most
likely have a collisional origin.

consists of a cluster of 6 spots spread over an area of 30 arcsec. Five spots
were detected in only the 84- and 95-GHz transitions (for two spots the 84-GHz
detection is marginal), while the sixth spot shows activity in all 12 observed
transitions. We report the first interferometric observations of the rare 9.9-

(<0.03 km/s) and the brightness temperature in these two transitions exceeds
5.3x10^7 and 2.0x10^4 K, respectively. The three most southern maser spots show
a clear association with the shocked gas traced by the H_2 2.12 micron emission
associated with the radio jet and their velocities are close to that of the
molecular core within which the jet is embedded. This fact supports the idea
that the class I masers reside in the interface regions of outflows. Comparison
with OH masers and infrared data reveals a potential discrepancy in the
expected evolutionary state. The presence of the OH masers usually means that
the source is evolved, but the infrared data suggest otherwise. The lack of any
class II methanol maser emission at 6.7 GHz in the source raises an additional
question, is this source too young or too old to have a 6.7 GHz maser? We argue
that both cases are possible and suggest that the evolutionary stage where the
class I masers are active, may last longer and start earlier than when the
class II masers are active. However, it is currently not possible to reveal the
exact evolutionary status of IRAS 16547-4247.

Instead, we favour the complex absorption model on the grounds that it requires
less extreme parameters. In particular the geometry appears to be more
physically plausible as the reflected component in the smeared absorption model

F.S., and, in 15/16 multiple systems, at least one of the individual components
displays a Class I or F.S. spectral index. However, the occurrence of mixed
pairings, such as F.S. with Class I, F.S. with Class II, and, in one case, F.S.
with Class III, is surprisingly frequent. Such behaviour is not consistent with
that of multiple systems among T Tauri stars (TTS), where the companion of a
classical TTS also tends to be a classical TTS, although other mixed pairings
have been previously observed among Class II objects. Based on an analysis of
the spectral indices of the individual binary components, there appears to be a
higher proportion of mixed Class I/F.S. systems (65-80%) than that of mixed
Classical/Weak-Lined TTS (25-40%), demonstrating that the envelopes of Class I/
F.S. systems are rapidly evolving during this evolutionary phase. We report the
discovery of a steep spectral index secondary companion to ISO-ChaI 97,
detected for the first time via our mid-infrared observations. In our previous
near- infrared imaging survey of binary/multiple Class I/F.S. sources, ISO-ChaI
97 appeared to be single. With a spectral index of Alpha >= 3.9, the secondary
component of this system is a member of a rare class of very steep spectral
index objects, those with Alpha > 3. Only three such objects have previously
been reported, all of which are either Class 0 or Class I.

N/H, and O/H ratios. These high column density sightlines have both log
H(HI)>21.00 and allow us to probe gas up to 1300 pc. In particular these
sightlines allow us to determine the gas phase D/H ratio in a hydrogen column
density range, log N(H)>20.70, where the only five measurements available in
the literature yield a weighted average of D/H = (0.86 +/- 0.08)E-5. We find
D/H=(2.14+ 0.51 - 0.43)E-5 along the HD41161 sightline. This ratio is 3sigma
higher than the weighted mean D/H ratio quoted above, for sightlines with log
N(H)>20.70, while the D/H ratio for the HD53975 line of sight, D/H = (1.02

along the HD 41161 sightline presents the first evidence of variations of D/H
at high N(H). Our result seems to indicate that either the long sightlines that
according to the deuterium depletion model are dominated by cold undisturbed
gas where deuterium would be depleted onto carbonaceous grains occur at higher
N(H) than previously thought or that the clumping of low D/H values in the
literature for the long sightlines has another explanation. In addition, the
relatively high signal-to-noise ratio of the HD41161 data allows us to place
constraints on the f-values of some neutral chlorine transitions, present in
the FUSE bandpass, for which only theoretical values are available.

that it provides a promising tool for an understanding of complex systems.

This viewpoint allows to naturally treat collective phenomena which are often
an integral part of complex systems, such as biological or socio-economical
phenomena. Much of the attraction of network theory arises from the discovery
that many networks, natural or man-made, seem to exhibit some sort of
universality, meaning that most of them belong to one of three classes: {\it

disorder, electrons would be trapped and unable to conduct a current. However,
that theory did not account for interactions between the electrons. Here we
investigate the interplay between the electron-electron interactions and
disorder near the MIT using simultaneous measurements of electrical resistivity
and magnetoconductance. We show that both the resistance and interaction
amplitude exhibit a fan-like spread as the MIT is crossed. From these data we
construct a resistance-interaction flow diagram of the MIT that clearly reveals
a quantum critical point, as predicted by the two-parameter scaling theory
(Punnoose and Finkel'stein, Science 310, 289 (2005)). The metallic side of this
diagram is accurately described by the renormalization group theory without any
fitting parameters. In particular, the metallic temperature dependence of the
resistance sets in when the interaction amplitude reaches gamma_2 = 0.45 - a
value in remarkable agreement with the one predicted by the theory.

of states at the Fermi level due to the formation of a Kubo gap. As a result,
the upper critical field (HC2) and irreversibility fields (Hirr) in
nanostructured Nb show non-monotonic grain size dependences. Between 60nm to
20nm, HC2 is found to increase by 2.5times while there is no appreciable
decrease in the superconducting transition temperature (TC) from its bulk value
of 9.4K. This can be ascribed to a decrease in the coherence length due to a
reduction in the mean free path with decreasing size. Below 20 nm, however, HC2
decreases with decreasing size. In this size range (<20 nm), there also occurs
a decrease in the TC as well as the superconducting energy gap. The decrease in
HC2 in this regime can be ascribed to the decrease in the density of states at
the Fermi level due to a quantization in the electronic energy levels.

The main goal of such a hybrid network is to reduce the cost of deployment
while achieving some performance constraints (minimum coverage, sensing rate,
etc). In this paper we are interested in the communication between
transmit-only sensors and cluster-heads. We develop a detailed analytical model
of the physical and MAC layer using tools from queuing theory and stochastic
geometry. (The MAC model, that we call Erlang's loss model with interference,
might be of independent interest as adequate for any non-slotted; i.e.,
unsynchronized, wireless communication channel.) We give an explicit formula
for the frequency of successful packet reception by a cluster-head, given
sensors' locations. We further define packet admission policies at a
cluster-head, and we calculate the optimal policies for different performance
criteria. Finally we show that the proposed hybrid network, using the optimal
policies, can achieve substantial cost savings as compared to conventional
architectures.

termination is at the heart of proof theory where it is usually called strong
normalization (of cut elimination). In computer science, termination has always
been an important issue for showing programs correct. In the early days of
logic, strong normalization was usually shown by assigning ordinals to
expressions in such a way that eliminating a cut would yield an expression with
a smaller ordinal. In the early days of verification, computer scientists used
similar ideas, interpreting the arguments of a program call by a natural
number, such as their size. Showing the size of the arguments to decrease for
each recursive call gives a termination proof of the program, which is however
rather weak since it can only yield quite small ordinals. In the sixties, Tait
invented a new method for showing cut elimination of natural deduction, based
on a predicate over the set of terms, such that the membership of an expression
to the predicate implied the strong normalization property for that expression.
The predicate being defined by induction on types, or even as a fixpoint, this
method could yield much larger ordinals. Later generalized by Girard under the
name of reducibility or computability candidates, it showed very effective in
proving the strong normalization property of typed lambda-calculi...

studied iteration theories and iteration algebras in which a specified solution
has to obey certain axioms. We propose so-called Elgot algebras as a convenient
structure for semantics in the present paper. An Elgot algebra is an algebra
with a specified solution for every system of flat recursive equations. That
specification satisfies two simple and well motivated axioms: functoriality
(stating that solutions are stable under renaming of recursion variables) and
compositionality (stating how to perform simultaneous recursion). These two
axioms stem canonically from Elgot's iterative theories: We prove that the

different hard-scattering processes. This construction provides a geometrical

single-spin asymmetries in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and the

display a significant difference between the calculation of a spin asymmetry

introduced the notion of the universal singular set of a Lagrangian L and
established its topological negligibility. This set is defined to be the set of
all points in the plane through which the graph of some absolutely continuous
L-minimizer passes with infinite derivative.
  Motivated by Tonelli's partial regularity results, the question of the size
of the universal singular set in measure naturally arises. Here we show that
universal singular sets are characterized by being essentially purely
unrectifiable -- that is, they intersect most Lipschitz curves in sets of zero
length and that any compact purely unrectifiable set is contained within the
universal singular set of some smooth Lagrangian with given superlinear growth.
This gives examples of universal singular sets of Hausdorff dimension two,
filling the gap between previously known one-dimensional examples and Sychev's
result that universal singular sets are Lebesgue null.
  We show that some smoothness of the Lagrangian is necessary for the
topological size estimate, and investigate the relationship between growth of
the Lagrangian and the existence of (pathological) rectifiable pieces in the
universal singular set.
  We also show that Tonelli's partial regularity result is stable in that the
energy of a `near' minimizer u over the set where it has large derivative is
controlled by the how far u is from being a minimizer.

like Hagen-Poiseuille pipe flow, which is a long-standing problem in fluid
mechanics [1,2]. A possible analogy with phenomenological theory of ideal
plasticity in solids is explored. It allows an extension of the Navier-Stokes
equations making the simple shear flows unstable. Following von Mises [4], the
existence of maximal allowed shear stress or ""yield stress"" in fluid is
assumed. After the actual stresses have reached this value, a new physical
mechanism will be activated attempting to reduce them. This mechanism results
in a pressure-like force, which has to be added to the Navier-Stokes equations.
The yield stress itself is a material constant, which does not depend on the
Reynolds number of particular flow. It will be shown how to estimate its value
from experimental data. To demonstrate how the character of flow changes if the
additional force is taken into account, an unsteady flow in a 2D nozzle is
presented. The momentum source was introduced in the Navier-Stokes equations

first, we studied the theory of entanglement in its characterization and
measurement, introducing a new scheme for detection of entanglement. The new
approach links molecular-spin entities involving nuclear spins to quantum
computing as more appropriate physical systems of interest. Then, we continued
with the realization of entanglement in experiments. NMR has been the first
choice due to its well approved advantages for quantum computing. NMR, however,
has not been an appropriate system for demonstrating entangled states. Through
a mathematical proof, NMR with low spin polarization has been invalidated for
true implementations of non-local quantum algorithms, particularly supserdense
coding. The point is that high spin polarization is inevitably required to
acquire entanglement while in the current NMR it has been a formidable task to
get highly polarized nuclear spins. In order to acquire high spin polarization,
introducing electron spins can be much effective because of its
three-order-of-magnitude larger gyromagnetic ratio compared to nuclear spins.

enables us to deal with both electron and nuclear spins. Thus, in this context,
it can be more appropriate device for quantum computing. We emphasize that
(pseudo)entanglement and interconversion between the entangled states have been
realized with ENDOR on extremely stable organic molecular-spin entities. The
required experimental conditions to obtain true quantum entanglement are also
discussed. The appropriate entanglement witness for the corresponding ensemble
quantum computing is introduced and examined.

  algorithm for n(=3 and 5)-qubit systems with real coefficients","13 pages, 2 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Evolution of entanglement with the proceeding of quantum algorithms affects
the outcome of the algorithm. Particularly, the performance of Grover's search
algorithm gets worsened if the initial state of the algorithm is an entangled
one. The success probability of search can be seen as an operational measure of
entanglement. This paper demonstrates an entanglement measure based on the
performance of Grover's search algorithm for three and five qubit systems. We
also show that although the overall pattern shows growth of entanglement, its
rise to a maximum and then consequent decay, the presence of local fluctuation
within each iterative step is likely.
