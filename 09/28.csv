initial conditions selected more for computational expediency than physical
accuracy. Since the initial conditions are eventually forgotten by the evolving
planet, this approach is valid for mature planets, if not young ones. To
explore the evolution at young ages of jovian mass planets we have employed
model planets created by one implementation of the core accretion mechanism as
initial conditions for evolutionary calculations. We find that young jovian
planets are smaller, cooler, and several to 100 times less luminous than
predicted by earlier models. Furthermore the time interval during which the
young jupiters are fainter than expected depends on the mass of planet. Jupiter
mass planets (1 M_J) align with the conventional model luminosity in as little
at 20 million years, but 10 M_J planets can take up to 1 billion years to match
commonly cited luminosities, given our implementation of the core accretion
mechanism. If our assumptions, especially including our treatment of the
accretion shock, are correct, then young jovian planets are substantially
fainter at young ages than currently believed. These results have important
consequences both for detection strategies and for assigning masses to young
jovian planets based on observed luminosities.

observational campaign to study the early outburst spectral and temporal
evolution, which combines data from X-ray (RXTE, INTEGRAL), radio (VLA) and
optical (ROTSE, SMARTS) instruments. During the reported period the source left
quiescence and went through four major accreting black hole states: low-hard,
hard intermediate, soft intermediate and high-soft. We investigated dipping
behavior in the RXTE band and compare our results to the 1996-1997 case, when
the source was predominantly in the high-soft state, finding significant
differences. We consider the evolution of the low frequency quasi-periodic
oscillations and find that the frequency strongly correlates with the spectral
characteristics, before shutting off prior to the transition to the high-soft
state. We model the broad-band high-energy spectrum in the context of empirical
models, as well as more physically motivated thermal and bulk-motion
Comptonization and Compton reflection models. RXTE and INTEGRAL data together
support a statistically significant high energy cut-off in the energy spectrum
at 100~200 keV during the low-hard state. The RXTE data alone also show it very
significantly during the transition, but cannot see one in the high-soft state
spectra. We consider radio, optical and X-ray connections in the context of
possible synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton origins of X-ray emission in
low-hard and intermediate states. In this outburst of GRO J1655-40, the radio

latter shows an enhancement by about 40% in the 0.2-2.5 keV flux. A very
similar, and apparently correlated increase, in time and scale, was observed in
the solar X-ray and EUV flux.
  The months of October and November 2003 saw a period of particularly intense
solar activity, which appears reflected in the behaviour of the soft X-rays
from Jupiter's disk. The X-ray spectra, from the XMM-Newton EPIC CCD cameras,
are all well fitted by a coronal model with temperatures in the range 0.4-0.5
keV, with additional line emission from Mg XI (1.35 keV) and Si XIII (1.86

  The XMM-Newton observations lend further support to the theory that Jupiter's

by scattering, elastic and fluorescent, of solar X-rays in the upper atmosphere
of the planet.

on W_0, ranging from ~-1 for W_0<~1\AA to ~-2 for W_0>~ 1.5\AA. At redshift
0.37<z<0.55, we find the average luminosity enclosed within 100 kpc around MgII
absorbers to be M_g=-20.65+-0.11 mag, which is ~0.5 L_g*. The global
luminosity-weighted colors are typical of present-day intermediate type
galaxies. However, while the light of weaker absorbers originates mostly from
red passive galaxies, stronger systems display the colors of blue star-forming
galaxies. Based on these observations, we argue that the origin of strong MgII
absorber systems might be better explained by models of metal-enriched gas
outflows from star-forming/bursting galaxies. Our analysis does not show any
redshift dependence for both impact parameter and rest-frame colors up to z=1.
However, we do observe a brightening of the absorbers related light at high
redshift (~50% from z~0.4 to 1). We argue that MgII absorbers are a phenomenon
typical of a given evolutionary phase that more massive galaxies experience
earlier than less massive ones, in a downsizing fashion. (abridged)

surface photometry. The studies included were those that used the ""Nuker law""

band WFPC2 photometry of Rest et al., NICMOS H band photometry by Ravindranath
et al. and Quillen et al., and the BCG WFPC2 I band photometry of Laine et al.
The distribution of the logarithmic slopes of the central profiles strongly
affirms that the central structure of elliptical galaxies with Mv < -19 is
bimodal, based on both parametric and non-parametric analysis. At the HST
resolution limit, most galaxies are either power-law systems, which have steep
cusps in surface brightness, or core systems, which have shallow cusps interior
to a steeper envelope brightness distribution. A rapid transition between the
two forms occurs over the luminosity range -22 < Mv < -20, with cores
dominating at the highest luminosities, and power-laws at the lowest. There are
a few ""intermediate"" systems that have both cusp slopes and total luminosities
that fall within the core/power-law transition, but they are rare and do not
fill in the overall bimodal distribution of cusp slopes. These results are
inconsistent with the Ferrarese et al. Virgo Cluster Survey (VCS) analysis.
However, using galaxies common to the VCS samples, we demonstrate that the VCS
models of the cusps are either a poor match to the observations or consist of
forms fitted to the galaxy envelopes and extrapolated inward to the HST
resolution limit.

thermal Comptonized spectrum with the electron temperature of 30 keV and
Thomson optical depth tau_T ~ 2 for the slab geometry. The source is detected
by INTEGRAL up to 200 keV at the luminosity of 5E36 erg/s (assuming a distance

In this paper we investigate the evolution of a population of cores with

interactions lead to orbit crossing and mergers, so that the cores grow during
their evolution. Interaction with the disk leads to orbital migration, which
results in the cores capturing each other in mean motion resonances. As the
cores migrate inside the disk inner edge, scatterings and mergers of planets on
unstable orbits together with orbital circularization causes strict
commensurability to be lost. Near commensurability however is usually
maintained. All the simulations end with a population of typically between two
and five planets, with masses depending on the initial mass. These results
indicate that if hot super-Earths or Neptunes form by mergers of inwardly
migrating cores, then such planets are most likely not isolated. We would
expect to always find at least one, more likely a few, companions on close and
often near-commensurable orbits. To test this hypothesis, it would be of
interest to look for planets of a few to about 10 earth masses in systems where
hot super-Earths or Neptunes have already been found.

constrain the parameters of the lenses. It has been demonstrated that such a
technique provides strong constraints on the parameters that characterize a
galaxy halo, as well as on the aperture mass of these halos. In this analysis,
we only use weak shear data and do not include strong lensing constraints. We
present the results of a study of galaxy-galaxy lensing in a homogeneous sample

bands with the CFH12k instrument. We find dark matter halos in these clusters
to be compact compared to those inferred around isolated field galaxies of
equivalent luminosity at this redshift: the half mass radius is found to be
smaller than 50 kpc, with a mean total mass of order 0.2 10^{12} M_sun. This is
in good agreement with previous galaxy-galaxy lensing results and with
numerical simulations, in particular with the tidal stripping scenario. We thus
provide a strong confirmation of tidal truncation from a homogeneous sample of

question of Galactic Astronomy. Is this stream caused by non-axisymmetric
perturbations of the galactic potential, such as transient or quasi-stationary
spiral waves, or by the on-going evaporation of the Hyades cluster? A simple
observational test has been designed to answer that question. Using the
Geneva-Copenhagen survey of F and G dwarfs, we compare the mass distribution
and metallicity of the stream to those of field disk stars. If the Hyades
stream is composed of stars trapped at resonance, its mass distribution should
obey the present-day mass function (PDMF) of the disk, and its metallicity
should reflect its origin in the inner regions of the Galaxy. On the other
hand, if it is an evaporated cluster, we expect a different mass distribution,
depending on the inital mass function (IMF) of the cluster, and on the
proportion of evaporated stars as a function of mass. We find that extreme
conditions have to be adopted for the selective evaporation and IMF of the
cluster to make the observed mass ditribution of the stream only roughly
consistent (at a one-sigma level) with the coeval evaporated cluster scenario.
The observed mass distribution is in much better agreement with the PDMF of the
field. We also note that the peculiar metallicity of the stream is inconsistent
with that of a field population from the solar neighbourhood trapped in the
primordial cluster during its formation process and subsequently evaporated.
These observations thus favour a resonant origin for the Hyades stream.

of insufficient strength to trigger an enhanced level of recent star formation

x$ will be activated and a particle is released with a rate $\mu$. Due to the
competition between both reactions the system evolves three different time
regimes. While in the initial time interval the diffusive process dominates the
behavior of the system, there appears a transient regime, where the system
shows a driveling wave solution which tends to a non-trivial stationary
solution for $v \to 0$. In that regime one observes a very slow decay of the
concentration. In the final long time regime a crossover to an exponentially
decaying process is observed. In case of $\lambda = \mu$ the concentration is a

to zero after a finite time. The mean square displacement offers an anomalous
diffusive behavior where the dynamic exponent is determined by the exponent
$\alpha $. In one dimension the model can be solved exactly. In higher

magnetic field modulation that is resonant with the molecular binding energy.
We show that maximal conversion is obtained by optimising the amplitude and
frequency of the modulation for the particular temperature and density of the
gas. For small modulation amplitudes, resonant coupling of an unbound atom pair
to a molecule occurs at a modulation frequency corresponding to the sum of the
molecular binding energy and the relative kinetic energy of the atom pair. An
atom pair with an off-resonant energy has a probability of association which
oscillates with a frequency and time-varying amplitude which are primarily
dependent on its detuning. Increasing the amplitude of the modulation tends to
result in less energetic atom pairs being resonantly coupled to the molecular
state, and also alters the dynamics of the transfer from continuum states with
off-resonant energies. This leads to maxima and minima in the total conversion
from the gas as a function of the modulation amplitude. Increasing the
temperature of the gas leads to an increase in the modulation frequency
providing the best fit to the thermal distribution, and weakens the resonant
frequency dependence of the conversion. Mean-field effects can alter the
optimal modulation frequency and lead to the excitation of higher modes. Our
simulations predict that resonant association can be effective for binding
energies of order $h \times 1$ MHz.

Often, the exact structure of the patterns of interest is not known. This
happens, for example, when molecular structures are mined to discover fragments
useful as features in chemical compound classification task, or when web sites
are mined to discover sets of web pages representing logical documents. Such
patterns are often generated from a few small subgraphs (cores), according to
certain generalization rules (GRs). We call such patterns ""generalized
patterns""(GPs). While being structurally different, GPs often perform the same
function in the network. Previously proposed approaches to mining GPs either
assumed that the cores and the GRs are given, or that all interesting GPs are
frequent. These are strong assumptions, which often do not hold in practical
applications. In this paper, we propose an approach to mining GPs that is free
from the above assumptions. Given a small number of GPs selected by the user,
our algorithm discovers all GPs similar to the user examples. First, a machine
learning-style approach is used to find the cores. Second, generalizations of
the cores in the graph are computed to identify GPs. Evaluation on synthetic
data, generated using real cores and GRs from biological and web domains,
demonstrates effectiveness of our approach.

feedback (IRCSDF) ISI detector, and a MRF detector. The MRF detector is a SISO
version of the stochastic relaxation algorithm by Geman and Geman in IEEE

achieves SNR savings of between 0.5 and 2.0 dB over the IRCSDF detector alone;
the savings increase as the MRFs become more correlated, or as the SNR
decreases. The algorithm is also fairly robust to mismatches between the

W. This is a low energy quantity, independent of the regularization scheme. In
addition, the mutual information is bounded above by twice the entropy
corresponding to the sets involved. Calculations of I(V,W) in QFT show that the
entropy in empty space cannot be renormalized to zero, and must be actually
very large. We find that this entropy due to the vacuum fluctuations violates
the FMW bound in Minkowski space. The mutual information also gives a precise,
cutoff independent meaning to the statement that the number of degrees of

points to the essential non locality of the physical cutoff. Violations of the

Higgsino- or Wino-like neutralino, the net effect of coannihilations with
sleptons is to increase the relic abundance, rather than producing the usual
suppression, which takes place if the LSP is Bino-like. The reason for the
enhancement lies in the effective thermally averaged cross section at
freeze-out: sleptons annihilate (and co-annihilate) less efficiently than the
neutralino(s)-chargino system, therefore slepton coannihilations effectively
act as parasite degrees of freedom at freeze-out. Henceforth, the thermal relic
abundance of LSP's corresponds to the cold Dark Matter abundance for smaller
values of the LSP mass, and larger values of the neutralino pair annihilation
cross section. In turn, at a given thermal neutralino relic abundance, this
implies larger indirect detection rates, as a result of an increase in the
fluxes of antimatter, gamma rays and neutrinos from the Sun orginating from
neutralino pair annihilations.

Our solution is calculated in terms of quadratic Strebel differentials which
are found numerically all over the relevant subspace of the moduli space of
spheres with five punctures. Part of the boundary of the reduced moduli space
is described in terms of an algebraic curve, while the remaining part has to be
evaluated numerically. We use this data to compute the contact term of five
tachyons and estimate its uncertainty to be of about 0.1%. To put to a test the
theory and the computations done, we calculate the contact term of five
dilatons. In agreement with the dilaton theorem, it is found to cancel the term
obtained from the tree level Feynman diagrams built with three- and
four-vertices. This cancellation, achieved with a precision of about 0.1%, is
within the estimated margin error on the contact term and is therefore a very
good evidence that our computations are reliable. The techniques and numerical
algorithm developed in this paper make it possible to compute the contact
amplitude of any five off-shell closed bosonic string states.

trajectories of classical mechanics can be characterized as geodesics on the
configuration space M with respect to a suitable metric which is the conformal
modification of the kinematic metric by a factor (U+h), where U and h is the
potential function and total energy, respectively.In the special case of 3-body
motions with zero angular momentum, the global geometry of such trajectories
can be reduced to that of their moduli curves, which record the change of size
and shape, in the moduli space of oriented m-triangles, whose kinematic metric
is, in fact, a Riemannian cone over the shape space M*(a 2-sphere of radius
1/2). In this paper, we show that the moduli curve of such a motion is uniquely
determined by its shape curve (which only records the change of shape)when h is
nonzero, while in the special case of h=0 it is uniquely determined up to
scaling. Thus, the study of the global geometry of such motions can be further
reduced to that of the shape curves, which are time-parametrized curves on the
2-sphere characterized by a third order ODE (cf. Theorem 3.9). Moreover, these
curves have two remarkable properties, namely the uniqueness of parametrization
and the monotonicity (cf. Theorem 4.6 and Theorem 5.8) that constitute a solid
foundation for a systematic study of their global geometry and naturally lead
to the formulation of some pertinent problems such as those briefly discussed
in Section 7.

$n$-well trapping potential. We prove, in the semiclassical limit, that the
finite dimensional eigenspace associated to the lowest n eigenvalues of the
linear operator is slightly deformed by the nonlinear term into an almost
invariant manifold M. Precisely, one has that solutions starting on M, or close
to it, will remain close to M for times exponentially long with the inverse of
the size of the nonlinearity. As heuristically expected the effective equation
on M is a perturbation of a discrete nonlinear Schroedinger equation. We deduce
that when the size of the nonlinearity is large enough then tunneling among the
wells essentially disappears: that is for almost all solutions starting close
to M their restriction to each of the wells has norm approximatively constant
over the considered time scale. In the particular case of a double well

needless information (topology), which disagrees with other original axioms.
The crisis manifests in the fact, that the mathematical community cannot see

most geometers-topologists deny the alternative method of the generalized
geometry construction, which does not uses the topology, because it does not
contain theorems. Most geometers see the geometry presentation as a set of
definitions and theorems. They cannot imagine the geometry presentation without
customary theorems. As a result the most clever topologists, which have
acknowledged the negligible role of the topology in the geometry construction

parallel semi-Riemannian metrics of a connection and the reducibility of the

necessarily reduces in the presence of a specified number of independent
parallel semi-Riemannian metrics is completely determined by the the signature
of the metrics and the dimension, d, of the manifold, when d not equal to four.
In particular, the existence of two independent, parallel semi-Riemannian
metrics, one of which having signature (p,q) with p not equal to q, implies the
holonomy group is reducible. The (p,p) cases, however, may allow for more than
one parallel metric and yet an irreducible holonomy group: for n=2m, m >2,
there exist connections on n-dimensional Euclidean space with irreducible
infinitesimal holonomy and which have two independent, parallel metrics of
signature (m,m). The case of four-dimensional manifolds, however, depends on
the topology of the manifold in question: the presence of three parallel
metrics always implies reducibility but reducibility in the case of two metrics
of signature (2,2) is guaranteed only for simply connected manifolds. The main
theorem in the paper is the construction of a topologically non-trivial
four-dimensional manifold with a connection that admits two independent
parallel metrics of signature (2,2) and yet has irreducible holonomy. We
provide a complete solution to the general problem.

genetic transformation (NGT) is a sexual process by which bacteria actively
take up exogenous DNA and use it to replace homologous chromosomal sequences.
As it has been demonstrated, the role of NGT in repairing deleterious mutations
under constant selection is insufficient for its survival, and the lack of
other viable explanations have left no alternative except that DNA uptake
provides nucleotides for food. Here we develop a novel simulation approach for
the long-term dynamics of genome organization (involving the loss and
acquisition of genes) in a bacterial species consisting of a large number of
spatially distinct populations subject to independently fluctuating ecological
conditions. Our results show that in the presence of weak inter-population
migration NGT is able to subsist as a mechanism to reload locally lost,
intermittently selected genes from the collective gene pool of the species
through DNA uptake from migrants. Reloading genes and combining them with those
in locally adapted genomes allow individual cells to re-adapt faster to
environmental changes. The machinery of transformation survives under a wide
range of model parameters readily encompassing real-world biological
conditions. These findings imply that the primary role of NGT is not to serve
the cell with food, but to provide homologous sequences for restoring genes
that have disappeared from or become degraded in the local population.

fail as an autonomous quantum method when infinite potential walls are present.
The stationary physical Wigner functions do not satisfy the normal eigen
equations, the *-eigen equations, unless an ad hoc boundary potential is added
[Dias-Prata]. Alternatively, they satisfy a different, higher-order,
``*-eigen-* equation'', locally, i.e. away from the walls [Kryukov-Walton].
Here we show that this substitute equation can be written in a very simple
form, even in the presence of an additional, arbitrary, but regular potential.
The more general applicability of the -eigen- equation is then demonstrated.
First, using an idea from [Fairlie-Manogue], we extend it to a dynamical
equation describing time evolution. We then show that also for general contact
interactions, the -eigen- equation is satisfied locally. Specifically, we treat
the most general possible (Robin) boundary conditions at an infinite wall,
general one-dimensional point interactions, and a finite potential jump.
Finally, we examine a smooth potential, that has simple but different
expressions for x positive and negative. We find that the -eigen- equation is
again satisfied locally. It seems, therefore, that the -eigen- equation is
generally relevant to the matching of Wigner functions; it can be solved
piece-wise and its solutions then matched.

$d$-dimensional classical systems by reducing the problem to the computation of
ground state properties of a $d$-dimensional quantum model. This
classical-to-quantum mapping allows us to deal with standard optimization
methods, such as simulated and quantum annealing, on an equal basis.
Consequently, we extend the quantum annealing method to simulate classical
systems at finite temperatures. Using the adiabatic theorem of quantum
mechanics, we derive the rates to assure convergence to the optimal
thermodynamic state. For simulated and quantum annealing, we obtain the
asymptotic rates of $T(t) \approx (p N) /(k_B \log t)$ and $\gamma(t) \approx
(Nt)^{-\bar{c}/N}$, for the temperature and magnetic field, respectively. Other
annealing strategies, as well as their potential speed-up, are also discussed.

mediator is discussed. The mediator bounces between the two qubits and exhibits
a resonant scattering. It is clarified how the degree of the entanglement is
enhanced by the constructive interference of such bouncing processes. Maximally
entangled states are available via adjusting the incident momentum of the
mediator or the distance between the two qubits, but their fine tunings are not
necessarily required to gain highly entangled states and a robust generation of
entanglement is possible.

Karasawa and M. Ozawa, Phys. Rev. A72, 052334 (2005)]. An estimation theory of
low-noise parameters of channels has also been developed. In this report, we
address the low-noise parameter estimation problem for the $N$-body extension
of low-noise channels. We perturbatively calculate the Fisher information of
the output states in order to evaluate the lower-bound of the mean-square error
of the parameter estimation. We show that the maximum of the Fisher information
over all input states can be attained by a factorized input state in the
leading order of the low-noise parameter. Thus, to achieve optimal estimation,
it is not necessary for there to be entanglement of the $N$ subsystems, as long
as the true low-noise parameter is sufficiently small.

and the exceptional points of the potential. The asymptotic eigenvalues behave
as $E_n \sim n^2.$ The solvable purely imaginary PT-symmetric potentials
vanishing asymptotically known so far do not have real discrete spectrum. Our

our understanding of the basics of quantum theory. The knowledge of the
implications of the quantum theory to other theories, especially to the
statistical mechanics and the domain of validity has captivated scientists from
the beginning of quantum description. In such a context, the presence of an
environment is commonly thought as entanglement, decohering and mixing
properties of quantum system. Generically, an environment is assumed to be a
noisy reservoir or a heat bath. Whereas in common interpretation of statistical
mechanics the heat bath is unspecified, in quantum systems a heat bath can also
provide an indirect interaction between otherwise totally decoupled subsystems
and consequently a means to entangle them \cite{cdkl,dvclp,bfp}. In simple
example for the entanglement between two qubits due to the interaction with a
common heat bath has been explicitly shown in \cite{b}. Whereas in that paper
the bath is described by a collection of harmonic oscillators, it seems to be
more reasonable to specify the bath by stochastic forces represented by
stochastic fields. From a more general point of view we expect the bath should
be better described in a stochastic manner and not by deterministic forces. In
the present paper we consider a two level system (qubits) which are able to
perform flip processes by a coupling to classical stochastic fields. Thus we
bridge the gap between quantum and classical probability theory. This problem
is related to many other questions of quantum optics and quantum electronics
where quantum statistical aspects arising from the intrinsic quantum character
of the system while the possible time-dependence of system parameters may be
interpreted as the influence of classical thermal fluctuations.

renormalization of the non-Markovian dynamics of an open quantum system to
which dynamical decoupling is applied. We utilize a non-Markovian master
equation which is derived from the non-Markovian quantum trajectories
formalism. It contains incoherent Markovian dynamics and coherent Schr\""odinger
dynamics as its limiting cases and is capable of capture the transition between
them. We have performed comprehensive simulations for the cases in which the
system is either driven by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise or or is described by
the spin-boson model. The renormalized dynamics under bang-bang control and
continuous dynamical decoupling are simulated. Our results indicate that the
renormalization of the non-Markovian dynamics depends crucially on the spectral
density of the environment and the envelop of the decoupling pulses. The
framework developed in this work hence provides an unified approach to
investigate the efficiency of realistic decoupling pulses. This work also opens
a way to further optimize the decoupling via pulse shaping.
