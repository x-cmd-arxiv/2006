monitored and the observed spectra can be used to trace strong gravitational
fields in the place of emission and along paths of light rays. This paper
summarizes several aspects of how the spectral features are influenced by
relativistic effects. We focus our attention onto variable and broad emission
lines, origin of which can be attributed to the presence of orbiting patterns
-- spots and spiral waves in the disc. We point out that the observed spectrum
can determine parameters of the central black hole provided the intrinsic local
emissivity is constrained by theoretical models.

the R&D activities for future mid-infrared space missions such as the 3.5 m

coronagraphic performance of checkerboard masks down to a $10^{-6}$
peak-to-peak contrast, which is required to detect self-luminous extra-solar
planets in the mid-infrared region. Two masks, consisting of aluminum films on
a glass substrates, were manufactured using nano-fabrication techniques with
electron beam lithography: one mask was optimized for a pupil with a 30%
central obstruction and the other was for a pupil without obstruction. The
theoretical contrast for both masks was $10^{-7}$ and no adaptive optics system
was employed. For both masks, the observed point spread functions were quite
consistent with the theoretical ones. The average contrast measured within the
dark regions was $2.7 {\times} 10^{-7}$ and $1.1 {\times} 10^{-7}$. The
coronagraphic performance significantly outperformed the $10^{-6}$ requirement
and almost reached the theoretical limit determined by the mask designs. We
discuss the potential application of checkerboard masks for mid-infrared
coronagraphy, and conclude that binary masks are promising for future
high-contrast space telescopes.

Universidad de Cantabria (GLUC, http://grupos.unican.es/glendama/). In an
initial stage (2003 March-June), the Estacion de Observacion de Calar Alto
(EOCA) was used to obtain VR frames of SBS 0909+532 and QSO 0957+561. These
observations in 2003 led to accurate fluxes of the two components of both
double QSOs, which are being compared and complemented with data from other
1-1.5 m telescopes located in the North Hemisphere: Fred Lawrence Whipple
Observatory (USA), Maidanak Observatory (Uzbekistan) and Wise Observatory
(Israel). On the other hand, the GLUC started the second phase of its
monitoring programme in 2005 January. In this second phase, they are using the
2 m fully robotic Liverpool Telescope (LT). The key idea is the two-band
photometric follow-up of four lensed QSOs with different main lensing galaxies:
SBS 0909+532 (elliptical), QSO 0957+561 (giant cD), B1600+434 (edge-on spiral)
and QSO 2237+0305 (face-on spiral). Thus, the light rays associated with the
components of the four gravitational mirages cross different galaxy
environments, and the corresponding light curves could unveil the content of
these environments. While SBS 0909+532 and QSO 0957+561 are the targets for the
two first years with the LT (2005-2006), the rest of targets (B1600+434 and QSO
2237+0305) will be monitored starting from 2007.

maximum ion dose up to 1x10^12 ions/cm2. Temperature- and magnetic
field-dependent resistivity measurements on all the films (before and after
irradiation) reveal a sustained decrease in resistivity with increasing ion
dose. A maximum dose of 1x10^12 ions/cm2 suppresses resistivity by factors of 3
and 10, at 330 K [insulator-metal (I-M) transition] and at 10 K, respectively.
On the other hand, with increasing ion dose, the magnetoresistance (MR)
enhances in the vicinity of I-M transition but decreases at low temperatures.
These results, corroborated by surface morphology of films, suggest that the
origin of such properties lies in the irradiation induced improved
crystallinity and epitaxial orientation, enhanced connectivity between grains,
and conglomeration of grains which result in better conductivity at grain
boundaries.

of the distribution detected for both switchings showed similar saturation
characteristics with decreasing temperature, the temperature at saturation was
about 13 times higher for the second switching than for the first switching.
The properties of the first switching can be explained in terms of a
conventional underdamped JJ, that is, macroscopic quantum tunneling below the
crossover temperature, and thermal activation with quality factor of 70$\pm$20
above the crossover temperature. In contrast, the relatively higher effective
temperature for the second switching evaluated from the switching probability

representation with $\dim(F)<\infty$ and $(\fh,\pi_2)$ is a unitary
representation.
  The main result of this paper is that a uniform lattice in a semisimple Lie
group has property $F \otimes H$ if and only if it has property $(T)$. The
proof hinges on an extension of a Bochner-type formula due to
Matsushima-Murakami and Raghunathan. We give a new and more transparent
derivation of this formula as the difference of two classical Weitzenb\""{o}ck
formula's for two different structures on the same bundle. Our Bochner-type
formula is also used in our work on harmonic maps into continuum products
\cite{Fisher-Hitchman2,Fisher-Hitchman1}. Some further applications of property
$F \otimes H$ in the context of group actions will be given in
\cite{Fisher-Hitchman3}.

the given space is not homotopy equivalent to a CW-complex.

called carbuncles. Techniques for suppressing carbuncles are trial-and-error
and lack in reliability and generality, partly because theoretical knowledge
about carbuncles is equally unsatisfactory. It is not known which numerical
schemes are affected in which circumstances, what causes carbuncles to appear
and whether carbuncles are purely numerical artifacts or rather features of a
continuum equation or model. This work presents evidence towards the latter: it
is conjectured that carbuncles are a special class of non-physical entropy
solutions. Using a new technique for triggering a single carbuncle, their
structure is computed in detail in similarity coordinates.

  Latinoamericano de Algebra (Colonia, Uruguay, 2005)",,,,"math.AG",,"  Given a complete nonsingular algebraic variety $X$ and a divisor $D$ with
normal crossings, we say that $X$ is log homogeneous with boundary $D$ if the
logarithmic tangent bundle $T_X(- \log D)$ is generated by its global sections.
We then show that the Albanese morphism $\alpha$ is a fibration with fibers
being spherical (in particular, rational) varieties. It follows that all
irreducible components of $D$ are nonsingular, and any partial intersection of
them is irreducible. Also, the image of $X$ under the morphism $\sigma$
associated with $- K_X - D$ is a spherical variety, and the irreducible
components of all fibers of $\sigma$ are quasiabelian varieties. Generalizing
the Borel-Remmert structure theorem for homogeneous varieties, we show that the
product morphism $\alpha \times \sigma$ is surjective, and the irreducible
components of its fibers are toric varieties. We reduce the classification of
log homogeneous varieties to a problem concerning automorphism groups of
spherical varieties, that we solve under an additional assumption.

influence have been able to explain how distinct cultural groups can form.
While these mechanisms normally lead to cultural convergence, increased levels
of heterogeneity can allow them to produce global diversity. However, this
emergent cultural diversity has proven to be unstable in the face of ""cultural
drift""- small errors or innovations that allow cultures to change from within.
We develop a model of cultural differentiation that combines the traditional
mechanisms of homophily and influence with a third mechanism of 2network
homophily"", in which network structure co-evolves with cultural interaction. We
show that if social ties are allowed to change with cultural influence, a
complex relationship between heterogeneity and cultural diversity is revealed,
in which increased heterogeneity can reduce cultural group formation while
simultaneously increasing social connectedness. Our results show that in
certain regions of the parameter space these co-evolutionary dynamics can lead
to patterns of cultural diversity that are stable in the presence of cultural
drift.
