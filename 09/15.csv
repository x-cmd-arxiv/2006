either by an anisotropic energy injection from the nuclear starburst or quasar

tentative but non-significant emission peak at one position in the Phoenix
dwarf, no significant emission was detected in the CO spectra of these
galaxies. For a velocity width of 6 km/s, we derive 4sigma upper limits of 0.03
K km/s, 0.04 K km/s and 0.06 K km/s for IC5152, the Phoenix dwarf and UGCA438,
respectively. This is an improvement of over a factor of 10 compared with
previous observations of IC5152; the other two galaxies had not yet been
observed at millimeter wavelengths. Assuming a Galactic CO-to-H_2 conversion
factor, we derive upper limits on the molecular gas mass of 6.2 x 10^4 M_sun,
3.7 x 10^3 M_sun and 1.4 x 10^5 M_sun for IC5152, the Phoenix dwarf and
UGCA438, respectively. We investigate two possible causes for the lack of CO
emission in these galaxies. On the one hand, there may be a genuine lack of
molecular gas in these systems, in spite of the presence of large amounts of
neutral gas. However, in the case of IC5152 which is actively forming stars,
molecular gas is at least expected to be present in the star forming regions.
On the other hand, there may be a large increase in the CO-to-H_2 conversion
factor in very low-metallicity dwarfs (-2 <= [Fe/H] <= -1), making CO a poor
tracer of the molecular gas content in dwarf galaxies.

the advantage that their bars are relatively free of the effects of dust, star
formation, and spiral structure that complicate bar studies in later type
galaxies. We describe the survey and present results on detailed analysis of
the relative Fourier intensity amplitudes of bars in 26 early-type galaxies. We
also evaluate the symmetry assumption of these amplitudes with radius, used
recently for bar-spiral separation in later-type galaxies.
  The results show a wide variety of radial Fourier profiles of bars, ranging
from simple symmetric profiles that can be represented in terms of a single
gaussian component, to both symmetric and asymmetric profiles that can be
represented by two overlapping gaussian components. More complicated profiles
than these are also found, often due to multiple bar-like features including
extended ovals or lenses. Based on the gravitational bar torque indicator Q_b,
double-gaussian bars are stronger on average than single-gaussian bars, at
least for our small sample. We show that published numerical simulations where
the bar transfers a large amount of angular momentum to the halo can account
for many of the observed profiles. The range of possibilities encountered in
models seems well-represented in the observed systems.

tracers of mass density, like galaxies, is to model the tracer density field as
a Taylor series in the local smoothed mass density fluctuations, possibly
adding a stochastic component. I suggest a set of parameter redefinitions,
eliminating problematic perturbative correction terms, that should represent a
modest improvement, at least, to this method. As presented here, my method can
be used to compute the power spectrum and bispectrum to 4th order in initial
density perturbations, and higher order extensions should be straightforward.
While the model is technically unchanged at this order, just reparameterized,
the renormalized model is more elegant, and should have better convergence
behavior, for three reasons: First, in the usual approach the effects of
beyond-linear-order bias parameters can be seen at asymptotically large scales,
while after renormalization the linear model is preserved in the large-scale
limit, i.e., the effects of higher order bias parameters are restricted to
relatively high k. Second, while the standard approach includes smoothing to
suppress large perturbative correction terms, resulting in dependence on the
arbitrary cutoff scale, no cutoff-sensitive terms appear explicitly after my
redefinitions (and, relatedly, my correction terms are less sensitive to
high-k, non-linear, power). Third, the 3rd order bias parameter disappears
entirely, so my model has one fewer free parameter than usual (this parameter
was redundant at the order considered). This model predicts a small
modification of the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal, in real space,
supporting the robustness of BAO as a probe of dark energy, and providing a
complete perturbative description over the relevant range of scales.

rms the presence of a broad, ionised iron Kalpha emission line in the spectrum,
first found by Gondoin et al. The broad line can be modeled successfully by
relativistic accretion disc reflection models. This interpretation is unusually
robust in the case of Mrk 335 because of the lack of any ionised (`` warm'')
absorber and the absence a clear narrow core to the line. Partial covering by
neutral gas cannot, however, be ruled out statistically as the origin of the
broad residuals. Regardless of the underlyin g continuum we report, for the
first time in this source, the detection of a narrow absorption feature at the
rest frame energy of ~5.9 keV. If the feature is identified with a resonance
absorption line of iron in a highly ionised medium, the redshift of the line
corresponds to an inflow velocity of ~0.11 -0.15 c. We present a simple model
for the inflow, accounting approximate ly for relativistic and radiation
pressure effects, and use Monte Carlo methods to compute synthetic spectra for
qualitative comparison with the data. This mode ling shows that the absorption
feature can plausibly be reproduced by infalling gas providing that the feature
is identified with Fe xxvi. We require the inflowing gas to extend over a
limited range of radii at a few tens of rg to match the observed feature. The
mass accretion rate in the flow correspond s to 60% of the Eddington limit, in
remarkable agreement with the observed rate . The narrowness of the absorption
line tends to argue against a purely gravitational origin for the redshift of
the line, but given the current data quality we stress that such an
interpretation cannot be ruled out.

have metallicities that are systematically lower than normal galaxies of the

general relativity and alternative theories of gravity in the strong-field
regime. Here we report on precision timing observations taken over the 2.5

relativistic corrections to the Keplerian description of the orbital motion, we
find that the ``post-Keplerian'' parameter s agrees with the value predicted by
Einstein's theory of general relativity within an uncertainty of 0.05%, the

eliminated using the SysRem algorithm. The remaining systematic errors caused
by spatially localised flat-fielding and other errors are quantified using a

transit parameters in the vicinity of the most significant solutions. We
illustrate the method's operation by applying it to data from one field of the

very massive stars. Giant eruptions of Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) like the
19th century event of $\eta$ Carinae can remove large quantities of mass almost
instantaneously, making them significant in stellar evolution. They can
potentially remove more mass from the star than line-driven winds, especially
if winds are clumped such that O star mass-loss rates need to be revised
downward. When seen in other galaxies as ``supernova impostors'', these
eruptions typically last for less than a decade, and they can remove of order
10 M$_{\odot}$ as indicated by massive nebulae around LBVs. Such extreme
mass-loss rates cannot be driven by radiation pressure on spectral lines.
Instead, these outbursts must either be continuum-driven super-Eddington winds
or outright hydrodynamic explosions, both of which are insensitive to
metallicity. As such, this eruptive mode of mass loss could play a pivotal role

wind nebula systems in the energy range accessible to the INTEGRAL satellite is
mainly synchrotron emission from energetic and fast cooling electrons close to
their acceleration site. Our analyses of public INTEGRAL data of known TeV
plerions detected by ground based Cherenkov telescopes indicate a deeper link
between these TeV plerions and INTEGRAL detected pulsar wind nebulae. The newly
discovered TeV plerion in the northern wing of the Kookaburra region
(G313.3+0.6 powered by the middle aged PSR J1420-6048) is found to have a
previously unknown INTEGRAL counterpart which is besides the Vela pulsar the
only middle aged pulsar detected with INTEGRAL. We do not find an INTEGRAL
counterpart of the TeV plerion associated with the X-ray PWN ``Rabbit''
G313.3+0.1 which is possibly powered by a young pulsar.

by more than 7 years (272 orbital cycles). The orbit is consistent with
circular, and e < 0.19 at the 90% confidence level. The mass function is 11.7

system. The orbital period, along with the previously known ~414 s pulse
period, places this system in the part of the Corbet diagram populated by
supergiant wind accretors. Using previous eclipse time measurements by Corbet
et al. and our orbital solution, combined with the assumption that the primary
underfills its Roche lobe, we find i > 61 degrees at the 99% confidence level,
the radius of the primary is between 21 R_sun and 37 R_sun, and its mass is
less than about 22 M_sun. The acceptable range of radius and mass shows that
the primary is probably a supergiant of spectral type B0I-B5I. Photometric
measurements of its likely counterpart are consistent with the spectral type
and luminosity if the distance to the system is between 5.3 kpc and 8.7 kpc.
Spectral analysis of the pulsar as a function of orbital phase reveals an
evolution of the hydrogen column density suggestive of dense filaments of gas
in the downstream wake of the pulsar, with higher levels of absorption seen at
orbital phases 0.5-1.0, as well as a variable Fe K_alpha line.

of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa). Assuming an exponential density reduction with
several characteristic times we have followed the evolution of a planar nuclear
flame in an expanding background from an initial density 6.6 10^7 g/cm3 down to
2 10^6 g/cm3. The total amount of synthesized intermediate-mass elements (IME),
from silicon to calcium, was monitored during the calculation. We have made use
of the computed mass fractions, X_IME, of these elements to give an estimation
of the total amount of IME synthesized during the deflagration of a massive
white dwarf. Using X_IME and adopting the usual hypothesis that turbulence
decouples the effective burning velocity from the laminar flame speed, so that
the relevant flame speed is actually the turbulent speed on the integral
length-scale, we have built a simple geometrical approach to model the region
where IME are thought to be produced. It turns out that a healthy production of
IME involves the combination of not too short expansion times, t_c > 0.2 s, and
high turbulent intensities. According to our results it could be difficult to
produce much more than 0.2 solar masses of intermediate-mass elements within
the deflagrative paradigma. The calculations also suggest that the mass of IME
scales with the mass of Fe-peak elements, making it difficult to conciliate
energetic explosions with low ejected nickel masses, as in the well observed
SN1991bg or in SN1998de. Thus a large production of Si-peak elements,
especially in combination with a low or a moderate production of iron, could be
better addressed by either the delayed detonation route in standard
Chandrasekhar-mass models or, perhaps, by the off-center helium detonation in
the sub Chandrasekhar-mass scenario.

out to quite large distances, galaxies are distributed in a quasi-fractal
fashion with fractal dimension $D \approx 2$. Whether or not this behaviour
continues onto indefinitely large scales is a matter of live debate and is a
question that can only be settled if, at some scale, there is an unambiguous
transition to homogeneity. This point has not yet been reached and may never
be. This paper has been written on the basis of the tentative hypothesis that
quasi-fractal $D\approx 2$ behaviour is a persistent and fundamental feature of
galaxy distribution on all scales and addresses the question of the origins of
this putative fractality. Given this tentative hypothesis then, except for the
device of putting the fractal behaviour into the initial conditions - which is
to by-pass the question, there is no obvious explanation within the framework
of conventional cosmology. So we adopt the position that fractality is per-se a
signature that different thinking is required. We find that a beautiful
solution flows deductively from elementary observations about the world in
which we live when we take seriously a view of space and time that can be
traced, via Mach, Berkeley and Leibnitz to Aristotle. In summary, we find that
a globally inertial space and time can be irreducibly associated with a
fractal, D=2, distribution of material if we are prepared to review our
understanding of what is meant by the notion of metric on astrophysical scales.

calculate the radiative transfer in spherical symmetry for a stellar cluster

The cluster contains two stellar populations: old bulge stars and OB stars.
Because the latter are young, a certain fraction of them will be embedded in
compact clouds which constitute hot spots that determine the MIR fluxes. We
present SEDs for a broad range of luminosities, sizes and obscurations. We
argue that the assumption of spherical symmetry and the neglect of clumpiness
of the medium are not severe shortcomings for computing the dust emission. The
validity of the approach is demonstrated by matching the SED of the best
studied galaxies, including M82 and Arp220, by library elements; one example is
shown for a galaxy at high redshift (z ~ 3). Generally, one finds an element

galaxies transition from actively star forming to passive systems. The sample
is limited to redshifts 0.03<z<0.07. At these distances, the SDSS spectra
sample the light from the bulge-dominated central regions of the galaxies. The
GALEX NUV data provide high sensitivity to low rates of global star formation
in these systems. Our sample of bulge-dominated galaxies exhibits a much larger
dispersion in NUV-r colour than in optical g-r colour. Nearly all of the
galaxies with bluer NUV-r colours are AGN. Both GALEX images and SDSS colour
profiles demonstrate that the excess UV light is associated with an extended
disk. We find that galaxies with red outer regions almost never have a young
bulge or a strong AGN. Galaxies with blue outer regions have bulges and black
holes that span a wide range in age and accretion rate. Galaxies with young
bulges and strongly accreting black holes almost always have blue outer disks.
Our suggested scenario is one in which the source of gas that builds the bulge
and black hole is a low mass reservoir of cold gas in the disk.The presence of
this gas is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for bulge and black hole
growth. Some mechanism must transport this gas inwards in a time variable way.
As the gas in the disk is converted into stars, the galaxies will turn red, but
further gas infall can bring them back into the blue NUV-r sequence.(Abridged)

steep decay, a shallow decay was observed from T_0+187 s to T_0+1287 s. After
an observation gap during T_0 +(1.5-3) ks, an extremely early steep decay was
observed in T_0+(4-30) ks. The lightcurve flattened again at T_0+30 ks, and
another steep decay followed from T_0+50 ks to the end of observations. Both

maximum quadrupole is very similar in the two cases, with the non-accreted

formalism for the problem, that allows us to drop the Cowling approximation and
have more control over the boundaries. The use of this formalism confirms that
there is not much difference between the two cases, but leads to results

50 nearly-parabolic comets of first class orbits. The data consist of 23

demonstrated. The average values of the original and future energy changes due

technological developments have provided the tools to design and build
scientific instruments of high enough sensitivity and precision to manipulate

is possible to: manipulate molecules one at a time and measure distributions
describing molecular properties; characterize the kinetics of biomolecular
reactions and; detect molecular intermediates. SME provide the additional
information about thermodynamics and kinetics of biomolecular processes. This
complements information obtained in traditional bulk assays. In SME it is also
possible to measure small energies and detect large Brownian deviations in
biomolecular reactions, thereby offering new methods and systems to scrutinize
the basic foundations of statistical mechanics. This review is written at a
very introductory level emphasizing the importance of SME to scientists
interested in knowing the common playground of ideas and the interdisciplinary
topics accessible by these techniques. The review discusses SME from an
experimental perspective, first exposing the most common experimental
methodologies and later presenting various molecular systems where such
techniques have been applied. I briefly discuss experimental techniques such as
atomic-force microscopy (AFM), laser optical tweezers (LOT), magnetic tweezers
(MT), biomembrane force probe (BFP) and single-molecule fluorescence (SMF). I
then present several applications of SME to the study of nucleic acids (DNA,
RNA and DNA condensation), proteins (protein-protein interactions, protein
folding and molecular motors). Finally, I discuss applications of SME to the
study of the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of small systems and the
experimental verification of fluctuation theorems. I conclude with a discussion

efficient protocols design. Routing protocols based on a self-organized
structure have been studied principally for the robustness and the scalability
they provide. On the other hand, self-organization schemes may decrease the
network capacity since they concentrate the traffic on privileged links. This
paper presents four models for evaluating the capacity of a routing schemes on
802.11 like networks. Our approach consists in modeling the radio resource
sharing principles of 802.11 like MAC protocols as a set of linear constraints.
We have implemented two models of fairness. The first one assumes that nodes
have a fair access to the channel, while the second one assumes that on the
radio links. We then develop a pessimistic and an optimistic scenarii of
spatial re-utilization of the medium, yielding a lower bound and an upper bound
on the network capacity for each fairness case. Our models are independent of
the routing protocols and provide therefore a relevant framework for their
comparison. We apply our models to a comparative analysis of the well-known
shortest path base flat routing protocol OLSR against two main self-organized
structure approaches, VSR, and Wu & Li's protocols. This study concludes on the
relevance of self-organized approaches from the network capacity point of view.

not prohibit the formation of the smallest classical black hole. For more
general situations, we derive a minimum mass, which may depend on the initial
value for entropy per particle. For primordial black holes, however, we show
that this minimum mass can not be much greater than the Planck mass at any
formation epoch of the Universe, as long as $g_{*}$ is within a reasonable

we point out that k_tr gives a significant contribution to the anomalous

With reasonable assumptions, we further show that this bound may be improved to

  random matrix theory","25 pages",,,,"math.ST stat.TH",,"  Estimating the eigenvalues of a population covariance matrix from a sample
covariance matrix is a problem of fundamental importance in multivariate
statistics; the eigenvalues of covariance matrices play a key role in many
widely techniques, in particular in Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In many
modern data analysis problems, statisticians are faced with large datasets
where the sample size, n, is of the same order of magnitude as the number of
variables p. Random matrix theory predicts that in this context, the
eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix are not good estimators of the
eigenvalues of the population covariance.
  We propose to use a fundamental result in random matrix theory, the
Marcenko-Pastur equation, to better estimate the eigenvalues of large
dimensional covariance matrices. The Marcenko-Pastur equation holds in very
wide generality and under weak assumptions. The estimator we obtain can be
thought of as ""shrinking"" in a non linear fashion the eigenvalues of the sample
covariance matrix to estimate the population eigenvalue. Inspired by ideas of
random matrix theory, we also suggest a change of point of view when thinking
about estimation of high-dimensional vectors: we do not try to estimate
directly the vectors but rather a probability measure that describes them. We
think this is a theoretically more fruitful way to think statistically about
these problems.
  Our estimator gives fast and good or very good results in extended
simulations. Our algorithmic approach is based on convex optimization. We also
show that the proposed estimator is consistent.

fluid in the plane can be expressed in Hamiltonian form, where the resulting
equations of motion are completely integrable in the sense of Liouville and
Arnold. The focus of this investigation is on the persistence of regular
behavior (especially periodic motion) associated to completely integrable
systems for certain (admissible) kinds of Hamiltonian perturbations of the
three vortex system in a plane. After a brief survey of the dynamics of the
integrable planar three vortex system, it is shown that the admissible class of
perturbed systems is broad enough to include three vortices in a half-plane,
three coaxial slender vortex rings in three-space, and `restricted' four vortex
dynamics in a plane. Included are two basic categories of results for
admissible perturbations: (i) general theorems for the persistence of invariant
tori and periodic orbits using Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser and Poincare-Birkhoff
type arguments; and (ii) more specific and quantitative conclusions of a
classical perturbation theory nature guaranteeing the existence of periodic
orbits of the perturbed system close to cycles of the unperturbed system, which
occur in abundance near centers. In addition, several numerical simulations are
provided to illustrate the validity of the theorems as well as indicating their
limitations as manifested by transitions to chaotic dynamics.

Within each phase, one can pursue the projects in any order. When pursuing the
project with one unit of resource, the project state changes according to a
Markov chain. The probability distribution of the Markov chain is known up to
an unknown parameter. When pursued, the project generates a random reward

for the ``biological neuron''. We discuss some models reducing the
Hodgkin-Huxley model to a two dimensional dynamical system, keeping one of the
main feature of the neuron: its excitability. We present then examples of phase
diagram and bifurcation analysis for the Hodgin-Huxley equations. Finally, we
end this section by a dynamical system analysis for the nervous flux
propagation along the axon. We then consider neuron couplings, with a brief
description of synapses, synaptic plasticiy and learning, in a second section.
We also briefly discuss the delicate issue of causal action from one neuron to
another when complex feedback effects and non linear dynamics are involved. The
third section presents the limit of weak coupling and the use of normal forms
technics to handle this situation. We consider then several examples of
recurrent models with different type of synaptic interactions (symmetric,
cooperative, random). We introduce various techniques coming from statistical
physics and dynamical systems theory. A last section is devoted to a detailed
example of recurrent model where we go in deep in the analysis of the dynamics
and discuss the effect of learning on the neuron dynamics. We also present
recent methods allowing the analysis of the non linear effects of the neural
dynamics on signal propagation and causal action. An appendix, presenting the
main notions of dynamical systems theory useful for the comprehension of the
chapter, has been added for the convenience of the reader.

the RHIC experiments. The observables include new p+p, A+A spectra, nuclear
modification factors (R_AA, R_CP), two particle azimuthal correlations, and
baryon to meson ratios at moderately high pt. Generally, the interpretation of
the SPS data suffers from the lack of reliable baseline measurements (p+p and
p+A). However, the overall picture that is emerging suggests that already at
SPS energies medium effects similar to those observed at RHIC are present.

the \Delta\phi azimuthal distribution on the far side when the trigger momentum
is in the non-perturbative region, p_T(trigger)<4 GeV/c. The dip-bump structure
for 1<p_T(assoc)<2.5 GeV/c is reproduced by averaging over the exit tracks of
deflected jets. An essential characteristic of the model, called Markovian
Parton Scattering (MPS) model, is that the scattering angle is randomly
selected in the forward cone at every step of a trajectory that is divided into
many discrete steps in a semi-classical approximation of the non-perturbative
scattering process. Energy loss to the medium is converted to thermal partons
which hadronize by recombination to give rise to the pedestal under the bumps.
When extended to high trigger momentum with \pt(trigger) >8 GeV/c, the model
reproduces the single-peak structure observed by STAR without invoking any new

interaction in calculations within the so-called ""Extended"" RPA (ERPA) and
investigate the response of closed-shell nuclei. The ERPA is a renormalized RPA
version which considers explicitly the depletion of the Fermi sea due to
long-range correlations and thus allows us to examine how these affect the
excitation spectra. It is found that the effect on the properties of giant
resonances is rather small. Compared to the standard RPA, where excitations are
built on top of the uncorrelated Hartree-Fock (HF) ground state, their centroid
energies decrease by up to 1 MeV, approximately, in the isovector channel. The
isoscalar response is less affected in general. Thus, the disagreement between
our previous UCOM-based RPA calculations and the experimental data are to be
attributed to other effects, mainly to a residual three-body force and
higher-order configurations. Ground-state properties obtained within the ERPA
are compared with corresponding HF and perturbation-theory results and are
discussed as well. The ERPA formalism is presented in detail.

different alphabet sizes and an ensemble of random structures, which we want to

significant fraction of structures is undesignable. This changes when we look

undesignable structures are the exception, although they still exist. Finally,

collisions between atoms even when there is neither interaction between nuclear
spins nor between the nuclear and electron spins. This ""exchange blockade"" is a
new mechanism for implementing quantum logic gates that arises from the
symmetry of composite identical particles, rather than direct coupling between
qubits. We study the implementation of the entangling $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gate
based on this mechanism for a model system of two atoms with ground electron
configuration $^1S_0$, spin 1/2 nuclei, trapped in optical tweezers. We
evaluate a proof-of-principle protocol based on adiabatic evolution of a one
dimensional double Gaussian well, calculating fidelities of operation as a
function of interaction strength, gate time, and temperature.

Semiclassical estimates are given for the time scales separating the different

  retain entanglement in coin space","9 pages, 3 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  In most widely discussed discrete time quantum walk model, after every
unitary shift operator, the particle evolves into the superposition of position
space and settles down in one of its basis states, loosing entanglement in the
coin space in the new position. The Hadamard operation is applied to let the
particle to evolve into the superposition in the coin space and the walk is
iterated. We present a model with a additional degree of freedom for the
unitary shift operator $U^{\prime}$. The unitary operator with additional
degree of freedom will evolve the quantum particle into superposition of
position space retaining the entanglement in coin space. This eliminates the
need for quantum coin toss (Hadamard operation) after every unitary
displacement operation as used in most widely studied version of the discrete
time quantum walk model. This construction is easily extended to a multiple
particle quantum walk and in this article we extend it for a pair of particles
in pure state entangled in coin degree of freedom by simultaneously subjecting
it to a pair of unitary displacement operators which were constructed for
single particle. We point out that unlike for single particle quantum walk,
upon measurement of its position after $N$ steps, the entangled particles are
found together with 1/2 probability and at different positions with 1/2
probability. This can act as an advantage in applications of the quantum walk.
A special case is also treated using a complex physical system such as, inter
species two-particle entangled Bose-Einstein condensate, as an example.

impact of ionization damping on the transition line shape, caused by the
possibility of ionization of the 2S level by the same laser field. Using a
Monte-Carlo simulation, we calculate the line shape of the \sts transition for
the experimental geometry used in the two latest absolute frequency
measurements (M. Niering {\it et al.}, PRL 84, 5496 (2000) and M. Fischer {\it
et al.}, PRL 92, 230802 (2004)). The calculated line shift and line width are
in excellent agreement with the experimentally observed values. From this
comparison we can verify the values of the dynamic Stark shift coefficient for
the \sts transition for the first time on a level of 15%. We show that the
ionization modifies the velocity distribution of the metastable atoms, the line
shape of the \sts transition, and has an influence on the derivation of its
absolute frequency.
