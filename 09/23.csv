phenomena, e.g. the Evershed effect and bright penumbral grains.
  Aims: A wealth of information can be extracted from spectropolarimetric
observations. In order to deduce the structure of the magnetic field in sunspot
penumbrae, detailed forward modeling is necessary. On the one hand, it gives
insight into the sensitivity of various spectral lines to different physical
scenarios. On the other hand, it is a very useful tool to guide inversion
techniques. In this work, we present a generalized 3D geometrical model that
embeds an arbitrarily shaped flux tube in a stratified magnetized atmosphere.
  Methods: The new semi-analytical geometric model serves as a frontend for a
polarized radiative transfer code. The advantage of this model is that it
preserves the discontinuities of the physical parameters across the flux tube
boundaries. This is important for the detailed shape of the emerging Stokes
Profiles and the resulting net circular polarization (NCP).
  Results: (a) The inclination of downflows in the outer penumbra must be
shallower than approximately 15 degrees. (b) Observing the limb-side NCP of
sunspots in the Fe I 1564.8 nm line offers a promising way to identify a
reduced magnetic field strength in flow channels. (c) The choice of the
background atmosphere can significantly influence the shape of the Stokes
profiles, but does not change the global characteristics of the resulting NCP
curves for the tested atmospheric models.

terms of nuclear photoionization as the driving ionization mechanism. However,
CL profiles show various peculiarities: they are broader by a factor of two
than lower ionization lines, the broadening being in terms of asymmetric blue

hundreds of km/s. Moreover, in NGC1386 and NGC1068, a double peak [FeVII] line
is detected in the nuclear and extended coronal region, this being the first

interpreted as outflow signatures, the total broadening of the lines at zero

stratification of ions across the coronal region means that photoionization is
the main power mechanism, the high velocities deduced from the profiles, the
relatively large spatial extension of the emission, and the results from

of SNe Ia with multiband ($griz$) light-curves and spectroscopic redshifts
obtained by the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). This estimator is analytical
and model-independent; it does not use spectral templates. We use all the
available SNe Ia from SNLS with near maximum photometry in $griz$ (a total of
40 SNe Ia) to train and test our photometric redshift estimator. The difference
between the estimated redshifts $z_{phot}$ and the spectroscopic redshifts
$z_{spec}$, $(z_{phot}-z_{spec})/(1+z_{spec})$, has rms dispersions of 0.031

uncertainties at peak brightness for the SNe Ia. There are no outlyers.
  This photometric redshift estimator should significantly enhance the ability
of observers to accurately target high redshift SNe Ia for spectroscopy in
ongoing surveys. It will also dramatically boost the cosmological impact of

effects of preheating on gas accretion and cooling in cold dark matter halos.
In the absence of radiative cooling, preheating reduces the amount of gas that
can be accreted into a halo, and the accreted gas fraction is determined by the
ratio of the initial specific entropy of the gas to the virial entropy of the
halo. In the presence of radiative cooling, preheating affects the gas fraction
that can cool in two different ways. For small halos with masses <10^12Msun,
preheating suppresses gas accretion, but most of the accreted gas can cool. For
more massive halos, preheating not only reduces the amount of accreted gas, but
also reduces the cooling efficiency. For both small and massive halos, gas
cooling is delayed by preheating and in an inside-out fashion if the halo gas
is assumed to be a single-phase medium. However, cooling can occur over a wider
range of redshifts and radii, if we assume a multi-phase medium. As examples,
two specific preheating cases are investigated. In the first case, the
preheating entropy is assumed to be proportional to the virial entropy of the
halo, as expected from AGN feedback. Such preheating effectively suppresses
radiative cooling in halos with M>10^13Msun. We suggest that this may be the
reason why the stellar mass function of galaxies breaks sharply at the massive
end. Such preheating also helps create the hot diffused halos within which the
""radio mode"" feedback of AGNs can act effectively. In the second case, we
assume the intergalactic medium is warm. Here the total amount of gas that can
cool in a halo scales with halo mass as ~M^2, as would be required to match the
observed stellar- and HI-mass functions in the current CDM model at the small
mass end.

observations. The bolometric light curve of SN 1999em and the spectral
evolution of its H-alpha line are consistent with a presupernova radius of 500
Rsun, an ejecta mass of 19.0 Msun, an explosion energy of 1.3x10^51 erg, and a
radioactive 56Ni mass of 0.036 Msun. A mutual mixing of hydrogen-rich and
helium-rich matter in the inner layers of the ejecta guarantees a good fit of
the calculated light curve to that observed. Based on the hydrodynamic models
in the vicinity of the optimal model, we derive the approximate relationships
between the basic physical and observed parameters. We find that the hydrogen
recombination in the atmosphere of a normal Type IIP SN 1999em, as well as most
likely other Type IIP supernovae at the photospheric epoch, is essentially a
time-dependent phenomenon. It is also shown that in normal Type IIP supernovae
the homologous expansion of the ejecta in its atmosphere takes place starting
from nearly the third day after the supernova explosion. A comparison of SN
1999em with SN 1987A reveals two very important results for supernova theory.
First, the comparability of the helium core masses and the explosion energies
implies a unique explosion mechanism for these core collapse supernovae.
Second, the optimal model for SN 1999em is characterized by a weaker 56Ni
mixing up to 660 km/s compared to a moderate 56Ni mixing up to 3000 km/s in SN
1987A, hydrogen being mixed deeply downward to 650 km/s.

strain, resulting in the coexistence of both ferroelectric and
antiferrodistortive domains. The magnitude and sign of the strain imposed on
the lattice by design can be used to tune the phase transitions and
interactions between these two phenomena. Using optical second harmonic
generation, we report a transition from centrosymmetric 4/mmm phase to
ferroelectric mm2, followed by an antiferrodistortive transition to a coupled
ferroelastic-ferroelectric mm2 phase in a strontium titanate thin film strained
in biaxial tension by 0.94%. The results agree well with theoretical first
principles and phase-field predictions. Direct imaging of domains arising from
the ferroelectric phase transition, and its switching under electric fields is
demonstrated using piezoelectric force microscopy. Nonlinear optics combined
with phase-field modeling is used to show that the dominant multiferroic domain
switching mechanism is through coupled 90 degree ferroelectric-ferroelastic
domain wall motion. More broadly, these studies of coexisting ferroelectric
(polar) and antiferrodistortive rotation (axial) phenomena could have relevance
to multiferroics with coexisting ferroelectric (polar) and magnetic (axial)

on both sides of the duality. The gapless collective excitations of this phase
closely resemble the graviton, although they have a soft $\omega\sim k^2$
dispersion relation. There are three branches of gapless excitations in this
phase, one of which is gapless scalar trace mode, the other two have the same

fluids presented in [R. D. Rohrmann, Physica A 347, 221 (2005)] is extended to

chemically complex fluids. Presently, the theory focuses on $D$-dimensional
mixtures in the low-density limit (packing factor $\eta < 0.01$). The formalism
combines the free-energy minimization technique with space partitions that
assign an available volume $v$ to each particle. $v$ is related to the
closeness of the nearest neighbor and provides an useful tool to evaluate the
perturbations experimented by particles in a fluid. The theory shows a close
relationship between statistical geometry and statistical mechanics. New,
unconventional thermodynamic variables and mathematical identities are derived
as a result of the space division. Thermodynamic potentials $\mu_{il}$,
conjugate variable of the populations $N_{il}$ of particles class $i$ with the
nearest neighbors of class $l$ are defined and their relationships with the
usual chemical potentials $\mu_i$ are established. Systems of hard spheres are
treated as illustrative examples and their thermodynamics functions are derived
analytically. The low-density expressions obtained agree nicely with those of
scaled-particle theory and Percus-Yevick approximation. Several pair
distribution functions are introduced and evaluated. Analytical expressions are
also presented for hard spheres with attractive forces due to K\^ac-tails and
square-well potentials. Finally, we derive general chemical equilibrium
conditions.

analytically and check numerically that there exists a wide interval of
interaction strength, in which the on-site number fluctuations remain Gaussian

experimentally in a wide range of lattice potential depths [Phys. Rev. Lett.

two regimes separated by some critical value of the surface anisotropy constant
$K_s$ which controls the intensity of spin non-collinearities: i) the so called
Stoner-Wohlfarth or N\'eel-Brown regime of a macrospin undergoing a coherent
switching, ii) the many-spin regime where the strong spin non-collinearities
invalidate the coherent mechanism, and where the particle's magnetic state and
switching mechanisms can no longer be modeled by a macrospin.
  For small-to-intermediate values of $K_s$, and within two models of surface
anisotropy (transverse and N\'eel), the behaviour of the nanoparticle can be
modeled by that of a macrospin with an effective potential energy containing a
uniaxial and cubic anisotropy terms. This effective spin model provides a
crossover between the two regimes.

description of relativistic N-particle systems, is shown to be a mathematically
consistent and physically reasonable framework for an arbitrary assemblage of
positive and negative charges. The electromagnetic plus exchange interactions
within the subset of {\it identical} particles are accounted for in a
consistent way, whereas {\it different} particles can undergo only the
electromagnetic interactions. The origin of this different interaction
mechanism for the subsets of identical and non-identical particles is traced
back to the fundamental conservation laws for charge and energy-momentum: in
order that these conservation laws can hold also for different particles, the
structure group $\mathcal U(N)$ of the fibre bundles must be reduced to its
maximal Abelian subgroup $\mathcal U(1) \times \mathcal U(1) \times ... \times
\mathcal U(1)$, which eliminates the exchange part of the bundle connection.
The persisting Abelian gauge symmetry adopts the meaning of the proper gauge
group for the electromagnetic interactions which apply to the identical and
non-identical particles in the same way. Thus in RST there is an intrinsic
dynamical foundation of the emergence of exchange effects for identical
particles, whereas the conventional theory is invaded by the exchange
phenomenon via a purely kinematical postulate, namely the antisymmetrization
postulate for the wave functions due to Pauli's exclusion principle. As a
concrete demonstration, a three-particle system is considered which consists of
a positively charged particle of arbitrary rest mass and of two negatively
charged particles of equal spin, mass and charge (e.g. electrons).

second author has shown that for $n = 2$ the bound $c |\Omega| $ may be
replaced by a uniform constant $d$ independent of $\Omega$ if the Dirichlet
norm is replaced by the Sobolev norm, i.e. requiring $\int_\Omega (|\nabla u|^n
+ |u|^n)dx \le 1$. We extend here this result to arbitrary dimensions $n > 2$.
Also, we prove that for $\Omega = \mathbb R^n$ the supremum of $\int_{\mathbb
R^n} (e^{\alpha_n|u|^{\frac n{n-1}}}-1)dx$ over all such functions is attained.
The proof is based on a blow-up procedure.

an automorphism has been solved in particular in two contexts. One of these two
constructions is that initiated by the third author in the case of a lattice
vertex operator algebra and an automorphism arising from an arbitrary lattice
isometry. This construction, from a physical point of view, is related to the
space-time geometry associated with the lattice in the sense of string theory.
The other construction is due to the first author, jointly with C. Dong and G.
Mason, in the case of a multi-fold tensor product of a given vertex operator
algebra with itself and a permutation automorphism of the tensor factors. The
latter construction is based on a certain change of variables in the worldsheet
geometry in the sense of string theory. In the case of a lattice that is the
orthogonal direct sum of copies of a given lattice, these two very different
constructions can both be carried out, and must produce isomorphic twisted
modules, by a theorem of the first author jointly with Dong and Mason. In this
paper, we explicitly construct an isomorphism, thereby providing, from both
mathematical and physical points of view, a direct link between space-time
geometry and worldsheet geometry in this setting.

last decade have reported that they arenon-Gaussian, scale in time, and have
power-law(or fat) tails. However, because they use sliding interval methods of
analysis, these studies implicitly assume that the underlying process has
stationary increments. We explicitly show that this assumption is not valid for
the Euro-Dollar exchange rate between 1999-2004. In addition, we find that
fluctuations in returns of the exchange rate are uncorrelated and scale as
power-laws for certain time intervals during each day. This behavior is
consistent with a diffusive process with a diffusion coefficient that depends
both on the time and the price change. Within scaling regions, we find that
sliding interval methods can generate fat-tailed distributions as an artifact,
and that the type of scaling reported in many previous studies does not exist.

Math Biology (55) 541-573 (2007)","10.1007/s00285-007-0094-6",,"q-bio.PE q-bio.QM",,"  We study the qualitative properties of population cycles in a predator-prey
system where genetic variability allows contemporary rapid evolution of the
prey. Previous numerical studies have found that prey evolution in response to
changing predation risk can have major quantitative and qualitative effects on
predator-prey cycles, including: (i) large increases in cycle period, (ii)
changes in phase relations (so that predator and prey are cycling exactly out
of phase, rather than the classical quarter-period phase lag), and (iii)
""cryptic"" cycles in which total prey density remains nearly constant while
predator density and prey traits cycle. Here we focus on a chemostat model
motivated by our experimental system [Fussmann et al. 2000,Yoshida et al. 2003]
with algae (prey) and rotifers (predators), in which the prey exhibit rapid
evolution in their level of defense against predation. We show that the effects
of rapid prey evolution are robust and general, and furthermore that they occur
in a specific but biologically relevant region of parameter space: when traits
that greatly reduce predation risk are relatively cheap (in terms of reductions
in other fitness components), when there is coexistence between the two prey
types and the predator, and when the interaction between predators and
undefended prey alone would produce cycles. Because defense has been shown to
be inexpensive, even cost-free, in a number of systems [Andersson and Levin
1999, Gagneux et al. 2006,Yoshida et al. 2004], our discoveries may well be
reproduced in other model systems, and in nature. Finally, some of our key
results are extended to a general model in which functional forms for the
predation rate and prey birth rate are not specified.

to a single point mutation is characterized by the number of mutated elements

with the behavior of randomized networks reveals relevant structural
characteristics other than the mean connectivity, namely the organization of
circuits and the functional form of the in-degree distribution. The abundance
of single-element circuits in {\it E. coli} and the power-law in-degree

understanding the nature of packing in folded structures and in elucidating
interactions between RNA and DNA or proteins. Using the coordinates of the
structures of RNA in the Protein Data Bank we find that the size of the folded
RNA structures, measured using the radius of gyration, $R_G$, follows the Flory
scaling law, namely, $R_G =5.5 N^{1/3}$ \AA where N is the number of
nucleotides. The shape of RNA molecules is characterized by the asphericity
$\Delta$ and the shape $S$ parameters that are computed using the eigenvalues
of the moment of inertia tensor. From the distribution of $\Delta$, we find
that a large fraction of folded RNA structures are aspherical and the
distribution of $S$ values shows that RNA molecules are prolate ($S>0$). The
flexibility of folded structures is characterized by the persistence length
$l_p$. By fitting the distance distribution function $P(r)$ to the worm-like
chain model we extracted the persistence length $l_p$. We find that $l_p\approx
1.5 N^{0.33}$ \AA. The dependence of $l_p$ on $N$ implies the average length of
helices should increases as the size of RNA grows. We also analyze packing in
the structures of ribosomes (30S, 50S, and 70S) in terms of $R_G$, $\Delta$,
$S$, and $l_p$. The 70S and the 50S subunits are more spherical compared to
most RNA molecules. The globularity in 50S is due to the presence of an
unusually large number (compared to 30S subunit) of small helices that are
stitched together by bulges and loops. Comparison of the shapes of the intact
70S ribosome and the constituent particles suggests that folding of the
individual molecules might occur prior to assembly.

realized.

entanglement. We show that, despite these limitations, entanglement can be
fully 'promiscuous', i.e. simultaneously present in unlimited two-body and
many-body forms in states living in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space.
Monogamy just bounds the divergence rate of the various entanglement
contributions. This is demonstrated in simple families of N-mode (N >= 4)
Gaussian states of light fields or atomic ensembles, which therefore enable
infinitely more freedom in the distribution of information, as opposed to
systems of individual qubits. Such a finding is of importance for the
quantification, understanding and potential exploitation of shared quantum
correlations in continuous variable systems. We discuss how promiscuity
gradually arises when considering simple families of discrete variable states,
with increasing Hilbert space dimension towards the continuous variable limit.
Such models are somehow analogous to Gaussian states with asymptotically
diverging, but finite squeezing. In this respect, we find that non-Gaussian
states (which in general are more entangled than Gaussian states), exhibit also
the interesting feature that their entanglement is more shareable: in the
non-Gaussian multipartite arena, unlimited promiscuity can be already achieved
among three entangled parties, while this is impossible for Gaussian, even
infinitely squeezed states.
