density fluctuations through detailed mapping of the redshifted 21-cm emission
from the neutral medium during reionization. We find that the
electron-scattering optical depth and 21-cm differential brightness temperature
are strongly anti-correlated, allowing optical depth estimates based entirely
on redshifted 21-cm measurements. This should help isolate the CMB polarization
fluctuations that are due to reionization, allowing both cleaning of the patchy
reionization polarization signal as a contaminating source of confusion to
other signals and a measurement of the primordial quadrupole that would be
measured at various locations in the universe at the epoch of reionization.
This latter application in principle allows mapping of the primordial density
field at z~1100 over a large fraction of the Hubble volume.

their evolution by the SIM, assuming a simple prescription for the angular

most epochs, the SIM reproduces the simulated mater distribution with a typical
fractional deviation of less than 40 per cent over more than six order of
magnitudes in the density. It is also found that, within the SIM framework,
most of the diversity in the shape of the density profiles at $z=0$ arises from
the scatter in the primordial initial conditions rather than the scatter in the
angular momentum distribution. A crude optimization shows that a similar degree
of agreement is obtained for galactic and cluster haloes, but the former seem
to require slightly higher amounts of angular momentum. Our main conclusion is
that the SIM provides a viable dynamical model for predicting the structure and
evolution of the density profile of dark matter haloes.

Eta Car's optically thick wind region with a high spatial resolution of 5 mas
(11 AU) and high spectral resolution. The medium spectral resolution
observations (R=1,500) were performed in the wavelength range around both the
HeI 2.059 micron and the Br gamma 2.166 micron emission lines, the high
spectral resolution observations (R=12,000) only in the Br gamma line region.
In the K-band continuum, a diameter of 4.0 +/-0.2 mas (Gaussian FWHM, fit range
28-89m) was measured for Eta Car's optically thick wind region. If we fit
Hillier et al. (2001) model visibilities to the observed AMBER visibilities, we
obtain 50 % encircled-energy diameters of 4.2, 6.5 and 9.6mas in the 2.17

the continuum near the Br gamma line, an elongation along a position angle of

efficiency (SFE), addressing the effects of turbulence and the magnetic field
strength. In closed-box numerical simulations, the effect of the turbulent Mach
number $\Ms$ depends on whether the turbulence is driven or decaying: In driven
regimes, increasing $\Ms$ decreases the SFE, while in decaying regimes the
converse is true. The efficiencies in non-magnetic cases for realistic Mach
numbers $\Ms \sim 10$ are somewhat too high compared to observed values.
Including the magnetic field can bring the SFE down to levels consistent with
observations, but the intensity of the magnetic field necessary to accomplish
this depends again on whether the turbulence is driven or decaying. In this
kind of simulations, a lifetime of the molecular cloud (MC) needs to be
assumed. Further progress requires determining the true nature of the
turbulence driving and the lifetimes of the clouds. Simulations of MC formation
by large-scale compressions in the warm neutral medium (WNM) show that the
clouds' initial turbulence is produced by the accumulation process that forms
them, and that the turbulence is driven for as long as this process lasts,
producing realistic velocity dispersions and also thermal pressures in excess
of the mean WNM value. In simulations including self-gravity, but neglecting
the magnetic field and stellar energy feedback, the clouds never reach an
equilibrium state, but rather evolve secularly, increasing their mass and
gravitational energy until they engage in generalized gravitational collapse.
However, local collapse events begin midways through this process, and produce
enough stellar objetcs to disperse the cloud or at least halt its collapse
before the latter is completed.

determined simultaneously by fitting the profiles of H and He lines using
dedicated synthetic spectra in NLTE. Evidence for cool companions to 8 sdOs as
well as a binary consisting of two sdO stars is found. A correlation between He
abundances and the presence of carbon and/or nitrogen lines emerges: below
solar He abundance, no sdO shows C or N lines. In contrast, C and/or N lines
are present in ALL sdOs with super- solar He abundance. We thus use the solar
He abundance to divide our sample into He-deficient and He-enriched sdOs. While
He-deficient sdOs are scattered in a wide range of the Teff-log(g)-diagram,
most of the He-enriched sdOs cluster in a narrow region at Teff = 40,000 ...
50,000K and log(g)=5.5 ... 6.0. An evolu- tionary link between sdBs and sdOs
appears plausible only for the He-deficient sdOs indicating that they are the
likely successors to sdBs. The properties of He-enriched sdOs cannot be
explained with canonical single star evolutionary models. Alternative scenarios
(late hot flasher) as well as for binary evolution (white dwarf merger;
post-RGB evolution) are tested. While we regard the post-RGB scenario as
inappropriate, the white dwarf merger and the late hot flasher scenarios remain
viable to explain the origin of He-enriched sdOs.

amounts of water. While this water cannot be present near the cloud tops, it
must be abundant in the deep interior. We investigate the likelihood of a
liquid water ocean existing in the hydrogen-rich region between the cloud tops
and deep interior. Starting from an assumed temperature at a given upper
tropospheric pressure (the photosphere), we follow a moist adiabat downward.
The mixing ratio of water to hydrogen in the gas phase is small in the
photosphere and increases with depth. The mixing ratio in the condensed phase
is near unity in the photosphere and decreases with depth; this gives two
possible outcomes. If at some pressure level the mixing ratio of water in the
gas phase is equal to that in the deep interior, then that level is the cloud
base. Alternately, if the mixing ratio of water in the condensed phase reaches
that in the deep interior, then the surface of a liquid ocean will occur. We
find that Neptune is both too warm (photospheric temperature too high) and too
dry (mixing ratio of water in the deep interior too low) for liquid oceans to
exist at present. To have a liquid ocean, Neptune's deep interior water to gas
ratio would have to be higher than current models allow, and the density at 19
kbar would have to be ~ 0.8 g/cm^3. Such a high density is inconsistent with
gravitational data obtained during the Voyager flyby. As Neptune cools, the
probability of a liquid ocean increases. Extrasolar ""hot Neptunes,"" which
presumably migrate inward toward their parent stars, cannot harbor liquid water

interface dynamo operating in a 3.0 M_sun Asymptotic Giant Branch star (AGB) in
both an isolated setting and one in which a low-mass companion is embedded

Poynting flux. For the isolated star, the shear must be resupplied in order to
sufficiently sustain the dynamo. Furthermore, we investigate the energy
requirements that convection must satisfy to accomplish this by analogy to the
sun. For the common envelope case, a robust dynamo results, unbinding the
envelope under a broad range of conditions. Two qualitatively different types
of explosion may arise: (i) magnetically dominated, possibly resulting in

are evolutionarily young objects, powered by the accretion of gas onto central
black holes that are lower in mass than those found in typical broad-line
Seyferts. We explore this hypothesis through the analysis of high-spatial
resolution, near-IR imaging data for a sample of 11 NLS1s. By employing the
correlation between black-hole mass and host galaxy bulge luminosity, we
determine the mean black-hole mass for our sample to be, in solar units, <(log
M_BH)> = 7.9. Using the correlation between the size of the broad-line region
and the monochromatic continuum luminosity, we obtain black-hole mass estimates
under the assumption that the emission-line gas is in virial equilibrium. The
mean black-hole mass derived from this relation is <(log M_BH)> = 6.4. We
explore possible causes for this discrepancy and the ramifications for our
understanding of the role played by NLS1s in AGN evolution. Because numerical
simulations constrain the start of the AGN duty cycle to a time shortly after a
significant gravitational interaction, we examine the morphology and near-IR
bulge colors of the NLS1 sample for evidence of recent encounters. The mean
bulge color is found to be redder than that of both a matched sample of
non-active galaxies and published estimates for broad-line Seyferts. The source
of the unusual bulge colors may be an excess of flux, peaking at around 2.2
micron, that has been detected near the centers of some NLS1s such as Mrk 1239.
No evidence is found for light asymmetries or an extra stellar component that
would indicate NLS1s are young objects. Finally, we postulate that there may be
some interesting lines of circumstantial evidence suggesting that secular
processes may be relevant in NLS1s.

free path regime, instability occurs for small wavenumbers when (dP/dz)(dln
T/dz) > 0, which we refer to as the Balbus criterion. We refer to the
convective-type instability that results as the magnetothermal instability
(MTI). We use the equations of MHD with anisotropic electron heat conduction to
numerically simulate the linear growth and nonlinear saturation of the MTI in
plane-parallel atmospheres that are unstable according to the Balbus criterion.
The linear growth rates measured from the simulations are in excellent
agreement with the weak field dispersion relation. The addition of isotropic
conduction, e.g. radiation, or strong magnetic fields can damp the growth of
the MTI and affect the nonlinear regime. The instability saturates when the
atmosphere becomes isothermal as the source of free energy is exhausted. By
maintaining a fixed temperature difference between the top and bottom
boundaries of the simulation domain, sustained convective turbulence can be
driven. MTI-stable layers introduced by isotropic conduction are used to
prevent the formation of unresolved, thermal boundary layers. We find that the
largest component of the time-averaged heat flux is due to advective motions as
opposed to the actual thermal conduction itself. Finally, we explore the
implications of this instability for a variety of astrophysical systems, such
as neutron stars, the hot intracluster medium of galaxy clusters, and the
structure of radiatively inefficient accretion flows.

controversial debate. KPD 1930+2752 is one of the best SN Ia progenitor
candidates known today. The object is a double degenerate system consisting of
a subluminous B star (sdB) and a massive white dwarf (WD). Maxted et al. (2000)
conclude that the system mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar mass. This conclusion,
however, rests on the assumption that the sdB mass is 0.5 Mo. However, recent
binary population synthesis calculations suggest that the mass of an sdB star
may range from 0.3 Mo to more than 0.7 Mo. It is therefore important to measure
the mass of the sdB star simultaneously with that of the white dwarf. Since the
rotation of the sdB star is tidally locked to the orbit the inclination of the
system can be constrained if the sdB radius and the projected rotational
velocity can be measured with high precision. An analysis of the ellipsoidal
variations in the light curve allows to tighten the constraints derived from
spectroscopy. We derive the mass-radius relation for the sdB star from a
quantitative spectral analysis of 150 low-resolution spectra. The projected
rotational velocity is determined for the first time from 200 high-resolution
spectra. In addition a reanalysis of the published light curve is performed.
The atmospheric and orbital parameters are measured with unprecedented
accuracy. In particular the projected rotational velocity is determined. A
neutron star companion can be ruled out and the mass of the sdB is limited
between 0.45 Mo and 0.52 Mo. The total mass of the system ranges from 1.36 Mo
to 1.48 Mo and hence is likely to exceed the Chandrasekhar mass. So KPD
1930+2752 qualifies as an excellent double degenerate supernova Ia progenitor
candidate.

atmospheric gas and the lifetime of a planet against the evaporation process.
In the energy diagram, we find an evaporation-forbidden region in which a
gaseous planet would evaporate in less than 5 billion years. With their
observed characteristics, all extrasolar planets are found outside this
evaporation-forbidden region. The escape rates are estimated to be in the range
10^5 g/s to 10^{12} g/s, with few cases above 10^{11} g/s. The estimated escape

galaxies in the Universe. These galaxies may still contain baryons, but no

of surveys for such objects, and simulations that do/do not predict their
existence, are controversial. In this paper we use an analytical model of
galaxy formation, consistent with CDM, to firstly show that dark galaxies are
certainly a prediction of the model. Secondly, we show that objects like
VIRGOHI21, a dark galaxy candidate recently discovered by us, while rare are
predicted by the model. Thirdly, we show that previous 'blind' HI surveys have
placed few constraints on the existence of dark galaxies. This is because they
have either lacked the sensitivity and/or velocity resolution or have not had
the required detailed optical follow up. We look forward to new 21cm blind
surveys (ALFALFA and AGES) using the Arecibo multi-beam instrument which should
find large numbers of dark galaxies if they exist.

magnetic features in the solar photosphere and its variation with the solar
magnetic activity cycle. Here we extend those studies by examining the fractal
geometry of bright magnetic features at higher atmospheric levels, specifically
in the solar chromosphere. We analyze structures identified in CaIIK images
obtained with the Precision Solar Photometric Telescopes (PSPTs) at
Osservatorio Astronomico di Roma (OAR) and Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO).
Fractal dimension estimates depend on the estimator employed, the quality of
the images, and the structure identification techniques used. We examine both
real and simulated data and employ two different perimeter-area estimators in
order to understand the sensitivity of the deduced fractal properties to
pixelization and image quality. The fractal dimension of bright 'magnetic'
features in CaIIK images ranges between values of 1.2 and 1.7 for small and
large structures respectively. This size dependency largely reflects the
importance of image pixelization in the measurement of small objects. The
fractal dimension of chromospheric features does not show any clear systematic
variation with time over the period examined, the descending phase of solar
cycle 23. These conclusions, and the analysis of both real and synthetic images
on which they are based, are important in the interpretation of previously
reported results.

superclusters is $\delta \approx 7.5$, in poor superclusters $\delta \approx
6.0$. Rich superclusters contain high density cores with densities $\delta >
10$ while in poor superclusters such high density cores are absent. The
properties of galaxies in rich and poor superclusters and in the field are
different: the fraction of early type, passive galaxies in rich superclusters
is slightly larger than in poor superclusters, and is the smallest among the
field galaxies. Most importantly, in high density cores of rich superclusters
($\delta > 10$) there is an excess of early type, passive galaxies in groups

The main galaxies of superclusters have a rather limited range of absolute

material failure an interesting playfield for the application of statistical
mechanics. The cornerstone in this respect has been lattice models of the
fracture in which a network of elastic beams, bonds or electrical fuses with
random failure thresholds are subject to an increasing external load. These
models describe on a qualitative level the failure processes of real, brittle
or quasi-brittle materials. This has been particularly important in solving the
classical engineering problems of material strength: the size dependence of
maximum stress and its sample to sample statistical fluctuations. At the same
time, lattice models pose many new fundamental questions in statistical
physics, such as the relation between fracture and phase transitions.
Experimental results point out to the existence of an intriguing crackling
noise in the acoustic emission and of self-affine fractals in the crack surface
morphology. Recent advances in computer power have enabled considerable
progress in the understanding of such models. Among these partly still
controversial issues, are the scaling and size effects in material strength and
accumulated damage, the statistics of avalanches or bursts of microfailures,
and the morphology of the crack surface. Here we present an overview of the
results obtained with lattice models for fracture, highlighting the relations
with statistical physics theories and more conventional fracture mechanics
approaches.

a role analogously to the usual $\Phi$-functional studied by Baym (G.Baym,

crosscutting concerns in existing systems. This paper proposes an aspect mining
approach based on determining methods that are called from many different
places, and hence have a high fan-in, which can be seen as a symptom of
crosscutting functionality. The approach is semi-automatic, and consists of
three steps: metric calculation, method filtering, and call site analysis.
Carrying out these steps is an interactive process supported by an Eclipse
plug-in called FINT. Fan-in analysis has been applied to three open source Java
systems, totaling around 200,000 lines of code. The most interesting concerns
identified are discussed in detail, which includes several concerns not
previously discussed in the aspect-oriented literature. The results show that a
significant number of crosscutting concerns can be recognized using fan-in
analysis, and each of the three steps can be supported by tools.

codes are known to be subject to decoding failures due to so-called
pseudo-codewords. These failures can cause the large signal-to-noise ratio
performance of message-passing iterative decoding to be worse than that
predicted by the maximum-likelihood decoding union bound. In this paper we
address the pseudo-codeword problem from the convolutional-code perspective. In
particular, we compare the performance of LDPC convolutional codes with that of
their ``wrapped'' quasi-cyclic block versions and we show that the minimum
pseudo-weight of an LDPC convolutional code is at least as large as the minimum
pseudo-weight of an underlying quasi-cyclic code. This result, which parallels
a well-known relationship between the minimum Hamming weight of convolutional
codes and the minimum Hamming weight of their quasi-cyclic counterparts, is due
to the fact that every pseudo-codeword in the convolutional code induces a
pseudo-codeword in the block code with pseudo-weight no larger than that of the
convolutional code's pseudo-codeword. This difference in the weight spectra
leads to improved performance at low-to-moderate signal-to-noise ratios for the
convolutional code, a conclusion supported by simulation results.

that there is not an anomaly of diffeomorphism invariance. By taking into

the Planck scale. In one model, in particular, an ultraviolet cutoff was
implemented into QFT through generalized uncertainty relations which have been
motivated from general quantum gravity arguments and from string theory. Here,
we improve upon prior numerical and semi-analytical results by presenting the
exact mode solutions for both de Sitter and power-law inflation in this model.
This provides an explicit map from the modes' initial conditions, which are
presumably set by quantum gravity, to the modes' amplitudes at horizon crossing
and thus to the inflationary predictions for the CMB. The solutions' particular
behaviour close to the cutoff scale suggests unexpected possibilities for how
the degrees of freedom of QFT emerge from the Planck scale.

provide a review of symmetries in physics and then move on to discuss the quark

lattice QCD and some of the associated problems. I discuss gauge fields on the
lattice along with free lattice fermions. I follow this with a definition of
the lattice QCD action and discuss how to reproduce the correct continuum
physics. I include a discussion of the basic numerical techniques employed in
lattice simulations. I review methods for putting particles onto the lattice
and describe how to fit the resulting data. The symmetries of the QCD
Lagrangian are reviewed along with various forms of symmetry breaking in
physics, the PCAC relation, the Goldberger-Treiman relation and the spontaneous
breakdown of the axial symmetry. I move on to discuss sigma models and finally
arrive at a basic chiral perturbation theory. I present research completed with
my supervisor C. Allton and collaborators A.W. Thomas, D.B. Leinweber and R.
Young in the final three chapters. This work involves making lattice
predictions for the Hadronic mass spectrum using extrapolation techniques based
on the predictions of chiral perturbation theory which have been developed by

the use of a tilted real-time contour leads to converging results in general.
All fixed point solutions are shown to fulfil the infinite hierarchy of
Dyson-Schwinger identities, however, they are not unique without further
constraints. For the nonabelian gauge theory the thermal equilibrium fixed
point is only approached at intermediate Langevin-times. It becomes more stable
if the complex time path is deformed towards Euclidean space-time. We analyze
this behavior further using the real-time evolution of a quantum anharmonic

the Kullback-Leibler divergence to a reference $Q$ (or maximization of Shannon
$Q$-entropy), subject to a constraint that implicates a second reference
distribution $P\_{1}$ and tunes the new equilibrium. In this setting, the
equilibrium distribution is the generalized escort distribution associated to
$P\_{1}$ and $Q$. The account of an additional constraint, an observable given
by a statistical mean, leads to the maximization of R\'{e}nyi/Tsallis
$Q$-entropy subject to that constraint. Two natural scenarii for this
observation constraint are considered, and the classical and generalized
constraint of nonextensive statistics are recovered. The solutions to the
maximization of R\'{e}nyi $Q$-entropy subject to the two types of constraints
are derived. These optimum distributions, that are Levy-like distributions, are
self-referential. We then propose two `alternate' (but effectively computable)
dual functions, whose maximizations enable to identify the optimum parameters.
Finally, a duality between solutions and the underlying Legendre structure are
presented.

of holomorphic functions. As is well known there are certain advantages to be

the standard form ${\mathfrak W}_m$. We conjecture that the functions
${\mathfrak W}^\star_m$ satisfy a set of properties which actually will
characterize a non-commutative QFT in terms of tempered ultrahyperfunctions. In
order to support this conjecture, we prove for this setting the validity of
some important theorems, of which the CPT theorem and the theorem on the
Spin-Statistics connection are the best known. We assume the validity of these

The later are the analog of p-divisible groups. We investigate which pure

give examples for pure t-motives which are not semisimple. Over finite fields
the semisimplicity is equivalent to the semisimplicity of the endomorphism
algebra, but also this fails over infinite fields. Still over finite fields we
study the endomorphism rings of pure t-motives and obtain answers which are
similar to Tate's famous results for abelian varieties. Finally we clarify the

theory in the sense that a similar perturbative series as in 3-dimension, which
is computed via configuration space integral, yields an invariant of higher
dimensional knots (Bott-Cattaneo-Rossi invariant), which is constructed by Bott
for degree 2 and by Cattaneo-Rossi for higher degrees. However, its feature is
yet unknown. In this paper we restrict the study to long ribbon n-knots and
characterize the Bott-Cattaneo-Rossi invariant as a finite type invariant of
long ribbon n-knots in [HKS]. As a consequence, we obtain a non-trivial
description of the Bott-Cattaneo-Rossi invariant in terms of the Alexander
polynomial.
  The results for higher codimension knots are also given. In those cases
similar differential forms to define Bott-Cattaneo-Rossi invariant yields
infinitely many cohomology classes of Emb(R^n, R^m) if m,n>= 3 odd and m>n+2.
We observe that half of these classes are non-trivial, along a line similar to
Cattaneo-CottaRamusino-Longoni [CCL].

calculation for beta-decay and electron-capture rates in heavy, deformed nuclei
at finite temperatures. Our first example indicates that, while experimentally
known Gamow-Teller transition rates from the ground state of the parent nucleus
are reproduced, stronger transitions from some low-lying excited states are
predicted to occur, which may considerably enhance the total decay rates once
these nuclei are exposed to hot stellar environments.

several kinds of chemical groups. While protein phosphorylation, i.e. the
attachment of a phosphoryl (PO$_3^-$) group, is the most studied form of
protein modification, and is known to regulate the functions of many proteins,
protein behavior can also be modified by nitrosylation, acetylation,
methylation, etc. A protein can have multiple modification sites, and display
some form of transition only when enough sites are modified. In a previous
paper we have modeled the generic equilibrium properties of multisite protein
modification (R.Chignola, C. Dalla Pellegrina, A. Del Fabbro, E.Milotti,
Physica A {\bf 371}, 463 (2006)) and we have shown that it can account both for
sharp, robust thresholds and for information transfer between processes with
widely separated timescales. Here we use the same concepts to expand that
analysis starting from a dynamical description of multisite modification: we
give analytical results for the basic dynamics and numerical results in an
example where the modification chain is cascaded with a Michaelis-Menten step.
We modify the dynamics and analyze an example with realistic
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation steps, and give numerical evidence of the
independence of the allosteric effect from the details of the
attachment-detachment processes. We conclude that multisite protein
modification is dynamically equivalent to the classic allosteric effect.

strength of mutation and selection to be sufficiently small. The resulting
dynamical system is a flow of measures on the space of loci. Each such measure
is the intensity measure of a Poisson random measure on the space of loci: the
points of a realization of the random measure record the set of loci at which
the genotype of a uniformly chosen individual differs from a reference wild
type due to an accumulation of ancestral mutations. Our motivation for working
in such a general setting is to provide a basis for understanding
mutation-driven changes in age-specific demographic schedules that arise from
the complex interaction of many genes, and hence to develop a framework for
understanding the evolution of aging.

conditions for the existence and stability of equilibrium states, and prove
that our continuous-time dynamical system is the limit of a sequence of

type system driven by laser fields that form a closed interaction loop is
studied. Due to the finite frequency width of the probe pulse, a
time-independent analysis relying on the multiphoton resonance assumption is
insufficient. Thus we apply a Floquet decomposition of the equations of motion
to solve the time-dependent problem beyond the multiphoton resonance condition.
We find that the various Floquet components can be interpreted in terms of
different scattering processes, and that the medium response oscillating in
phase with the probe field in general is not phase-dependent. The phase
dependence arises from a scattering of the coupling fields into the probe field
mode at a frequency which in general differs from the probe field frequency. We
thus conclude that in particular for short pulses with a large frequency width,
inducing a closed loop interaction contour may not be advantageous, since
otherwise the phase-dependent medium response may lead to a distortion of the
pulse shape. Finally, using our time-dependent analysis, we demonstrate that
both the closed-loop and the non-closed loop configuration allow for sub- and
superluminal light propagation with small absorption or even gain. Further, we
identify one of the coupling field Rabi frequencies as a control parameter that
allows to conveniently switch between sub- and superluminal light propagation.

perform joint measurements on the pairs. In this situation the proposed
one-party-QECC can improve error correction by allowing a higher tolerated

power and slightly diverging laser beam optimizes the transfer between the two
traps when its frequency is red-detuned from the atomic transition. This
pushing laser extracts a continuous beam of slow and cold atoms out of the
first MOT and also provides a guiding to the second one through the dipolar
force. In order to optimize the transfer efficiency, the dependence of the
atomic flux on the pushing laser parameters (power, detuning, divergence and
waist) is investigated. The atomic flux is found to be proportional to the
first MOT loading rate. Experimentally, the transfer efficiency reaches 70%,
corresponding to a transfer rate up to 2.7x10^8 atoms/s with a final velocity
of 5.5 m/s. We present a simple analysis of the atomic motion inside the
pushing-guiding laser, in good agreement with the experimental data.

properties of distinct noncomplementary parts of discrete and continuous
Bosonic systems in ground and thermal states. The Fermionic case, however, has
yet to be expressly addressed. In this paper we investigate the entanglement
between a pair of far-apart regions of the 3+1 dimensional massless Dirac
vacuum via a previously introduced distillation protocol [B. Reznik et al.,
Phys. Rev. A 71, 042104 (2005)]. We show that entanglement persists over
arbitrary distances, and that as a function of L/R, where L is the distance
between the regions and R is their typical scale, it decays no faster than
exp(-(L/R)^2). We discuss the similarities and differences with analogous
results obtained for the massless Klein-Gordon vacuum.
