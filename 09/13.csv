  literature. Reference removed as required by Journal",,"10.1086/518225",,"astro-ph",,"  Black hole masses are tightly correlated with the stellar velocity
dispersions of the bulges which surround them, and slightly less-well
correlated with the bulge luminosity. It is common to use these correlations to
estimate the expected abundance of massive black holes. This is usually done by
starting from an observed distribution of velocity dispersions or luminosities
and then changing variables. This procedure neglects the fact that there is
intrinsic scatter in these black hole mass--observable correlations. Accounting
for this scatter results in estimates of black hole abundances which are larger
by almost an order of magnitude at masses >10^9 M_sun. Including this scatter
is particularly important for models which seek to infer quasar lifetimes and
duty cycles from the local black hole mass function. However, even when scatter
has been accounted for, the M_bh-sigma relation predicts fewer massive black
holes than does the M_bh-L relation. This is because the sigma-L relation in
the black hole samples currently available is inconsistent with that in the
SDSS sample from which the distributions of L or sigma are based: the black
hole samples have smaller L for a given sigma, or larger sigma for a given L.
The sigma-L relation in the black hole samples is similarly discrepant with
that in other samples of nearby early-type galaxies. This suggests that current
black hole samples are biased: if this is a selection rather than physical
effect, then the M_bh-sigma and M_bh-L relations currently in the literature
are also biased from their true values.

correlation between black hole mass and another more easily measured observable
such as the velocity dispersion or luminosity of the surrounding bulge. The
correlation is used to transform the distribution of the observable into an
estimate of the distribution of black hole masses. However, different
observables provide different estimates: the Mbh-sigma relation predicts fewer
massive black holes than does the Mbh-L relation. This is because the sigma-L
relation in black hole samples currently available is inconsistent with that in
the SDSS sample, from which the distributions of L or sigma are based: the
black hole samples have smaller L for a given sigma or have larger sigma for a
given L. This is true whether L is estimated in the optical or in the NIR. If
this is a selection rather than physical effect, then the Mbh-sigma and Mbh-L
relations currently in the literature are also biased from their true values.
We provide a framework for describing the effect of this bias. We then combine
it with a model of the bias to make an estimate of the true intrinsic
relations. While we do not claim to have understood the source of the bias, our
simple model is able to reproduce the observed trends. If we have correctly
modeled the selection effect, then our analysis suggests that the bias in the
<Mbh|sigma> relation is likely to be small, whereas the <Mbh|L> relation is
biased towards predicting more massive black holes for a given luminosity. In
addition, it is likely that the Mbh-L relation is entirely a consequence of
more fundamental relations between Mbh and sigma, and between sigma and L. The
intrinsic relation we find suggests that at fixed luminosity, older galaxies
tend to host more massive black holes.

correlation estimated in local samples (< 100 Mpc) differs from that measured
more recently in the SDSS. This is true even when systematics in the SDSS
photometric and spectroscopic parameters have been accounted-for. We show that
this is also true for the ENEAR sample if galaxy luminosities are estimated
using distances which have been corrected for peculiar motions. We then show
that, because the estimate of the `true' distance is derived from a correlation
with velocity dispersion, in this case the D_n-sigma relation, using it in the
sigma-L relation leads to an artificially tight relation with a biased slope.
Making no correction for peculiar velocities results in a sigma-L relation
which is very similar to that of the SDSS, although with larger scatter. We
also measure the sigma-L correlation in a mock ENEAR catalog, in which the
underlying galaxy sample has the same sigma-L correlation as seen in the SDSS.
The mock catalog produces the same D_n-sigma relation as the data, the same
biased slope when D_n-sigma distances are used to estimate luminosities, and
good agreement with the input sigma-L relation when redshift is used as the
distance indicator. This provides further evidence that the true sigma-L
relation of ENEAR galaxies is indeed very similar to that of SDSS early-types.
Our results suggest that local sigma-L relations which are based on Fundamental
Plane distances should also be re-evaluated. Our findings also have important
implications for black hole demographics; the best direct estimates of the
masses of supermassive black holes come from local galaxies, so estimates of
the black hole mass function are more safely made by working with the Mbh-sigma
correlation than with Mbh-L.

of determining the surface density profiles. Gas parcels (baryons) fall through
the potentials of dark matter halos on nearly ballistic, zero energy orbits and
collect in a rotating disk. The dark matter halos have a nearly universal form,
as determined previously through numerical simulations. The calculation is
first carried out for a variety of pre-collapse mass distributions and rotation
profiles, including polytropic spheres in hydrostatic equilibrium with the halo
potential. The resulting disk surface density profiles have nearly power-law
forms, with well-defined edges. This idealized scenario is generalized to
include non-spherical starting states and multiple accretion events (due to gas
being added to the halo via merger events). This latter complication is
explored in detail and considers a log-normal distribution for the angular
momenta of the pre-collapse states. If this distribution is wide, then the
composite surface density approaches a universal power-law form, independent of
the shape of the constituent profiles. When the angular momentum distribution
has an intermediate width, the composite surface density attains a nearly
exponential form, roughly consistent with profiles of observed galaxies.

with the NGC 346 cluster. It includes a rich component of low mass pre-main
sequence stars mainly concentrated in a number of sub-clusters, spatially co-
located with CO clumps previously detected by Rubio et al. (2000). Within our
analysis uncertainties, these sub-clusters appear coeval with each other. The
most massive stars appear concentrated in the central sub-clusters, indicating

micron sized grains in an optically thin disk. Disk models, which
simultaneously fit the surface brightness and polarization, show that the inner
disk (< 40-50 AU) is depleted of micron-sized dust by a factor of more than
300, which means that the disk is collision dominated. The grains have high
maximum linear polarization and strong forward scattering. Spherical grains
composed of conventional materials cannot reproduce these optical properties. A
Mie/Maxwell-Garnett analysis implicates highly porous (91-94%) particles. In
the inner Solar System, porous particles form in cometary dust, where the
sublimation of ices leaves a ""bird's nest"" of refractory organic and silicate
material. In AU Mic, the grain porosity may be primordial, because the dust

span the range of values implied by laboratory studies of particle coagulation

arises from the combined effects of the galaxy stellar mass function, the
early-type fraction, and the dependence of star formation history on mass and
environment. This approach complements the use of the early- to late-type host
galaxy ratio, with the added benefit that the star formation histories of
early-type galaxies are simpler than those of late-type galaxies, and any

the overwhelming brightness of the host star. Current instruments employing the
combination of adaptive optics (AO) and coronagraphy can typically detect
objects within 2'' of the star that are 10^{4-5} times fainter. Correlated
speckle noise is one of the biggest obstacles limiting such high-contrast
imaging. We have obtained a series of 284 8 s, AO-corrected, coronagraphically
occulted H-band images of the star Vega at the 3.63 m AEOS telescope located on
Haleakala, Hawaii. This dataset is unique for studying the temporal behavior of
speckle noise, and represents the first time such a study on highly corrected
_coronagraphic_ AO images has been carried out in a quantitative way. We find
the speckle pattern to be highly stable in both position and time in our data.
This is due to the fact that the AO system corrects disturbances to the stellar
wave front at the level where the instrumental wave front errors dominate.
Because of this, we find that our detection limit is not significantly improved
simply with increased exposure time alone. However, we are able to improve our
dynamic range by 1.5-2 magnitudes through subtraction of static/quasi-static
speckles in two rotating frames: the telescope pupil frame and the deformable
mirror frame. Furthermore, from our data, we are able to constrain the mass of

Seljak's formalism, we show this can lead to a smoothing of the CMB
power-spectrum which may be able to move the first acoustic peak to smaller l,
if the mass clustering amplitude is high enough. Evidence for such a high
amplitude comes from the QSO magnification results of Myers et al (2003, 2005)
who suggest that foreground galaxy groups may be more massive than expected,
implying that Omega_m ~ 1 and strong galaxy anti-bias. We then show that an
inflationary model with neither CDM nor a cosmological constant and that
predicts a primordial first peak at l=330 may fit the first acoustic peak of
the WMAP data. This fit may be regarded as somewhat contrived since it also
requires high redshift reionisation at the upper limit of what is allowed by
the WMAP results. But given the finely-tuned nature of the standard LCDM model,
the contrivance may be small in comparison and certainly the effect of lensing
and other foregrounds may still have a considerable influence on the
cosmological interpretation of the CMB.

pseudo-bulges. In two of the galaxies the $B/T$ flux ratio is as small as in
typical Sc-type spirals. This might be the hitherto undiscovered link in the

CMB analysis. The Mexican Hat Wavelet Family (MHWF), which has been proved very
useful for the detection of extragalactic point sources, is applied here to the
study of non-Gaussianity due to point sources in CMB maps. We carry out
simulations of CMB maps with the characteristics of the forthcoming Planck

skewness and kurtosis of simulated maps with and without point sources, we are
able to detect clearly the non-Gaussian signal due to point sources for flux

members of the MHWF perform better in this respect than the Mexican Hat Wavelet
(MHW1) and much better than the Daubechies 4 wavelet. We have also estimated
the third order, $K_3$, and fourth order, $K_4$, cumulants produced by point
sources at these Planck channels by means of a fit with the MHWF. The average
relative errors with respect to the real values are below 12% for fluxes down
to 0.6 Jy (70 GHz) and 0.4 Jy (100 GHz). The values of these cumulants allow us
to distinguish between different source counts models.

Therefore we perform convection calculations in the range Co = 0...10 and
interpret the value of Co realised in the calculation to represent a depth in
the solar CZ. In order to study the dependence on rotation, we compute the
mixing length parameters alpha_T and alpha_u relating the temperature and
velocity fluctuations, respectively, to the mean thermal stratification. We
find that the mixing length parameters for the rapid rotation case,
corresponding to the base of the solar CZ, are 3-5 times smaller than in the
nonrotating case. Introducing such depth-dependent alpha into a solar structure
model employing a non-local mixing length formalism results in overshooting
which is approximately proportional to alpha at the base of the CZ. Although
overshooting is reduced due to the reduced alpha, a discrepancy with
helioseismology remains due to the steep transition to the radiative
temperature gradient. In comparison to the mixing length models the transition
at the base of the CZ is much gentler in the 3D models. It was suggested
recently (Rempel 2004) that this discrepancy is due to the significantly larger
(up to seven orders of magnitude) input energy flux in the 3D models in
comparison to the Sun and solar models, and that the 3D calculations should be
able to approach the mixing length regime if the input energy flux is decreased
by a moderate amount. We present results from local convection calculations
which support this conjecture.

evaluated by combining estimates (often indirect) of the BLR radius and of the
FWHM of the broad lines, under the assumption that the BLR clouds are in
Keplerian motion around the BH. Such an evaluation depends on the geometry of
the BLR. There are two major options for the BLR configuration: spherically
symmetric or ``flattened''. In the latter case the inclination to the line of
sight becomes a relevant parameter. This paper is devoted to evaluate the bias
on the estimate of the Eddington ratio when a spherical geometry is assumed
(more generally when inclination effects are ignored), while the actual
configuration is ``flattened'', as some evidence suggests. This is done as a
function of luminosity and redshift, on the basis of recent results which show
the existence of a correlation between the fraction of obscured AGN and these
two parameters up to at least z=2.5. The assumed BLR velocity field is akin to
the ``generalized thick disk'' proposed by Collin et al. (2006). Assuming an
isotropic orientation in the sky, the mean value of the bias is calculated as a
function of luminosity and redshift. It is demonstrated that, on average, the
Eddington ratio obtained assuming a spherical geometry is underestimated for
high luminosities, and overestimated for low luminosities. This bias converges
for all luminosities at z about 2.7, while nothing can be said on this bias at
larger redshifts due to the lack of data. The effects of the bias, averaged
over the luminosity function of broad line AGN, have been calculated. The
results imply that the bias associated with the a-sphericity of the BLR make
even worse the discrepancy between the observations and the predictions of
evolutionary models.

the recently examined field VLM population characteristics. Despite the fact
that this survey was dedicated to the search for faint brown dwarf and
planetary mass companions, all planetary mass candidates were background

over the period 10^7 < t <10^9 yr. This decline is essentially identical to
that observed previously for more massive clusters in the merging Antennae
galaxies, and also for lower-mass embedded clusters in the solar neighborhood.
The SMC cluster age distribution therefore provides additional evidence for the
rapid disruption of star clusters (``infant mortality''). These disrupted
clusters deliver their stars to the general field population, implying that the
field star age distribution, dN_{fld star}/dt, should have an inverse relation
to dN_{cluster}/dt if most stars form initially in clusters. We make specific
predictions for dN_{fldstar}/dt based on our cluster disruption models, and
compare them with current data available for stars in the SMC. While these data
do not extend to sufficiently young ages for a definitive test, they are
consistent with a scenario wherein most SMC stars formed in clusters. Future
analyses of dN_{fldstar}/dt that extend down to ages of approximately few
million years are needed to verify the age relationship between stars residing

of skewness coefficient (h3) and the rotational support (V/sigma), as well as
the anticorrelation between h3 and V, may be reproduced through collisionless
mergers. Previous attempts using N-body simulations failed to reach V/sigma ~
1-2 and corresponding high h3 values, which suggested that gas dynamics and
ensuing star formation might be needed in order to explain the skewness
properties of ellipticals through mergers. Here we show that high V/sigma and
high h3 are reproduced in collisionless spiral-spiral mergers whenever a
central bulge allows the discs to retain some of their original angular
momentum during the merger. We also show that elliptical-elliptical mergers,
unless merging from a high-angular momentum orbit, reproduce the strong
skewness observed in non-rotating, giant, boxy ellipticals. The behaviour of
the h3 coefficient therefore associates rapidly-rotating disky ellipticals to
disc-disc mergers, and associates boxy, slowly-rotating giant ellipticals to
elliptical-elliptical mergers, a framework generally consistent with the
expectations of hierarchical galaxy formation.

measured object. When a linear amplifier is used to continuously monitor the
position of an object, the Heisenberg uncertainty relationship requires that
the object be driven by force impulses, called back-action. Here we measure the
back-action of a superconducting single-electron transistor (SSET) on a
radiofrequency nanomechanical resonator. The conductance of the SSET, which is
capacitively coupled to the resonator, provides a sensitive probe of the
latter's position;back-action effects manifest themselves as an effective
thermal bath, the properties of which depend sensitively on SSET bias
conditions. Surprisingly, when the SSET is biased near a transport resonance,
we observe cooling of the nanomechanical mode from 550mK to 300mK-- an effect
that is analogous to laser cooling in atomic physics. Our measurements have
implications for nanomechanical readout of quantum information devices and the
limits of ultrasensitive force microscopy (such as single-nuclear-spin magnetic
resonance force microscopy). Furthermore, we anticipate the use of these
backaction effects to prepare ultracold and quantum states of mechanical
structures, which would not be accessible with existing technology.

the nodes are deployed on a two-dimensional (2D) plane. However, this 2D
assumption is not valid in underwater, atmospheric, or space communications. In
fact, recent interest in underwater acoustic ad hoc and sensor networks hints
at the need to understand how to design networks in 3D. Unfortunately, the
design of 3D networks is surprisingly more difficult than the design of 2D
networks. For example, proofs of Kelvin's conjecture and Kepler's conjecture
required centuries of research to achieve breakthroughs, whereas their 2D
counterparts are trivial to solve. In this paper, we consider the coverage and
connectivity issues of 3D networks, where the goal is to find a node placement
strategy with 100% sensing coverage of a 3D space, while minimizing the number
of nodes required for surveillance. Our results indicate that the use of the
Voronoi tessellation of 3D space to create truncated octahedral cells results
in the best strategy. In this truncated octahedron placement strategy, the
transmission range must be at least 1.7889 times the sensing range in order to
maintain connectivity among nodes. If the transmission range is between 1.4142
and 1.7889 times the sensing range, then a hexagonal prism placement strategy
or a rhombic dodecahedron placement strategy should be used. Although the
required number of nodes in the hexagonal prism and the rhombic dodecahedron
placement strategies is the same, this number is 43.25% higher than the number
of nodes required by the truncated octahedron placement strategy. We verify by
simulation that our placement strategies indeed guarantee ubiquitous coverage.
We believe that our approach and our results presented in this paper could be
used for extending the processes of 2D network design to 3D networks.

about complexity, algorithms, heuristics and threshold phenomena. Recent work
on heuristics, and the satisfiability threshold has centered around the
structure and connectivity of the solution space. Motivated by this work, we
study structural and connectivity-related properties of the space of solutions
of Boolean satisfiability problems and establish various dichotomies in
Schaefer's framework.
  On the structural side, we obtain dichotomies for the kinds of subgraphs of
the hypercube that can be induced by the solutions of Boolean formulas, as well
as for the diameter of the connected components of the solution space. On the
computational side, we establish dichotomy theorems for the complexity of the
connectivity and st-connectivity questions for the graph of solutions of
Boolean formulas. Our results assert that the intractable side of the
computational dichotomies is PSPACE-complete, while the tractable side - which
includes but is not limited to all problems with polynomial time algorithms for
satisfiability - is in P for the st-connectivity question, and in coNP for the
connectivity question. The diameter of components can be exponential for the
PSPACE-complete cases, whereas in all other cases it is linear; thus, small
diameter and tractability of the connectivity problems are remarkably aligned.
The crux of our results is an expressibility theorem showing that in the
tractable cases, the subgraphs induced by the solution space possess certain
good structural properties, whereas in the intractable cases, the subgraphs can
be arbitrary.

taking into account the point of view of an observer in the interior of the
event horizon, one verifies that new conceptual difficulties arise. In this
work, besides providing a very brief pedagogical review, we further analyze the
interior Schwarzschild black hole solution. Firstly, by deducing the interior
metric by considering time-dependent metric coefficients, the interior region
is analyzed without the prejudices inherited from the exterior geometry. We
also pay close attention to several respective cosmological interpretations,
and briefly address some of the difficulties associated to spacetime
singularities. Secondly, we deduce the conserved quantities of null and
timelike geodesics, and discuss several particular cases in some detail.
Thirdly, we examine the Eddington-Finkelstein and Kruskal coordinates directly
from the interior solution. In concluding, it is important to emphasize that
the interior structure of realistic black holes has not been satisfactorily
determined, and is still open to considerable debate.

`alternating orthogonal products'. This leads to alternating decompositions of
the free product itself, with the star product or the comb product followed by
orthogonal products. These decompositions correspond to the recently studied
decompositions of the free additive convolution of probability measures in

convolutions. We also introduce a new type of `quantum decomposition' of the

taken with respect to a set of vertices instead of a single vertex. We show
that even in the case of widely studied graphs this yields new and more

faithful semifinite trace $\t$, and let $E$ be an r.i. space on $(0, \8)$. Let
$E(\M)$ be the associated symmetric space of measurable operators. Then to any
bounded linear map $T$ from $E(\M)$ into a Hilbert space $\mathcal H$
corresponds a positive norm one functional $f\in E_{(2)}(\M)^*$ such that
$$\forall x\in E(\M)\quad \|T(x)\|^2\le K^2 \|T\|^2 f(x^*x+xx^*),$$ where

different RMF models the dynamical instabilities of uniform matters, with and

dominant contribution of the variation of matter composition and the role of

factor values q=1 and q=3 is studied in a reduced cylindrical model of a
tokamak plasma. We focus on cases where the resonant surfaces are a small
distance apart. Recent numerical studies have shown that in such configurations
high-m modes are strongly unstable. In this paper, it is first demonstrated
that linear DTM theory predicts the dominance of high-m DTMs. A semi-empirical
formula for estimating the poloidal mode number of the fastest growing mode,
m_peak, is obtained from the existing linear theory. Second, using nonlinear
simulations, it is shown that the presence of fast growing high-m modes leads
to a rapid turbulent collapse in an annular region, whereby small magnetic
island structures form. Furthermore, consideration is given to the evolution of
low-m modes, in particular the global m=1 internal kink, which can undergo
nonlinear driving through coupling to fast growing linear high-m DTMs. Factors
influencing the details of the dynamics are discussed. These results may be
relevant for the understanding of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) activity near
the minimum of q and may thus be of interest to studies concerned with
stability and confinement in advanced tokamaks.

temperature dependence of the free energy in D=3 nm, we show that this effect
is entropically driven. The potentials of mean force (PMFs) between two methane
molecules show that the solvent separated minimum in the bulk is completely
absent in confined water, independent of the droplet size since the solute
particles are primarily associated with the droplet surface. The tendency of
methanes with charges (Mq+ and Mq- with q+ = q- = 0.4e, where e is the
electronic charge) to be pinned at the surface depends dramatically on the size
of the water droplet. When D=4 nm, the ions prefer the interior whereas for D<4
nm the ions are localized at the surface, but with much less tendency than for
methanes. Increasing the ion charge to e makes the surface strongly
unfavorable. Reflecting the charge asymmetry of the water molecule, negative
ions have a stronger preference for the surface compared to positive ions of
the same charge magnitude. With increasing droplet size, the PMFs between Mq+

the surface becomes less unfavorable. The implications of our results for the

sensitivity. To reconstruct high-resolution images in 3D-PET, iterative
methods, such as OSEM, are superior to analytical reconstruction algorithms,
although their high computational cost is still a serious drawback. The higher
performance of modern computers could make iterative image reconstruction fast
enough to be viable, provided we are able to deal with the large number of
probability coefficients for the system response matrix in high-resolution PET
scanners, which is a difficult task that prevents the algorithms from reaching
peak computing performance. Considering all possible axial and in-plane
symmetries, as well as certain quasi-symmetries, we have been able to reduce
the memory requirements to store the system response matrix (SRM) well below 1
GB, which allows us to keep the whole response matrix of the system inside RAM
of ordinary industry-standard computers, so that the reconstruction algorithm
can achieve near peak performance. The elements of the SRM are stored as cubic
spline profiles and matched to voxel size during reconstruction. In this way,
the advantages of on-the-fly calculation and of fully stored SRM are combined.
The on-the-fly part of the calculation (matching the profile functions to voxel
size) of the SRM accounts for 10 to 30% of the reconstruction time, depending
on the number of voxels chosen. We tested our approach with real data from a
commercial small animal PET scanner. The results (image quality and
reconstruction time) show that the proposed technique is a feasible solution.

elastic turbulence, realized by the flow of a polymer solution between two
disks. The dynamics of the elastic stress are analogous to those of a small
scale fast dynamo in magnetohydrodynamics, and to those of the turbulent
advection of a passive scalar in the Batchelor regime. Both systems are
theoretically studied in literature, and this analogy is exploited to explain
the statistical properties, the flow structure, and the scaling observed
experimentally. Several features of elastic turbulence are confirmed
experimentally and presented in this paper: (i) saturation of the rms of the
vorticity and of velocity gradients in the bulk, leading to the saturation of
the elastic stress; (ii) large rms of the velocity gradients in the boundary
layer, linearly growth with Wi; (iii) skewed PDFs of the injected power, with
exponential tails, which indicate intermittency; PDF of the acceleration
exhibit well-pronounced exponential tails too; (iv) a new length scale, i.e the
thickness of the boundary layer, as measured from the profile of the rms of the
velocity gradient, is found to be relevant and much smaller than the vessel
size; (v) the scaling of the structure functions of the vorticity, velocity
gradients, and injected power is found to be the same as that of a passive
scalar advected by an elastic turbulent velocity field.

  transferred genes and reveals their involvement in operon formation","22 pages, 7 figures",,,,"q-bio.PE q-bio.BM",,"  The formation mechanism of operons remains controversial despite the proposal
of many models. Although acquisition of genes from other species, horizontal
gene transfer, is considered to occur, definitive concrete cases have been
unavailable. It is desirable to select horizontally transferred genes reliably
and examine their relationship to operons. We here developed a method to
identify candidates of horizontally transferred genes based on minimization of
gene cluster insertions/deletions. To select a benchmark set of positively
horizontally transferred genes against which the candidate set can be
appraised, we devised another procedure using intergenetic alignments.
Comparison with the benchmark set of horizontally transferred genes
demonstrated the absence of a significant number of false positives in the
candidates, showing that the method identifies horizontally transferred genes
with a high degree of confidence. Horizontally transferred genes constitute at
least 5.5% of the genes in Escherichia, Shigella, and Salmonella and ~46% of
which originate from other gamma-proteobacteria. Not only informational genes,
but also operational genes (those involved in housekeeping) are horizontally
transferred less frequently than expected. A gene-cluster analysis of
Escherichia coli K-12 operons revealed that horizontal transfer produced four
entire operons and expanded two operons, but deletion of intervening genes
accounts for the formation of no operons. We propose that operons generally
form by horizontal gene transfer. We further suggest that genes with related
essential functions tend to reside in conserved operons, while genes in
nonconserved operons generally confer slight advantage to the organisms and
frequently undergo horizontal transfer and decay.

phenomena. Having derived an accurate, size-consistent Hamiltonian for the
photonic field in the well-known Dicke model, we predict striking behavior of
the optical squeezing and photon statistics near the phase transition. The
corresponding dynamics resemble those of a degenerate parametric amplifier. Our
findings boost the motivation for exploring exotic quantum phase transition
phenomena in atom-cavity, nanostructure-cavity, and
nanostructure-photonic-band-gap systems.

double scaling limit: the size of the block is much larger then 1 but much
smaller then the length of the whole chain. The entropy of the block has an
asymptotic limit. We study this limiting entropy as a function of the
anisotropy and of the magnetic field. We identify its minima at product states
and its divergencies at the quantum phase transitions. We find that the curves
of constant entropy are ellipses and hyperbolas and that they all meet at one
point (essential critical point). Depending on the approach to the essential
critical point the entropy can take any value between 0 and infinity. In the
vicinity of this point small changes in the parameters cause large change of
the entropy.

protection and the braiding statistics of a non-Abelian topological state to
perform quantum computation. The enormous technological prospect of topological
quantum computation provides new motivation for experimentally observing a
topological state. Here we explicitly work out a realistic experimental scheme
to create and braid the Abelian topological excitations in the Kitaev model
built on a tunable robust system, a cold atom optical lattice. We also
demonstrate how to detect the key feature of these excitations, their braiding
statistics. Observation of this statistics would directly establish the
existence of anyons, quantum particles which are neither fermions nor bosons.
In addition to establishing topological matter, the experimental scheme we
develop here can also be adapted to a non-Abelian topological state, supported
by the same Kitaev model but in a different parameter regime, to eventually
build topologically protected quantum gates.
