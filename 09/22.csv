responsible for driving mixing in phase-space and the evolution to dynamical
equilibrium. We focus on mixing in energy and angular momentum and show that
mixing occurs in step-like fashion following pericenter passages of the halos.
This makes mixing during a merger unlike other well known mixing processes such
as phase mixing and chaotic mixing whose rates scale with local dynamical time.
We conclude that the mixing process that drives the system to equilibrium is
primarily a response to energy and angular momentum redistribution that occurs
due to impulsive tidal shocking and dynamical friction rather than a result of
chaotic mixing in a continuously changing potential. We also analyze the merger
remnants to determine the degree of mixing at various radii by monitoring
changes in radius, energy and angular momentum of particles. We confirm
previous findings that show that the majority of particles retain strong memory
of their original kinetic energies and angular momenta but do experience
changes in their potential energies owing to the tidal shocks they experience
during pericenter passages. Finally, we show that a significant fraction of
mass (~ 40%) in the merger remnant lies outside its formal virial radius and
that this matter is ejected roughly uniformly from all radii outside the inner
regions. This highlights the fact that mass, in its standard virial definition,
is not additive in mergers. We discuss the implications of these results for
our understanding of relaxation in collisionless dynamical systems.

objects. Many of them have recently experienced major mergers. Here we
investigate an equal mass merging event at z = ~0.6 resulting in a dark matter
haloe of ~2.2 times 10^{14} Msol/h at z=0. The merging process is covered by
270 outputs of a high resolution cosmological N-body simulation performed with
the ART (adaptive refinement tree) code. Some 2 Gyrs elapse between the first
peri-centre passage of the progenitor cores and their final coalescence. During
that phase the cores experience six peri-centre passages with minimal distances
declining from ~30 to ~2 kpc/h. The time intervals between the peri-centre
passages continuously decrease from 9 to 1 times 10^8 yrs. We follow the mean
density, the velocity dispersion and the entropy of the two progenitors within
a set of fixed proper radii (25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000 kpc/h). During the
peri-centre passages we find sharp peaks of the mean densities within these

addition to the intermixing of the merging haloes, the densities increase due
to contraction caused by the momentary deepening of the potential well. At the
end of the oscillatory relaxation phase the material originating from the less
concentrated of the two equal mass progenitors is deposited at larger radii and
shows a slightly more radially anisotropic velocity dispersion compared to the
material coming from the more concentrated progenitor. Every peri-centre
passage is accompanied by a substantial drop of the central potential well. We
briefly discuss the possibility that AGN outbursts are triggered by the
periodically changing potential.

There is consensus that SNe Ia are thermonuclear explosions that destroy
carbon-oxygen white dwarf stars that accrete matter from a companion star,
although the nature of this companion remains uncertain. SNe Ia are thought to
be reliable distance indicators because they have a standard amount of fuel and
a uniform trigger -- they are predicted to explode when the mass of the white
dwarf nears the Chandrasekhar mass -- 1.4 solar masses. Here we show that the
high redshift supernova SNLS-03D3bb has an exceptionally high luminosity and
low kinetic energy that both imply a super-Chandrasekhar mass progenitor.
Super-Chandrasekhar mass SNe Ia should preferentially occur in a young stellar
population, so this may provide an explanation for the observed trend that
overluminous SNe Ia only occur in young environments. Since this supernova does
not obey the relations that allow them to be calibrated as standard candles,
and since no counterparts have been found at low redshift, future cosmology
studies will have to consider contamination from such events.

  We investigate the ability of SuperWASP to detect these planets in the

find that the number of planets that transit with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10

a simulation of detection rates across 20 fields observed by one camera, we
predict that a total of 18.6 \pm 8.0 planets should be detectable from the

noise and increase the number of detectable planets is to boost the
signal-to-noise ratio, by increasing the number of observed transits for each
candidate transiting planet. This requires the observing baseline to be
increased, by spending a second observing season monitoring the same fields.

gas outflow, or 2) inefficient star formation at the lowest galaxy masses. Our
simulated galaxies reproduce the observed MZR in shape and normalization both
at z=0 and z=2. We find that baryon loss occurs due to UV heating before star
formation turns on in galaxies with M_baryon < 10^8 M_sun, but that some gas
loss due to supernovae induced winds is required to subsequently reproduce the
low effective chemical yield observed in low mass galaxies. Despite this, we
show that low star formation efficiencies, regulated by supernovae feedback,
are primarily responsible for the lower metallicities of low mass galaxies and
the overall M-Z trend. We find that the shape of the MZR is relatively constant
with redshift, but that its normalization increases with time. Simulations with
no energy feedback from supernovae overproduce metals at low galaxy masses by
rapidly transforming a large fraction of their gas into stars. Despite the fact
that our low mass galaxies have lost a majority of their baryons, they are
still the most gas rich objects in our simulations due to their low star
formation efficiencies.

lensing clusters. This last effect can potentially increase the number of
lensing clusters by an extra 50%. While the magnitude of these effects may be

transition. Because of the proximity of this line to the SiO maser line at
42.821 GHz (J=1-0 v=2),it was observable simultaneously in the ~43 GHz SiO
maser searches at Nobeyama. From the past data of SiO maser surveys of infrared
objects in the Galactic center, we created a map of emission distribution of
HOCO+ in the Sgr A molecular cloud as well as maps of the 29SiO J=1-0 v=0
thermal emission and H53alpha emission. The emission distribution of HOCO+ was
quite similar to the distribution of 29SiO emission. It suggests that the
enhancement of the HOCO+ abundance in the galactic center is induced by shock
activities which release the CO2 molecules frozen on grains into gases.

There is also an indication that the peak of C-star lifetime shifts to lower

SMC metallicities. The M-giant lifetimes also peak at 2 Msun in the LMC, with a

Similar to the case of S=1/2, this plateau state breaks the translational
symmetry of the Hamiltonian and realizes an up-up-down pattern in the spin
component parallel to the external field. Our study further shows that this
plateau exists both in the cases of an isotropic exchange and in the easy-axis

chains with isotropic interactions. We discuss the magnetic phase diagram of

performances regarding time-domain ensemble learning of both a linear model and
a nonlinear model. Analyzing in the framework of online learning using a
statistical mechanical method, we show the qualitatively different behaviors
between the two models. In a linear model, the dynamical behaviors of the
generalization error are monotonic. We analytically show that time-domain
ensemble learning is twice as effective as conventional ensemble learning.
Furthermore, the generalization error of a nonlinear model features
nonmonotonic dynamical behaviors when the learning rate is small. We
numerically show that the generalization performance can be improved remarkably
by using this phenomenon and the divergence of students in the time domain.

general problem taking into account the processing capability of the relays
(half-duplex or full-duplex), and the network geometry (clustered or
non-clustered). We first study the multiple antenna relay channel with a
full-duplex relay to understand the effect of increased degrees of freedom in
the direct link. We find DMT upper bounds and investigate the achievable
performance of decode-and-forward (DF), and compress-and-forward (CF)
protocols. Our results suggest that while DF is DMT optimal when all terminals
have one antenna each, it may not maintain its good performance when the
degrees of freedom in the direct link is increased, whereas CF continues to
perform optimally. We also study the multiple antenna relay channel with a
half-duplex relay. We show that the half-duplex DMT behavior can significantly
be different from the full-duplex case. We find that CF is DMT optimal for
half-duplex relaying as well, and is the first protocol known to achieve the
half-duplex relay DMT. We next study the multiple-access relay channel (MARC)
DMT. Finally, we investigate a system with a single source-destination pair and
multiple relays, each node with a single antenna, and show that even under the
idealistic assumption of full-duplex relays and a clustered network, this
virtual multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system can never fully mimic a real
MIMO DMT. For cooperative systems with multiple sources and multiple
destinations the same limitation remains to be in effect.

index assignment plays a critical role. In addition, one also needs to choose
the Voronoi cell size of the central lattice v, the sublattice index N, and the
number of side descriptions K to minimize the expected MDLVQ distortion, given
the total entropy rate of all side descriptions Rt and description loss
probability p. In this paper we propose a linear-time MDLVQ index assignment
algorithm for any K >= 2 balanced descriptions in any dimensions, based on a
new construction of so-called K-fraction lattice. The algorithm is greedy in
nature but is proven to be asymptotically (N -> infinity) optimal for any K >=
2 balanced descriptions in any dimensions, given Rt and p. The result is
stronger when K = 2: the optimality holds for finite N as well, under some mild
conditions. For K > 2, a local adjustment algorithm is developed to augment the
greedy index assignment, and conjectured to be optimal for finite N.
  Our algorithmic study also leads to better understanding of v, N and K in
optimal MDLVQ design. For K = 2 we derive, for the first time, a
non-asymptotical closed form expression of the expected distortion of optimal
MDLVQ in p, Rt, N. For K > 2, we tighten the current asymptotic formula of the
expected distortion, relating the optimal values of N and K to p and Rt more
precisely.

is sufficiently large. We also find -- for all types of shell -- that collapse

an antiproton beam by repeated interaction with a hydrogen gas target in a

scattering it is important to consider small angle scattering, hence small
momentum transfer t. In the low momentum transfer region electromagnetic
effects dominate the hadronic effects. Of immediate importance is whether the
polarization of an antiproton beam can be built up by spin filtering off

non--universal soft Supersymmetry breaking scalar masses in the Higgs sector.
In particular, we calculate the relic density abundance of the lightest
neutralino candidate for cold dark matter and the rates in direct and indirect
detection at present and future experiments. We first show that while in the
mSUGRA model this regime is disfavored by present data, there are regions in
the parameter space of models with non--universal Higgs masses where it can
occur. We then show that because of the large value of $\tan\beta$ and the
relatively low values of the neutral Higgs boson masses, the cross section for
neutralino--nucleon scattering is strongly enhanced in this regime and would
allow for the observation of a signal in direct detection experiments such as
CDMS--Soudan. The expected sensitivity of gamma--ray detectors like GLAST might
be also sufficient to observe the annihilation of neutralinos in such a regime.

and nue related to so far unknown theta13 amplitude, at distances corresponding
to an invariant neutrino flight path around about 2.0 MeV/km. Zucchelli [12]
has proposed the production of very pure neue beams (beta beams), in which
relativistic radio-nuclides are stored in a high energy storage ring and decay
in a long straight section pointing toward the neutrino detector far away. This
method produces ultra pure anti-neue (He-6) and neue (Ne-18) with a negligible
numu contamination (10-5). A novel kind of beta element production has been
recently proposed [15] in which slow (v about 0.1 c) fully ionized ions are
stored in a very small storage ring. Products like the isomeric doublet
Li-7(d,p) Li-8 and Li-6(He3,n) B-8 are stopped in some foils few micron thick,
from which they quickly diffuse as neutral atoms. The improvements are shown to
be considerable. An ion source, a chain of several accelerators in cascade and
a high energy storage/decay ring can produce a B-8 induced nue spectrum which
has as much as 7.7 times higher energy than the one from He-6 induced anti-nue
for a given magnetic rigidity of the storage ring. At a given neutrino energy,
the CC cross sections for nue are about 3 times larger than the ones of
anti-nue while the NC/CC inelastic pion background faking muons is about 3
times smaller. An optimal neu-e source might be fully ionized B-8 from the 120
GeV Main Energy Injector at FNAL, followed by a decay storage ring and a
neutrino fly path of about 700-800 km. As detector we consider a LAr TPC with a
fiducial mass of 50 to 100 kton. Such a technology should permit to detect a
background free signal for sin2(2theta13) as small as about 6.0 x 10-4. By
comparison, the present experimental limit is < 0.14.

with only one gauge field. We suggest that one possible solution is to consider
a second physical pseudo-vector gauge field $C$. The action for this theory is
originally motivated by the inclusion of magnetic monopoles. These particles
play no role in this work and our argument is only based in, that the violation
of the Bianchi identities, cannot be accounted at the action level with only
the standard gauge field. We give a particular example for a periodic rotating
external magnetic field. Our construction holds that at classical level both
the vector and pseudo-vector gauge fields $A$ and $C$ are regular. We compare
pseudo-photon with paraphoton (graviphoton) theories concluding that, besides
the mechanisms of gauge symmetry breaking already studied, the Bianchi
identities violation are a crucial difference between both theories. We also
show that, due to Dirac's quantization condition, at quantum field theory level
the effects due to pseudo-photons and photons can be distinguished by the
respective contributions to the magnetic moment of fermions and vacuum
polarization. These effects may be relevant in astrophysical environments,
namely close and inside neutron stars and magnetars. [Erratum: The construction
in this work must, at most, be considered as a conceptual system or toy model.

field theory with a non-canonical kinetic term (or k-essence). Even though
perturbations of Cuscuton propagate superluminally, we show that they have a
locally degenerate phase space volume (or zero entropy), implying that they
cannot carry any microscopic information, and thus the theory is causal. Even
coupling to ordinary scalar fields cannot lead to superluminal signal
propagation. Furthermore, we show that the family of constant field
hypersurfaces are the family of Constant Mean Curvature (CMC) hypersurfaces,
which are the analogs of soap films (or soap bubbles) in a Euclidian space.
This enables us to find the most general solution in 1+1 dimensions, whose
properties motivate conjectures for global degeneracy of the phase space in
higher dimensions. Finally, we show that the Cuscuton action can model the
continuum limit of the evolution of a field with discrete degrees of freedom
and argue why it is protected against quantum corrections at low energies.
While this paper mainly focuses on interesting features of Cuscuton in a
Minkowski spacetime, a companion paper (astro-ph/0702002) examines cosmology

implications of the coupled scalar field. Data from the Solar system,
supernovae Ia, cosmic microwave background radiation, large scale structure and
big bang nucleosynthesis is used to constrain the parameters of the model. A
good Newtonian limit may require to fix the coupling. With all the data
combined, there appears to be some tension with the nucleosynthesis bound, and
the baryon oscillation scale seems to strongly disfavor the model. These
possible problems might be overcome in more elaborate models. In addition, the
validity of these constraints in the present context is not strictly
established. Evolution of fluctuations in the scalar field and their impact to
clustering of matter is studied in detail and more model-independently. Small

begin with, we give an explicit formula for the Borel transform of the
associated formal power series $F(x)=e^{-1/(24x)}f(e^{-1/x})$ from which its
analytic continuation, its singularities and their structure can be manifestly
determined. This gives rise to right/left and median summation of the original
power series. These sums, which are well-defined in the open right half-plane
are expressed by an integral formula involving the Dedekind eta function. The
median sum can also be expressed as a series involving the complex error
function. Moreover, it is shown using results of Zagier that the limiting
values at $-1/(2 \pi i \a)$ for rational numbers $\a$ coincide with $F(-1/(2
\pi i \a))$. One motivation for studying the series $f(q)$ is Quantum Topology,
which assigns numerical invariants to knotted 3-dimensional objects. Motivated

control strategies that, while making minimal or no assumptions on

efficiency of such systems, but merely affects the rate of convergence to the
steady state. Furthermore, the proposed strategies do not rely on the knowledge
of the details of the underlying stochastic process. Finally, we show that our
proposed strategies provide an efficient, pure Nash equilibrium in a game

call Nash matrices. If $A$ is a Nash matrix then the Nash map ${\cal N}$ is

type is known to be an invariant that completely determines the diffeomorphism
type of the surface. Calculating this factorization is of high technical
complexity; computing the braid monodromy factorization of branch curves of
surfaces uncovers new facts and invariants of the surfaces. Since finding the
branch curve of a surface is very difficult, we degenerate the surface into a
union of planes. Thus, we can find the braid monodromy of the branch curve of
the degenerated surface, which is a union of lines. The regeneration of the
singularities of the branch curve, studied locally, leads us to find the global
braid monodromy factorization of the branch curve of the original surface. So
far, only the regeneration of the BMF of 3,4 and 6-point (a singular point
which is the intersection of 3 / 4 / 6 planes) were done. In this paper, we
fill the gap and find the braid monodromy of the regeneration of a 5-point.
This is of great importance to the understanding of the BMT (braid monodromy
type) of surfaces. This braid monodromy will be used to find the global braid
monodromy factorization of different surfaces; in particular - the monodromy of
the branch curve of the Hirzebruch surface $F_{2,(2,2)}$.

different proof of this result by ordering S_3 up to the stronger
shape-Wilf-order: |S_Y(213)|<=|S_Y(123)|<=|S_Y(312)| for any Young diagram Y,
derive as a consequence that |S_Y(k+2,k+1,k+3,tau)|<=|S_Y(k+1,k+2,k+3,tau)|<=
|S_Y(k+3,k+1,k+2,tau)| for any tau in S_k, and find out when equalities are

|S_Y(123)|=|S_Y(312)| coincide with every other Fibonacci term.) This
strengthens and generalizes Bona's result to arbitrary length permutations.
While all length-3 permutations have been shown in numerous ways to be
Wilf-equivalent, the current paper distinguishes between and orders these

whether shape-Wilf-ordering of permutations, or some generalization of it, is

Exclusion Principle as it is applied to atomic species, (that is versions of

which it is shown that energy conservation is not consistent with current
models. If the two electrons in the ground state, per current theory, are at
the same energy as the ionization energy, it is demonstrated that according to
the standard theory approximately 30 eV are lost during ionization, or
alternatively, about 30 eV of energy are created during ionization/electron
attachment. The same issue of energy loss during relaxation of energy levels
following ionization is shown to exist for all atomic species, thus
demonstrating that the Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP) and energy conservation
are not consistent for any atomic species for current forms of distinguishable
electron forms of quantum theory. Only that form of quantum that has a single
orbital, and for which only one ionization energy can be computed (that is the
original Schrodinger form), is consistent with an energy balance. However, this
form is not consistent with common spectroscopy results, and it is argued PEP
has no meaning in this form of quantum theory. In contrast a new model,
Classical Quantum Mechanics (CQM), invented by R. Mills,, following
modification, is consistent with all spectroscopy and energy conservation for
bound electron systems. This new model is based on the validity of Maxwell s

scattering of muons. We have calculated this cross section for liquid H2 from
first principles and atomic data, avoiding traditional assumptions. Thence, 2-D
probability maps of energy loss and scattering in mm-scale thicknesses are
derived by folding, and stored in a database. Large first-order correlations
between energy loss and scattering are found for H2, which are absent in other
simulations. This code is named ELMS, Energy Loss & Multiple Scattering. Single
particle trajectories may then be tracked by Monte Carlo sampling from this
database on a scale of 1 mm or less. This processor has been inserted into the
cooling code ICOOL. Significant improvements in 6-D muon cooling are predicted
compared with previous predictions based on GEANT. This is examined in various

control and quantum information processing applications. Here, we investigate
how single-bit, discrete-time feedback capabilities may be exploited to enact
or to enhance quantum procedures for effectively suppressing unwanted dynamics
in a finite-dimensional open quantum system. An explicit characterization of
the joint unitary propagators correctable by a single-bit feedback strategy for
arbitrary evolution time is obtained. For a two-dimensional target system, we
show how by appropriately combining quantum feedback with dynamical decoupling
methods, concatenated feedback-decoupling schemes may be built, which can
operate under relaxed control assumptions and can outperform purely closed-loop
and open-loop protocols.

In the usual search problem, we have a collection of n items and we would like
to find a marked item. We consider a new variant of this problem in which
evaluating the i-th item may take a different number of time steps for
different i.
  Let t_i be the number of time steps required to evaluate the i-th item. If
the numbers t_i are known in advance, we give an algorithm that solves the
problem in O(\sqrt{t_1^2+t_2^2+...+t_n^2}) steps. This is optimal, as we also
show a matching lower bound. The case, when t_i are not known in advance, can
be solved with a polylogarithmic overhead. We also give an application of our

reliably to electronically excited states, and a perturbative approach is used
to analyse the effect of ground state hyperfine shifts. This analysis shows
that the errors due to the hyperfine shift are dynamically supressed during
gate operation, a fact we attribute to the AC Stark shift. Furthermore we
present an implementation of a controlled phase gate which is resilient to the
effects of the hyperfine shift. Decoherence and decay effects are included in
simulations in order to show that a demonstration of quantum gates is feasible
over the relevant range of system parameters.

realist description of quantum phenomena in terms of the motion of point-like
particles following well-defined trajectories. This work is concerned by the de
Broglie-Bohm account of the properties of semiclassical systems. Semiclassical
systems are quantum systems that display the manifestation of classical
trajectories: the wavefunction and the observable properties of such systems
depend on the trajectories of the classical counterpart of the quantum system.
For example the quantum properties have a regular or disordered aspect
depending on whether the underlying classical system has regular or chaotic
dynamics. In contrast, Bohmian trajectories in semiclassical systems have
little in common with the trajectories of the classical counterpart, creating a
dynamical mismatch relative to the quantum-classical correspondence visible in
these systems. Our aim is to describe this mismatch (explicit illustrations are
given), explain its origin, and examine some of the consequences on the status
of Bohmian trajectories in semiclassical systems. We argue in particular that
semiclassical systems put stronger constraints on the empirical acceptability
and plausibility of Bohmian trajectories because the usual arguments given to
dismiss the mismatch between the classical and the de Broglie-Bohm motions are
weakened by the occurrence of classical trajectories in the quantum
wavefunction of such systems.
