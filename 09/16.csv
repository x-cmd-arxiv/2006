of the Milky Way. Most of these stars may have originated from the breakup of
binary star systems by the nuclear black hole SgrA*. In some instances, the
breakup of the binary may lead to a collision between its member stars. We
examine the dynamical properties of these collisions by simulating thousands of
different binary orbits around SgrA* with a direct N-body integration code. For
some orbital parameters, the two stars collide with an impact velocity lower
than their escape velocity and may therefore coalesce. It is possible for a
coalescing binary to have sufficient velocity to escape the galaxy.
Furthermore, some of the massive S-stars near Sgr A* might be the merger
remnants of binary systems, however this production method can not account for
most of the S-stars.

Branch (AGB) wind is thought to be the basic mechanism for shaping
Pre-Planetary Nebulae (PPN) and later Planetary Nebulae (PN). Due to the large
speed of the fast wind, one expects extended X-ray emission from these objects,
but X-ray emission has only been detected in a small fraction of PNs and only
in one PPN. Using numerical simulations we investigate the constraints that can
be set on the physical properties of the fast wind (speed, mass-flux, opening
angle) in order to produce the observed X-ray emission properties of PPNs and
PNs. We combine numerical hydrodynamical simulations including radiative
cooling using the code FLASH with calculations of the X-ray properties of the
resulting expanding hot bubble using the atomic database ATOMDB. In this first
study, we compute X-ray fluxes and spectra using one-dimensional models.
Comparing our results with analytical solutions, we find some agreements and
many disagreements. In particular, we test the effect of different time
histories of the fast wind on the X-ray emission and find that it is determined
by the final stage of the time history during which the fast wind velocity has
its largest value. The disagreements which are both qualitative and
quantitative in nature argue for the necessity of using numerical simulations
for understanding the X-ray properties of PNs.

  withdrawn by arXiv administrators as a duplicate of arXiv:astro-ph/0512123",,,"IGPG-06/9-5","astro-ph",,"  Primordial stars are likely to be very massive >30 Msun, form in isolation,
and will likely leave black holes as remnants in the centers of their host dark
matter halos. We expect primordial stars to form in halos in the mass range
10^6-10^10 Msun. Some of these early black holes, formed at redshifts z>10,
could be the seed black hole for a significant fraction of the supermassive
black holes found in galaxies in the local universe. If the black hole
descendants of the primordial stars exist, their mergers with nearby
supermassive black holes may be a prime candidate for long wavelength
gravitational wave detectors. We simulate formation and evolution of dark
matter halos in LambdaCDM universe. We seed high-redshift dark matter halos
with early black holes, and explore the merger history of the host halos and
the implications of black hole's kick velocities arising from their
coalescence. The central concentration of low mass early black holes in present
day galaxies is reduced if they experience even moderate kicks of tens of km/s.
Even such modest kicks allow the black holes to leave their parent halo, which
consequently leads to dynamical friction being less effective on the low mass
black holes that were ejected, compared to those still embedded in their parent
halos. Therefore, merger rates with central supermassive black holes in the
largest halos may be reduced by more than an order of magnitude. Using
analytical and illustrative cosmological N-body simulations, we quantify the
role of kicks on the merger rates of black holes formed from massive metal free
stars with supermassive black holes in present day galaxies.

measuring the properties of relativistic iron lines observed in stellar-mass

studies of similar lines in Seyfert-1 AGN. In particular, the lines observed in
stellar-mass black holes are not complicated by complex low-energy absorption
or partial-covering of the central engine, and strong lines are largely
independent of the model used to fit the underlying broad-band continuum flux.
Indeed, relativistic iron lines are the most robust diagnostic of black hole
spin that is presently available to observers, with specific advantages over
the systematics-plagued disk continuum. If accretion onto stellar-mass black
holes simply scales with mass, then the widespread nature of lines in
stellar-mass black holes may indicate that lines should be common in Seyfert-1
AGN, though perhaps harder to detect.

three, roughly parallel components in a 65 degree-long stellar stream complex
previously identified with the Anticenter or Monoceros Ring. The three-stream
complex varies in width from 4 to 6 degrees along its length and appears to be
made up of two or more narrow substreams as well as a broader, diffuse
component. The width and complexity of the stream indicate that the progenitor
was likely a dwarf galaxy of significant size and mass. The stream is 8.9 kpc
distant and is oriented almost perpendicularly to our line of sight. The
visible portion of the stream does not pass near any known dwarf galaxies and a
preliminary orbit does not point to any viable progenitor candidates. Orbits
for the narrower substreams can be modeled with velocity offsets from the broad
component of about 8 km/s. We suggest that the broad component is likely to be
the remains of a dwarf galaxy, while the narrower streams constitute the
remnants of dynamically distinct components which may have included a native
population of globular clusters. While the color of the main sequence turn-off
is not unlike that for the Monoceros Ring, neither the visible stream nor any
reasonable projection of its orbit passes through Monoceros or Canis Major, and
we conclude that this stream is probably unrelated to the overdensities found

having high neutral hydrogen column densities.
  Aims: To increase the spectroscopic sample of GRBs with z > 2 and hence
establish the N(HI) distribution along GRB lines-of-sight.
  Methods: We have obtained six z > 2 GRB afterglow spectra and fitted the

complemented with 12 other Swift N(HI) values from the literature.
  Results: We show that the peak of the GRB N(HI) distribution is qualitatively
consistent with a model where GRBs originate in Galactic-like molecular clouds.

carbon mass fraction hardly affects the 56Ni synthesized although it alters the

transformations for objects with strong absorption features within a filter

the linearity correction for stars observed with the shortest exposure times;
very accurate photometry of stars approaching the saturation limits of infrared

Both the X-ray and optical fluxes of SDSS J1446+02 are modulated on a period of
48.7+/-0.5 min, with the X-ray modulation showing the characteristic energy
dependence of photo-electric absorption seen in many intermediate polars (IP).
A longer period modulation and radial velocity variation is also seen at a
period around 4 hrs, though neither dataset set is long enough to constrain
this longer, likely orbital, period well. SDSS J2050-05 appears to be an
example of the most highly magnetized class of mCV, a disk-less, stream-fed
polar. Its 1.57 hr orbital period is well-constrained via optical eclipse
timings; in the X-ray it shows both eclipses and an underlying strong, smooth
modulation. In this case, broadly phase-resolved spectral fits indicate that
this change in flux is the result of a varying normalization of the dominant
component (a 41 keV MEKAL), plus the addition of a partial covering absorber
during the lower flux interval. SDSS J2101+10 is a more perplexing system to
categorize: its X-ray and optical fluxes exhibit no large periodic modulations;
there are only barely detectable changes in the velocity structure of its
optical emission lines; the X-ray spectra require only absorption by the
interstellar medium; and the temperatures of the MEKAL fits are low, with
maximum temperature components of either 10 or 25 keV. We conclude that SDSS
J2101+10 can not be an IP, nor likely a polar, but is rather most likely a disc
accretor-- a low inclination SW Sex star.

(G0V, 18.4 pc, ~0.3 Gyr) and HD 3651 (K0V, 11.1 pc, ~7 Gyr). During an ongoing
survey of 5'x5' fields surrounding stars in the solar neighborhood with IRAC
aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope, we identified these companions as candidate
T dwarfs based on their mid-IR colors. Using near-IR spectra obtained with SpeX
at the NASA IRTF, we confirm the presence of methane absorption that
characterizes T dwarfs and measure spectral types of T2.5+/-0.5 and T7.5+/-0.5
for HN Peg B and HD 3651 B, respectively. By comparing our Spitzer data to
images from 2MASS obtained several years earlier, we find that the proper
motions of HN Peg B and HD 3651 B are consistent with those of the primaries,
confirming their companionship. HN Peg B and HD 3651 B have angular separations
of 43.2"" and 42.9"" from their primaries, which correspond to projected physical
separations of 795 and 476 AU, respectively. A comparison of their luminosities
to the values predicted by theoretical evolutionary models implies masses of
0.021+/-0.009 and 0.051+/-0.014 Msun for HN Peg B and HD 3651 B. In addition,
the models imply an effective temperature for HN Peg B that is significantly
lower than the values derived for other T dwarfs at similar spectral types,
which is the same behavior reported by Metchev & Hillenbrand for the young
late-L dwarf HD 203030 B. Thus, the temperature of the L/T transition appears
to depend on surface gravity. Meanwhile, HD 3651 B is the first substellar
companion directly imaged around a star that is known to harbor a close-in
planet from RV surveys. The discovery of this companion supports the notion
that the high eccentricities of close-in planets like the one near HD 3651 may
be the result of perturbations by low-mass companions at wide separations.

results in a long-memory effect that can be best taken into account by
introducing an additional dynamical variable corresponding to the nondiagonal

of dynamical equations describes the phonon-bottleneck plateau in the spin
excitation, as well as a gap in the spin-phonon spectrum for any finite

electronic properties. When electrons are confined to one-dimensional chains of
atoms their behavior is very different than in higher dimensional systems
because they become strongly correlated, even in the case of vanishingly small
interactions. The chains consisting of copper and oxygen atoms are particularly
interesting, because the CuO orbitals are constituents of all known high
temperature superconductors. Most of previous spectroscopic studies of CuO
chain systems indicated insulating behavior[23-25]. Here we report the
discovery of momentum dependent superconducting gap and hump-peak-dip structure
in the spectra of the CuO chains. We demonstrate that superconductivity in the
chains arises due to proximity effects and the peculiar momentum dependence of
the superconducting gap shows how three dimensional coherence emerges in a
layered superconductor. The presence of the hump-dip-peak structure in the
spectra of the CuO chains is very unexpected as it was thought to only occur in
the CuO2 planes and is frequently considered to be a signature of the d-wave
pairing and the pairing boson itself.

antiferromagnetism, it is essential to understand the doping and temperature
dependence of the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic spin correlations. The
phase diagram is asymmetric with respect to electron and hole doping, and for
the comparatively less-studied electron-doped materials, the antiferromagnetic
phase extends much further with doping [1, 2] and appears to overlap with the
superconducting phase. The archetypical electron-doped compound
Nd{2-x}Ce{x}CuO{4\pm\delta} (NCCO) shows bulk superconductivity above x \approx

measurements that point to the distinct possibility that genuine long-range
antiferromagnetism and superconductivity do not coexist. The data reveal a
magnetic quantum critical point where superconductivity first appears,
consistent with an exotic quantum phase transition between the two phases [7].
We also demonstrate that the pseudogap phenomenon in the electron-doped

reservoirs, is the standard building block of sub-micron devices, such as
quantum dots - small boxes of electrons, and qubits - the proposed basic
elements of quantum computers. As a function of its width, the conductance
through a QPC changes in integer steps of G0 = $2e^2/h$, signalling the
quantization of its tranverse modes.1,2 Such measurements also reveal an
additional shoulder at a value around 0.7, an observation which remains a
puzzle even after more than a decade. Recently it has been suggested5,6 that
this phenomenon can be explained if one invokes the existence of a magnetic
impurity in the QPC at low densities. Here we present extensive numerical
density-functional calculations that reveal the formation of a magnetic moment
in the channel as the density increases above pinch-off, under very general
conditions. In addition we show that such an impurity will also form at large
magnetic fields, for a specific value of the field (corresponding to a
degeneracy point between the upper spin state in the first mode and the lower
spin state in the second mode), and sometimes even at the opening of the second
mode in the QPC. Beyond explaining the source of the ""0.7 anomaly"", these
results may have far reaching implications on spin filling of electronic states

with R=Er, Ho and Dy are found to show first order magnetic transition at their
ordering temperatures. The inherent instability of Co sublattice magnetism is
responsible for the occurrence of IEM, which leads to interesting magnetic and
related properties. The systematic studies of the variations in the magnetic
and magnetocaloric properties of the RCo2-based compounds show that the
magnetovolume effect plays a decisive role in determining the nature of
magnetic transitions and hence the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in these
compound. It is found that the spin fluctuations arising due to the
magnetovolume effect reduce the strength of IEM in these compounds, which
subsequently lead to a reduction in the MCE. Most of the substitutions at the
Co site are found to result in a positive magnetovolume effect, leading to an
initial increase in the ordering temperature. Application of pressure, on the
other hand, causes a reduction in the ordering temperature due to the negative
magnetovolume effect. A comparative study of the magnetic and magnetocaloric
properties of RCo2 compounds under various substitutions and applied pressure
is presented. Analysis of the magnetization data using the Landau theory has
shown that there is a strong correlation between the Landau coefficient (B) and
the MCE. The variations seen in the order of magnetic transition and the MCE
values seem to support the recent model proposed by Khmelevskyi and Mohn for
the occurrence of IEM in RCo2 compounds.

needs the addressing from check nodes to variable nodes while the original
min-sum algorithm requires that addressing plus the addressing from variable
nodes to check nodes. To cut down memory usage or wiring further, another
version of the single-scan min-sum algorithm is presented where the messages of

from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and shown to provide a good fit.
The inflaton potential is naturally flat due to shift symmetries, and in the
simplest version takes the form $V(\phi) = \Lambda^4 [1 \pm \cos(N\phi/f)]$.
The model agrees with WMAP3 measurements as long as $f > 0.7 m_{Pl}$ (where
$m_{Pl} = 1.22 \times 10^{19}$GeV) and $\Lambda \sim m_{GUT}$. The running of
the scalar spectral index is shown to be small -- an order of magnitude below
the sensitivity of WMAP3. The location of the field in the potential when
perturbations on observable scales are produced is examined; for $f > 5
m_{Pl}$, the relevant part of the potential is indistinguishable from a
quadratic, yet has the advantage that the required flatness is well-motivated.
Depending on the value of $f$, the model falls into the large field ($f \ge 1.5
m_{Pl}$) or small field ($f < 1.5 m_{Pl}$) classification scheme that has been
applied to inflation models. Natural inflation provides a good fit to WMAP3
data.

radiative corrections up to scales of order 5 TeV without large corrections to
precision electroweak observables. In these `folded supersymmetric' theories
the one loop quadratic divergences of the Standard Model Higgs field are
cancelled by opposite spin partners, but the gauge quantum numbers of these new
particles are in general different from those of the conventional
superpartners. This class of models is built around the correspondence that
exists in the large N limit between the correlation functions of supersymmetric
theories and those of their non-supersymmetric orbifold daughters. By
identifying the mechanism which underlies the cancellation of one loop
quadratic divergences in these theories, we are able to construct simple
extensions of the Standard Model which are radiatively stable at one loop.
Ultraviolet completions of these theories can be obtained by imposing suitable
boundary conditions on an appropriate supersymmetric higher dimensional theory
compactified down to four dimensions. We construct a specific model based on
these ideas which stabilizes the weak scale up to about 20 TeV and where the
states which cancel the top loop are scalars not charged under Standard Model
color. Its collider signatures are distinct from conventional supersymmetric
theories and include characteristic events with hard leptons and missing
energy.

is motivated by similarities between these theories and their traditional

Laplacian eigenmodes as the de Sitter photon; they are conformal in four
dimensions; their gauge invariance has a single scalar parameter and actions
can be expressed as squares of single derivative curvature tensors. We examine
this proposal in detail for its simplest spin 2 example. We find that it is
possible to construct a natural and consistent interaction scheme to conserved
vector electromagnetic currents primarily coupled to the helicity 1 partially
massless modes. The resulting current-current single ``partial-photon''
exchange amplitude is the (very unCoulombic) sum of contact and shorter-range
terms, so the partial photon cannot replace the traditional one, but rather
modifies short range electromagnetic interactions. We also write the gauge
invariant fourth-derivative effective actions that might appear as effective
corrections to the model, and their contributions to the tree amplitude are
also obtained.

infinite system of interacting $\nu$-dimensional quantum anharmonic oscillators
is given. The oscillators are indexed by the elements of a countable set
$\mathbb{L}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, possibly irregular; the anharmonic potentials
vary from site to site. The description is based on the representation of the
Gibbs states in terms of path measures -- the so called Euclidean Gibbs
measures. It is proven that: (a) the set of such measures $\mathcal{G}^{\rm t}$
is non-void and compact; (b) every $\mu \in \mathcal{G}^{\rm t}$ obeys an
exponential integrability estimate, the same for the whole set
$\mathcal{G}^{\rm t}$; (c) every $\mu \in \mathcal{G}^{\rm t}$ has a
Lebowitz-Presutti type support; (d) $\mathcal{G}^{\rm t}$ is a singleton at
high temperatures. In the case of attractive interaction and $\nu=1$ we prove
that $|\mathcal{G}^{\rm t}|>1$ at low temperatures. The uniqueness of Gibbs
measures due to quantum effects and at a nonzero external field are also proven
in this case. Thereby, a qualitative theory of phase transitions and quantum
effects, which interprets most important experimental data known for the
corresponding physical objects, is developed. The mathematical result of the
paper is a complete description of the set $\mathcal{G}^{\rm t}$, which refines
and extends the results known for models of this type.

target population characterized by variables not observable at the time a
treatment decision is made. Characterizing and estimating such treatment
effects is tricky; the most popular but naive approach inappropriately adjusts
for variables affected by treatment and so is biased. We consider several
appropriate ways to formalize the effects: principal stratification,
stratification on a single potential auxiliary variable, stratification on an
observed auxiliary variable and stratification on expected levels of auxiliary
variables. We then outline identifying assumptions for each type of estimand.
We evaluate the utility of these estimands and estimation procedures for
decision making and understanding causal processes, contrasting them with the
concepts of direct and indirect effects. We motivate our development with
examples from nephrology and cancer screening, and use simulated data and real
data on cancer screening to illustrate the estimation methods.

practical principle for simulating rare events. The method approximates the
probability of the rare event by means of a family of probabilistic models. The
method has been extended to optimization, by considering an optimal event as a
rare event. CE works rather good when dealing with deterministic function
optimization. Now, it appears that two conditions are needed for a good
convergence of the method. First, it is necessary to have a family of models
sufficiently flexible for discriminating the optimal events. Indirectly, it
appears also that the function to be optimized should be deterministic. The
purpose of this paper is to consider the case of partially discriminating model
family, and of stochastic functions. It will be shown on simple examples that
the CE could fail when relaxing these hypotheses. Alternative improvements of
the CE method are investigated and compared on random examples in order to
handle this issue.

neutron-rich compound nuclei because of the neutron emissions from excited
compound nuclei. The compound nucleus $^{304}114$ has two advantages to
achieving a high survival probability. First, because of small neutron
separation energy and rapid cooling, the shell correction energy recovers
quickly. Secondly, owing to neutron emissions, the neutron number of the
nucleus approaches that of the double closed shell and the nucleus obtains a
large fission barrier. Because of these two effects, the survival probability
of $^{304}114$ does not decrease until the excitation energy $E^{*}= 50$ MeV.
These properties lead to a rather high evaporation reside cross section.

ordered and disordered linear chains of metal nanospheres. In our simulations,
SPs are excited at one end of a chain by a near-field tip. We then find
numerically the SP amplitude as a function of propagation distance. Two types
of SPs are discovered. The first SP, which we call the ordinary or quasistatic,
is mediated by short-range, near-field electromagnetic interaction in the
chain. This excitation is strongly affected by Ohmic losses in the metal and by
disorder in the chain. These two effects result in spatial decay of the
quasistatic SP by means of absorptive and radiative losses, respectively. The
second SP is mediated by longer range, far-field interaction of nanospheres. We
refer to this SP as the extraordinary or non-quasistatic. The non-quasistatic
SP can not be effectively excited by a near-field probe due to the small
integral weight of the associated spectral line. Because of that, at small
propagation distances, this SP is dominated by the quasistatic SP. However, the
non-quasistatic SP is affected by Ohmic and radiative losses to a much smaller
extent than the quasistatic one. Because of that, the non-quasistatic SP
becomes dominant sufficiently far from the exciting tip and can propagate with
little further losses of energy to remarkable distances. The unique physical
properties of the non-quasistatic SP can be utilized in all-optical integrated
photonic systems.

magnet quickly reaches the terminal velocity, inside a superconducting tube the
magnet falls freely. On the other hand, to enter the pipe the magnet must
overcome a large electromagnetic energy barrier. For sufficiently strong
magnets, the barrier is so large that the magnet will not be able to penetrate
it and will be suspended over the front edge. We calculate the work that must
done to force the magnet to enter a superconducting tube. The calculations show
that superconducting pipes are very efficient at screening magnetic fields. For
example, the magnetic field of a dipole at the center of a short pipe of radius
$a$ and length $L \approx a$ decays, in the axial direction, with a
characteristic length $\xi \approx 0.26 a$. The efficient screening of the

be qualitatively different from any uniform substance. The differences are
particularly pronounced when the electromagnetic wavelength is comparable to
the primitive translation of the periodic structure. In such a case, the
periodic medium cannot be assigned any meaningful refractive index. Still, such
features as negative refraction and/or opposite phase and group velocities for
certain directions of light propagation can be found in almost any photonic
crystal. The only reservation is that unlike hypothetical uniform left-handed
media, photonic crystals are essentially anisotropic at frequency range of
interest. Consider now a plane wave incident on a semi-infinite photonic
crystal. One can assume, for instance, that in the case of positive refraction,
the normal components of the group and the phase velocities of the transmitted
Bloch wave have the same sign, while in the case of negative refraction, those
components have opposite signs. What happens if the normal component of the
transmitted wave group velocity vanishes? Let us call it a ""zero-refraction""
case. At first sight, zero normal component of the transmitted wave group
velocity implies total reflection of the incident wave. But we demonstrate that
total reflection is not the only possibility. Instead, the transmitted wave can
appear in the form of an abnormal grazing mode with huge amplitude and nearly
tangential group velocity. This spectacular phenomenon is extremely sensitive
to the frequency and direction of propagation of the incident plane wave. These
features can be very attractive in numerous applications, such as higher
harmonic generation and wave mixing, light amplification and lasing, highly
