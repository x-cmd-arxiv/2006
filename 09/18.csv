General Relativity focussing on two aspects which have not been investigated in
detail in the past. Namely, on the persistence of the bar deformation once the
instability has reached its saturation and on the precise determination of the
threshold for the onset of the instability in terms of the parameter
$\beta={T}/{|W|}$. We find that generic nonlinear mode-coupling effects appear
during the development of the instability and these can severely limit the
persistence of the bar deformation and eventually suppress the instability. In
addition, we observe the dynamics of the instability to be strongly influenced
by the value $\beta$ and on its separation from the critical value $\beta_c$
marking the onset of the instability. We discuss the impact these results have
on the detection of gravitational waves from this process and provide evidence
that the classical perturbative analysis of the bar-mode instability for
Newtonian and incompressible Maclaurin spheroids remains qualitatively valid
and accurate also in full General Relativity.

during the brightening observed since the discovery in X-rays. High resolution
spectra from the Reflection Grating Spectrometers yield a complementary view
and allow us to perform more detailed investigations of prominent emission
lines. The X-ray spectra were modeled with two-temperature emission components
from a hot plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium and in non-equilibrium
(NEI). We find a temperature for the equilibrium component of 0.24+/-0.02 keV
in January 2000 and April 2001 which increased to 0.30+/-0.02 keV in May 2003

\~2 keV to ~3 keV. Emission line ratios inferred from the RGS spectra suggest
temperatures as low as 100 eV and an increase in the ionization state of oxygen
and neon consistent with the observed temperature increases. The fast readout
of the EPIC-pn instrument yields X-ray fluxes free of CCD pile-up effects which
we used to normalize pile-up corrections for the published Chandra fluxes. The
corrected X-ray light curve of SN1987A in the 0.5-2.0 keV energy band is best
represented by a linear increase up to about day 4000 after the explosion and
an exponential rise afterwards until the last published Chandra observation on

expansion of the galaxy surface density field up to the octapole order. We find
strong indications for significant contributions to the Local Group motion from
depths up to $\sim 185$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc and possible contribution even from $\sim
210$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc, in agreement with the recent analysis of Kocevski & Ebeling

increase of the overall dipole amplitude due to the important contribution of
the local volume ($\mincir 4 h^{-1}$Mpc), which we now take into account. This
results in a lower value of the $\beta (\equiv \Omega_{\rm m}^{0.6}/b)$

violent relaxation after expelling gas not used in star formation. We show
that, if we assume that luminous mass estimates are correct (for a standard

known are likely to be destroyed within a few 10s Myr of their formation. Even
clusters which will retain a bound core may lose a large fraction of their

change significantly during the violent relaxation that follows gas expulsion

to tackle this effect properly based on the numerical follow-up, with time, of

with respect to the total mass. In this first step, we do not include angular
momentum, velocity dispersion or triaxiality. Within this framework - named as
the Spherical Shell Tracker (SST) - we investigate the dependence of the
evolution of the halo with virial mass, with the adopted mass fraction of the
shell, and for different cosmologies. We find that our results are very
sensitive to a variation of the halo virial mass or the mass fraction of the
shell that we consider. However, we obtain a negligible dependence on
cosmology. Furthermore, we show that the effect of shell-crossing plays a
crucial role in the way that the halo reaches the stabilization in radius and
the virial equilibrium. We find that the values currently adopted in the
literature for the actual density contrast at the moment of virialization,
delta_vir, may not be accurate enough. In this context, we stress the problems
related to the definition of a virial mass and a virial radius for the halo.
The question of whether the results found here may be obtained by tracking the
shells with an analytic approximation remains to be explored.

The clusters cover a temperature range from 2.5 keV to 8.5 keV, and present a

profiles to ~ 0.5 R_200, and compare structural properties (outer slope,
presence of cooling core) with a quantitative measure of the X-ray morphology
as expressed by power ratios. We also compare the results to recent
cosmological numerical simulations. Once the temperature profiles are scaled by
an average cluster temperature (excluding the central region) and the estimated
virial radius, the profiles generally decline in the region 0.1 R_200 < R < 0.5
R_200. The central regions show the largest scatter, attributable mostly to the
presence of cool core clusters. There is good agreement with numerical
simulations outside the core regions. We find no obvious correlations between
power ratio and outer profile slope. There may however be a weak trend with the
existence of a cool core, in the sense that clusters with a central temperature

a template to construct luminosity distances in order to compare observations
with theory, the evolution of the scale factor in such a construction must be

modified Friedmann equations derived by Buchert [7, 8] in the context of
spatial averaging in Cosmology. Furthermore, we argue that this scale factor,
defined in the spatially averaged cosmology, will correspond to the effective
FLRW metric provided the size of the averaging domain coincides with the scale
at which cosmological homogeneity arises. This allows us, in principle, to
compare predictions of a spatially averaged cosmology with observations, in the
standard manner, for instance by computing the luminosity distance versus
red-shift relation. The predictions of the spatially averaged cosmology would
in general differ from standard FLRW cosmology, because the scale-factor now
obeys the modified FLRW equations. This could help determine, by comparing with
observations, whether or not cosmological inhomogeneities are an alternative
explanation for the observed cosmic acceleration.

primary nitrogen, seem to indicate that very metal poor stars were fast
rotators. As a consequence of this fast rotation, these stars, contrarily to
current wisdom, might lose large amounts of mass during their lifetime. In this
paper, we review various mechanisms triggered by rotation which may induce
strong mass loss at very low metallicity. The most efficient process comes from
surface enrichments in CNO elements which then drive mass loss by stellar
winds. Due to this process, a fast rotating 60 M$_\odot$ with metallicities in
the range of $Z=10^{-8}$ and $10^{-5}$, can lose between 30 and 55% of its
initial mass. This rotationally wind ejected material participates to the
chemical evolution of the interstellar medium, enriching it exclusively in H-
and He-burning products. In particular, metal poor fast rotating stars may play
a key role for explaining the origin of the peculiar abundance pattern observed
at the surface of the extremely metal-poor C-rich stars, for explaining the
chemical inhomogeneities observed in globular clusters, and the presence of
stars in $\omega$ Cen with a very high helium content .

hard to localize, they are so bright that they can be detected in the most
difficult environments. GRB observations are unveiling a surprising view of the
chemical state of the distant universe (redshifts z > 2). Contrary to what is
expected for a high-z metal-poor star, the neutral interstellar medium (ISM)
around GRBs is not metal poor (metallicities vary from ~1/10 solar at z = 6.3
to about solar at z = 2) and is enriched with dust (90-99% of iron is in solid
form). If these metallicities are combined with those measured in the warm ISM
of GRB host galaxies at z < 1, a redshift evolution is observed. Such an
evolution predicts that the stellar masses of the hosts are in the range M* =
10^(8.6-9.8) Msun. This prediction makes use of the mass-metallicity relation
(and its redshift evolution) observed in normal star-forming galaxies.
Independent measurements coming from the optical-NIR photometry of GRB hosts
indicate the same range of stellar masses, with a typical value similar to that
of the Large Magellanic Cloud. This newly detected population of
intermediate-mass galaxies is very hard to find at high redshift using
conventional astronomy. However, it offers a compelling and relatively
inexpensive opportunity to explore galaxy formation and cosmic chemical
evolution beyond known borders, from the primordial universe to the present.

attempt to model circumstellar disks and the formation of collapsed objects
(e.g. planets) within them. First, we define a resolution requirement based on
the wavelength for neutral stability of self gravitating waves in the disk. For
particle based or grid based simulations, this criterion takes the form,
respectively, of a minimum number of particles per critical (`Toomre') mass or
maximum value of a `Toomre number', $T= \delta x/\lambda_T$, where the
wavelength, $\lambda_T$, is the wavelength for neutral stability for waves in
disks. We apply our criterion to particle simulations and find that in order to
prevent numerically induced fragmentation of the disk, the Toomre mass must be
resolved by a minimum of six times the average number of neighbor particles
used. Second, we require that particle based simulations with self gravity use
a variable gravitational softening. We show that using a fixed gravitational
softening length can lead either to artificial suppression or enhancement of
structure (including fragmentation) in a given disk, or both in different
locations of the same disk. Third, we require that 3D SPH simulations resolve
the disk's vertical structure with at least $\sim4$ particle smoothing lengths
per scale height at the disk midplane and suggest that a similar criterion
applies to grid based simulations. Failure to meet this criterion leads to
underestimates in the midplane density of up to 30--50% at resolutions common
in the literature.

This phenomenon strongly enhances the QD ground state luminescence at the

contact with the solution or with the porous layer can be passivated with rate
p and volume excess diffuses with rate D. At small times, the corrosion front
linearly grows in time, but the growth velocity shows a t^{-1/2} decrease after
a crossover time of order t_c ~ D/p^2, where the average front height is of
order h_c ~ D/p. A universal scaling relation between h/h_c and t/t_c is
proposed and confirmed by simulation for 0.00005 <= p <= 0.5 in square
lattices. The roughness of the corrosion front shows a crossover from
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang scaling to Laplacian growth (diffusion-limited erosion -
DLE) at t_c. The amplitudes of roughness scaling are obtained by the same kind
of arguments as previously applied to other competitive growth models. The
simulation results confirm their validity. Since the proposed model captures

optimization investigated here is the graph cut technique. Both methods have
the advantage to lead to a global minimum. Since we can distinguish moving
objects from static elements of a scene by analyzing norm of the optical flow

detector function as the weight of the weighted total variation. This model has
been used in one of our former works. We also apply the same methods to a video
segmentation model used by Jehan-Besson, Barlaud and Aubert. In this case, only
standard perimeter is incorporated in the shape functional. We also propose
another way for finding moving objects by using an a contrario detection of
objects on the image obtained by solving the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi Total Variation
regularization problem.We can notice the segmentation can be associated to a
level set in the former methods.

coupling with bosonic excitations at finite temperature (T), employing
  Yukawa models with a massive scalar (pseudoscalar) and vector (axial-vector)
boson of mass m. The quark spectral function and the quasi-dispersion relations
are calculated at one-loop order. We find that there appears a three-peak
structure in the quark spectral function with a collective nature when T is
comparable with m, irrespective of the type of boson considered. Such a
multi-peak structure was first found in a chiral model yielding scalar
composite bosons with a decay width. We elucidate the mechanism through which
the new quark collective excitations are realized in terms of the Landau
damping of a quark (an antiquark) induced by scattering with the thermally
excited boson, which gives rise to mixing and hence a level repulsion between a
quark (antiquark) and an antiquark-hole (quark-hole) in the thermally excited
antiquark (quark) distribution. Our results suggest that the quarks in the QGP
phase can be described within an interesting quasi-particle picture with a
multi-peak spectral function. Because the models employed here are rather
generic, our findings may represent a universal phenomenon for fermions coupled
to a massive bosonic excitation with a vanishing or small width. The relevance
of these results to other fields of physics, such as neutrino physics, is also
briefly discussed. In addition, we describe a new aspect of the plasmino
excitation obtained in the hard-thermal loop approximation.

which is the logarithm of an appropriate one-dimensional radial determinant.
While these individual radial determinants can be evaluated simply and
efficiently using the Gel'fand-Yaglom method, the sum over all partial-wave
contributions diverges. A renormalization procedure is needed to unambiguously
define the finite renormalized effective action. Here we use a combination of
the Schwinger proper-time method, and a resummed uniform DeWitt expansion. This
provides a more elegant technique for extracting the large partial-wave
contribution, compared to the higher order radial WKB approach which had been
used in previous work. We illustrate the general method with a complete
analysis of the scalar one-loop effective action in a class of radially
separable SU(2) Yang-Mills background fields. We also show that this method can
be applied to the case where the background gauge fields have asymptotic limits
appropriate to uniform field strengths, such as for example in the Minkowski
solution, which describes an instanton immersed in a constant background.

geometric transitions involving SO/Sp Chern-Simons theory, localization on the
moduli space of holomorphic maps with involution, and the topological vertex.

low-dimensional homology of a group and its lower central series quotients. In
1975 W. Dwyer extended Stallings' theorem by weakening the hypothesis on the
second homology groups. The naive analogues of these theorems for the derived
series are false. In 2003 the second author introduced a new characteristic
series, associated to the derived series, called the torsion-free derived
series. The authors previously established a precise analogue, for the
torsion-free derived series, of Stallings' theorem. Here our main result is the
analogue of Dwyer's theorem for the torsion-free derived series. We also prove
a version of Dwyer's theorem for the rational lower central series. We apply
these to give new results on the Cochran-Orr-Teichner filtration of the

  In this note, I discuss some aspects of this more general Fourier transform.
In order to avoid technical difficulties, typical for the analytical approach,
I will restrict to the algebraic quantum groups. Roughly speaking, these are
the locally compact quantum groups that can be treated with purely algebraic
methods (in the framework of multiplier Hopf algebras).
  I will illustrate various notions and results using not only classical
Fourier theory on the circle group $\Bbb T$, but also on the additive group
$\Bbb Q_p$ of $p$-adic numbers. It should be observed however that these cases
are still too simple to illustrate the full power of the more general theory.

kinetic energy arising from the quantum fluctuations that turn the classical

Nelson's stochastic approach to quantum mechanics, which we use to conceptually
clarify the physical nature of part of the kinetic-energy functional in terms
of statistical fluctuations and in direct correspondence with Fisher
Information Theory. We show that the N-electron purely quantum kinetic energy

explicitly dependent on the electron phase and this has implications for the
development of accurate orbital-free kinetic-energy functionals. Also, there is

hierarchical dynamics with three plateaus. Once the highly connected hubs are
reached, the infection pervades almost the whole network in a progressive

protein segregation structure known as the immunological synapse appears to
precede antigen (Ag) uptake by B cells. The mature B cell synapse is
characterized by a central cluster of BCR/Ag molecular complexes surrounded by
a ring of LFA-1/ICAM-1 complexes. Recent experimental evidence shows receptor
clustering in B cells can occur via mechanical or signaling-driven processes.
An alternative mechanism of diffusion and affinity-dependent binding has been
proposed to explain synapse formation in the absence of signaling-driven
processes. In this work, we investigated the biophysical mechanisms that drive
immunological synapse formation in B cells across the physiological range of
BCR affinity (KA~10^6-10^10 M-1) through computational modeling. Our
computational approach is based on stochastic simulation of diffusion and
reaction events with a clearly defined mapping between probabilistic parameters
of our model and their physical equivalents. We show that a
diffusion-and-binding mechanism is sufficient to drive synapse formation only
at low BCR affinity and for a relatively stiff B cell membrane that undergoes
little deformation. We thus predict the need for alternative mechanisms: a
difference in the mechanical properties of BCR/Ag and LFA-1/ICAM-1 bonds and/or
signaling driven processes.

highlight another factor which acts on interference: a symmetry condition (SC)
concerning the experimental set-up. This condition seems even to play a role
more important than classical chaos. Indeed, when the SC is verified, classical
chaos has no effect, whereas when the SC is violated classical chaos turns out
to be an additional factor that causes dephasing at the slits. We explain the
respective roles of these two factors, by specifying the physical mechanism
through which they influence the interference patterns. This mechanism depends
both on the position and direction of the initial wave packet and on certain
its recurrences which occur especially in the regular billiards.

condensates (BECs). For certain values of the coupling strength the nonrotating
ground state is unstable with respect to fluctuations in the higher angular
momentum modes. The two branched Bogoliubov spectrum exhibits distinct regions
of instability enabling one to selectively occupy certain angular momentum
modes. For sufficiently long evolution times angular momentum Josephson
oscillations spontaneously appear, breaking the initial chiral symmetry of the
BECs.
