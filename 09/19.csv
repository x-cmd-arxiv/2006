uses the transit timing of a known, transiting planet. The transits of a
solitary planet orbiting a star occur at equally spaced intervals in time. If a
second planet is present, dynamical interactions within the system will cause
the time interval between transits to vary. These transit time variations can
be used to infer the orbital elements of the unseen, perturbing planet. I show
analytic expressions for the amplitude of the transit time variations in
several limiting cases. Under certain conditions the transit time variations
can be comparable to the period of the transiting planet. I also present the
application of this planet detection technique to existing transit observations
of the TrES-1 and HD209458 systems. While no convincing evidence for a second
planet in either system was found from those data, I constrain the mass that a
perturbing planet could have as a function of the semi-major axis ratio of the
two planets and the eccentricity of the perturbing planet. Near low-order,
mean-motion resonances (within about 1% fractional deviation), I find that a
secondary planet must generally have a mass comparable to or less than the mass
of the Earth--showing that these data are the first to have sensitivity to sub
Earth-mass planets orbiting main sequence stars. These results show that TTV
will be an important tool in the detection and characterization of extrasolar
planetary systems.

Galactic Nuclei monitored by both observatories from 4.8 to 37 GHz covering

for four gamma-ray blazars that have been nearly continuously monitored at both
observatories: 0458-020, 0528+134, 1730-130 and 2230+114. We have decomposed
the most prominent outbursts in the light curves of these four blazars into
individual components using Gaussian model fitting, and estimated the epochs,
amplitudes, and half-widths of these components as functions of frequency. We
attempt to distinguish ""core outbursts"", which show frequency-dependent time
delays and are associated with brightening of the core, from ""jet outbursts"",
which appear nearly synchronously at all frequencies and are accompanied by the
emergence of new jet components and their subsequent evolution. Available 43
GHz VLBA images allow us to identify only one pure core outburst (in 2230+114)
and one pure jet outburst (0458-020). Most of the outbursts analyzed are mixed,
in the sense that they display frequency-dependent time delays (i.e., they are
optically thick) and are associated with the eventual emergence of new jet
components. The maxima of the jet and mixed outbursts probably correspond to
epochs when newly ejected components become fully optically thin. These epochs
are also marked by a significant increase in the angular velocities of the
ejected components. There is evidence that the outbursts in 2230+114 repeat
every 8.0+-0.3 years, with the positions of individual sub-outbursts being
preserved from one quasi-periodic eight-year cycle to another, even though
their amplitudes vary by more than a factor of two.

reliability of such high-z Lya studies and the validity of the conclusions that
are based upon them. We examine whether reliable Lya fluxes (F_Lya) and
equivalent widths (W_Lya) can be estimated from narrowband imaging surveys and
whether any observational biases may be present. We have developed software to
simulate the observed line and continuum properties of synthetic LAEs in the
distant universe by adopting various typical observational techniques. This was
used to investigate how detected F_Lya and W_Lya vary with properties of the
host or IGM: internal dust reddening; intervening Lya absorption systems; the
presence of underlying stellar populations. None of the techniques studied are
greatly susceptible to underlying stellar populations or the contribution of
nebular gas. We find that techniques that use one off-line filter on the red
side of Lya result in highly inaccurate measurements of W_Lya. Adopting two
off-line filters to estimate continuum at Lya is an improvement but is still
unreliable when dust extinction is considered. Techniques that employ single
narrow- and broad-band filters with the same central wavelength are not
susceptible to internal dust, but IGM Lya absorption can cause W_Lya to be
overestimated by factors of up to 2: at z=6, the median W_Lya is overestimated
by ~25%. The most robust approach is a SED fitting technique that fits E(B-V)
and burst-age from synthetic models - broadband observations are needed that
sample the UV continuum slope, 2175AA dust feature, and the 4000AA
discontinuity. We also notice a redshift-dependent incompleteness that results
from DLA systems close to the target LAEs, amounting to ~10% at z=6.

NGC 5253. The data have been taken with the Very Large Telescope UVES echelle
spectrograph in the 3100 to 10400 angstroms range. We have measured the
intensities of a large number of permitted and forbidden emission lines in four
zones of the central part of the galaxy. In particular, we detect faint C II
and O II recombination lines (RLs). This is the first time that these lines are
unambiguously detected in a dwarf starburst galaxy. The physical conditions of
the ionized gas have been derived using a large number of different line
intensity ratios. Chemical abundances of He, N, O, Ne, S, Cl, Ar, and Fe have
been determined following the standard methods. In addition, C^{++} and O^{++}
abundances have been derived from pure RLs. These abundances are larger than
those obtained from collisionally excited lines, (CELs) (from 0.30 to 0.40 dex
for C^{++} and from 0.19 to 0.28 dex for O^{++}). This result is consistent
with a temperature fluctuations parameter (t^2) between 0.050 and 0.072. We
confirm previous results that indicate the presence of a localized N enrichment
in certain zones of the center of the galaxy. Moreover, our results also
indicate a possible slight He overabundance in the same zones. The enrichment
pattern agrees with that expected for the pollution by the ejecta of massive
stars in the Wolf-Rayet (WR) phase. The amount of enriched material needed to
produce the observed overabundance is consistent with the mass lost by the
number of WR stars estimated in the starbursts. Finally, we discuss the
possible origin of the difference between abundances derived from RLs and CELs
in H II regions, finding that a recent hypothesis based on the delayed
enrichment by SNe ejecta inclusions seems not to explain the observed features.

samples of relaxed elliptical-like-objects (ELOs) identified, at z=0, in a set
of self-consistent hydrodynamical simulations operating in the context of a
concordance cosmological model. At the halo scale they have been found to
satisfy virial relations; at the scale of the baryonic object the (logarithms
of the) ELO stellar masses, projected stellar half-mass radii, and stellar
central l.o.s. velocity dispersions define a flattened ellipsoid close to a
plane (the intrinsic dynamical plane, IDP), tilted relative to the virial one,
whose observational manifestation is the observed FP. The ELO samples have been
found to show systematic trends with the mass scale in both, the relative
content and the relative distributions of the baryonic and the dark mass ELO
components, so that homology is broken in the spatial mass distribution
(resulting in the IDP tilt), but ELOs are still a two-parameter family where
the two parameters are correlated. The physical origin of these trends
presumably lies in the systematic decrease, with increasing ELO mass, of the
relative amount of dissipation experienced by the baryonic mass component along
ELO stellar mass assembly. ELOs also show kinematical segregation, but it does
not appreciably change with the mass scale.
  The non-homogeneous population of IDPs explains the role played by the virial
mass to determine the correlations among intrinsic parameters. In this paper we
also show that the central stellar line-of-sight velocity dispersion of ELOs,
is a fair empirical estimator of the virial mass, and this explains the central
role played by this quantity at determining the observational correlations.

circumstellar disks of the targets are resolved. We fit the interferometric
visibilities with predictions from a simple disk model that assumes an
isothermal gas in Keplerian rotation. We derive fits of the four model
parameters (disk base density, radial density exponent, disk normal
inclination, and position angle) for each of the targets. The resulting
densities are in broad agreement with prior studies of the IR excess flux and
the resulting orientations generally agree with those from interferometric
H-alpha and continuum polarimetric observations. We find that the angular size
of the K' disk emission is smaller than that determined for the H-alpha
emission, and we argue that the difference is the result of a larger H-alpha
opacity and the relatively larger neutral hydrogen fraction with increasing
disk radius. All the targets are known binaries with faint companions, and we
find that companions appear to influence the interferometric visibilities in
the cases of phi Per and kappa Dra. We also present contemporaneous
observations of the H-alpha, H-gamma, and Br-gamma emission lines. Synthetic
model profiles of these lines that are based on the same disk inclination and

needed, reversing the usual direction of the field line transform. The fluxon
skeleton forms the grid for a collection of 1-D Eulerian models of plasma along

they preserve topology explicitly. Our prototype code, \emph{FLUX}, is

neutralino annihilation spectra take a very different form. In both cases we
find pronounced spectral signatures that could in principle be used to
distinguish between these two types of dark matter candidates already with
today's detector resolutions.

The helium spectrum is computed with a non local thermodynamic equilibrium
radiative transfer code. The effect of Doppler dimming / brightening is
investigated in the resonance lines of He I and He II formed in the EUV, as
well as on the He I 10830 A and 5876 A lines. We focus on the line profile
properties and the resulting integrated intensities. It is shown that the

effect of frequency redistribution in the formation mechanisms of the resonance
lines and find that it is necessary to use partial redistribution in frequency
for the resonance lines.

demonstrate that mergers of small clumps that are either initially mass
segregated, or in which mass segregation can be produced by two-body relaxation
before they merge, generically lead to larger systems which inherit the
progenitor clumps' segregation. We conclude that clusters formed in this way
are naturally mass segregated, accounting for the anomalous observations and
suggesting that this process of prompt mass segregation due to initial clumping

interactions between the stars in high-density young stellar clusters, like the
Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), change the angular momentum in their protoplanetary
discs. METHOD:Two types of simulations were combined -- N-body simulations of
the dynamics of the stars in the ONC, and angular momentum loss results from
simulations of star-disc encounters. RESULTS:It is shown that in a star-disc
encounter the angular momentum loss is usually larger than the mass loss, so
that the disc remnant has a lower specific angular momentum. Assuming an age of
1-2 Myr for the ONC, the disc angular momentum in the higher density region of
the Trapezium is reduced by 15-20% on average. Encounters therefore play an
important part in the angular momentum transport in these central regions but
are not the dominant process. More importantly, even in the outer cluster
regions the angular momentum loss is on average 3-5%. Here it is shown that a
3-5% loss in angular momentum might be enough to trigger gravitational
instabilities even in low-mass discs - a possible prerequisite for the
formation of planetary systems.

and (iii) a deep optical survey using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Each
wavelength regime contributes to the understanding of different aspects of
young stellar systems. XMM-Newton and Spitzer mapping of the central TMC is a
real breakthrough in disk characterization, offering the most detailed studies
of correlations between disk properties and high-energy magnetic processes in
any low-mass star-forming region, extending also to brown dwarfs in which disk
physics is largely unexplored. The optical data critically complements the
other two surveys by allowing clear source identification with 0.8 arcsec
resolution, identifying substellar candidates, and, when combined with NIR
data, providing the wavelength baseline to probe NIR excess emission. We report
results and correlation studies from these surveys. In particular, we address
the physical interpretation of our new X-ray data, discuss the entire young
stellar population from embedded protostars to weak-lined T Tau stars and their

that at a few keV. This directly demonstrates that the whole reflection
spectrum is much less variable than the power-law continuum. The broadband
spectral variability can be decomposed into two components - a highly variable
power-law and constant reflection - as previously inferred from other
observations in the 2-10 keV band. The strong reflection and high iron
abundance give rise to a strong broad iron line, which requires the inner disc
radius to be at about 2 gravitational radii. Our results are consistent with
the predictions of the light bending model which invokes the very strong
gravitational effects expected very close to a rapidly spinning black hole.

disc chemical evolution: the metallicity distribution (MD) of long-lived dwarfs
and the age-metallicity relation (AMR). It is shown first that the observed MD,
designed with standard methods, is more fit to a closed-box model than to the
infall MD. We argue that this is due to the specific contribution of the thick
disc population, which has been overlooked both in the derivation of the
observed MD and in the standard chemical evolution models. Although this
agreement disqualifies the MD as the best supportive evidence for infall, we
argue that the evolution must be more complex than described by either the
closed-box or the standard infall models. A new age-metallicity distribution is
obtained, where particularities of the previous recent determinations are
phased out. The new AMR shows a mean increase limited to about a factor of 2 in
Z over the disc age. It is shown that below 3 Gyrs, the dispersion in
metallicity is about 0.1 dex, which, (given the observational uncertainties),
is compatible with the small cosmic dispersion measured on the interstellar
medium and meteoritic pre-solar dust grains. A population that is progressively
older and more metal rich arises at a metallicity greater than that of the
Hyades, to reach [Fe/H] ~ +0.5 dex at ages > 5 Gyr. We suggest that this is
best explained by radial migration. A symmetrical widening towards lower
metallicities is seen at about the same age. Finally, the new derived ages are
sufficiently consistent that an AMR within the thick disc is confirmed. These
new features altogether draw a picture of the chemical evolution where
dynamical effects and complexity in the AMR dominate, rather than a generalized
high dispersion at all ages. (abridged)

LTE significantly affect the profiles of Ca I lines over the whole range of
stellar parameters considered. However, at [Ca/H] >= -2, NLTE abundance
correction of individual lines may be small in absolute value due to the
different influence of NLTE effects on line wings and the line core. At lower
Ca abundances, NLTE leads to systematically depleted total absorption in the
line and positive abundance corrections, exceeding +0.5 dex for Ca I 4226 at
[Ca/H] = -4.9. In contrast, NLTE effects strengthen the Ca II lines and lead to
negative abundance corrections. NLTE corrections are small, <= 0.02 dex, for
the Ca II resonance lines. For the IR lines of multiplet 3d - 4p, they grow in
absolute value with decreasing Ca abundance exceeding 0.4 dex in metal-poor
stars with [Fe/H] <= -3. Ca abundances are determined for the Sun, Procyon, and
seven metal-poor stars, using high S/N and high-resolution spectra at visual
and near-IR wavelengths. Lines of Ca I and Ca II give consistent abundances for
all objects (except Procyon) when collisions with hydrogen atoms are taken into
account. The derived absolute solar Ca abundance (from Ca I and Ca II lines) is
$\eps{Ca,\odot}$ = 6.38+-0.01. For Procyon, the mean Ca abundance from Ca I

mass X-ray binary V616 Mon (= A0620$-$00). V616 Mon is the proto-typical soft
x-ray transient containing a black hole primary. As such it is important to
constrain the masses of the binary components. The modeling of the infrared
observations of ellipsoidal variations in this system lead to a derived mass of
11.0 M$_{\sun}$ for the black hole. The validity of this derivation has been
called into question due to the possiblity that the secondary star's spectral
energy distribution is contaminated by accretion disk emission (acting to
dilute the variations). Our new $K$-band spectrum of V616 Mon reveals a
late-type K dwarf secondary star, but one that has very weak $^{\rm 12}$CO
absorption features. Comparison of V616 Mon with SS Cyg leads us to estimate
that the accretion disk supplies only a small amount of $K$-band flux, and the
ellipsoidal variations are not seriously contaminated. If true, the derived
orbital inclination of V616 Mon is not greatly altered, and the mass of the
black hole remains large. A preliminary stellar atmosphere model for the
$K$-band spectrum of V616 Mon reveals that the carbon abundance is
approximately 50% of the solar value. We conclude that the secondary star in
V616 Mon has either suffered serious contamination from the accretion of
supernova ejecta that created the black hole primary, or it is the stripped
remains of a formerly more massive secondary star, one in which the CNO cycle

flow, but a general theory is still lacking. Here, we start with Mohr-Coulomb
plasticity for quasi-2D granular materials to calculate (average) stresses and
slip planes, but we propose a ""stochastic flow rule"" (SFR) to replace the
principle of coaxiality in classical plasticity. The SFR takes into account two
crucial features of granular materials - discreteness and randomness - via
diffusing ""spots"" of local fluidization, which act as carriers of plasticity.
We postulate that spots perform random walks biased along slip-lines with a
drift direction determined by the stress imbalance upon a local switch from
static to dynamic friction. In the continuum limit (based on a Fokker-Planck
equation for the spot concentration), this simple model is able to predict a
variety of granular flow profiles in flat-bottom silos, annular Couette cells,
flowing heaps, and plate-dragging experiments -- with essentially no fitting
parameters -- although it is only expected to function where material is at
incipient failure and slip-lines are inadmissible. For special cases of
admissible slip-lines, such as plate dragging under a heavy load or flow down
an inclined plane, we postulate a transition to rate-dependent Bagnold
rheology, where flow occurs by sliding shear planes. With different yield
criteria, the SFR provides a general framework for multiscale modeling of
plasticity in amorphous materials, cycling between continuum limit-state stress
calculations, meso-scale spot random walks, and microscopic particle
relaxation.

based on the effects of lattice fluctuations on the quantum coherence of the

conduction occurs. It is driven by the coupling of the carrier to the molecular
lattice through polarization and transfer integral fluctuations as described by
the hamiltonian of Gosar and Choi. Localization effects in the quantum coherent
regime are modeled via the Anderson hamiltonian with correlated diagonal and
non-diagonal disorder leading to the determination of the carrier localization
length. This length defines the coherent extension of the ground state and
determines, in turn, the diffusion range in the incoherent regime and thus the
mobility. The transfer integral disorder of Troisi and Orlandi can also be
incorporated. This model, based on the idea of decoherence, allowed us to
predict the value and temperature dependence of the carrier mobility in

other, while an externally tunable Zeeman term then closes the gap between the
singlet and the one of the triplet states (with spin projection parallel the
external field). Near this degeneracy, the spin-orbit coupling leads to a
striking temperature dependence of the conductance, with observable effects of
order unity at temperatures lower than the strength of the spin-orbit coupling.

three signatures related respectively to Hyperedge Replacement (HR)

Higgs field is driven to the cutoff of the higher-dimensional theory. This
re-introduces a small hierarchy since the compactification scale 1/R should not
be smaller than the weak scale. In this paper we study possible solutions to
this problem by considering five-dimensional theories where the Higgs field
potential vanishes at tree level due to a global symmetry. We consider two
avenues: a Little Higgs model and a Twin Higgs model. An obstacle for the
embedding of these four-dimensional models in five dimensions is that their
logarithmic sensitivity to the cutoff will result in linear divergences in the
higher dimensional theory. We show that, despite the increased cutoff
sensitivity of higher dimensional theories, it is possible to control the Higgs
mass in these two scenarios. For the Little Higgs model studied, the
phenomenology will be significantly different from the case of the standard
model in UED. This is due to the fact that the compactification scale
approximately coincides with the scale where the masses of the new states
appear. For the case of the Twin Higgs model, the compactification scale may be
considerably lower than the scale where the new states appear. If it is as low
as allowed by current limits, it would be possible to experimentally observe
the standard model Kaluza-Klein states as well as a new heavy quark. On the
other hand, if the compactification scale is higher, then the phenomenology at
colliders would coincide with the one for the standard model in UED.

theories on compact six-dimensional parallelizable nil- and solvmanifolds
(quotients of six-dimensional nilpotent and solvable groups, respectively).
Some of these manifolds have appeared in the construction of string backgrounds
and are typically called twisted tori. We look for vacua directly in ten
dimensions, using the a reformulation of the supersymmetry condition in the
framework of generalized complex geometry. Certain algebraic criteria to
establish compactness of the manifolds involved are also needed. Although the
conditions for preserved N=1 supersymmetry fit nicely in the framework of
generalized complex geometry, they are notoriously hard to solve when coupled
to the Bianchi identities. We find solutions in a large-volume,
constant-dilaton limit. Among these, we identify those that are T-dual to
backgrounds of IIB on a conformal T^6 with self-dual three-form flux, and hence
conceptually not new. For all backgrounds of this type fully localized
solutions can be obtained. The other new solutions need multiple intersecting
sources (either orientifold planes or combinations of O-planes and D-branes) to
satisfy the Bianchi identities; the full list of such new solution is given.
These are so far only smeared solutions, and their localization is yet unknown.
Although valid in a large-volume limit, they are the first examples of
Minkowski vacua in supergravity which are not connected by any duality to a
Calabi-Yau. Finally, we discuss a class of flat solvmanifolds that may lead to
AdS_4 vacua of type IIA strings.

and internal spaces are properly adjusted to each other. With a proper choice
of parameters (fine tuning), effective cosmological constant in this model
provides the late time acceleration of the Universe. The fine tuning problem is
resolved in the case of the internal spaces in the form of orbifolds with
branes in fixed points. However, in this case the effective potential is too
flat (mass gravexcitons is very small) to provide necessary constancy of the
effective fundamental ""constants"".

governed by $B(\cdot,t)$ up to $T$, while for $t >T$ the solutions become

proton and neutron densities are not similar. The asymmetry of the CDFM
quasielastic scaling function is introduced, simulating in a phenomenological
way the effects which violate the symmetry for $\psi^{\prime}\geq 0$ including
the role of the final-state interaction (FSI). The superscaling properties of
the electron scattering are used to predict charge-changing neutrino-nucleus
cross sections at energies from 1 to 2 GeV. A comparison with the results of
the ERFG model is made. The analyses make it possible to gain information about
the nucleon correlation effects on both local density and nucleon momentum
distributions.

Navier-Stokes equations and turbulence in complex spaces. The necessity of
introducing complex spaces in hydrodynamics is deter-mined by the mechanism of
transition of a laminar flow into a turbulent flow. The author pro-poses a
non-traditional scenario of the transition: the cause of turbulence is in
destruction (cessation of existence) of a laminar flow. The article contains
the mathematical rationale for the necessity of development of the theory of
turbulence in the complex configurational space: the complex configurational
space is the natural area of existence of turbulence. Hydrody-namic flows are
regarded as flows on entropy manifolds that [flows] are supported by the two
symmetries: the symmetry of conservation of general entropy and the symmetry of
duality of impulse representation. The new symmetry has been introduced and
studied: the forminvari-ance of Helmholtz matrix of impulse density. The strict
foundation has been provided for the known fact of chaotic mechanics:
appearance of the new structure (a turbulent flow) is a result of interaction
of two entities: dissipation and vorticity. On the deep level the phenomenology
of turbulence in complex spaces is based on the transition from the mechanics
of a material point to the mechanics of an oriented material point, that
[transition] takes place in a current period of time.

within the framework of the hidden subgroup problem (HSP) must perform highly
entangled measurements across Omega(n log n) coset states. One of the only
known models for how such a measurement could be carried out efficiently is
Kuperberg's algorithm for the HSP in the dihedral group, in which quantum
states are adaptively combined and measured according to the decomposition of
tensor products into irreducible representations. This ``quantum sieve'' starts
with coset states, and works its way down towards representations whose
probabilities differ depending on, for example, whether the hidden subgroup is
trivial or nontrivial.
  In this paper we give strong evidence that no such approach can succeed for
Graph Isomorphism. Specifically, we consider the natural reduction of Graph
Isomorphism to the HSP over the the wreath product S_n \wr Z_2. We show, modulo
a group-theoretic conjecture regarding the asymptotic characters of the
symmetric group, that no matter what rule we use to adaptively combine quantum
states, there is a constant b > 0 such that no algorithm in this family can
solve Graph Isomorphism in e^{b sqrt{n}} time. In particular, such algorithms
are essentially no better than the best known classical algorithms, whose
running time is e^{O(sqrt{n \log n})}.
