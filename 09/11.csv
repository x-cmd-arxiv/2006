SDSS 0809+1729, classified as a star in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
The galaxy has a redshift z = 0.0441 and a B-band absolute magnitude M_B =
-17.1. With a metallicity of log(O/H)+12~7.44 or ~1/20 solar, this galaxy is
among the 10 most metal poor emission-line galaxies known. SDSS 0809+1729 is a
blue compact galaxy (BCG) with a stellar age of ~4.5 Myr, a star formation rate
of 0.18 Msun/yr, and a large gas-phase electron density ~367/cm^3. Similar
values of these parameters are common among other extremely metal poor
galaxies, including IZw18. SDSS 0809+1729 is, however, unusual among BCGs
because it lies in the same region of the luminosity-metallicity diagram as the
two lowest metallicity long duration gamma ray burst (GRB) hosts. For a given
B-band luminosity, both nearby GRB hosts and SDSS 0809+1729 have systematically
lower metallicities than dwarf irregulars, the majority of BCGs, and normal
star-forming galaxies. Because the star formation properties of SDSS 0809+1729
are similar to nearby long duration GRB hosts, SDSS 0809+1729 may be a
potential GRB host. Identification of larger samples of similar extremely metal
poor objects may provide important insights into the conditions required to
produce long duration GRBs.

homogeneous turbulence with a mean velocity shear is discussed. The transport
of magnetic helicity as a dynamical nonlinearity is taken into account. The
shear-current effect is associated with the ${\bf W} {\bf \times} {\bf J}$ term
in the mean electromotive force, where ${\bf W}$ is the mean vorticity due to
the large-scale shear motions and ${\bf J}$ is the mean electric current. This
effect causes the generation of large-scale magnetic field in a turbulence with
large hydrodynamic and magnetic Reynolds numbers. The dynamo action due to the
shear-current effect depends on the spatial scaling of the correlation time
$\tau(k)$ of the background turbulence, where $k$ is the wave number. For
Kolmogorov scaling, $\tau(k) \propto k^{-2/3}$, the dynamo instability occurs,
while when $\tau(k) \propto k^{-2}$ (small hydrodynamic and magnetic Reynolds
numbers) there is no the dynamo action in a sheared nonhelical turbulence. The
magnetic helicity flux strongly affects the magnetic field dynamics in the
nonlinear stage of the dynamo action. Numerical solutions of the nonlinear
mean-field dynamo equations which take into account the shear-current effect,
show that if the magnetic helicity flux is not small, the saturated level of
the mean magnetic field is of the order of the equipartition field determined
by the turbulent kinetic energy. Turbulence with a large-scale velocity shear
is a universal feature in astrophysics, and the obtained results can be
important for elucidation of origin of the large-scale magnetic fields in
astrophysical sheared turbulence.

a simultaneous solution for the distance modulus difference of the two objects,

advection and the outflow, and compute characteristic disc temperatures. The
bolometric luminosity exceeds the Eddington luminosity L_Edd by a logarithmic
factor 1+0.6 ln mdot (where mdot is the accretion rate in Eddington units) and
the wind kinetic luminosity is close to L_Edd. The apparent luminosity for the
face-on observer is 2-7 times higher because of geometrical beaming. Such an
observer has a direct view of the inner hot accretion disc, which has a peak
temperature T_max of a few keV in stellar-mass BHs. The emitted spectrum
extends as a power-law F_E ~ E**{-1} down to the temperature at the
spherization radius T_sp ~ mdot**(-1/2) keV. We associate T_max with a few keV
spectral components and T_sp with the soft, 0.1-0.2 keV components observed in
ULXs. An edge-on observer sees only the soft emission from the extended
envelope, with the photosphere radius exceeding the spherization radius by
orders of magnitude. The dependence of the photosphere temperature on
luminosity is consistent with that observed in the super-Eddington accreting
BHs SS 433 and V4641 Sgr. Strong outflows combined with the large intrinsic
X-ray luminosity of the central BH explain naturally the presence of the

used to derive line shifts and line widths in the interplanetary medium for
various angles of the LOS with the interstellar flow direction. The SWAN data
results were then compared to an interplanetary background upwind spectrum
obtained by STIS/HST in March 2001. We find that the LOS upwind velocity
associated with the mean line shift of the IP \lya line varies from 25.7 km/s
to 21.4 km/s from solar minimum to solar maximum. Most of this change is linked
with variations in the radiation pressure. LOS kinetic temperatures derived
from IP line widths do not vary monotonically with the upwind angle of the LOS.
This is not compatible with calculations of IP line profiles based on hot model
distributions of interplanetary hydrogen. We also find that the line profiles
get narrower during solar maximum. The results obtained on the line widths (LOS
temperature) show that the IP line is composed of two components scattered by
two hydrogen populations with different bulk velocities and temperature. This

quiet Sun being rooted in the magnetic concentrations of the chromospheric
network alone is strongly questionable. Building on that previous study we
explore the impact of magnetic configurations in the photosphere and the low
corona on the magnetic connectivity from the network to the corona.
Observational studies of this connectivity are often utilizing magnetic field
extrapolations. However, it is open to which extent such extrapolations really
represent the connectivity found on the Sun, as observations are not able to
resolve all fine scale magnetic structures. The present numerical experiments
aim at contributing to this question. We investigated random
salt-and-pepper-type distributions of kilo-Gauss internetwork flux elements
carrying some $10^{15}$ to $10^{17}$ Mx, which are hardly distinguishable by
current observational techniques. These photospheric distributions are then
extrapolated into the corona using different sets of boundary conditions at the
bottom and the top. This allows us to investigate the fraction of network flux
which is connected to the corona, as well as the locations of those coronal
regions which are connected to the network patches. We find that with current
instrumentation one cannot really determine from observations, which regions on
the quiet Sun surface, i.e. in the network and internetwork, are connected to
which parts of the corona through extrapolation techniques. Future

series in which a number of signals is present, such as arising from the
observation of multiperiodic oscillating stars in observational
asteroseismology. Standard Fourier analysis tends only to be effective in cases
when the data are perfectly regularly sampled. During normal telescope
operation it is often the case that there are large, diurnal, gaps in the data,
that data are missing, or that the data are not regularly sampled at all. For
this reason it is advantageous to perform the analysis as much as possible in
the time domain. Furthermore, for quantitative analyses of the frequency
content and power of all real signals, it is of importance to have good
estimates of the errors on these parameters. This is easiest to perform if one
can use linear combinations of the measurements. Here such a linear method is
described. The method is based in part on well-known techniques in radio
technology used in every FM radio receiver, and in part on the SOLA inverse

1177 arcmin^2 (Praesepe) and 1122 arcmin^2 (sigma Orionis) down to 5-sigma
detection limits of i'= 24.5 and z'= 24 mag, corresponding to masses of 50-55
M_Jup (Praesepe) and 6 M_Jup (sigma Orionis). Besides recovering previously
known cluster members reported in the literature, we have identified new
photometric candidates in both clusters whose masses expand the full range
covered by our study. In sigma Orionis, follow-up NIR photometry has allowed us
to confirm the likely cluster membership of three newly discovered
planetary-mass objects. The substellar mass function of sigma Orionis, which is
complete from the star-brown dwarf borderline down to 7 M_Jup, keeps rising
smoothly with a slope of alpha = 0.6^{+0.5}_{-0.1}. Very interestingly, one of
the faintest Praesepe candidates for which we have also obtained follow-up JHK
photometry nicely fits the expected optical and infrared photometric sequence
of the cluster. From its colors, we have estimated its spectral type in the
L4-L6 range. If confirmed as a true Praesepe member, it would become the first
L-type brown dwarf (50-60 M_Jup) identified in an intermediate-age star
cluster. Our derivation of the Praesepe mass function depends strongly on the
cluster age. For the youngest possible ages (500-700 Myr), our results suggest
that there is a deficit of Praesepe brown dwarfs in the central regions of the
cluster, while the similarity between the Praesepe and sigma Orionis mass
functions increases qualitatively for models older than 800 Myr.

coincides with the near-infrared nebulosity and is consistent with entrainment
of the gas by an underlying wide-angle wind. The analysis of the molecular

the colour bimodality is found to be a decreasing function of redshift, and
seems to disappear by z>1.5. Due to the large size of our sample we are able to
investigate the differing cosmological evolution of the red and blue galaxy
populations. It is found that the space density of the brightest red galaxies
(M_K < -23) stays approximately constant with redshift, and that these sources
dominate the bright-end of the luminosity function at redshifts z<1. In
contrast, the brightening of the characteristic luminosity and mild decrease in

no net polarization is detected the first five nights, a significant
photospheric field of Bz = 149 \pm 33 G is found on the sixth night. To rule
out spurious instrumental polarization, we apply the same analysis technique to
several non-magnetic telluric lines, detecting no significant polarization. We
further demonstrate the reality of this field detection by showing that the
splitting between right and left polarized components in these 12 photospheric
lines shows a linear trend with Lande g-factor times wavelength squared, as
predicted by the Zeeman effect. However, this longitudinal field detection is
still much lower than that which would result if a pure dipole magnetic
geometry is responsible for the mean magnetic field strength of 2.6 kG
previously reported for TW Hya. We also detect strong circular polarization in
the He I 5876 and the Ca II 8498 emission lines, indicating a strong field in
the line formation region of these features. The polarization of the Ca II line
is substantially weaker than that of the He I line, which we interpret as due
to a larger contribution to the Ca II line from chromospheric emission in which
the polarization signals cancel. However, the presence of polarization in the
Ca II line indicates that accretion shocks on Classical T Tauri stars do
produce narrow emission features in the infrared triplet lines of Calcium.

of the photoelectron, the bulk origin C 1$s$ peak position shifts to higher
binding energies. This systematic shift is due to the kinetic energy loss of
the high-energy photoelectron by kicking the atom, and is clear evidence of the
recoil effect in photoelectron emission. It is also observed that the
asymmetric broadening increases for the higher energy photoelectrons. All these
recoil effects can be quantified in the same manner as the M\""ossbauer effect
for $\gamma$-ray emission from nuclei embedded in crystals.

sets for binary erasure channels (BECs) and trapping sets (also known as

problem, and efficient algorithms are provided for codes of practical short
lengths n~=500. By exploiting the sparse connectivity of LDPC codes, the
stopping sets of size <=13 and the trapping sets of size <=11 can be
efficiently exhaustively determined for the first time, and the resulting
exhaustive list is of great importance for code analysis and finite code
optimization. The featured tree-based narrowing search distinguishes this
algorithm from existing ones for which inexhaustive methods are employed. One
important byproduct is a pair of upper bounds on the bit-error rate (BER) &
frame-error rate (FER) iterative decoding performance of arbitrary codes over
BECs that can be evaluated for any value of the erasure probability, including
both the waterfall and the error floor regions. The tightness of these upper
bounds and the exhaustion capability of the proposed algorithm are proved when
combining an optimal leaf-finding module with the tree-based search. These
upper bounds also provide a worst-case-performance guarantee which is crucial
to optimizing LDPC codes for extremely low error rate applications, e.g.,
optical/satellite communications. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted

a mechanism that keeps some nodes active and puts other nodes into sleep so
that the number of active nodes at a time is minimized (and thus network life
time is maximized), while maintaining full coverage and connectivity. One
simple way to do that is to partition the 3D space into cells, and only one
node in each cell remains active at a time. Our results show that the number of
active nodes can be minimized if the shape of each cell is a truncated
octahedron. It requires the sensing range to be at least 0.542326 times the
transmission radius. This value is 0.5, 0.53452 and 0.5 for cube, hexagonal

active nodes for cube, hexagonal prism and rhombic dodecahedron model is
respectively 2.372239, 1.82615 and 1.49468 times of that of truncated

Thus, it is natural to ask what is the optimal method to scan and predict a
given image, what is the resulting minimum prediction loss, and whether there
exist specific scandiction schemes which are universal in some sense.
  Specifically, we investigate the following problems: First, modeling the data
array as a random field, we wish to examine whether there exists a scandiction
scheme which is independent of the field's distribution, yet asymptotically
achieves the same performance as if this distribution was known. This question
is answered in the affirmative for the set of all spatially stationary random
fields and under mild conditions on the loss function. We then discuss the
scenario where a non-optimal scanning order is used, yet accompanied by an
optimal predictor, and derive bounds on the excess loss compared to optimal
scanning and prediction.

making for multi-dimensional data. It deals with clean, noiseless data arrays.

show the undecidability of unification for boolean description logics with

Nemeti had shown that some \forall \exists relations on natural numbers which
are neither universal nor co-universal, can be decided in Kerr spacetimes, and
had asked specifically as to the extent of computational limits there. The
purpose of this note is to address this question, and further show that MH
spacetimes can compute far beyond the arithmetic: effectively Borel statements
(so hyperarithmetic in second order number theory, or the structure of
analysis) can likewise be resolved: Theorem A. If H is any hyperarithmetic
predicate on integers, then there is an MH spacetime in which any query ? n \in
H ? can be computed. In one sense this is best possible, as there is an upper
bound to computational ability in any spacetime which is thus a universal
constant of the space-time M. Theorem C. Assuming the (modest and standard)
requirement that space-time manifolds be paracompact and Hausdorff, for any MH
spacetime M there will be a countable ordinal upper bound, w(M), on the
complexity of questions in the Borel hierarchy resolvable in it.

(LPM) effects on virtual photon emission from the quark gluon plasma as a
function of photon mass. The variational method was well tested for the LPM
effects in real photon emission by Arnold et. al., For virtual photons, LPM
effects arising from multiple scatterings of quarks in the plasma are
determined by the integral equations for the transverse vector function (${\bf
\tilde{f}(\tilde{p}_\perp)}$) and the longitudinal function ($\tilde{g}({\bf
\tilde{p}_\perp})$). We extended the variational method to solve these
transverse and longitudinal equations for a variable set \{$p_0,q_0,Q^2$\},
considering bremsstrahlung and $\bf aws$ processes. We solved these equations,
also by the self consistent iterations for comparing with the results of
variational method. In order to estimate the variational parameter, we obtained
empirical fits for the peak positions of the ${\bf

optimized variational parameter for virtual photon emission is approximately
equal to these empirical peak position values. The detailed study showed that
the variational method gives reliable results for LPM effects on virtual photon
emission for photon virtuality of the order $Q^2/T^2\le 100$. At low $Q^2$, the
peak positions for $\tilde{p}_\perp$ distributions of transverse vector
functions for virtual photons nearly coincide with the peak positions of

use of faithfully flat descent, to recover the theorem from a classification
theorem of Dieudonne-Manin type) and extends the result to allow an arbitrary
action on coefficients (previously the action on coefficients had to itself be
a lift of an absolute Frobenius). This extension is relevant to a study of
(phi, Gamma)-modules associated to families of p-adic Galois representations,
presently being initiated by Berger and Colmez.

two Wishart matrices and one normally distributed random matrix, which are
mutually independent. For a family of orthogonally equivariant estimators, we
calculate the asymptotic risks with respect to the entropy or the quadratic

numerically show 1) the convergence in both the distributions and the risks are
quick enough for a practical use, 2) the asymptotically best estimator is

modern Indian art using functional data analysis. The purpose here is not just
to understand what determines the final prices of art objects, but also the
price movement during the entire auction. We identify several factors, such as
artist characteristics (established or emerging artist; prior sales history),
art characteristics (size; painting medium--canvas or paper), competition
characteristics (current number of bidders; current number of bids) and auction
design characteristics (opening bid; position of the lot in the auction), that
explain the dynamics of price movement in an on-line art auction. We find that
the effects on price vary over the duration of the auction, with some of these
effects being stronger at the beginning of the auction (such as the opening bid
and historical prices realized). In some cases, the rate of change in prices
(velocity) increases at the end of the auction (for canvas paintings and
paintings by established artists). Our analysis suggests that the opening bid
is positively related to on-line auction price levels of art at the beginning
of the auction, but its effect declines toward the end of the auction. The
order in which the lots appear in an art auction is negatively related to the
current price level, with this relationship decreasing toward the end of the
auction. This implies that lots that appear earlier have higher current prices
during the early part of the auction, but that effect diminishes by the end of
the auction. Established artists show a positive relationship with the price
level at the beginning of the auction. Reputation or popularity of the artists
and their investment potential as assessed by previous history of sales are
positively related to the price levels at the beginning of the auction. The
medium (canvas or paper) of the painting does not show any relationship with
art auction price levels, but the size of the painting is negatively related to
the current price during the early part of the auction. Important implications
for auction design are drawn from the analysis.

solutions or discrete solitons) for the Discrete Nonlinear Schr\""odinger
Equation with saturable and power nonlinearity. Theoretical and numerical
results are proved concerning the existence and nonexistence of periodic

variational approach we are restricted to DNLS lattices with Dirichlet boundary
conditions. It is proved that there exists parameters (frequency or
nonlinearity parameters) for which the corresponding minimizers satisfy
explicit upper and lower bounds on the power. The numerical studies performed
indicate that these bounds behave as thresholds for the existence of periodic
solutions. The fixed point method considers the case of infinite lattices.
Through this method, the existence of a threshold is proved in the case of
saturable nonlinearity and an explicit theoretical estimate which is
independent on the dimension is given. The numerical studies, testing the
efficiency of the bounds derived by both methods, demonstrate that these
thresholds are quite sharp estimates of a threshold value on the power needed
for the the existence of a breather solution. This it justified by the
consideration of limiting cases with respect to the size of the nonlinearity
parameters and nonlinearity exponents.

understood signal transduction pathways in eukaryotes. It transmits the mating
signal from plasma membrane into the nucleus through the G-protein coupled

the current understandings of the mating pathway, we construct a system of
ordinary differential equations to describe the process. Our model is
consistent with a wide range of experiments, indicating that it captures some
main characteristics of the signal transduction along the pathway.
Investigation with the model reveals that the shuttling of the scaffold protein
and the dephosphorylation of kinases involved in the MAPK cascade cooperate to
regulate the response upon pheromone induction and to help preserving the
fidelity of the mating signaling. We explored factors affecting the
dose-response curves of this pathway and found that both negative feedback and
concentrations of the proteins involved in the MAPK cascade play crucial role.
Contrary to some other MAPK systems where signaling sensitivity is being
amplified successively along the cascade, here the mating signal is transmitted
through the cascade in an almost linear fashion.

frequency dependence of the spectral density determines whether or not the
quantum dynamics is coherent or incoherent, and thus whether on not one can
observe quantum interference effects such as Rabi oscillations. We find the
contributions to the spectral density from each component of the chromophore
environment: the bulk solvent, protein, and water bound to the protein. The
relative importance of each component to the quantum dynamics of the
chromophore is determined by the dynamics' time scale. Our results provide a
natural explanation and model for the different time scales observed in the
spectral density extracted from the solvation dynamics probed by ultra-fast
laser spectroscopy techniques such as the dynamic Stokes shift and three pulse
photon echo spectroscopy. Our results are used to define under what conditions
the dynamics of the excited chromophore is dominated by the surrounding protein
and when it is dominated by dielectric fluctuations in the solvent. We show
that even when the chromophore is shielded from the solvent by the protein
ultra-fast solvation can be dominated by the solvent. We suggest that the
ultra-fast solvation recently seen in some biological chromophores should not
necessarily be assigned to ultra-fast protein dynamics. Spectral densities

making particular measurements on the respective components. For pure states it
corresponds to making measurements diagonal in a corresponding Schmidt basis.
More generally, it is shown that the maximum correlation may be characterised
in terms of a `correlation basis' for the joint density operator, which defines
the corresponding (nondegenerate) optimal measurements. The maximum coincidence
rate for spin measurements on two-qubit systems is determined to be (1+s)/2,
where s is the spectral norm of the spin correlation matrix, and upper bounds
are obtained for n-valued measurements on general bipartite systems. It is
shown that the maximum coincidence rate is never greater than the computable

this system, which agrees well with direct diagonalisation of the Hamiltonian

requirements, other than an absence of decoherence, which become harder to
achieve as the system size increases. Firstly, the energies of the two distinct

entanglement between two particles located? We present a thought-experiment,
equally applicable to discrete or continuous-variable systems, in which one or
both parties makes a preliminary measurement of the state with only enough
resolution to determine whether or not the particle resides in a chosen region,
before attempting to make use of the entanglement. We argue that this provides
an operational answer to the question of how much entanglement was originally
located within the chosen region. We illustrate the approach in a spin system,
and also in a pair of coupled harmonic oscillators. Our approach is
particularly simple to implement for pure states, since in this case the
sub-ensemble in which the system is definitely located in the restricted region
after the measurement is also pure, and hence its entanglement can be simply
characterised by the entropy of the reduced density operators. For our spin
example we present results showing how the entanglement varies as a function of
the parameters of the initial state; for the continuous case, we find also how
it depends on the location and size of the chosen regions. Hence we show that
the distribution of entanglement is very different from the distribution of the
classical correlations.

theoretical approach to macroscopic realism and classical physics within
quantum theory. It focuses on the limits of observability of quantum effects of
macroscopic objects, i.e., on the required precision of our measurement
apparatuses such that quantum phenomena can still be observed. First, we
demonstrate that for unrestricted measurement accuracy no classical description
is possible for arbitrarily large systems. Then we show for a certain time
evolution that under coarse-grained measurements not only macrorealism but even
the classical Newtonian laws emerge out of the Schroedinger equation and the
projection postulate.
