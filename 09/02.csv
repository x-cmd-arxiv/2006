3 year WMAP dataset using ``slow roll reconstruction'', using the SDSS galaxy
power spectrum to gain further leverage where appropriate. This approach
inserts the inflationary slow roll parameters directly into a Monte Carlo
Markov chain estimate of the cosmological parameters, and uses the inflationary
flow hierarchy to compute the parameters' scale-dependence. We work with the
first three parameters (epsilon, eta and xi) and pay close attention to the
possibility that the 3 year WMAP dataset contains evidence for a ``running''
spectral index, which is dominated by the xi term. Mirroring the WMAP team's
analysis we find that the permitted distribution of xi is broad, and centered
away from zero. However, when we require that inflationary parameters yield at
least 30 additional e-folds of inflation after the largest observable scales
leave the horizon, the bounds on xi tighten dramatically. We make use of the
absence of an explicit pivot scale in the slow roll reconstruction formalism to
determine the dependence of the computed parameter distributions on the pivot.
We show that the choice of pivot has a significant effect on the inferred
constraints on the inflationary variables, and the spectral index and running
derived from them. Finally, we argue that the next round of cosmological data
can be expected to place very stringent constraints on the region of parameter
space open to single field models of slow roll inflation.

Galactocentric distances were calculated in a consistent manner using the
radial velocities measured by our radio recombination line survey. The large
number of nebulae widely distributed over the Galactic disk together with the
uniformity of our data provide a secure estimate of the present electron
temperature gradient in the Milky Way. Because metals are the main coolants in
the photoionized gas, the electron temperature along the Galactic disk should
be directly related to the distribution of heavy elements in the Milky Way. Our
best estimate of the electron temperature gradient is derived from a sample of
76 sources for which we have the highest quality data. The present gradient in
electron temperature has a minimum at the Galactic Center and rises at a rate
of 287 +/- 46 K/kpc. There are no significant variations in the value of the
gradient as a function of Galactocentric radius or azimuth. The scatter we find
in the HII region electron temperatures at a given Galactocentric radius is not
due to observational error, but rather to intrinsic fluctuations in these
temperatures which are almost certainly due to fluctuations in the nebular
heavy element abundances. Comparing the HII region gradient with the much
steeper gradient found for planetary nebulae suggests that the electron
temperature gradient evolves with time, becoming flatter as a consequence of
the chemical evolution of the Milky Way's disk.

all of which have evidence of an associated circumstellar disk, are accreting
matter, with rates 3x10^{-9} < Macc} < 10^{-6} Msun/yr; for 7 objects, 6 of
which are located on the ZAMS in the HR diagram, we do not detect any line
emission. Few HAe stars (25%) have Macc>10^{-7} Msun/yr. In most HAe stars the
accretion rate is sufficiently low that the gas in the inner disk, inside the
dust evaporation radius, is optically thin and does not prevent the formation
of a puffed-up rim, where dust is directly exposed to the stellar radiation.
When compared to the Macc values found for lower-mass stars in the star forming
regions Taurus and Ophiuchus, HAe stars have on average higher accretion rates
than solar-mass stars; however, there is a lack of very strong accretors among
them, probably due to the fact that they are on average older.

species as the incoming particles encounter the increasing magnetic field
within the shock front provides the basic plasma heating mechanism. The most
significant new results come from simulations with mass ratio $m_p/m_\pm =

upstream flow energy density (including particle kinetic energy and Poynting
flux), a substantial fraction of the shock heating goes into the formation of
suprathermal power-law spectra of pairs. Cyclotron absorption by the pairs of
the high harmonic ion cyclotron waves, emitted by the protons, provides the
non-thermal acceleration mechanism. As the proton fraction increases, the
non-thermal efficiency increases and the pairs' power-law spectra harden.
  We suggest that the varying power law spectra observed in synchrotron sources
powered by magnetized winds and jets might reflect the correlation of the
proton to pair content enforced by the underlying electrodynamics of these

The depression in the X-ray emission is coincident with the position of the

which may be the result of a shock that has been driven into the gas by the

produce a robust 120-object SHADES catalogue; an invaluable resource for
follow-up campaigns aiming to study the properties of a complete and consistent

represent the SEDs of real galaxies at different redshifts; (2.) A training set
of spectroscopic redshifts for a small fraction of the photometric sample; and
(3.) An iterative technique for Bayesian redshift estimates, which extracts the

with the dense stellar plasma in which it is initially embedded. We argue that
the confining pressure and inertia of the surrounding plasma acts to collimate
the magnetar's Poynting-flux-dominated outflow into tightly beamed jets and
increases its magnetic luminosity. We propose this process as an essential
ingredient in the magnetar model for gamma-ray burst and asymmetric supernova
central engines. We introduce the ``pulsar-in-a-cavity'' as an important model
problem representing a magnetized rotating neutron star inside a collapsing
star. We describe its essential properties and derive simple estimates for the
evolution of the magnetic field and the resulting spin-down power. We find that
the infalling stellar mantle confines the magnetosphere, enabling a gradual
build-up of the toroidal magnetic field due to continuous twisting. The growing
magnetic pressure eventually becomes dominant, resulting in a
magnetically-driven explosion. The initial phase of the explosion is
quasi-isotropic, potentially exposing a sufficient amount of material to
$^{56}$Ni-producing temperatures to result in a bright supernova. However, if
significant expansion of the star occurs prior to the explosion, then very
little $^{56}$Ni is produced and no supernova is expected. In either case, hoop
stress subsequently collimates the magnetically-dominated outflow, leading to
the formation of a magnetic tower. After the star explodes, the decrease in
bounding pressure causes the magnetic outflow to become less beamed. However,
episodes of late fallback can reform the beamed outflow, which may be
responsible for late X-ray flares.

been made in forecasting the strength and timing of this 11-year cycle, using a
predictive flux-transport dynamo model (Dikpati 2005, Dikpati et al. 2006). We
can strengthen the foundation of this model by extending it to match
observations of similar magnetic activity cycles in other Sun-like stars, which
exhibit variations in their Ca II H and K emission on time scales from 2.5 to
25 years (Baliunas et al. 1995). This broad range of cycle periods is thought
to reflect differences in the rotational properties and the depth of the
surface convection zone for stars with various masses and ages.
Asteroseismology is now yielding direct measurements of these quantities for
individual stars, but the most promising asteroseismic targets are in the
southern sky (alpha Cen A, alpha Cen B, beta Hyi), while the existing activity
cycle survey is confined to the north. We are initiating a long-term survey of

The bulk of the emission is largely confined to half of the orbit, peaking
around the inferior conjunction epoch of the compact object. The flux
modulation provides the first indication of gamma-ray absorption by pair
production on the intense stellar photon field. This implies that the
production region size must be not significantly greater than the gamma-gamma
photosphere size (~1 AU), thus excluding the large scale collimated outflows or
jets (extending out to ~1000 AU). A hardening of the spectrum is also observed
at the same epoch between 0.2 and a few TeV which is unexpected under a pure
absorption scenario and could rather arise from variation with phase in the
maximum electron energy and/or the dominant VHE gamma-ray production mechanism.
This first-time observation of modulated gamma-ray emission allows precise

potentials that occur naturally in the analysis of finite quantum systems.
Special attention is paid, in particular, to the so-called Fokker-Planck
potential, which has a particular property: the perturbation series for the
ground-state energy vanishes to all orders in the coupling parameter, but the
actual ground-state energy is positive and dominated by instanton
configurations of the form exp(-a/g), where a is the instanton action. The
instanton effects are most naturally taken into account within the modified
Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization conditions whose expansion leads to the
generalized perturbative expansions (so-called resurgent expansions) for the
energy values of the Fokker-Planck potential. Until now, these resurgent
expansions have been mainly applied for small values of coupling parameter g,
while much less attention has been paid to the strong-coupling regime. In this
contribution, we compare the energy values, obtained by directly resumming
generalized Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization conditions, to the strong-coupling
expansion, for which we determine the first few expansion coefficients in
powers of g^(-2/3). Detailed calculations are performed for a wide range of
coupling parameters g and indicate a considerable overlap between the regions
of validity of the weak-coupling resurgent series and of the strong-coupling
expansion. Apart from the analysis of the energy spectrum of the Fokker-Planck
Hamiltonian, we also briefly discuss the computation of its eigenfunctions.
These eigenfunctions may be utilized for the numerical integration of the
(single-particle) time-dependent Schroedinger equation and, hence, for studying
the dynamical evolution of the wavepackets in the double-well-like potentials.

of the interlayer coupling, we observed for the first time the splitting of the

dispersion (as in the case of graphene), coexisting with quasiparticles
characterized by parabolic dispersion and finite effective mass. We also report
the first ARPES signatures of electron-phonon interaction in graphite: a kink
in the dispersion and a sudden increase in the scattering rate. Moreover, the
lattice disorder strongly affects the low energy excitations, giving rise to
new localized states near the Fermi level. These results provide new insights

a broad range of values of $G$, with a power-law tail distribution $\Phi_{\rm

exponent for the scale-free network degree distribution. We confirm our

transport in scale-free networks, compared to Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi networks

develop a simple physical picture of the transport to account for the results.

conductance is defined as the number of link-independent paths between the two
nodes, and find that a similar picture holds. The effects of distance on the
value of conductance are considered for both models, and some differences
emerge. We then extend our study to the case of multiple sources, where the
transport is define between two \emph{groups} of nodes. We find a fundamental
difference between the two forms of flow when considering the quality of the

central role is played by a single nonlocal invariant, the irreducible string,
whose interplay with the driven motion of reconstituting dimers, arising from
the assisted hopping, determines the asymptotic dynamics and scaling regimes.
These are investigated both analytically and numerically through
sector-dependent mappings to the asymmetric simple exclusion process.

momentum. The muons were decay products from semi-leptonic decays of open charm
mesons as well as decays from lighter non-charmed mesons (pions and kaons).
Data were taken simultaneously from two interaction regions; one of two thin
nuclear targets and a copper beam dump 92 inches downstream. The open decay
length for hadrons produced in the targets increased the contribution to the
muon spectrum from light hadron decays, relative to those from the dump.
Production cross sections for light hadrons from previous experiments were used
in conjunction with parameterized open charm cross sections to produce total
Monte Carlo single muon spectra that were subsequently fit to the data.
  The sensitivity of this measurement covered an open charm hadron transverse
momentum range of approximately 2 to 7 GeV/c, center-of-mass rapidity, y,
between 0 and 2, and Feynman-x between 0.2 and 0.8. Extrapolation of the cross
sections to small transverse momentum shows good agreement with previous
experiments. The power alpha of the nuclear dependency A^{alpha(p_T)} was
calculated as a function of transverse momentum. The result indicates that
alpha is transverse-momentum dependent, albeit within large errors.

hyperplanes in H, if their intersection is nonempty, meet in a subspace that is
a topological hyperplane in the intersection of any k-1 of them; but two
topological hyperplanes that do intersect need not cross each other. If every
intersecting pair does cross, the arrangement is affine. The number of regions
formed by an arrangement of topological hyperplanes has the same formula as for
arrangements of affine hyperplanes. Hoping to explain this geometrically, we
ask whether parts of the topological hyperplanes in any arrangement can be
reassembled into an arrangement of affine topological hyperplanes with the same
regions. That is always possible if the dimension is two but not in higher
dimensions. We also ask whether all affine topological hyperplane arrangements
correspond to oriented matroids; they need not, but we can characterize those
that do if the dimension is two. In higher dimensions this problem is open.
Another open question is to characterize the intersection semilattices of
topological hyperplane arrangements; a third is to prove that the regions of an
arrangement of topological hyperplanes are necessarily cells.

application is to interval coloring in which the interval of available colors

in few- and many-body calculations, have generally been formulated with a sharp
cutoff on relative momenta. However, a sharp cutoff has technical disadvantages
and can cause convergence problems at the 10-100 keV level in the deuteron and
triton. This motivates using smooth momentum-space regulators as an
alternative. We generate low-momentum interactions with smooth cutoffs both
through energy-independent renormalization group methods and using a multi-step
process based on the Bloch-Horowitz approach. We find greatly improved
convergence for calculations of the deuteron and triton binding energies in a
harmonic oscillator basis compared to results with a sharp cutoff. Even a
slight evolution of chiral effective field theory interactions to lower momenta
is beneficial. The renormalization group preserves the long-range part of the
interaction, and consequently the renormalization of long-range operators, such
as the quadrupole moment, the radius and 1/r, is small. This demonstrates that
low-energy observables in the deuteron are reproduced without short-range
correlations in the wave function.

all the nanoparticles, a main resonance with a dipolar character was identified

efficiency and high pion rejection. Since muons at the ILC are often produced
with or in jets, for many of the physics channels of interest[1], an efficient
algorithm to deal with the identification and separation of particles within
jets is important. The algorithm at the core of the method accounts for the
effects of the magnetic field and for the loss of energy by charged particles
due to ionization in the detector. We have chosen to develop the analysis
within the setup of one of the Linear Collider Concept Detectors adopted by the
US. Within b-pair production jets, particles cover a wide range in momenta;
however ~ 80% of the particles have a momentum below 30 GeV[2]. Our study,
focused on bbar-b jets, is preceded by a careful analysis of single energy
particles between 2 and 50 GeV. As medium energy particles are a substantial
component of the jets, many of the particles lose part of their energy in the
calorimeters and the solenoid coil before reaching the muon detector where they
may have energy below 2 GeV. To deal with this problem we have implemented a
Runge-Kutta correction of the calculated trajectory to better handle these
lower energy particles. The multiple scattering and other stochastic processes,
more important at lower energy, is addressed by a Kalman-filter integrated into
the reconstruction algorithm. The algorithm provides a unique and powerful
separation of muons from pions. The 5 Tesla magnetic field from a solenoid
surrounds the hadron calorimeter and allows the reconstruction and precision
momentum measurement down to a few GeV.

divergence of orthologous genes of the genomes analyzed and suggest the
following: 1) The true tree relationship among the species studied is still
maintained by the largest group of orthologous genes; 2) There are usually more
orthologous genes with higher similarities between genetically closer species
than between genetically more distant ones; and 3) The maximum gene-support
