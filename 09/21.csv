very large scales (0.01<k[h/Mpc]<0.15), due to non-linear effects from dynamics
and halo bias. We pursue a two line offensive: high resolution numerical
simulations are used to establish several new results, and an analytic model is
developed to understand their origins. Our simulations show: (i) that the z=0
dark matter power spectrum is suppressed relative to linear theory by ~5% on
scales (0.05<k[h/Mpc]<0.075); (ii) that, indeed, halo bias is non-linear over
the scales we probe and that the scale dependence is a strong function of halo
mass. High mass haloes show no suppression of power on scales (k<0.07[h/Mpc]),
and only show amplification on smaller scales, whereas low mass haloes show
strong, ~5-10%, suppression over the range (0.05 <k[h/Mpc] <0.15). Our results
have relevance for studies of the baryon acoustic oscillation features.
Non-linear mode-mode coupling: (i) damps these features on progressively larger
scales as halo mass increases; (ii) produces small shifts in the positions of
the peaks and troughs which depend on halo mass. Our analytic model is
described in the language of the `halo-model'. However, for the first time the
halo-halo clustering term is propagated into the non-linear regime using
`1-loop' perturbation theory and a non-linear halo bias model. We show that,
with bias parameters derived from simulations, the model predictions are in
agreement with the numerical results. We then use the model to explore the
scale dependence of galaxies of different colour and find significant
differences between the power spectra of the two populations. Thus
understanding the scale dependent bias for a given galaxy sample will be
crucial for deriving accurate cosmological constraints. (Abridged)

that their cooling time is short. In protoplanetary disks radiative cooling is
likely to be too slow to permit formation of planets by fragmentation within
several tens of AU from the star. Recently, convection has been suggested as a
faster means of heat loss from the disk but here we demonstrate that it is only
marginally more efficient than the radiative cooling. The crucial factor is the
rate at which energy can be radiated from the disk photosphere, which is
robustly limited from above in the convective case by the adiabatic temperature
gradient (given a certain midplane temperature). Thus, although vigorous
convection is definitely possible in disks, the inefficiency of radiative loss
from the photosphere may create a bottleneck limiting the ability of the disk
to form self-gravitating objects. Based on this argument we derive a set of
analytical constraints which diagnose the susceptibility of an unstable disk to
fragmentation and show that the formation of giant planets by fragmentation of
protoplanetary disks is unlikely to occur at distances of tens of AU. At the
same time these constraints do not preclude the possibility of fragmentation
and star formation in accretion disks around supermassive black holes.

grid of 130 one-dimensional models. It is shown that the observable properties
of SNe Ia resulting from Chandrasekhar-mass explosions are chiefly determined
by their final composition and some measure of ``mixing'' in the explosion. A
grid of final compositions is explored including essentially all combinations
of 56Ni, stable ``iron'', and intermediate mass elements that result in an
unbound white dwarf. Light curves (and in some cases spectra) are calculated
for each model using two different approaches to the radiation transport
problem. Within the resulting templates are models that provide good
photometric matches to essentially the entire range of observed SNe Ia. On the
whole, the grid of models spans a wide range in B-band peak magnitudes and
decline rates, and does not obey a Phillips relation. In particular, models
with the same mass of 56Ni show large variations in their light curve decline
rates. We identify the physical parameters responsible for this dispersion, and
consider physically motivated ``cuts'' of the models that agree better with the
Phillips relation. For example, models that produce a constant total mass of
burned material of 1.1 +/- Msun do give a crude Phillips relation, albeit with
much scatter. The scatter is further reduced if one restricts that set to
models that make 0.1 to 0.3 Msun of stable iron and nickel isotopes, and then
mix the ejecta strongly between the center and 0.8 Msun. We conclude that the
supernovae that occur most frequently in nature are highly constrained by the
Phillips relation and that a large part of the currently observed scatter in
the relation is likely a consequence of the intrinsic diversity of these
objects.

timescales for the sedimentation of heavy elements. Motivated by observations
of Type I X-ray bursts from sources with extremely low persistent accretion
luminosities, $L_X < 10^{36}\usp\ergspersecond (\simeq
0.01\ensuremath{L_{\mathrm{Edd}}}$), we study how sedimentation affects the
distribution of isotopes and the ignition of H and He in the envelope of an
accreting neutron star. For local mass accretion rates $\mdot \lesssim
10^{-2}\medd$ (for which the ignition of H is unstable), where $\medd =
8.8\times 10^{4}\nsp\gpscps$, the helium and CNO elements sediment out of the
accreted fuel before reaching a temperature where H would ignite. Using
one-zone calculations of the thermonuclear burning, we find a range of
accretion rates for which the unstable H ignition does not trigger unstable He
burning. This range depends on the emergent flux from reactions in the deep
neutron star crust; for $F = 0.1\nsp\MeV(\dot{m}/\mb)$, the range is $3\times
10^{-3}\medd\lesssim\mdot\lesssim 10^{-2}\medd$. We speculate that sources
accreting in this range will build up a massive He layer that later produces an
energetic and long X-ray burst. At mass accretion rates lower than this range,
we find that the H flash leads to a strong mixed H/He flash. Surprisingly, even
at accretion rates $\mdot \gtrsim 0.1\medd$, although the H and He do not
completely segregate, the H abundance at the base of the accumulated layer is
still reduced. While following the evolution of the X-ray burst is beyond the
scope of this introductory paper, we note that the reduced proton-to-seed ratio
favors the production of \iso{12}{C}--an important ingredient for subsequent
superbursts.

higher space density of z=0.9 red galaxies than some of the recent literature,
in part because we account for the faint yet significant galaxy flux which
falls outside of our photometric aperture. The B-band luminosity density of red

by only 36 percent from z=0 to z=1. If red galaxy stellar populations have
faded by 1.24 B-band magnitudes since z=1, the stellar mass contained within

consistent with star-forming galaxies being transformed into ~L* red galaxies
after a decline in their star formation rates. In contrast, the evolution of
4L* red galaxies differs only slightly from a model with negligible star
formation and no galaxy mergers since z=1. If this model approximates the
luminosity evolution of red galaxy stellar populations, then 80 percent of the
stellar mass contained within today's 4L* red galaxies was already in place at
z=0.7. While red galaxy mergers have been observed, such mergers do not produce
rapid growth of 4L* red galaxy stellar masses between z=1 and the present day.

clusters at z~0.5. We focus on the fundamental plane (FP) relation, and combine
the kinematics with structural parameters determined from HST images. The
galaxies obey clear FP relations, which are offset from the FP of the nearby
Coma cluster due to passive evolution of the stellar populations. The z~0.5
data are combined with published data for 11 additional clusters at
0.18<z<1.28, to determine the evolution of the mean M/L(B) ratio of cluster
galaxies with masses M>10^11 M_sun, as implied by the FP. We find
dlog(M/L(B))/dz = -0.555+-0.042, stronger evolution than was previously
inferred from smaller samples. The observed evolution depends on the
luminosity-weighted mean age of the stars in the galaxies, the initial mass
function (IMF), selection effects due to progenitor bias, and other parameters.
Assuming a normal IMF but allowing for various other sources of uncertainty we
find z* = 2.01+-0.20 for the luminosity-weighted mean star formation epoch. The
main uncertainty is the slope of the IMF in the range 1-2 Solar masses: we find
z* = 4.0 for a top-heavy IMF with slope x=0. The M/L(B) ratios of the cluster
galaxies are compared to those of recently published samples of field
early-type galaxies at 0.32<z<1.14. Assuming that progenitor bias and the IMF
do not depend on environment we find that the present-day age of stars in
massive field galaxies is 4.1 +- 2.0 % (~0.4 Gyr) less than that of stars in
massive cluster galaxies, consistent with most, but not all, previous studies
of local and distant early-type galaxies. This relatively small age difference

coincides in detail with the S-shaped jet recently found in Spitzer IRAC

l^2C_l~1\times10^{-12}. The peak scale is determined by the typical size of the
ionized regions and roughly corresponds to the ionized bubble sizes observed in
our simulations, ~5-20 Mpc. The kSZ anisotropy signal from reionization
dominates the primary CMB signal above l=3000. This predicted kSZ signal at
arcminute scales is sufficiently strong to be detectable by upcoming
experiments, like the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and South Pole Telescope
which are expected to have ~1' resolution and ~muK sensitivity. The extended
and patchy nature of the reionization process results in a boost of the peak
signal in power by approximately one order of magnitude compared to a uniform
reionization scenario, while roughly tripling the signal compared with that
based upon the assumption of gradual but spatially uniform reionization. At
large scales the patchy kSZ signal depends largely on the ionizing source
efficiencies and the large-scale velocity fields: sources which produce photons
more efficiently yield correspondingly higher signals. The introduction of
sub-grid gas clumping in the radiative transfer simulations produces
significantly more power at small scales, and more non-Gaussian features, but
has little effect at large scales. The patchy nature of the reionization

of ~0.05-4. Only 33% (25/77) of these objects are normal type-1 quasars, with
no obscuration. 44% (34/77) are type-2 objects, with high-ionization, narrow
emission lines, 14% (11/77) are dust-reddened type-1 quasars, showing broad
lines but a dust-reddened or unusually weak quasar continuum. 9% (7/77) show no
sign of an AGN in the optical spectrum, having either starburst spectra or
spectra which could be of either starburst or LINER types. These latter objects
are analogous to the X-ray detected population of AGN with weak or non-existent
optical AGN emission (the ``XBONGs''). 21 of our objects from the SWIRE field
fall within moderately-deep XMM exposures. All the unobscured quasars, and
about half the obscured quasars are detected in these exposures. This sample,
when taken together with other samples of Spitzer selected AGN and quasars, and
results from X-ray studies, confirms that obscured AGN dominate the AGN and
quasar number counts of all rapidly-accreting supermassive black hole systems,
at least for z~<4. This implies a high radiative efficiency for the black hole
accretion process.

field near the surface of the neutron star, possibly accompanied by fractures
in the crust. The explosive release of over 10^46 ergs (isotropic equivalent)
powered a one-sided mildly relativistic outflow. The outflow produced a new
expanding radio nebula, that is still visible over a year after the GF. Also
considered are the constraints on the total energy in the GF, the energy and

of a thin outer layer of the star, $\Delta R(t)$. The layer rotates slower than
the star due to angular momentum conservation. The shear between the star and
the layer acts to twist the star's dipole magnetic field giving at first a
trailing spiral field. The twist of the field acts in turn to `torque up' the
layer increasing its specific angular momentum. As the layer cools and
contracts, its excess specific angular momentum causes it to {\it rotate
faster} than the star which gives a leading spiral magnetic field. The process
repeats, giving rise to torsional oscillations. We derive equations for the
angular velocity and magnetic field of the layer taking into account the
diffusivity and viscosity which are probably due to turbulence. The magnetic
field causes a nonuniformity of the star's photosphere (at the top of the
heated layer), and this gives rise to the observed X-ray oscillations. The fact
that the layer periodically rotates faster than the star means that the X-ray
oscillation frequency may ``overshoot'' the star's rotation frequency.
Comparison of the theory is made with observations of Chakrabarty et al. (2003)
of an X-ray burst of SAX J1808.4-3658.

stellar--mass seeds at high redshift. Rapid growth without violating the
Eddington limit requires that most mass is gained while the hole has a low spin
and thus a low radiative accretion efficiency. If, as was formerly thought, the
black--hole spin aligns very rapidly with the accretion flow, even a
randomly--oriented sequence of accretion events would all spin up the hole and
prevent rapid mass growth. However, using a recent result that the
Bardeen--Petterson effect causes {\it counter}alignment of hole and disc spins
under certain conditions, we show that holes can grow rapidly in mass if they
acquire most of it in a sequence of randomly oriented accretion episodes whose
angular momenta $J_d$ are no larger than the hole's angular momentum $J_h$.
Ultimately the hole has total angular momentum comparable with the last
accretion episode. This points to a picture in which the accretion is chaotic
on a lengthscale of order the disc size, that is $\la 0.1$ pc.

the stellar mass component a compact dark mass (black hole) of M_bh =
2.7(-2.0,+2.4) 10**8 M_sun (uncertainties at a 2 sigma level); the radius of
its sphere of influence (R_sph ~ 0"".16) is well resolved at the HST resolution.
The BH mass estimate in NGC 3998 is in good agreement with both the M_bh vs.
M_bul (with an upward scatter by a factor of ~2) and M_bh vs. sigma
correlations (with a downward scatter by a factor of ~3-7, depending on the
form adopted for the dependence of M_bh on sigma). Although NGC 3998 cannot be
considered as an outlier, its location with respect to the M_bh-sigma relation
conforms with the trend suggesting the presence of a connection between the
``residuals'' from the M_bh-sigma correlation and the galaxy's effective
radius. In fact, NGC 3998 has one of the smallest values of R_e among the
galaxies with measured M_bh (0.85 kpc) and it shows a negative residual. This
suggests that a combination of both sigma and R_e is necessary to drive the

accretion disc show the presence of at least two spectral components. One
component is black-body radiation from an optically thick standard accretion
disc. The other is produced in a optically thin corona and usually shows a
powerlaw behaviour. Electron-proton (ep) bremsstrahlung is one of the
contributing radiation mechanisms in the corona. Soft photons from the
optically thick disc can Compton cool the electrons in the corona and therefore
lead to a two-temperature plasma, where electrons and ions have different
temperatures. Aims: We qualitatively discuss effects on ep-bremsstrahlung in
the presence of such a two-temperature plasma. Methods: We use the classical
dipole approximation allowing for non-relativistic electrons and protons and
apply quantum corrections through high-precision Gaunt factors. Results: In the
two-temperature case (T_e< T_p) the protons cause a significant fraction of the
ep-bremsstrahlung if their speed is high compared to the electrons. We give
accurate values for ep-bremsstrahlung including quantum-mechanical corrections
in the non-relativistic limit and give some approximations in the relativistic
limit. Conclusions: The formulae presented in this paper can be used in models

J005510.7-373855, detected in the 1992 May/June ROSAT data and in the 2000/2001
XMM-Newton data, fell below detectability. This source already appeared highly
variable in ROSAT observations. Aims. We report on the temporal and spectral
analysis of this new supersoft source (SSS) and compare its properties with the

light curve of XMMU J005455.0-374117 does not show large fluctuations in any of
the observations and its spectrum can be modelled with an absorbed blackbody
with kT~60eV. The corresponding bolometric luminosity is 8.1e38 erg/s in the
first observation and drops to 2.2e38 erg/s six months later. No optical source
brighter than mV~21.7 mag is found coincident with its position. Conclusions.
The luminosity of these two SSSs is higher than what has been found for
`classical' SSSs. Their nature could be explained by beamed emission from
steady nuclear burning of hydrogen onto white dwarfs, or accretion onto
stellar-mass black hole with matter outflow or observed at high inclination
angle. The presence of an intermediate-mass black hole seems unlikely in our
case.

their luminosity function.
  Methods. HII region luminosity functions are derived for individual galaxies
which, after photometric calibration, are summed to form a total luminosity
function comprising 17,797 HII regions from 53 galaxies.
  Results. The total luminosity function, above its lower limit of
completeness, is clearly best fitted by a double power law with a significantly
steeper slope for the high luminosity portion of the function. This change of
slope has been reported in the literature for individual galaxies, and occurs
at a luminosity of log L = 38.6\pm0.1 (L in erg/s) which has been termed the
Stromgren luminosity. A steep fall off in the luminosity function above log L =
40 is also noted, and is related to an upper limit to the luminosities of
underlying massive stellar clusters. Detailed data are presented for the
individual sample galaxies.
  Conclusions. The luminosity functions of HII regions in spiral galaxies show
a two slope power law behaviour, with a significantly steeper slope for the
high luminosity branch. This can be modelled by assuming that the high
luminosity regions are density bounded, though the scenario is complicated by
the inhomogeneity of the ionized interstellar medium. The break, irrespective
of its origin, is of potential use as a distance indicator for disc galaxies.

appropriate to the plasma membrane of human red blood cells. We follow these
barriers as the composition of hexagonal-formers is then increased in the cis
layer and decreased in the trans layer, again to an extent comparable to the
biological system. We find that, while the fusion pathway exhibits two barriers
in both the standard and alternative pathways, in both cases the magnitudes of
these barriers are comparable to one another, and small, on the order of 13 kT.
As a consequence, one expects that once the bilayers are brought sufficiently

cubic or tetrahedral symmetry for arbitrary order parameters and Fermi surfaces
and identify the stable states in zero applied field. We further examine the
possibility of having multiple superconducting transitions arising from the
weak breaking of a higher symmetry group to cubic or tetrahedral symmetry.
Specifically, we consider two higher symmetry groups. The first is a weak
crystal field theory in which the spin-singlet Cooper pairs have an approximate
spherical symmetry. The second is a weak spin orbit coupling theory for which
spin-triplet Cooper pairs have a cubic orbital symmetry and an approximate
spherical spin rotational symmetry. In hexagonal UPt_3, these theories easily
give rise to multiple transitions. However, we find that for cubic materials,
there is only one case in which two superconducting transitions occur within
weak coupling theory. This sequence of transitions does not agree with the
observed properties of PrOs_4Sb_{12}. Consequently, we find that to explain two
transitions in PrOs_4Sb_{12} using approximate higher symmetry groups requires
a strong coupling theory. In view of this, we finally consider a weak coupling
theory for which two singlet representations have accidentally nearly
degenerate transition temperatures (not due to any approximate symmetries). We
provide an example of such a theory that agrees with the observed properties of
PrOs_4Sb_{12}.

magnetic and structural transitions. The model consists of an orbitally doubly
degenerate conduction band and a periodic array of local moments. The band
electrons interact with the local spins via the s-f interaction. The
interaction of the band electrons with phonons is introduced by including band
Jahn-Teller (J-T) interaction. The model Hamiltonian, including the above
terms, is solved for the single particle Greens function. In doing this an
ansatz for selfenergy of electrons, which was developed earlier has been
utilized. The quasiparticle density of states (QDOS) and hence the orbital
populations are calculated treating the ferromagnetism of local moments in the
mean field approximation. The critical value of electron-phonon interaction
($G$) for the appearance of the band J-T distortion is higher in the
ferromagnetic state. The strain appears at a critical temperature ($T_s$) when
$G$ is greater than the critical value. The onset of ferromagnetism at $T_C$
($<T_s$) arrests the growth of the strain. It is concluded that the
magnetization hinders the structural transition. The quasiparticle density of

interest, it is proposed that the magnetocaloric effect may be used as an
appropriate tool for the qualitative study of slow relaxation processes in the
spin ice regime. In the high temperature regime the temperature change on
adiabatic demagnetization was found to be consistent with previously published
entropy versus temperature curves. At low temperatures (T < 0.4 K) cooling by
adiabatic demagnetization was followed by an irreversible rise in temperature
that persisted after the removal of the applied field. The relaxation time
derived from this temperature rise was found to increase rapidly down to 0.3 K.
The data near to 0.3 K indicated a transition into a metastable state with much
slower relaxation, supporting recent neutron scattering results. In addition,
magnetic dilution of 50 % concentration was found to significantly prolong the
dynamical response in the milikelvin temperature range, in contrast with
results reported for higher temperatures at which the spin correlations are
suppressed. These observations are discussed in terms of defects and loop
correlations in the spin ice state.

over an appropriate phase distribution shows that there is a perfect
equivalence between the models for the case of one single-channel probe.
Interestingly, the appropriate phase distribution function is found to be
uniform. A uniform distribution is provided by a chaotic cavity with a long
dwell time. The dwell time of a chaotic cavity plays a role similar to the
charge response time of a voltage or dephasing probe. For multi-channel or

compression techniques, and perform a number of experiments with lossy
compression and denoising of objects from different domains. We also introduce
a natural generalization to lossy compression with side information. To
maintain full generality we need to address a difficult searching problem.
While our solutions are therefore not time efficient, we do observe good
denoising and compression performance.

that cosmologies with variable cosmological parameters can mimic more
traditional DE pictures exclusively based on scalar fields (e.g. quintessence

context of a renormalization group running cosmological term, Lambda. Here we
analyze the possibility that both the cosmological term and the gravitational
coupling, G, are running parameters within a more general framework (a variant
of the so-called ``LXCDM models'') in which the DE fluid can be a mixture of a
running Lambda and another dynamical entity X (the ``cosmon'') which may behave
quintessence-like or phantom-like. We compute the effective EOS parameter, w,
of this composite fluid and show that the LXCDM can mimic to a large extent the
standard LCDM model while retaining features hinting at its potential composite
nature (such as the smooth crossing of the cosmological constant boundary
w=-1). We further argue that the LXCDM models can cure the cosmological
coincidence problem. All in all we suggest that future experimental studies on
precision cosmology should take seriously the possibility that the DE fluid can
be a composite medium whose dynamical features are partially caused and
renormalized by the quantum running of the cosmological parameters.

simple constant or radiative boundary conditions, which we show to be
well-posed in the scalar wave case. The main motivation for this work, however,
is to evolve black holes for the first time with the BSSN system by means of a
spectral method. We use our new code to simulate the evolution of a single
black hole using all applicable methods that are usually employed when the BSSN
system is used together with finite differencing methods. In particular, we use
black hole excision and test standard radiative and also constant outer
boundary conditions. Furthermore, we study different gauge choices such as
$1+\log$ and constant densitized lapse. We find that these methods in principle
do work also with our spectral method. However, our simulations fail after
about $100M$ due to unstable exponentially growing modes. The reason for this
failure may be that we evolve the black hole on a full grid without imposing
any symmetries. Such full grid instabilities have also been observed when
finite differencing methods are used to evolve excised black holes with the

obtained in both cases. In an s-channel picture of the high energy scattering
both models can be viewed as reaction-diffusion processes. We derive known

glueballs will have unique dynamical properties if the <G_0|\bar qq> amplitude
is suppressed by chiral symmetry, as it is to all orders in perturbation
theory: for instance, mixing of G_0 with \bar qq mesons would be suppressed,
radiative J/psi decay would be a filter for new physics in the spin zero
channel, and the decay G_0 \to \bar KK could be enhanced relative to G_0 \to
\pi \pi. These properties are consistent with the identification of f_0(1710)
as the largely unmixed ground state scalar glueball, while recent BES data
implies that f_0(1500) does not contain the dominant glueball admixture. Three

predominantly f_0(1710) or 3) is strongly mixed between f_0(1500) and

finding the critical points of the action and then quantizing the spectrum of

there do not exist, in general, any critical points of the action on the space

the functional integration into the space of complex fields so as to pass
through the complex critical points according to the method of steepest

results are based on the exact numerical solution to the rate equation which
are consistent with Monte Carlo simulations of the model's dynamics. Power-law
degree distributions with apparent exponents $<1$ were observed for generic
parameter choices. However, a proper finite-size scaling analysis revealed that
the actual critical exponent in such cases is equal to 1. We present a
mean-field argument to determine the asymptotic value of the average degree,
illustrating the existence of an attractive fixed point, and corroborate this
result with numerical simulations of the first moment of the degree

results, we show that the apparent exponent is determined by the

triggered seismicity based on mechanical and thermodynamic principles. It
predicts that, above a triggering magnitude cut-off $M_0$, the exponent $p$ of
the Omori law for the seismic decay of aftershocks is a linear increasing
function $p(M) =a M+b$ of the main shock magnitude $M$. We previously reported
empirical support for this prediction, using the Southern California SCEC
catalog. Here, we confirm this law using an updated, longer version of the same
catalog, as well as new methods to estimate $p$. One of this methods is the
newly defined Scaling Function Analysis, adapted from the wavelet transform.
This method is able to measure a singularity ($p$-value), erasing the possible
regular part of a time series. The Scaling Function Analysis also proves
particularly efficient to reveal the coexistence of several types of relaxation
laws (typical Omori sequences and short-lived swarms sequences) which can be
mixed within the same catalog. The same methods are used on data from the
worlwide Harvard CMT and show results compatible with those of Southern
California. For the Japanese JMA catalog, we still observe a linear dependence
of $p$ on $M$, yet with a smaller slope. The scaling function analysis shows
however that results for this catalog may be biased by numerous swarm
sequences, despite our efforts to remove them before the analysis.

analysis of fluctuations reveals how external driving forces can be only
observed at weekly and higher time scales. Hourly and higher change frequencies
mostly relate to internal maintenance activities. There is a crossover from
endogenous to exogenous activity depending on the average number of file
changes. This new evidence suggests that software development is a
non-homogeneous design activity where stronger efforts focus in a few project
files. The crossover can be explained with a Langevin equation associated to
the cascading process, where changes to any file trigger additional changes to
its neighbours in the software network. In addition, analysis of fluctuations
enables us to detect whether a software system can be decomposed in several
subsystems with different development dynamics.

calculating spike-triggered averages of synaptic conductances using numerical

Accepted for publ. in PRA",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.74.052108",,"quant-ph",,"  A coarse grained Wigner distribution p_{W}(x,u) obeying positivity derives
out of information-theoretic considerations. Let p(x,u) be the unknown joint
PDF (probability density function) on position- and momentum fluctuations x,u
for a pure state particle. Suppose that the phase part Psi(x,z) of its Fourier
transform F.T.[p(x,u)]=|Z(x,z)|exp[iPsi(x,z)] is constructed as a hologram.
(Such a hologram is often used in heterodyne interferometry.) Consider a
particle randomly illuminating this phase hologram. Let its two position
coordinates be measured. Require that the measurements contain an extreme
amount of Fisher information about true position, through variation of the
phase function Psi(x,z). The extremum solution gives an output PDF p(x,u) that
is the convolution of the Wigner p_{W}(x,u) with an instrument function
defining uncertainty in either position x or momentum u. The convolution arises
naturally out of the approach, and is one-dimensional, in comparison with the
two-dimensional convolutions usually proposed for coarse graining purposes. The
output obeys positivity, as required of a PDF, if the one-dimensional
instrument function is sufficiently wide. The result holds for a large class of

recover quantum mechanics as mechanics on a non-differentiable (fractal)
spacetime. The Schrodinger and Klein-Gordon equations are demonstrated as
geodesic equations in this framework. A development of the intrinsic properties
of this theory, using the mathematical tool of Hamilton's bi-quaternions, leads
us to a derivation of the Dirac equation within the scale-relativity paradigm.
The complex form of the wavefunction in the Schrodinger and Klein-Gordon
equations follows from the non-differentiability of the geometry, since it
involves a breaking of the invariance under the reflection symmetry on the
(proper) time differential element (ds <-> - ds). This mechanism is generalized
for obtaining the bi-quaternionic nature of the Dirac spinor by adding a
further symmetry breaking due to non-differentiability, namely the differential
coordinate reflection symmetry (dx^mu <-> - dx^mu) and by requiring invariance
under parity and time inversion. The Pauli equation is recovered as a

unknown state taken from an ensemble, the task is to generate a bipartite state
transfering as much Holevo-information to each copy as possible.
  We argue that upper bounds on the average information over both copies imply
lower bounds on the quantum capacity required to send the ensemble without
information loss. This is because a channel with zero quantum capacity has a
unitary extension transfering at least as much information to its environment
as it transfers to the output.
  For an ensemble being the time orbit of a pure state under a Hamiltonian
evolution, we derive such a bound on the required quantum capacity in terms of
properties of the input and output energy distribution. Moreover, we discuss
relations between the broadcasting problem and entropy power inequalities.
  The broadcasting problem arises when a signal should be transmitted by a
time-invariant device such that the outgoing signal has the same timing
information as the incoming signal had. Based on previous results we argue that
this establishes a link between quantum information theory and the theory of
low power computing because the loss of timing information implies loss of free
