stars of planetary nebulae: BD+303639, NGC 40, NGC 5315 and NGC 6905. Using the
radiative transfer code CMFGEN, we determined new physical parameters and
chemical abundances for these stars. The results were analyzed in the context
of the [WR] => PG 1159 evolution via the transformed radius(Rt)-temperature and
HR diagrams. NGC 5315 showed itself as an odd object among the previously
analyzed central stars. Its temperature (~76kK) is considerably lower than
other early-type [WR] stars (~120-150kK). From our models for NGC 5315 and NGC
6905, it is unclear if early-type [WR] stars have smaller C/He mass ratios than
other spectral classes, as claimed in the literature. A ratio of ~0.8 is found
for NGC 6905. We analyzed FUSE spectra of these stars for the first time, and
identified phosphorus in the spectra of BD+303639, NGC 40 and NGC 5315 through
the transitions P V 1118,1128. The Fe, Si, P, S and Ne abundances were analyzed
in the context of the nucleosynthesis occurring in previous evolutionary
phases. We found evidence for Fe deficiency in BD +30 3639 and NGC 5315, and
from fits to the Si IV lines we determined a solar Si abundance for BD+303639
and NGC 40. For phosphorus, an oversolar abundance in the NGC 5315 model was
preferred, while in the other stars a solar phosphorus abundance cannot be
discarded. Regarding sulfur, we estimated upper limits for its abundance, since
no conspicuous lines can be seen in the observed spectra. We found that Ne is
overabundant in BD +30 3639. In the other stars, Ne is weak or undetectable and
upper limits for its abundance were estimated. Our results are in agreement
with theoretical predictions and show the usefulness of [WR] stars as testbeds
for nucleosynthesis calculations in the AGB and post-AGB phases.(abridged)

spiral galaxies is isotropic or not.
  METHODS. A statistical analysis of the polar angle distribution of large
samples of QSOs from the SDSS survey and Monte Carlo simulations to calculate
their significance are carried out.
  RESULTS. There is a clear excess of QSOs near the minor axis with respect to
the major axis of nearby edge-on spiral galaxies, significant at a level
3.5-sigma up to angular distances of 3 deg. (or ~1.7 Mpc) from the centre of
each galaxy. The significance is increased to 3.9-sigma with the z>0.5 QSOs,
and it reaches 4.8-sigma if we include galaxies whose circles of radius 3
degrees are covered by the SDSS in more than 98% (instead of 100%) of the area.
  CONCLUSIONS. Gravitational lensing in the halo of nearby galaxies or
extinction seem insufficient to explain the observed anisotropic distribution
of QSOs. The anisotropic distribution agrees qualitatively with the predictions
of Arp's models, which claim that QSOs are ejected by galaxies along the
rotation axis, although Arp's prediction give a distance of the QSOs ~3 times
smaller than that found here. In any case, a chance fluctuation, although
highly improbable, might be a possibility rather than a true anisotropy, and
the present results should be corroborated by other groups and samples, so we
prefer to consider it as just a first tentative detection.

relativistic radio-jets and where the companion is a black-hole. A little after
its discovery in 1994 by $BATSE$, a distance of 3.2$\pm$0.2 kpc has been
estimated, and at which the radio jets appeared superluminal. Since that time,
this distance of GRO J1655--40 has been discussed in many studies, often
strengthening the value of 3.2 kpc, and used in numerous models. However,
recently, \citet{Foellmi-etal-2006b-astroph} used new VLT-UVES and {\it
published} photometric data to show that GRO J1655--40 must be closer than 1.7
kpc and that the accuracy of the main distance estimators for this source can
be questioned. Still, the details on how really the distance of 3.2 kpc has
been build was not fully clear. It is the purpose of this article to show that
while the {\it upper} limit to the distance is rather firm, the lower limit is
not. We draw some conclusions about the new understanding we have of GRO
J1655--40, and finally present a new and promising method that can be used to
determine the distance of GRO J1655--40, and maybe many faint and embedded

the diffusion time (emphasized in previous studies) is in fact of secondary
relevance in understanding the model WLR. Instead, the essential physics
involves the luminosity dependence of the spectroscopic/color evolution of SNe
Ia. Following maximum-light, the SN colors are increasingly affected by the
development of numerous Fe II/Co II lines which blanket the B-band and, at the
same time, increase the emissivity at longer wavelengths. Because dimmer SNe Ia
are generally cooler, they experience an earlier onset of Fe III to Fe II
recombination in the iron-group rich layers of ejecta, resulting in a more
rapid evolution of the SN colors to the red. The faster B-band decline rate of
dimmer SNe Ia thus reflects their faster ionization evolution.

  We test the software on simulated optical and radio data to evaluate how well
lens models can be recovered and with what accuracy. For optical data, lens
model parameters can typically be recovered with better than 1% accuracy and
the degeneracy between mass ellipticity and power law is reduced. For radio
data, we find that systematic errors associated with using processed radio
maps, rather than the visibilities, are of similar magnitude to the random
errors. Hence analysing radio data in image space is still useful and
meaningful.

color-color diagram is a powerful diagnostic of the stellar populations of
distant galaxies. Galaxies with red rest-frame U-V colors are generally red in
rest-frame V-J as well. However, at a given U-V color a range in V-J colors
exists, and we show that this allows us to distinguish young, dusty galaxies
from old, passively evolving galaxies. We quantify the effects of IRAC
photometry on estimates of masses, ages, and the dust content of z>2 galaxies.
The estimated distributions of these properties do not change significantly
when adding IRAC data to the UBVIJHK photometry. However, for individual
galaxies the addition of IRAC can improve the constraints on the stellar
populations, especially for red galaxies: uncertainties in stellar mass
decrease by a factor of 2.7 for red (U-V > 1) galaxies, but only by a factor of
1.3 for blue (U-V < 1) galaxies. We find a similar color-dependence of the
improvement for estimates of age and dust extinction. In addition, the
improvement from adding IRAC depends on the availability of full near-infrared
JHK coverage; if only K-band were available, the mass uncertainties of blue
galaxies would decrease by a more substantial factor 1.9. Finally, we find that
a trend of galaxy color with stellar mass is already present at z>2. The most
massive galaxies at high redshift have red rest-frame U-V colors compared to
lower mass galaxies even when allowing for complex star formation histories.

intermediate luminosity around M_K = -23, within a radius 0.3R_500 from the
centres of these groups. This feature is not seen in the X-ray brighter groups,
nor in either kind of group when the LFs are determined all the way out to
R_500. We conclude that an enhanced level of star formation is not responsible
for the this feature. From the faint end of the LFs, we find support for the
under-abundance of low surface brightness dwarfs in the 2MASS survey. We find
that for all kinds of groups, the modelling of the luminosity function, with
universal forms for the LFs of galaxies of different morphological types, fails
when simultaneously required to fit the B and K-band LFs. This means that the
dip-like features seen in LFs are not merely due to the varying proportions of
galaxies of different morphological types among the X-ray dim and bright
groups. We argue that this support our hypothesis that this feature is due to
the enhanced merging of intermediate-mass galaxies in the dynamically sluggish

most important backreaction effect due to nonrelativistc matter, as well as
several exact solutions describing inhomogeneous and anisotropic expanding
universes. We find that the effects are $O(H^2l^2/c^2)$ or smaller, where $H$
is the Hubble parameter and $l$ the typical size scale of inhomogeneities. For
virialized structures this is of order $v^2/c^2$, where $v$ is the
characteristic peculiar velocity.

softer spectrum than gas in classical HII regions surrounding O stars, the

clump density of about n(H$_2$)$\sim 10^4-10^6$ cm$^{-3}$. While the cold
quiescent component is massive containing typically more than 94 % of the mass,
the warm, dense, and turbulent gas is dominated by mid- and high-$J$ CO line
emission and its large line widths. The medium must be clumpy with a
volume-filling of a few percent. The CO lines are found to be important for the
cooling of the cold molecular gas, e.g. at DR21 (OH). Near the outflow of the

Spectrometer (XIS) onboard the Suzaku X-ray satellite in three pointings, one
centered on the cluster core and the other two offset by +-8' in declination.
To search for possible bulk motions of the intracluster medium, the central
energy of He-like Fe-K line (at a rest-frame energy of 6.7 keV) was examined to
look for a positional dependence. Over spatial scales of 50 kpc to 140 kpc
around the cluster core, the central line energy was found to be constant
within the calibration error of 15 eV. The 90% upper limit on the line-of-sight
velocity difference is |Delta_v|< 1400 km/s, giving a tighter constraint than
previous measurements. The significant velocity gradients inferred from a
previous Chandra study were not detected between two pairs of rectangular
regions near the cluster core. These results suggest that the bulk velocity
does not largely exceed the thermal velocity of the gas in the central region
of the Centaurus cluster. The mean redshift of the intracluster medium was
determined to be 0.0097, in agreement with the optical redshift of the cluster
within the calibration uncertainty. Implications of the present results for the

compared the power spectrum and cluster number counts predicted within the
framework of two density fields that yield different cluster mass functions at
high redshifts. This is done for the usual Press & Schechter mass function,
which is based on a Gaussian density fluctuation field, and for a mass function
based on a chi^2-distributed density field. We quantify the significant
differences in the respective integrated S-Z observables in these two models.
  S-Z polarization levels and patterns strongly depend on the non-uniform
distributions of intracluster gas and on peculiar and internal velocities. We
have therefore calculated the patterns of two polarization components that are
produced when the CMB is doubly scattered in a simulated cluster. These are
found to be very different than the patterns calculated based on spherical

hollow cylinder surrounding the optical jet. The formation of this cavity and
its kinematics are well accounted for in the frame of outflow gas entrainment
by jet bow shocks. Evidence of gas acceleration is found along the cavity
walls, correlated with the presence of optical bow shocks. The cavity has been
expanding with a mean velocity of 4 km/s on a timescale of 8700 yr, similar to
the dynamical age of the optical jet. The separation of the inner walls reaches
8""-10"", which matches the transverse size of the wings in the bow shock. CSO
observations of the J=7-6 line show evidence of a high-velocity and hot gas
component (T=300-1000 K) with a low filling factor, associated with shocked
molecular gas in the jet. [CI] observations are consistent with C-type
non-dissociative shocks. Mapping of the high-velocity molecular bullets B1-B3

1.2mm with the MAMBO array at the IRAM 30-m telescopes. This is the first
survey of a large sample of M-dwarfs conducted to provide statistical
constraints on debris disks around this type of stars. We have detected a new
debris disk around the M0.5 dwarf GJ842.2 at lambda = 850 microns, providing
evidence for cold dust at large distance from this star (~ 300AU). By combining
the results of our survey with the ones of Liu et al. (2004), we estimate for
the first time the detection rate of cold debris disks around field M-dwarfs
with ages between 20 and 200 Myr. This detection rate is 13^{+6}_{-8} % and is
consistent with the detection rate of cold debris disks (9 - 23 %) around A- to

disks may be equally prevalent across stellar spectral types.

the majority of the background radiation at 160um with a flux of 0.87+/-0.16

complex that we model with broad and narrow lines and we show that the

The broad Fe K line has an EW of 118 (+32,-61) eV and could originate in an
accretion disk (with inclination angle greater than ~30 degrees). The narrow Fe
Kalpha line has an EW of 163 (+47,-26) eV and is unresolved FWHM <4090 km/s)
and likely originates in distant matter. The absolute flux in the narrow line
implies that the column density out of the line-of-sight could be much higher
than measured in the line-of-sight, and that the mean (historically-averaged)
continuum luminosity responsible for forming the line could be a factor of
several higher than that measured from the data. We also detect the narrow Fe
Kbeta line with a high signal-to-noise ratio and describe a new robust method
to constrain the ionization state of Fe responsible for the Fe Kalpha and Fe
Kbeta lines that does not require any knowledge of possible gravitational and
Doppler energy shifts affecting the line energies. For the distant
line-emitting matter (e.g. the putative obscuring torus) we deduce that the
predominant ionization state is lower than Fe VIII (at 99% confidence),
conservatively taking into account residual calibration uncertainties in the
XIS energy scale and theoretical and experimental uncertainties in the Fe K
fluorescent line energies. From the limits on a possible Compton-reflection
continuum it is likely that the narrow Fe Kalpha and Fe Kbeta lines originate
in a Compton-thin structure.

total spin and moderate deviation principles (MDPs) for the total spin. The
model under study is defined by a probability distribution that depends on the
parameters $n$, $\beta$, and $K$, which represent, respectively, the number of
spins, the inverse temperature, and the interaction strength. The intricate
structure of the phase transitions is revealed by the existence of 18 scaling
limits and 18 MDPs for the total spin. These limit results are obtained as
$(\beta,K)$ converges along appropriate sequences to points belonging to
various subsets of the phase diagram, which include a curve of second-order
points and a tricritical point. The forms of the limiting densities in the
scaling limits and of the rate functions in the MDPs reflect the influence of
one or more sets that lie in neighborhoods of the critical points and the
tricritical point. Of all the scaling limits, the structure of those near the
tricritical point is by far the most complex, exhibiting new types of critical
behavior when observed in a limit-theorem phase diagram in the space of the two

states to the contacts below a fixed energy cutoff, the density matrix for the
core electrons can be evaluated analytically. The full density matrix is formed
by adding this core contribution to the valence part that is evaluated
numerically. Expanding the definition of the core in the all-electron
calculations significantly reduces the computational effort and, up to biases
of about 2 V, the results are very similar to those obtained using more
rigorous approaches. The convergence of the I-V curves and transmission
coefficients with respect to basis set is discussed. The addition of diffuse
functions is critical in approaching basis set completeness.

trap can be described with the lowest Landau-level set of states. In this case,
the condensate wave function psi(x,y) is a Gaussian function of r^2 = x^2 +
y^2, multiplied by an analytic function P(z) of the single complex variable z=
x+ i y; the zeros of P(z) denote the positions of the vortices. Here, a similar
description is used for a rapidly rotating anisotropic two-dimensional trap
with arbitrary anisotropy (omega_x/omega_y le 1). The corresponding condensate
wave function psi(x,y) has the form of a complex anisotropic Gaussian with a
phase proportional to xy, multiplied by an analytic function P(zeta), where
zeta is proportional to x + i beta_- y and 0 le beta_- le 1 is a real parameter
that depends on the trap anisotropy and the rotation frequency. The zeros of
P(zeta) again fix the locations of the vortices. Within the set of lowest
Landau-level states at zero temperature, an anisotropic parabolic density
profile provides an absolute minimum for the energy, with the vortex density
decreasing slowly and anisotropically away from the trap center.

rheological properties of colloidal suspensions consisting of aggregates of
laponite particles in a silicone oil. Microscopy observations show that under
application of an electric field greater than a triggering electric field
E_c~0.6 kV/mm, laponite aggregates assemble into chain- and/or column-like
structures in the oil. Without an applied electric field, the steady state
shear behavior of such suspensions is Newtonian-like. Under application of an
electric field larger than E_c, it changes dramatically as a result of the
changes in the microstructure: a significant yield stress is measured, and
under continuous shear the fluid is shear-thinning. The rheological properties,
in particular the dynamic and static shear stress, were studied as a function
of particle volume fraction, for various strengths(including null) of the
applied electric field. The flow curves under continuous shearing can be scaled
with respect to both particle fraction and electric field strength, onto a
master curve. This scaling is consistent with simple scaling arguments. The
shape of the master curve accounts for the system's complexity; it approaches a
standard Herschel-Bulkley model at high Manson numbers. Both dynamic and static
yield stress are observed to depend on the particle fraction \phi and electric
field E as \phi^\beta E^\alpha, with \alpha~1.85, and \beta~1 and 1.70, for the
dynamic and static yield stresses, respectively. The measured yield stress
behavior may be explained in terms of standard conduction models for
electrorheological systems. Interesting prospects include using such systems

relaxing learning is a slight modification of the self-organizing map learning

algorithm. The magnification exponent can be calculated analytically for
arbitrary dimension from a continuum theory, and the entropy of the resulting

influence of a diagonal term, which can be added without impacting the
magnification, is studied numerically. This approach to maps of maximal mutual

adds computational cost of same order and is easy to implement. In particular,
it is not necessary to estimate the generally unknown data probability density

work in neutral D decays could be indirect or direct CP violation (or both).
(ii) One can experimentally distinguish between these possibilities. (iii) If
the dominant CP violation is indirect, then there are clear predictions for
other modes. (iv) Tree-level direct CP violation in various known models is

the locus is circular, which has been proven for the cross-section of the

have different types of information, communication and functionality. The
players communicate and function in a way that resembles some real-life
situations. We consider two types of operations. First, there are operations
that follow an open democratic discussion. Second, some subgroups of players
who may have different interests make decisions based on their own group
interest. A key ingredient here is that the identity of each subgroup is known
only to the members of that group. In this paper, we are interested in the best
strategies for the different groups in such scenarios and in evaluating their
relative power. The main focus of the paper is the question: How large and
strong should a subgroup be in order to dominate the game? The concrete model
studied here is based on the popular game ``Mafia.'' In this game, there are
three groups of players: Mafia, detectives and ordinary citizens. Initially,
each player is given only his/her own identity, except the mafia, who are given
the identities of all mafia members. At each ``open'' round, a vote is made to
determine which player to eliminate. Additionally, there are collective
decisions made by the mafia where they decide to eliminate a citizen. Finally,
each detective accumulates data on the mafia/citizen status of players. The
citizens win if they eliminate all mafia members. Otherwise, the mafia wins. We
first find a randomized strategy that is optimal in the absence of detectives.
This leads to a stochastic asymptotic analysis where it is shown that the two
groups have comparable probabilities of winning exactly when the total
population size is $R$ and the mafia size is of order $\sqrt{R}$. We then show
that even a single detective changes the qualitative behavior of the game
dramatically. Here, the mafia and citizens have comparable winning
probabilities only for a mafia size linear in $R$. Finally, we provide a
summary of simulations complementing the theoretical results obtained in the
paper.

perturbative QCD calculations. The p+p measurement serves as a baseline for
direct photon production in Au+Au collisions. In d+Au collisions, no effects of
cold nuclear matter are found within the large uncertainty of the measurement.
In Au+Au collisions, the production of high p_T direct photons scales as
expected for particle production in hard scatterings. This supports jet
quenching models, which attribute the suppression of high p_T hadrons to the
energy loss of fast partons in the medium produced in the collision. Low p_T
direct photons, measured via e+e- pairs with small invariant mass, are possibly
related to the production of thermal direct photons.

uses microcanonical ensembles and the variational principle obeyed by the free

the minimization of the free energy without corrections from the
nonorthogonality of the correlated basis states, similar to that of the ground

multiple administrative domains. Grid middleware, which is meant to enable
access to grid resources, is currently widely seen as being too heavyweight
and, in consequence, unwieldy for general scientific use. Its heavyweight
nature, especially on the client-side, has severely restricted the uptake of
grid technology by computational scientists. In this paper, we describe the
Application Hosting Environment (AHE) which we have developed to address some
of these problems. The AHE is a lightweight, easily deployable environment
designed to allow the scientist to quickly and easily run legacy applications
on distributed grid resources. It provides a higher level abstraction of a grid
than is offered by existing grid middleware schemes such as the Globus Toolkit.
As a result the computational scientist does not need to know the details of
any particular underlying grid middleware and is isolated from any changes to
it on the distributed resources. The functionality provided by the AHE is
`application-centric': applications are exposed as web services with a
well-defined standards-compliant interface. This allows the computational
scientist to start and manage application instances on a grid in a transparent
manner, thus greatly simplifying the user experience. We describe how a range
of computational science codes have been hosted within the AHE and how the
design of the AHE allows us to implement complex workflows for deployment on
grid infrastructure.

ultracold alkali atoms forming a homonuclear diatomic is investigated using
realistic atomic interaction potentials. Confinement of the initial atom pair
due to the trap leads to a uniform strong enhancement of the photoassociation
rate to most, but also to a strongly suppressed rate for some final states.
Thus tighter traps do not necessarily enhance the photoassociation rate. A
further massive enhancement of the rate is found for strong interatomic
interaction potentials. The details of this interaction play a minor role,
except for large repulsive interactions for which a sharp window occurs in the
photoassociation spectrum as is known from the trap-free case. A comparison
with simplified models describing the atomic interaction like the
pseudopotential approximation shows that they often provide reasonable
estimates for the trap-induced enhancement of the photoassociation rate even if
the predicted rates can be completely erroneous.

helical twists with an arbitrary angular frequency W modulate a classical mode
(angular frequency w, group velocity vg). The modal field patterns are
unchanged, apart from the twist, provided that the helical velocity vh equals
vg. Pairs of resonating retarded and advanced waves with modal and helical
frequencies (w,W) and (w,-W)respectively, trap one temporal period of the
underlying classical mode forming a photon-like packet provided W = (M+1/2)w:
'Schrodinger' frequencies. This theory supports experimental evidence that the
photon velocity does not change with M in dispersive systems. Promotion and
demotion increase or decrease the helical frequencies in units of w. An energy
of interaction between retarded and advanced waves in the wave-packet is also
proportional to these helical frequencies W = (M+1/2)w similar to Planck's law.
Group velocity and polarisation are unaffected by the value of M. Advanced
waves enable phase and polarisation to be predicted along all future paths and
may help to explain the outcomes of experiments on delayed-choice interference
