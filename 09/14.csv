the cosmological power spectrum. However accurate photometric redshifts for
tomography out to high redshift require imaging in five or more bands, which is
expensive to carry out over thousands of square degrees. Since lensing makes
coarse, statistical use of redshift information, we explore the prospects for
tomography using limited color information from two or three band imaging. With
an appropriate calibration sample, we find that it is feasible to create up to
four redshift bins using imaging data in just the g, r and i bands. We
construct such redshift sub-samples from mock catalogs by clustering galaxies
in color space and discarding regions with poorly-defined redshift
distributions. The loss of galaxy number density decreases the accuracy of
lensing measurements, but even losing half or more of the galaxies is not a
severe loss for large area surveys. We estimate the errors on lensing power
spectra and dark energy parameters with color tomography and discuss trade-offs
in survey area and filter choice. We discuss the systematic errors that may
change our conclusions, especially the information needed to tackle intrinsic
alignments.

thickening galactic disks, a process that theories of galaxy formation and
evolution need to accommodate. If the gas-evacuation time-scale depends on
cluster mass, then a power-law embedded-cluster mass function may transform
within a few dozen Myr to a mass function with a turnover near 10^5 Msun,
thereby possibly explaining this universal empirical feature. Discordant

significant correlation between the GCLF dispersion, sigma, and the galaxy
luminosity, M_B, in the sense that the GC systems in fainter galaxies have
narrower luminosity functions. The GCLF dispersions in the Milky Way and M31
are fully consistent with this trend, implying that the correlation between
sigma and galaxy luminosity is more fundamental than older suggestions that
GCLF shape is a function of galaxy Hubble type. We show that the sigma - M_B
relation results from a bonafide narrowing of the distribution of (logarithmic)
cluster masses in fainter galaxies. We further show that this behavior is
mirrored by a steepening of the GC mass function for relatively high masses, M
>~ 3 x 10^5 M_sun, a mass regime in which the shape of the GCLF is not strongly
affected by dynamical evolution over a Hubble time. We argue that this trend
arises from variations in initial conditions and requires explanation by
theories of cluster formation. Finally, we confirm that in bright galaxies, the
GCLF ""turns over"" at the canonical mass scale of M_TO ~ 2 x 10^5 M_sun.
However, we find that M_TO scatters to lower values (~1-2 x 10^5 M_sun) in

the effect of orbital eccentricity on the expected gravitational background
radiation (GWBR) from supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries in the nuclei of
galaxies. For this purpose, we formulate a power spectrum of the GWBR from
cosmological evolving eccentric binaries. Then, we apply this formulation to
the case of the GWBR from SMBH binaries. The key to doing this is to correctly
estimate the number density of coalescing SMBH binaries. In this study, we use
a semi-analytic model of galaxy and SMBH formation. We find that the power
spectrum of the GWBR from SMBH binaries on eccentric orbits is suppressed for
frequencies $f \lesssim 1~{\rm nHz}$ if the initial eccentricity, $e_0$,
satisfies $e_0 > 0.2$ and the initial semi-major axis is 300 times Scwarzschild
radius. Our model predicts that while the overall shape and amplitude of the
power spectrum depend strongly on the processes of galaxy formation, the
eccentricity of binaries can affect the shape of the power spectrum for lower
frequencies, i.e., $f \lesssim 1~{\rm nHz}$. Pulsar timing measurements, which
can detect GW in this frequency range, could constrain the effect of
eccentricity on the power spectrum of the GWBR from SMBH binaries.

Mrk279 shows evidence of broad emission features, especially at the wavelength
of the OVII triplet. We quantitatively explore the possibility that this
emission is produced in the broad line region (BLR). We modeled the broad UV
emission lines seen in the FUSE and HST-STIS spectra following the ``locally
optimally emitting cloud"" approach. We find that the X-ray lines luminosity
derived from the best fit BLR model can match the X-ray features, suggesting
that the gas producing the UV lines is sufficient to account also for the X-ray
emission. The spectrum is absorbed by ionized gas whose total column density is
~5x10^{20} cm^{-2}. The absorption spectrum can be modeled by two distinct gas
components (log xi ~ 0.47 and 2.49, respectively) both showing a significant
outflow velocity. However, the data allow also the presence of intermediate
ionization components. The distribution of the column densities of such extra
components as a function of the ionization parameter is not consistent with a
continuous, power law-like, absorber, suggesting a complex structure for the
gas outflow for Mrk 279 (abridged).

infall has major consequences not only on clusters but also on the physics of
cluster galaxies. Faint galaxies are particularly interesting as they are very
sensitive to environmental effects, and may have a different behaviour from
that of bright galaxies. The aim of this paper is to sample the Coma cluster
building history, based on the analysis of galaxy luminosity functions and red
sequences in the Color Magnitude Relation down to faint magnitudes, which are
privileged tools for this purpose. The present analysis is based on deep
(R~24), wide (~0.5 deg2) multiband (BVRI Vega system) images of the Coma
cluster obtained with the CFH12K camera at the CFHT. We have derived LFs and
CMRs in twenty 10x10 arcmin2 regions and in larger regions. In all photometric
bands, we found steeply rising LFs in the north-northeast half of the cluster
(due to early type galaxies at bright magnitudes and due to late type galaxies
at the faint end), and much flatter LFs in the south-southwest region. Although
the fine behaviour of the CMR RS is different in these two regions, a good
agreement is found in general between the RS computed for faint and for bright
galaxies. All these results can be interpreted consistently in the framework of
the building up process previously proposed. The Northern Coma area is a
relatively quiescent region while the southern area experiences several
infalls.

means of a sparse opacity distribution technique and a time-dependent treatment
of the nucleation, growth and evaporation of inhomogeneous dust grains composed
of a mixture of Mg2SiO4, SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, and solid Fe. The
frequency-dependent treatment of radiative transfer reveals that the gas is
cold close to the star (700-900 K at 1.5-2 R*) which facilitates the nucleation
process. The dust temperatures are strongly material-dependent, with
differences as large as 1000 K for different pure materials, which has an
important influence on the dust formation sequence. Two dust layers are formed
in the dynamical models: almost pure glassy Al2O3 close to the star (r > 1.5
R*) and the more opaque Fe-poor Mg-Fe-silicates further out. Solid Fe or
Fe-rich silicates are found to be the only condensates that can efficiently
absorb the stellar light in the near IR. Consequently, they play a crucial role
for the wind driving mechanism and act as thermostat. Only small amounts of Fe
can be incorporated into the grains, because otherwise the grains get too hot.
Thus, the models reveal almost no mass loss, and no dust shells.

becomes a contact system if its own dynamical evolution enables it to pass the

habitability. These features are generated by H2O, CO2, CH4, O2, O3, N2O, and
vegetation-like surface albedos. We chose six geological epochs to
characterize. These epochs exhibit a wide range in abundance for these
molecules, ranging from a CO2 rich early atmosphere, to a CO2/CH4-rich
atmosphere around 2 billion years ago to a present-day atmosphere. We analyzed
the spectra to quantify the strength of each important spectral feature in both
the visible and thermal infrared spectral regions, and the resolutions required
to unambiguously observe the features for each epoch. We find a wide range of
spectral resolutions required for observing the different features. For
example, H2O and O3 can be observed with relatively low resolution, while O2
and N2O require higher resolution. We also find that the inclusion of clouds in
our models significantly affects both the strengths and resolutions required to
observe all spectral features.

large enough for the turbulent waves in the plasma to see the transition of the

through a step shock: the downstream Alfven waves propagate predominantly
towards the shock in the local plasma frame and, thus, the scattering-centre
compression ratio is larger than the gas compression ratio. For thick
relativistic shocks, however, we find qualitative differences with respect to
the step-shock case: for low-Alfvenic-Mach-number shocks the downstream waves
propagate predominantly away from the shock, and the scattering-centre

the Alfven wave transmission can decrease the efficiency of the first-order

very complex and single stars only perhaps can do the job. (Un)Fortunately at
present we know that a significant fraction of the observed intermediate mass
and massive stars are members of a binary or multiple system and that certain
objects can only be formed through binary evolution. Therefore galactic studies
that do not account for close binaries may be far from realistic. We
implemented a detailed binary population in a galactic chemical evolutionary
model. Notice that this is not something simple like replacing chemical yields.
Here we discuss three topics: the effect of binaries on the evolution of 14N,
the evolution of the type Ia supernova rate and the effects on the G-dwarf
distribution, the link between the evolution of the r-process elements and
double neutron star mergers (candidates of short gamma-ray burst objects).

discovered and the overall Number-Intensity distribution of the bursts has been

stages of our exploration of the role of charge separation potentials in
non-relativistic electron-ion shocks where the inertial gyro-scales are widely
disparate, using results from a Monte Carlo simulation. Charge density spatial
profiles were obtained in the linear regime, sampling the inertial scales for
both ions and electrons, for different magnetic field obliquities. These were
readily integrated to acquire electric field profiles in the absence of
self-consistent, spatial readjustments between the electrons and the ions. It
was found that while diffusion plays little role in modulating the linear field
structure in highly oblique and perpendicular shocks, in quasi-parallel shocks,
where charge separations induced by gyrations are small, and shock-layer
electric fields are predominantly generated on diffusive scales.

discussed the CNO cycle for those objects where C abundances were available. In
this paper we concentrate more on other elemental abundances (such as O, Ne, S,
Ar) and their implications for the evolution of the progenitor stars. We use a
much larger sample of 183 objects, of which 65 are from our own observations,
where the abundances have been re-derived in a homogeneous way. For 156 of
them, the quality of data is considered to be satisfactory for further
analysis. We confirm the difficulty of separating Type-I and non-type-I objects
in the classical He-N/O diagram, as found in Paper I, a problem reinforced by
the variety of initial compositions for the progenitor stars. We observed
oxygen variations, either depletion via the ON cycle in the more massive
progenitor stars, or oxygen production in other objects. Neon production also
appears to be present. These enrichments are best explained by fresh material
from the core or from burning shells, brought to the surface by the 3rd
dredge-up, as reproduced in recent models, some including overshooting. All the
effects appear stronger in the SMC, suggesting a higher efficiency in a low
metallicity environment. Neither oxygen nor neon can therefore be used to
derive the initial composition of the progenitor star: other elements not
affected by processing such as sulfur, argon or, if observed, chlorine, have to
be preferred for this purpose. Some objects with very low initial abundances
are detected, but on average, the spatial distribution of PNe abundances is
consistent with the history of star formation (SF) as derived from field stars

foregrounds. Significant phase correlations is found in between the ILC(III)
quadrupole and the WMAP foregrounds phases for K-W band: the phases of the
ILC(III) quadrupole xi_{2,1}, xi_{2,2} and those of the foregrounds at K-W

ILC(III) quadrupole is mere reflection of that the foreground quadrupole
through coupling. To clarify this issue we exploit the symmetry of the CMB
power, which is invariant under permutation of the index m=1<->2. By simple
rotation of the ILC(III) phases with the same angle we reach the phases of
foreground quadrupole. We discuss possible sources of phase correlation and
come to the conclusion that the phases of the ILC(III) quadrupole reflect most

halo metallicity distribution. In this way we try to better constrain the ISM
enrichment timescale, which was not done in our previous work. The stellar
models adopted in this work were computed under the assumption that the ratio
of the initial rotation velocity to the critical velocity of stars is roughly
constant with metallicity. This naturally leads to faster rotation at lower
metallicity, as metal poor stars are more compact than metal rich ones. We find
that the new Z = 10-8 stellar yields computed for large rotational velocities
have a tremendous impact on the interstellar medium nitrogen enrichment for
log(O/H)+12 < 7 (or [Fe/H]< -3). We show that upon the inclusion of the new
stellar calculations in a chemical evolution model for the galactic halo with
infall and outflow, both high N/O and C/O ratios are obtained in the very-metal
poor metallicity range in agreement with observations. Our results give further
support to the idea that stars at very low metallicities could have initial
rotational velocities of the order of 600-800kms-1. An important contribution
to N from AGB stars is still needed in order to explain the observations at
intermediate metallicities. One possibility is that AGB stars at very low
metallicities also rotate fast. This could be tested in the future, once
stellar evolution models for fast rotating AGB stars will be available.

spatially inhomogeneous metric, determined by J. The geodesic approximation is
used to describe low energy soliton dynamics in this system: n-soliton motion
is approximated by geodesic motion in the moduli space of static n-solitons,

natural choices of J(x,y) are obtained. From these it is shown that single

re-scaling the self-interaction correction and we establish a link with the
existing atomic-like corrective scheme LDA+U. We find that when no re-scaling
is applied, i.e. when we consider the entire atomic correction, the Kohn-Sham

potential for molecules. Similarly the HOMO eigenvalues of negatively charged
molecules reproduce closely the molecular affinities. In contrast a re-scaling
of about 50% is necessary to reproduce insulator bandgaps in solids, which
otherwise are largely overestimated. The method therefore represents a
Kohn-Sham based single-particle theory and offers good prospects for
applications where the actual position of the Kohn-Sham eigenvalues is

sequence of collisions collected in an MD event driven simulation of inelastic

structure: particles in a core of index k have collided at least k times with
other particles in the same core. The difference between cores k+1 and k is the
so-called k-shell, and the set of all shells is a complete and on-overlapping
decomposition of the system. Because of energy dissipation, the gas cools down:
its initial spatially homogeneous dynamics, characterized by the Haff law, i.e.
a t^{-2} energy decay, is unstable towards a strongly inhomogeneous phase with
clusters and vortices, where energy decays as t^{-1}. The clear transition
between those two phases appears in the evolution of the k-shells structure in
the collision network. In the homogeneous regime the k-shell structure evolves
as in a growing network with fixed number of vertices and randomly added links:
the shell distribution is strongly peaked around the most populated shell,
which has an index k_{max} ~ 0.9 <d> with <d> the average number of collisions
experienced by a particle. During the final non-homogeneous regime a growing
fraction of collisions is concentrated in small, almost closed, 'communities'
of particles: k_{max} is no more linear in <d> and the distribution of shells
becomes extremely large developing a power-law tail ~ k^{-3} for high shell
indexes. We propose the k-shell decomposition as a quantitative
characterization of Molecular Chaos violation.

examine the robustness of communication networks under intentional attack that
takes down network nodes in a decreasing order of their nodal degrees. In this
paper, we study two different effects that have been largely missed in the
existing results: (i) some communication networks, like Internet, are too large
for anyone to have global information of their topologies, which makes the
accurate intentional attack practically impossible; and (ii) most attacks in
communication networks are propagated from one node to its neighborhood
node(s), utilizing local network-topology information only. We show that
incomplete global information has different impacts to the intentional attack
in different circumstances, while local information-based attacks can be
actually highly efficient. Such insights would be helpful for the future
developments of efficient network attack/protection schemes.

planar and curved surface domains, is proposed. The meshes described are those
which, in the limit of an increasingly finer mesh (smaller cells), and away
from irregular vertices, have ideally-shaped cells (squares or equilateral
triangles), and can therefore be completely described by two local properties:
local cell size and local edge directions. The connection between the two
properties is derived by defining a Riemannian manifold whose geodesics trace
the edges of the mesh. A function $\phi$, proportional to the logarithm of the
cell size, is shown to obey the Poisson equation, with localized charges
corresponding to irregular vertices. The problem of finding a suitable manifold
for a given domain is thus shown to exactly reduce to an Inverse Poisson
problem on $\phi$, of finding a distribution of localized charges adhering to
the conditions derived for boundary alignment. Possible applications to mesh
generation are discussed.

perturbative method in a wide range of spacetime dimensions. At the linear
order of perturbations, we see that the Gregory-Laflamme instability vanishes
at the point where the background solution becomes thermodynamically stable.
The emergence/vanishing of the static mode resembles phase transitions, and in
fact we find that its critical exponent is nearly 1/2, which means a
second-order transition. By employing higher-order perturbations, the physical
properties of the non-uniform black strings are investigated in detail. For
fixed spacetime dimensions, we find the critical charges at which the stability
of non-uniform states changes. For some range of charge, non-uniform black
strings are entropically favored over uniform ones. The gauge charge works as a
control parameter that controls not only the stability of uniform black strings
but also the non-uniform states. In addition, we find that for a fixed
background charge the uniform state is not necessarily the state carrying the
largest tension. The phase diagram and a comparison with the critical dimension
are also discussed.

possible according to at least two different paradigms; both allow to
circumvent singularity theorems, i.e. the necessity of singularities in the
past of inflating domains which have the required properties to generate a
universe similar to ours. The first of them is substantially classical, and is
built up considering solitons which collide with surrounding topological

hence to define velocity and momentum in terms of the local space and time

derivative of a vector (the momentum) along a trajectory. Then the possible
form of the gravitation force is investigated. It is shown that, if the motion
of free particles has to follow space-time geodesics, then the expression for
the gravity acceleration is determined uniquely. It depends on the variation of
the metric with space and time, and it involves the velocity of the particle.

higher-dimensional space, particles in uniform motion radiate gravitational
waves because of spacetime lumpiness. This phenomenon is analogous to the
electromagnetic diffraction radiation of a charge moving near to a metallic
grating. In the gravitational case, the role of the metallic grating is played
by the inhomogeneities of the extra-dimensional space, such as a hidden brane.
We derive a general formula for gravitational diffraction radiation and apply
it to a higher-dimensional scenario with flat compact extra dimensions.
Gravitational diffraction radiation may carry away a significant portion of the
particle's initial energy. This allows to set stringent limits on the scale of
brane perturbations. Physical effects of gravitational diffraction radiation
are briefly discussed.

a divergence in the measure, which we observe to be due to the dilatation
invariance of flat FRW universes. We show that the divergence is removed if we
identify universes which are so flat they cannot be observationally
distinguished. The resulting measure is independent of time and of the choice
of coordinates on the space of fields. We further show that, for some
quantities of interest, the measure is very insensitive to the details of how
the identification is made. One such quantity is the probability of inflation
in simple scalar field models. We find that, according to our implementation of
the canonical measure, the probability for N e-folds of inflation in
single-field, slow-roll models is suppressed by of order exp(-3N) and we
discuss the implications of this result.

interpretation in terms of the Bose-condensation process of elementary spinless
quanta. In a cutoff theory, this leads to a picture of the vacuum as a
condensed medium whose excitations might deviate from exact Lorentz covariance
in both the ultraviolet and infrared regions. For this reason, the conventional
singlet Higgs boson, the shifted field of spontaneous symmetry breaking, rather
than being a purely massive field, might possess a gapless branch describing
the long-wavelength fluctuations of the scalar condensate. To test this idea,
that might have substantial phenomenological implications, I compare with a
detailed lattice simulation of the broken phase in the 4D Ising limit of the
theory. The results are the following: i) differently from the symmetric phase,
the single-particle energy spectrum is not reproduced by the standard massive
form ii) for the value of the hopping parameter \kappa=0.076, increasing the
lattice size from 20^4 to 32^4, the mass gap is found to decrease from the
value 0.392(1) reported by Balog et al. (see Nucl. Phys. B714 (2005) 256) to
the value 0.366(5). Both results confirm that, in the infrared region, the
standard singlet Higgs cannot be considered as a simple massive field. Several
arguments indicate that, approaching the continuum limit of the lattice theory,
the observed volume dependence of the mass gap might require larger and larger
lattice sizes before to show up.

a so-called Ferrers tableau or, equivalently, a Ferrers bipartite graph. Its
edge ideal, dubbed Ferrers ideal, is a squarefree monomial ideal that is
generated by quadrics. We show that such an ideal has a 2-linear minimal free
resolution, i.e. it defines a small subscheme. In fact, we prove that this
property characterizes Ferrers graphs among bipartite graphs. Furthermore,
using a method of Bayer and Sturmfels, we provide an explicit description of
the maps in its minimal free resolution: This is obtained by associating a
suitable polyhedral cell complex to the ideal/graph. Along the way, we also
determine the irredundant primary decomposition of any Ferrers ideal. We
conclude our analysis by studying several features of toric rings of Ferrers
graphs. In particular we recover/establish formulae for the Hilbert series, the
Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, and the multiplicity of these rings. While most
of the previous works in this highly investigated area of research involve path
counting arguments, we offer here a new and self-contained approach based on

square, is the zero scheme of a section of a vector bundle of rank $\dim(X)$ on
$X\times X$. We call this the diagonal property (D). It was known that it holds
for all flag manifolds ${\rm SL}_n/P$.
  We consider mainly the cases of proper smooth varieties, and the analogous
problems for smooth manifolds (the topological case).
  Our main new observation in the case of proper varieties is a relation
between (D) and cohomologically trivial line bundles on $X$, obtained by a
variation of Serre's classic argument relating rank 2 vector bundles and
codimension 2 subschemes, combined with Serre duality. Based on this, we have
several detailed results on surfaces, and some results in higher dimensions.
  For smooth affine varieties, we observe that for an affine algebraic group
over an algebraically closed field, the diagonal is in fact a complete
intersection; thus (D) holds, using the trivial bundle. We conjecture the
existence of smooth affine complex varieties for which (D) fails; this leads to
an interesting question on projective modules.
  The arguments in the topological case have a different flavour, with
arguments from homotopy theory, topological K-theory, index theory etc. There
are 3 variants of the diagonal problem, depending on the type of vector bundle
we want (arbitrary, oriented or complex). We obtain a homotopy theoretic
reformulation of the diagonal property as an extension problem for a certain
homotopy class of maps. We also have detailed results in several cases:
spheres, odd dimensional complex projective quadric hypersurfaces, and
manifolds of even dimension $\leq 6$ with an almost complex structure.

functions and the analysis of unordered sums, where the summands are given by
values of a positive real-valued function, we develop a measure-theoretical
framework which in particular allows us to describe \textit{rigorously} the
representation and meaning of sums of jumps of type $\sum_{0 < s \leq t} \Phi
\circ | \Delta X_s |$, where $X : \Omega \times \R_+ \longrightarrow \R$ is a
stochastic process with regulated trajectories, $t \in \R_+$ and $\Phi : \R_+
\longrightarrow \R_+$ is a strictly increasing function which maps 0 to 0 (cf.
Proposition \ref{prop:sum of jumps on R+ with invertible function}). Moreover,
our approach enables a natural extension of the jump measure of c\`{a}dl\`{a}g
and adapted processes to an integer-valued random measure of optional processes
with regulated trajectories which need not necessarily to be right- or
left-continuous (cf. Theorem \ref{thm:optional random measures}). In doing so,
we provide a detailed and constructive proof of the fact that the set of all
discontinuities of the first kind of a given real-valued function on $\R$ is at
most countable (cf. Lemma \ref{lemma:right limits and left limits}, Theorem
\ref{thm:at most countably many jumps on compact intervals} and Theorem
\ref{thm:at most countably many jumps on R+}).
  By using the powerful analysis of unordered sums, we hope that our
contributions fill an existing gap in the literature, since neither a detailed
proof of (the frequently used) Theorem \ref{thm:at most countably many jumps on
compact intervals} nor a precise definition of sums of jumps seems to be
available yet.

restrictions on wealth. For a utility function which satisfies the condition of
reasonable asymptotic elasticity at $-\infty$ we prove that the utility-based
super-replication price of an unbounded (but sufficiently integrable)
contingent claim is equal to the supremum of its discounted expectations under
pricing measures with finite {\it loss-entropy}. For an agent whose utility
function is unbounded from above, the set of pricing measures with finite
loss-entropy can be slightly larger than the set of pricing measures with
finite entropy. Indeed, the former set is the closure of the latter under a
suitable weak topology.
  Central to our proof is the representation of a cone $C_U$ of utility-based
super-replicable contingent claims as the polar cone to the set of finite
loss-entropy pricing measures. The cone $C_U$ is defined as the closure, under
a relevant weak topology, of the cone of all (sufficiently integrable)
contingent claims that can be dominated by a zero-financed terminal wealth.
  We investigate also the natural dual of this result and show that the polar
cone to $C_U$ is generated by those separating measures with finite
loss-entropy. The full two-sided polarity we achieve between measures and
contingent claims yields an economic justification for the use of the cone
$C_U$, and an open question.

consider plastic and elastic types of collisions. We examine static (collapse
initiation lines, derived from the ultimate yield strength of the structural
steel) and dynamic (duration of collapse, computed using mathematical models)
features of events that comprised the collapse in WTC 1 and 2. We show that
$(a)$, the dynamic and static aspects of the collapse are mutually consistent
and weakly dependent on the class or type of mathematical model used, and
$(b)$, that the NIST scenario, in which the buildings collapse after a sequence
of two damaging events (airplane impact and subsequent ambient fires), is
inconsistent with respect to the structural strength of the buildings. Our
analysis shows that the force that resisted the collapse in WTC 1 and 2 came
from a single structural element, the weaker perimeter columns, while the
second structural element, the stronger core columns, did not contribute. We
discuss two non-obvious inconsistencies between the mathematical models of
progressive collapse based on the NIST scenario, and the practical realizations
of collapse in WTC 1 and 2: $(i)$, the average avalanche pressure is 3 orders
of magnitude smaller than the pressure the vertical columns are able to
withstand, and $(ii)$, the intact vertical columns can easily absorb through
plastic deformation the energy of the falling top section of the WTCs. We
propose collapse scenario that resolves these inconsistencies, and is in
agreement with the observations and with the mathematical models.

resistivity or electron inertia, the fastest growing linear eigenmodes may have
high poloidal mode numbers m ~ 10. The spectrum of unstable modes tends to be
broader in the collisionless case. In the nonlinear regime, it is shown that in
both cases fast growing high-m DTMs lead to an annular collapse involving small
magnetic island structures. In addition, collisionless DTMs exhibit multiple
reconnection cycles due to reversibility of collisionless reconnection and
strong ExB flows. Collisionless reconnection leads to a saturated stable state,
while in the collisional case resistive decay keeps the system weakly dynamic
by driving it back towards the unstable equilibrium maintained by a source

wireless and mobile technology. A Personal Communication System (PCS) network
must have an efficient way to keep track of the mobile users to deliver
services effectively. Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) is a
commonly accepted standard for mobility management of mobile users. Location
management involves location tracking, and location information storage.
Location management requires mobile users to register at various registration
areas whenever they are on the move. The registration process may cause
excessive signaling traffic and long service delays. To improve the efficiency
of location tracking and avoid call set up delays, several strategies such as
local anchor scheme, per-user caching scheme and several pointer forwarding
schemes have been proposed in the past. In this paper, we propose a new ""Two
Level Single Chain Pointer Forwarding (TLSCP) Strategy"" in which a two level
hierarchy of level-1 and level-2 forwarding pointers reduced to single chain
length are used. Organizing the pointers in a two level hierarchy and further
restricting the pointer chain lengths at both the levels to single chain
localizes the network signaling traffic and reduces the call set up delays. To
justify the effectiveness of our proposed strategy, we develop an analytical
model to evaluate the signaling cost. Our performance analysis shows that the
proposed dynamic TLSCP scheme can significantly reduce the network signaling
traffic and cost for different categories of users under different network
conditions.

obtained in different limits. A particularly interesting example is
evolutionary game theory, which is traditionally based on infinite populations,
where strict Nash equilibria correspond to stable fixed points that are always
evolutionarily stable. However, in finite populations stochastic effects can
drive the system away from strict Nash equilibria, which gives rise to a new
concept for evolutionary stability. The conventional and the new stability
concepts may apparently contradict each other leading to conflicting
predictions in large yet finite populations. We show that the two concepts can
be derived from the frequency dependent Moran process in different limits. Our
results help to determine the appropriate stability concept in large finite
populations. The general validity of our findings is demonstrated showing that
the same results are valid employing vastly different co-evolutionary
processes.

different experimental schemes based either on linear or non-linear methods and

Schrodinger equation to spinors, so the Pauli equation must be derived from the
Dirac equation by taking its non-relativistic limit. Hence, it predicts the
existence of an intrinsic magnetic moment for the electron and gives its
correct value. In the scale relativity framework, the Schrodinger, Klein-Gordon
and Dirac equations have been derived from first principles as geodesics
equations of a non-differentiable and continuous spacetime. Since such a
generalized geometry implies the occurence of new discrete symmetry breakings,
this has led us to write Dirac bi-spinors in the form of bi-quaternions
(complex quaternions). In the present work, we show that, in scale relativity
also, the correct Pauli equation can only be obtained from a non-relativistic
limit of the relativistic geodesics equation (which, after integration, becomes
the Dirac equation) and not from the non-relativistic formalism (that involves
symmetry breakings in a fractal 3-space). The same degeneracy procedure, when
it is applied to the bi-quaternionic 4-velocity used to derive the Dirac
equation, naturally yields a Pauli-type quaternionic 3-velocity. It therefore
corroborates the relevance of the scale relativity approach for the building
from first principles of the quantum postulates and of the quantum tools. This
also reinforces the relativistic and fundamentally quantum nature of spin,
which we attribute in scale relativity to the non-differentiability of the
quantum spacetime geometry (and not only of the quantum space). We conclude by
performing numerical simulations of spinor geodesics, that allow one to gain a
physical geometric picture of the nature of spin.

another, cosmological theory, accurate only for the description of subsystems
of the universe. Quantum theory is then to be derived from the cosmological
theory by averaging over variables which are not internal to the subsystem,
which may be considered non-local hidden variables. We find conditions for
arriving at quantum mechanics through such a procedure. The key lesson is that
the effect of the coupling to the external degrees of freedom introduces noise
into the evolution of the system degrees of freedom, while preserving a notion
of averaged conserved energy and time reversal invariance.
  These conditions imply that the effective description of the subsystem is
Nelson's stochastic formulation of quantum theory. We show that Nelson's
formulation is not, by itself, a classical stochastic theory as the conserved
averaged energy is not a linear function of the probability density. We also
investigate an argument of Wallstrom posed against the equivalence of Nelson's
stochastic mechanics and quantum mechanics and show that, at least for a simple
case, it is in error.
