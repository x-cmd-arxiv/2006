Beuermann et al. and show explicitly that CV donors have later SpTs than main
sequence (MS) stars at all orbital periods. The semi-empirical donor sequence
matches the observed SpTs very well, implying that the empirical M2-R2 relation
predicts just the right amount of radius expansion. We finally apply the donor
sequence to the problem of distance estimation. Based on a sample of 22 CVs

reconnection in this event consists of two parts, and the induced electric
field Erec is temporally correlated with the evolution of hard X-ray and
gamma-ray emission. In particular, the first hard X-ray and gamma-ray emission
peak occurred at 10:22 UT, corresponding to the magnetic reconnection in the

different acceleration mechanisms. A reasonable conclusion is that reconnection
electric field makes a crucial contribution to the acceleration of relativistic

CME-driven shocks play a dominant role in the gradual component.

of sufficient magnitude to account fo the observed cosmic acceleration. We show
that a single decaying species in a flat, dark-matter dominated cosmology

magnitude-redshift relation from Type Ia supernovae. However, a delayed bulk
viscosity, possibly due to a cascade of decaying particles may be able to
account for a significant fraction of the apparent cosmic acceleration.

a detonation wave which will then propagate inward burning the core of the star

fragmentation, whereas viscous heating and the high protostellar luminosity

reasonable accretion times, massive disks larger than ~150 AU are prone to
fragmentation. We develop an analytical estimate for the angular momentum of
accreted material, extending the analysis of Matzner and Levin (2005) to
account for strongly turbulent initial conditions. In a core-collapse model, we
predict that disks are marginally prone to fragmentation around stars of about
four to 15 solar masses -- even if we adopt conservative estimates of the
disks' radii and tendency to fragment. More massive stars are progressively
more likely to fragment, and there is a sharp drop in the stability of disk
accretion at the very high accretion rates expected above 110 solar masses.
Fragmentation may starve accretion in massive stars, especially above this
limit, and is likely to create swarms of small, coplanar companions.

substructures. Specifically, we introduce a reduced time delay and explore its
behavior as a function of the image configuration that is characterized by the
asymmetry and opening angle of the image pair. In particular we derive a
realistic conditional probability distribution. We find that the probability
distribution is sensitive to the image configuration such that more asymmetric

perturbations on the primary lens potential. On average time delays of double
lenses are less scattered than those of quadruple lenses. Furthermore, the
realistic conditional distribution allows a new statistical method to constrain
the Hubble constant. We find that 16 published time delay quasars constrain the
Hubble constant to be H_0=70+/-6 km/s/Mpc, where the value and its error are
estimated using jackknife resampling. After including rough estimates of the
sizes of important systematic errors, we find H_0=68+/-6(stat.)+/-8(syst.)
km/s/Mpc. The reasonable agreement with other estimates indicates the
usefulness of our new approach as a cosmological and astrophysical probe,
particularly in the era of large-scale synoptic surveys. (Abridged)

dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy Leo II. These stars cover the entire surface
area of Leo II and are radial velocity members. We obtained medium-resolution
multi-fiber spectroscopy with ESO/VLT's FLAMES spectrograph. The metallicities
were determined based on the near-infrared Ca II triplet. The resulting
metallicity distribution (MD) is asymmetric and peaks at [Fe/H]=-1.74 dex on
the Carretta & Gratton scale. The full range in metallicities extends from -2.4
to -1.1 dex. As in other dSphs, no extremely metal-poor red giants were found.
We compare Leo II's observed MD with model predictions for several other
Galactic dSphs from the literature. Leo II clearly exhibits a lack of more
metal poor stars, in analogy to the classical G-dwarf problem, which may
indicate a comparable `K-giant problem'. Moreover, its evolution appears to
have been affected by galactic winds. We use our inferred metallicities as an
input parameter for isochrone fits to SDSS photometry and derive approximate
ages. The resulting age-metallicity distribution covers the full age range from
2-15 Gyr on our adopted isochrone scale. During the first 7 Gyr relative to the
oldest stars [Fe/H] appears to have remained almost constant. The almost
constant metallicity at higher ages and a slight drop by about 0.3 dex
thereafter may be indicative of rejuvenation by low metallicity gas. Overall,
the age-metallicity relation appears to support the formation of Leo II from
pre-enriched gas. Evidence for enrichment is seen during the recent 2-4 Gyr.
Our findings support earlier photometric findings of Leo II as a galaxy with a
prominent old and a dominant intermediate-age population. We do not find a

(CCA) based on second-order statistics, to estimate the mixing matrix, a key
ingredient to separate astrophysical foregrounds superimposed to the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB). In the present application, the mixing matrix is
parameterized in terms of the spectral indices of Galactic synchrotron and
thermal dust emissions, while the free-free spectral index is prescribed by
basic physics, and is thus assumed to be known. We consider simulated
observations of the microwave sky with angular resolution and white stationary
noise at the nominal levels for the PLANCK satellite, and realistic foreground
emissions, with a position dependent synchrotron spectral index. We work with
two sets of PLANCK frequency channels: the low frequency set, from 30 to 143
GHz, complemented with the Haslam 408 MHz map, and the high frequency set, from
217 to 545 GHz. The concentration of intense free-free emission on the Galactic
plane introduces a steep dependence of the spectral index of the global
Galactic emission with Galactic latitude, close to the Galactic equator. This
feature makes difficult for the CCA to recover the synchrotron spectral index
in this region, given the limited angular resolution of PLANCK, especially at
low frequencies. A cut of a narrow strip around the Galactic equator (|b|<3
deg), however, allows us to overcome this problem. We show that, once this
strip is removed, the CCA allows an effective foreground subtraction, with
residual uncertainties inducing a minor contribution to errors on the recovered
CMB power spectrum.

like the magnetic field content or particle acceleration, and emission
processes, such as synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC), a complete modeling of
the multiwavelength data is necessary. LS 5039 has been detected along almost
all the electromagnetic spectrum thanks to several radio, infrared, optical and
soft X-ray detections. However, hard X-ray detections above 20 keV have been so
far elusive and/or doubtful, partly due to source confusion for the poor
spatial resolution of hard X-ray instruments. We report here on deep (300 ksec)
serendipitous INTEGRAL hard X-ray observations of LS 5039, coupled with
simultaneous VLA radio observations. We obtain a 20-40 keV flux of 1.1 +/- 0.3
mCrab (5.9 (+/-1.6) X 10^{-12} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}), a 40-100 keV upper limit of
1.5 mCrab (9.5 x 10^{-12} erg cm^{-2}s^{-1}), and typical radio flux densities
of about 25 mJy at 5GHz. These hard X-ray fluxes are significantly lower than
previous estimates obtained with BATSE in the same energy range but, in the
lower interval, agree with extrapolation of previous RXTE measurements. The
INTEGRAL observations also hint to a break in the spectral behavior at hard
X-rays. A more sensitive characterization of the hard X-ray spectrum of LS 5039
from 20 to 100 keV could therefore constrain key aspects of the jet physics,
like the relativistic particle spectrum and the magnetic field strength. Future
multiwavelength observations would allow to establish whether such hard X-ray
synchrotron emission is produced by the same population of relativistic
electrons as those presumably producing TeV emission through IC.

examine whether the UV-radiation of O-type stars can lead to the observed
pillar-like structures and can trigger star formation. We developed a new
implementation, based on a parallel Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics code (called
IVINE), that allows an efficient treatment of the effect of ionising radiation
from massive stars on their turbulent gaseous environment. Here we present
first results at very high resolution. We show that ionising radiation can
trigger the collapse of an otherwise stable molecular cloud. The arising
structures resemble observed structures (e.g. the pillars of creation in the
Eagle Nebula (M16) or the Horsehead Nebula B33). Including the effect of
gravitation we find small regions that can be identified as formation places of
individual stars. We conclude that ionising radiation from massive stars alone
can trigger substantial star formation in molecular clouds.

The searchers perform random walks in discrete time n=0,1,2, ..., N, where N is

the searchers step on a nearest-neighbour, and with probability (1-\alpha) they
leave the lattice and stay off until they land back on the lattice at a fixed

transition in easy-axis antiferromagnets. A comprehensive phenomenological
theory of easy-axis antiferromagnets displaying spin-flops is developed. It is
shown how the hierarchy of magnetic coupling strengths in these
antiferromagnets causes a strongly pronounced two-scale character in their
magnetic phase structure. In contrast to the major part of the magnetic phase
diagram, these antiferromagnets near the spin-flop region are described by an
effective model akin to uniaxial ferromagnets. For a consistent theoretical
description both higher-order anisotropy contributions and dipolar stray-fields
have to be taken into account near the spin-flop. In particular,
thermodynamically stable multidomain states exist in the spin-flop region,
owing to the phase coexistence at this first-order transition. For this region,
equilibrium spin-configurations and parameters of the multidomain states are
derived as functions of the external magnetic field. The components of the
magnetic susceptibility tensor are calculated for homogeneous and multidomain
states in the vicinity of the spin-flop. The remarkable anomalies in these
measurable quantities provide an efficient method to investigate magnetic
states and to determine materials parameters in bulk and confined

XY anisotropies. Doping with nonmagnetic impurities, such as Zn, is considered
according to classical percolation theory, whereas the effect of Sr, which
introduces charge carriers into the CuO(2) planes, is described as a dipolar

and the anisotropy gaps, as well as their evolution with both Zn and Sr doping.
We explain the nonmonotonic and reentrant behavior experimentally observed for

reduction, due to the nonmagnetic impurities, of the dipolar frustration
induced by the charge carriers (order-from-disorder). Furthermore, we find a
similar nonmonotonic and reentrant behavior for all the other observables
studied. Most remarkably, our results show that while for x=2% and z=0 the

coupling between shot noise and radiation pressure noise that produces a
squeezed output for the quantum noise at the dark-port of the interferometer
allowing these interferometers to operate with a sensitivity that exceeds the
standard quantum limit at certain frequencies. The ability of the detector to
take advantage of this squeezed output state depends in part on the readout
system used. With the phase modulated laser input planned for these
interferometers the quantum-noise limited sensitivity is slightly better when

Yang-Mills condensate in a flat expanding universe during the matter-dominated

is coupled either with the matter, or with both the matter and the radiation
components. The effective YM Lagrangian is completely determined by quantum
field theory up to 1-loop order. It is found that under very generic initial
conditions and for a variety of forms of coupling, the existence of the scaling
solution during the early stages and the subsequent exit from the scaling
regime are inevitable. The transition to the accelerating stage always occurs
around a redshift $z\simeq (0.3\sim 0.5)$. Moreover, when the Yang-Mills
condensate transfers energy into matter or into both matter and radiation, the
equation of state $w_y$ of the Yang-Mills condensate can cross over -1 around
$z\sim 2$, and takes on a current value $\simeq -1.1$. This is consistent with
the recent preliminary observations on supernovae Ia. Therefore, the
coincidence problem can be naturally solved in the effective YMC dark energy
models.

the arrival time (and its associated error) of the gravitational signal in each

the blind regions and in the case of 6 detectors, a precision less than 1

explains the observed neutrino masses, adopting a phenomenological approach
where the decay branching ratios of the triplets and the amount of
CP--violation in its different decay channels are assumed as free parameters.
We find that the solutions of the relevant Boltzmann equations lead to a rich
phenomenology, in particular much more complex compared to the
non--supersymmetric case, mainly due to the presence of an additional Higgs
doublet. Several unexpected and counter--intuitive behaviors emerge from our
analysis: the amount of CP violation in one of the decay channels can prove to
be be irrelevant to the final lepton asymmetry, leading to successful
leptogenesis even in scenarios with a vanishing CP violation in the leptonic
sector; gauge annihilations can be the dominant effect in the determination of
the evolution of the triplet density up to very high values of its mass,
leading anyway to a sizeable final lepton asymmetry, which is also a growing
function of the wash--out parameter K=Gamma_d/H, defined as usual as the ratio
between the triplet decay amplitude Gamma_d and the Hubble constant H; on the
other hand, cancellations in the Boltzmann equations may lead to a vanishing
lepton asymmetry if in one of the decay channels both the branching ratio and
the amount of CP violation are suppressed, but not vanishing. The present
analysis suggests that in the supersymmetric triplet see-saw model successful
leptogenesis can be attained in a wide range of scenarios, provided that an
asymmetry in the decaying triplets can act as a lepton--number reservoir.

  Dimensions","26 pages, 1 figure, submitted as a PDF file (PostScript may be

  discuss differential forms, added references",,,,"hep-ph",,"  In the past five years, there has been considerable research on the collider
phenomenology of TeV-scale extra compact dimensions which are universal - i.e.
accessible to all the Standard Model fields. We consider in detail a
fundamental conceptual issue in the higher-dimensional theory: Since the cross
product is only physically meaningful in three spatial dimensions, how do
traditional vector formulas involving the cross product or curl operation
generalize in the case of universal extra dimensions? For example, is angular
momentum physically meaningful, and, if so, how is it related to the position
and momentum vectors? We find that if angular velocity, torque, angular
momentum, and magnetic field, for example, are regarded as anti-symmetric
second-rank tensors instead of pseudovectors, we can construct tensor forms of
the standard cross product and curl equations that do generalize to higher
dimensions. Although Maxwell's equations have been generalized to extra
dimensions in terms of differential forms, we show that our simple technique
casts the generalized Maxwell's equations in a form very similar to the
standard vector calculus. We also provide direct integrals for the fields in a
practical tensor calculus form. We explore the electric and magnetic fields in
detail to show that there are no fundamental conceptual problems hidden in the
theory - e.g. how the Lorentz force can be meaningfully expressed in terms of
the velocity and magnetic field when the traditional cross product and
right-hand rule do not apply. Finally, we explore the effects that
compactification has on the effective form of Maxwell's equations, which could
be useful for direct tests of Coulomb's law.

represent certain boundary integrals - generalized Euler integrals - which for
N>= 6 correspond to multiple hypergeometric series (generalized Kampe de Feriet

we show that the leading string corrections to the Yang-Mills amplitude, of
order O(alpha'^2), originate from the well-known alpha'^2 Tr F^4 effective
interactions of four gauge field strength tensors. By using iteration based on
the soft gluon limit, we derive a simple formula valid to that order for

  Ambjorn, J. Jersak, July 2005",,,,"hep-th",,"  We describe the motivation behind the recent formulation of a nonperturbative
path integral for Lorentzian quantum gravity defined through Causal Dynamical
Triangulations (CDT). In the case of two dimensions the model is analytically
solvable, leading to a genuine continuum theory of quantum gravity whose ground
state describes a two-dimensional ""universe"" completely governed by quantum
fluctuations. One observes that two-dimensional Lorentzian and Euclidean
quantum gravity are distinct. In the second part of the review we address the
question of how to incorporate a sum over space-time topologies in the
gravitational path integral. It is shown that, provided suitable causality
restrictions are imposed on the path integral histories, there exists a
well-defined nonperturbative gravitational path integral including an explicit
sum over topologies in the setting of CDT. A complete analytical solution of
the quantum continuum dynamics is obtained uniquely by means of a double
scaling limit. We show that in the continuum limit there is a finite density of
infinitesimal wormholes. Remarkably, the presence of wormholes leads to a
decrease in the effective cosmological constant, reminiscent of the suppression
mechanism considered by Coleman and others in the context of a Euclidean path
integral formulation of four-dimensional quantum gravity in the continuum. In
the last part of the review universality and certain generalizations of the
original model are discussed, providing additional evidence that CDT define a
genuine continuum theory of two-dimensional Lorentzian quantum gravity.

counting short and semi-short multiplets which do not form long multiplets
found recently is shown to be related to particular cases of reduced

Through analysis of these, exact formulae are obtained for counting half and
some quarter BPS operators in the free case. Similarly, partial results for the
counting of semi-short operators are given. It is also shown in particular

supersymmetric theories derived from string compactifications. Even at
tree-level, the Kahler potential for the physical matter fields, as a function
of the moduli fields, is unknown for generic Calabi-Yau compactifications and
has only been computed for simple toroidal orientifolds. In this paper we
describe how the modular dependence of matter metrics may be extracted in a
perturbative expansion in the Kahler moduli. Scaling arguments, locality and
knowledge of the structure of the physical Yukawa couplings are sufficient to
find the relevant Kahler potential. Using these techniques we compute the
`modular weights' for bifundamental matter on wrapped D7 branes for
large-volume IIB Calabi-Yau flux compactifications. We also apply our
techniques to the case of toroidal compactifications, obtaining results
consistent with those present in the literature. Our techniques do not provide
the complex structure moduli dependence of the Kahler potential, but are
sufficient to extract relevant information about the canonically normalised
matter fields and the soft supersymmetry breaking terms in gravity mediated
scenarios.

incorporate type III examples, such as those arising from the transverse
geometry of codimension one foliations. Since the twisting of the commutators
turns the usual hypertrace constructed out of the Dixmier trace into a twisted
trace on the coordinate algebra, one would be tempted to interpret that as a
manifestation of twisting at the level of cyclic cohomology, akin to that
introduced by the authors in the context of Hopf cyclic cohomology. The main
point of this note, besides giving simple natural examples of the general
notion and developing the first basic steps of the theory, is to show that
contrary to the initial expectations no cohomological twisting is in fact
required. The Chern character of finitely summable spectral triples extends to
the twisted case, and lands in fact in ordinary (untwisted) cyclic cohomology.
The same holds true for the local Hochschild character. The index pairing with
ordinary (untwisted) K-theory continues to make sense and the index formula is
still given by the pairing of the corresponding Chern characters. This opens
the road to extending the local index formula, as well as the analogue of the
hypoelliptic construction on the dual system together with the corresponding
Thom isomorphism, to the context of twisted spectral triples of type III.

diffusion perturbed by a periodic reflection invariant vector field. The vector
field is assumed to have fixed direction but varying amplitude. The existence
of a homogenized limit is proven and formulas for the effective diffusion
constant are given. In dimension $d=1$ the effective diffusion constant is
always less than the constant for the pure diffusion. In $d>1$ this property no
longer holds in general.

J","Michigan Math. J., 55 (2007), no. 3, 693-713",,,"math.CV math.AG",,"  The study of proper rational mappings between balls in complex Euclidean
spaces naturally leads to the relationship between the degree and imbedding
dimension of such a mapping. The special case for monomial mappings is
equivalent to the question discussed in this paper. Estimate the degree $d$ of
a polynomial in $n$ real variables, assumed to have non-negative coefficients
and to be constant on a hyperplane, in terms of the number $N$ of its terms. No
such estimate is possible when $n=1$. The sharp bound $d\le 2N-3$ is known when
$n=2$. This paper includes two main results. The first provides a bound, not
sharp for $n\ge 3$, for all $n\ge 2$. This bound implies the more easily stated
bound $d\le {4(2N-3)\over 3(2n-3)}$ for $n\ge 3$. The second result is a
stabilization theorem; if $n$ is sufficiently large given $d$, then the sharp
bound $d \le {N-1 \over n-1}$ holds. In this situation we determine all
polynomials for which the bound is sharp.

to SL(2,C) inherits the structure of an algebraic variety known as the
""representation variety"" of G. This algebraic variety is an invariant of fg
presentations of G. Call a group G parafree of rank n if it shares the lower
central sequence with a free group of rank n, and if it is residually
nilpotent. The deviation of a fg parafree group is the difference between the
minimum possible number of generators of G and the rank of G. So parafree
groups of deviation zero are actually just free groups. Parafree groups that
are not free share a host of properties with free groups. In this paper
algebraic geometric invariants involving the number of maximal irreducible
components (mirc) of R(G) and the dimension of R(G) for certain classes of
one-relator parafree groups are computed. It is then shown that in an infinite
number of cases these invariants successfully discriminate between isomorphism
types within the class of parafree groups of the same rank. This is quite
surprising, since in this paper it also shown that an n generated group G is
free of rank n iff Dim(R(G))=3n. In fact, a direct consequence of Theorem 1.6
in this paper is that given an arbitrary positive integer k, and any integer r
> 1 there exist infinitely many non-isomorphic (fg) parafree groups of rank r
and deviation one with representation varieties of dimension 3r, having more
than k mirc of dimension 3r.

as well as that of the mutual interaction between blocks, are studied. It is
shown that the presence of a small number of blocks modifies the seismic
disturbance in a manner which evokes qualitatively, but not quantitatively,

Disturbances at a much greater level, induced by a large number of blocks (in

first show the pitfalls of popular methods, including maximum likelihood and

(im)possible. We prove that every model whose transition matrices can be
parameterized by an open set of multi-linear polynomials, either has
non-identifiable mixture distributions, in which case reconstruction is
impossible in general, or there exist linear tests which identify the topology.
This duality theorem, relies on our notion of linear tests and uses ideas from

the physico chemical nature of its constituent amino acids. The twenty
different types of amino acids, depending on their physico chemical properties,
can be grouped into three major classes - hydrophobic, hydrophilic and charged.
We have studied the anatomy of the weighted and unweighted networks of
hydrophobic, hydrophilic and charged residues separately for a large number of
proteins. Our results show that the average degree of the hydrophobic networks
has significantly larger value than that of hydrophilic and charged networks.
The average degree of the hydrophilic networks is slightly higher than that of
charged networks. The average strength of the nodes of hydrophobic networks is
nearly equal to that of the charged network; whereas that of hydrophilic
networks has smaller value than that of hydrophobic and charged networks. The
average strength for each of the three types of networks varies with its
degree. The average strength of a node in charged networks increases more
sharply than that of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic networks. Each of the
three types of networks exhibits the 'small-world' property. Our results
further indicate that the all amino acids' networks and hydrophobic networks
are of assortative type. While maximum of the hydrophilic and charged networks
are of assortative type, few others have the characteristics of disassortative
mixing of the nodes. We have further observed that all amino acids' networks

hydrophilic and charged networks do not have any hierarchical signature.

dynamics of transport factors and their interaction with the flexible FG-nups
as diffusion in an effective potential, using both analytical theory and
computer simulations. We show that specific binding of transport factors to the
FG-nups facilitates transport and provides the mechanism of selectivity. We
show that the high selectivity of transport can be accounted for by competition
for both binding sites and space inside the NPC, which selects for transport
factors over other macromolecules that interact only non-specifically with the
NPC. We also show that transport is relatively insensitive to changes in the
number and distribution of FG-nups in the NPC, due mainly to their flexibility;
this accounts for recent experiments where up to half of the total mass of the
NPC has been deleted, without abolishing the transport. Notably, we demonstrate
that previously established physical and structural properties of the NPC can
account for observed features of nucleocytoplasmic transport. Finally, our
results suggest strategies for creation of artificial nano-molecular sorting

following only a tiny fraction of the variables necessary for a perfectly
fine-grained description. Coarse graining in classical physics is made natural
by our limited powers of observation and computation. But in the modern quantum
mechanics of closed systems, some measure of coarse graining is inescapable
because there are no non-trivial, probabilistic, fine-grained descriptions.
This essay explores the consequences of that fact. Quantum theory allows for
various coarse-grained descriptions some of which are mutually incompatible.
For most purposes, however, we are interested in the small subset of
``quasiclassical descriptions'' defined by ranges of values of averages over
small volumes of densities of conserved quantities such as energy and momentum
and approximately conserved quantities such as baryon number. The
near-conservation of these quasiclassical quantities results in approximate
decoherence, predictability, and local equilibrium, leading to closed sets of
equations of motion. In any description, information is sacrificed through the
coarse graining that yields decoherence and gives rise to probabilities for
histories. In quasiclassical descriptions, further information is sacrificed in
exhibiting the emergent regularities summarized by classical equations of
motion. An appropriate entropy measures the loss of information. For a
``quasiclassical realm'' this is connected with the usual thermodynamic entropy
as obtained from statistical mechanics. It was low for the initial state of our
universe and has been increasing since.
