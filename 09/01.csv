For next generation measurements combining weak lensing, supernovae distances,

for fitting gravity simultaneously with the expansion equation of state,
diluting the equation of state estimation by less than 25% relative to when
general relativity is assumed, and determining the growth index to 8%. For weak

the poorly studied embedded cluster Serpens/G3-G6, located ~ 45' (3 pc) to the
south of the Serpens Cloud Core, and to determine the luminosity and mass
functions of its population of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs).
  Methods. Multi-wavelength broadband photometry was obtained to sample the
near and mid-IR spectral energy distributions to separate YSOs from field stars
and classify the YSO evolutionary stage. ISOCAM mapping in the two filters LW2
(5-8.5 um) and LW3 (12-18 um) of a 19' x 16' field was combined with JHKs data
from 2MASS, Ks data from Arnica/NOT, and L' data from SIRCA/NOT. Continuum
emission at 1.3 mm (IRAM) and 3.6 cm (VLA) was mapped to study the cloud
structure and the coldest/youngest sources. Deep narrow band imaging at the
2.12 um S(1) line of H2 from NOTCam/NOT was obtained to search for signs of
bipolar outflows.
  Results. We have strong evidence for a stellar population of 31 Class II
sources, 5 flat-spectrum sources, 5 Class I sources, and two Class 0 sources.
Our method does not sample the Class III sources. The cloud is composed of two
main dense clumps aligned along a ridge over ~ 0.5 pc plus a starless core
coinciding with absorption features seen in the ISOCAM maps. We find two
S-shaped bipolar collimated flows embedded in the NE clump, and propose the two
driving sources to be a Class 0 candidate (MMS3) and a double Class I (MMS2).
For the Class II population we find a best age of ~ 2 Myr and compatibility
with recent Initial Mass Functions (IMFs) by comparing the observed Class II
luminosity function (LF), which is complete to 0.08 L_sun, to various model LFs
with different star formation scenarios and input IMFs.

significant amount of synchrotron-emitting gas, which appears to co-exist with
a large reservoir of molecular gas. The spatial correlation between fluorescent
Fe K-alpha line emission at 6.4 keV and molecular line emission from Galactic
center molecular clouds has been explained as reflected X-rays from a past
outburst of Sgr A*. Here we present multi-wavelength study of a representative
Galactic center cloud Sgr C using Chandra, VLA and FCRAO. We note a correlation
between the nonthermal radio filaments in Sgr C and the X-ray features,
suggesting that the two are related. We account for this distribution in terms
of the impact of the relativistic particles from local (nonthermal filaments)
and extended sources with diffuse neutral gas producing both a nonthermal
bremsstrahlung X-ray continuum emission, as well as diffuse 6.4 keV line
emission. The production rate of Fe Kalpha photons associated with the
injection of electrons into a cloud as a function of column density is
calculated. The required energy density of low-energy cosmic rays associated
with the synchrotron emitting radio filaments or extended features is estimated
to be in the range between 20 and $\sim10^3$ eV cm^-3 for Sgr C, Sgr B1, Sgr
B2, and ``the 45 and -30 \kms'' clouds. We also generalize this idea to explain
the pervasive production of diffuse Kalpha line and TeV emission from the
Galactic center molecular clouds. In particular, we suggest that IC scattering
of the sub-millimeter radiation from dust by relativistic electrons may
contribute substantially to the large-scale diffuse TeV emission observed

this study, we have adopted a three-component (thin disk, thick disk and halo)
model to analyze star counts information. By calculating the stellar space
density as a function of distance from the Galactic plane, we determine that
the range of scale height for the thin disk varies from 220 to 320 pc. Although
220 pc seems an extreme value, it is close to the lower limit in the
literature. The range of scale height for the thick disk is from 600 to 1100
pc, and the corresponding space number density normalization is 7.0-1.0% of the
thin disk. We find that the scale height of the disk may be variable with
observed direction, which cannot simply be attributed to statistical errors.
Possibly the main reasons can be attributed to the disk (mainly the thick disk)
is flared, with a scale height increasing with radius. The structure is
consistent with merger origin for the thick disk formation. Adopting a de
Vaucouleurs $r^{1/4}$ law halo, we also find that the axis ratio towards the
Galactic center is somewhat flatter ($\sim 0.4$), while the shape of the halo
in the anticentre and antirotation direction is rounder with $c/a> 0.4$. Our
results show that star counts in different lines of sight can be used directly
to obtain a rough estimate of the shape of the stellar halo. Our solutions
support the Galactic models with a flattened inner halo, possibly it is formed
by a merger early in the Galaxy's history.

observable radiation most likely originates in a relativistic jet oriented at a
small angle with respect to the line of sight. This review starts out with a
general overview of the phenomenology of blazars, including results from a
recent multiwavelength observing campaign on 3C279. Subsequently, issues of
modeling broadband spectra will be discussed. Spectral information alone is not
sufficient to distinguish between competing models and to constrain essential
parameters, in particular related to the primary particle acceleration and
radiation mechanisms in the jet. Short-term spectral variability information
may help to break such model degeneracies, which will require snap-shot
spectral information on intraday time scales, which may soon be achievable for
many blazars even in the gamma-ray regime with the upcoming GLAST mission and
current advances in Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope technology. In addition to
pure leptonic and hadronic models of gamma-ray emission from blazars,
leptonic/hadronic hybrid models are reviewed, and the recently developed

while it increases by a factor 1.7 for the elliptical-like galaxies. We
identify several SFR periods; from z = 5 to 3.4 the FUV-band density increases
by at most 0.5dex, from z=3.4 to 1.2 it decreases by 0.08dex, from z=1.2 to
0.05 it declines steadily by 0.6dex. For the most luminous M_AB(1500) < -21
galaxies the FUV-band density drops by 2dex from z = 3.9 to 1.2, and for the
intermediate -21 < M_AB(1500) < -20 galaxies it drops by 2dex from z = 0.2 to
0. Comparing with dust corrected surveys, at 0.4 < z < 2 the FUV seems obscured
by a constant factor of ~1.8-2 mag, while at z < 0.5 it seems progressively
less obscured by up to ~0.9-1 mag when the dust-deficient early-type population
is increasingly dominating the B-band density. The VVDS results agree with a
downsizing picture where the most luminous sources cease to efficiently produce
new stars 12 Gyrs ago (at z~4), while intermediate luminosity sources keep
producing stars until 2.5 Gyrs ago (at z~0.2).(abridged)

gravitationally stratified background have been examined by performing
three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations. The current-carrying,
Poynting flux-dominated magnetic tower jet, which possesses a highly wound
helical magnetic field, is subject to the current-driven instability (CDI). We
find that, under general physical conditions including small perturbations in
the initial background profiles, the propagating magnetic tower jets develop
the non-axisymmetric, $m=1$ kink mode of the CDI. The kink mode grows on the
local Alfv\'en crossing time scale. In addition, two types of kink modes appear
in the system. At the central region where external thermal pressure
confinement is strong, only the internal kink mode is excited and will grow. A
large distance away from the central region where the external thermal pressure
becomes low, the external kink mode is observed. As a result, the exterior of
magnetic tower jets will be deformed into a large-scale wiggled structure. We
also discuss extensively the different physical processes that contribute to
the overall stability properties of the magnetic tower jets. Specifically, when
the jet propagates in an initially unperturbed background, we find that they
can survive the kink mode beyond the point predicted by the well-known
Kruskal-Shafranov (K-S) criterion. The stabilization in this case comes mainly
from the dynamical relaxation of magnetic twists during the propagation of
magnetic towers; the magnetic pitch is reduced and the corresponding K-S
critical wavelength becomes longer as the tower jet proceeds. Furthermore, we
show that the pressure-driven and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities do not occur
in the magnetic tower jets.

The long-period dereddened optical spectral slopes are calculated. We analyse
the average spectral slope distribution, which suggests that the spectra of
flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and high energy peaked BL Lac objects
(HBLs) are probably deformed by other emission components. The average spectral
slopes of low energy peaked BL Lac objects(LBLs), which scatter around 1.5,
show a good accordance with the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) loss-dominated
model. We present and discuss the variability between the spectral slope and
optical luminosity. The spectra of all HBLs and LBLs get flatter when they turn
brighter, while for FSRQs this trend does not exist or may even be reversed.
This phenomenon may imply that there is a thermal contribution to the optical
spectrum for FSRQs. For the FSRQ 1156+295, there is a hint that the slope gets
flatter at both the brightest and faintest states. Our result shows that three
subclasses locate in different regions in the pattern of slope variability
indicator versus average spectral slope. The relativistic jet mechanism is
supported by the significant correlation between the optical Doppler factor and
the average spectral slope.

Ne/O abundance to values as observed for nearby stars has been proposed as a
solution. Because of the absence of strong neon lines in the optical, neon
abundances are difficult to measure and the correct solar and stellar Ne/O
abundances are currently hotly debated. Based on X-ray spectra obtained with
XMM-Newton, we determine a reference value of Ne/O for the inactive, solar-like

X-rays), with three independent, line-based methods, using differential

results indicate a value of approx. 0.28 for Ne/O in alpha Cen, approximately
twice the value measured for the Sun, but still below the average value
obtained for other stars. The low Ne/O abundance of the Sun is peculiar when

obtain more and accurate Ne/O abundance measurements of low activity stars.

significant brightening (~ 1 mag) in the rest-frame 2800A characteristic
magnitude (M*) over the redshift range 0.3<z<1.7 and no evolution at higher
redshifts. The rest-frame 2800A luminosity density shows an increase by a
factor ~4 to z~2.2. We estimate the SFR to z~2.2 from the 1500A and 2800A
luminosities. The SFR derived from the 2800A luminosity density is almost
factor two higher than that derived from the 1500A luminosities. Attributing
this to differential dust extinction, we find that an E(B-V)=0.20 results in
the same extinction corrected SFR from both 1500A and 2800A luminosities. We
investigate the morphological composition of our sample by fitting Sersic
profiles to the galaxy images at a fixed rest-frame wavelength of 2800A at
0.5<z<2.2. We find that the fraction of apparently bulge-dominated galaxies
(Sersic index n>2.5) increases from ~10% at z~0.5 to ~30% at z~2.2. At the same
time, we note that galaxies get bluer at increasing redshift. This suggests a
scenario where an increased fraction of the star formation takes place in
bulge-dominated systems at high redshift. This could be the evidence that the
present day ellipticals are a result of assembly (i.e., mergers) of galaxies at
z>1. Finally, we find that galaxy sizes for a luminosity selected sample
evolves as (1+z)^{-1.1} between redshifts z=2.2 and z=1.1. This is consistent
with previous measurements and suggests a similar evolution over the redshift
range 0 < z < 6.

contain intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We carefully investigated the
XMM-Newton EPIC spectra of the four ULXs that were claimed to be strong
candidates of IMBHs by several authors. We first tried fitting by the standard
spectral model of disk blackbody (DBB) + power-law (PL), finding good fits to
all of the data, in agreement with others. We, however, found that the PL
component dominates the DBB component at $\sim$ 0.3 to 10 keV. Thus, the black
hole parameters derived solely from the minor DBB component are questionable.
Next, we tried to fit the same data by the ``$p$-free disk model'' without the
PL component, assuming the effective temperature profile of $T_{\rm eff}
\propto r^{-p}$ where $r$ is the disk radius. Interestingly, in spite of one
less free model parameters, we obtained similarly good fits with much higher
innermost disk temperatures, $1.8 < kT_{\rm in} < 3.2$ keV. More importantly,
we obtained $p \sim 0.5$, just the value predicted by the slim (super-critical)
disk theory, rather than $p = 0.75$ that is expected from the standard disk
model. The estimated black hole masses from the $p$-free disk model are much
smaller; $M\ltsim 40 M_\odot$. Furthermore, we applied a more sophisticated
slim disk model by Kawaguchi (2003, ApJ, 593,69), and obtained good fits with
roughly consistent black hole masses. We thus conclude that the central engines
of these ULXs are super-critical accretion flows to stellar-mass black holes.

narrow (Halpha) and broad band images at different wavelengths (u, B, g, V, r,
i, z, J, H, K), from Spitzer IRAC and MIPS images and from atomic and molecular
gas maps. The model in the absence of interaction (characterized by its
rotation velocity and spin parameter) is constrained by the unperturbed H band
light profile and by the Halpha rotation curve. We can reconstruct the observed
total-gas radial-density profile and the light surface-brightness profiles at
all wavelengths in a ram-pressure stripping scenario by making simple
assumptions about the gas removal process and the orbit of NGC 4569 inside the
cluster. The observed profiles cannot be reproduced by simply stopping gas
infall, thus mimicing starvation. Gas removal is required, which is more
efficient in the outer disk, inducing a radial quenching in the star formation
activity, as observed and reproduced by the model. This observational result,
consistent with theoretical predictions that a galaxy-cluster IGM interaction
is able to modify structural disk parameters without gravitational
perturbations, is discussed in the framework of the origin of lenticulars in

direction of evolved stars made with the Nancay Radiotelescope. The HI line at
21 cm has been detected in the circumstellar shells of a variety of evolved
stars: AGB stars, oxygen-rich and carbon-rich, Semi-Regular and Miras, and
Planetary Nebulae. The emissions are generally spatially resolved, i.e. larger
than 4', indicating shell sizes of the order of 1 pc which opens the
possibility to trace the history of mass loss over the past ~ 10^4-10^5 years.
The line-profiles are sometimes composite. The individual components have
generally a quasi-Gaussian shape; in particular they seldom show the
double-horn profile that would be expected from the spatially resolved
optically thin emission of a uniformly expanding shell. This probably implies
that the expansion velocity decreases outwards in the external shells (0.1-1
pc) of these evolved stars. The HI line-profiles do not necessarily match those
of the CO rotational lines. Furthermore, the centroid velocities do not always
agree with those measured in the CO lines and/or the stellar radial velocities.
The HI emissions may also be shifted in position with respect to the central
stars. Without excluding the possibility of asymmetric mass ejection, we
suggest that these two effects could also be related to a non-isotropic
interaction with the local interstellar medium. HI was detected in emission
towards several sources (rho Per, alpha Her, delta^2 Lyr, U CMi) that otherwise
have not been detected in any radio lines. Conversely it was not detected in
the two oxygen-rich stars with substantial mass-loss rate, NML Tau and WX Psc,

  Emission","Submitted to ApJ","Astrophys.J.666:1245-1255,2007","10.1086/519943",,"astro-ph",,"  Recent simulations of solar active regions have shown that it is possible to
reproduce both the total intensity and the general morphology of the high
temperature emission observed at soft X-ray wavelengths using static heating
models. There is ample observational evidence, however, that the solar corona
is highly variable, indicating a significant role for dynamical processes in
coronal heating. Because they are computationally demanding, full hydrodynamic
simulations of solar active regions have not been considered previously. In
this paper we make first application of an impulsive heating model to the
simulation of an entire active region,
  AR8156 observed on 1998 February 16. We model this region by coupling
potential field extrapolations to full solutions of the time-dependent
hydrodynamic loop equations. To make the problem more tractable we begin with a
static heating model that reproduces the emission observed in 4 different
\textit{Yohkoh} Soft X-Ray Telescope
  (SXT) filters and consider dynamical heating scenarios that yield
time-averaged SXT intensities that are consistent with the static case. We find
that it is possible to reproduce the total observed soft X-ray emission in all
of the SXT filters with a dynamical heating model, indicating that nanoflare
heating is consistent with the observational properties of the high temperature
solar corona.

IRS on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. The spectra show a vast range in
starburst SEDs. The silicate absorption ranges from essentially no absorption
to heavily obscured systems with an optical depth of tau(9.8um)~5. The spectral
slopes can be used to discriminate between starburst and AGN powered sources.
The monochromatic continuum fluxes at 15um and 30um enable a remarkably
accurate estimate of the total infrared luminosity of the starburst. We find
that the PAH equivalent width is independent of the total starburst luminosity
L_IR as both continuum and PAH feature scale proportionally. However, the
luminosity of the 6.2um feature scales with L_IR and can be used to approximate
the total infrared luminosity of the starburst. Although our starburst sample
covers about a factor of ten difference in the [NeIII]/[NeII] ratio, we found
no systematic correlation between the radiation field hardness and the PAH
equivalent width or the 7.7um/11.3um PAH ratio. These results are based on
spatially integrated diagnostics over an entire starburst region, and local
variations may be ``averaged out''. It is presumably due to this effect that
unresolved starburst nuclei with significantly different global properties
appear spectrally as rather similar members of one class of objects.

the spatial distribution of the dust grains and the evolution of their
size-frequency distribution due to collisions. We investigate how strongly
avalanche propagation depends on different parameters (e.g., amount of dust
released in the initial break-up, collisional properties of dust grains and
their distribution in the disc). Our simulations show that avalanches evolve on
timescales of ~1000 years, propagating outwards following a spiral-like
pattern, and that their amplitude exponentially depends on the number density
of dust grains in the system. We estimate a probability for witnessing an
avalanche event as a function of disc densities, for a gas-free case around an
A-type star, and find that features created by avalanche propagation can lead
to observable asymmetries for dusty systems with a beta Pictoris-like dust
content or higher. Characteristic observable features include: (i) a brightness
asymmetry of the two sides for a disc viewed edge-on, and (ii) a one-armed open
spiral or a lumpy structure in the case of face-on orientation. A possible

abundance in high-mass star-forming cores, and to investigate its dependence on
the physical conditions. In this way we wish to provide constraints on the
chemistry models concerning the formation of SiO in the gas phase or via grain
mantle evaporation. The work addresses also CH3CCH chemistry as the kinetic
temperature is determined using this molecule.
  Methods. We estimate the physical conditions of 15 high-mass star-forming
cores and derive the fractional SiO and CH3CCH abundances in them by using
spectral line and dust continuum observations with the SEST.
  Results. The kinetic temperatures as derived from CH3CCH range from 25 to 39
K. The SiO emission regions are extended and typically half of the integrated
line emission comes from the velocity range traced out by CH3CCH emission. The
upper limit of SiO abundance in this 'quiescent' gas component is ~10^-10. The
average CH3CCH abundance is about 7 x 10^-9. It shows a shallow, positive
correlation with the temperature, whereas SiO shows the opposite tendency.
  Conclusions. We suggest that the high CH3CCH abundance and its possible
increase when the clouds get warmer is related to the intensified desorption of
the chemical precursors of the molecule from grain surfaces. In contrast, the
observed tendency of SiO does not support the idea that the evaporation of
Si-containing species from the grain mantles would be important, and it
contradicts with the models where neutral reactions with activation barriers
dominate the SiO production. A possible explanation for the decrease is that
warmer cores represent more evolved stages of core evolution with fewer
high-velocity shocks and thus less efficient SiO replenishment.

X-rays with XMM-Newton and in the U-band with the XMM-Newton Optical/UV Monitor

(U>19.6-20.6 mag), whereas 2MASSJ04141188+2811535 was detected in the U-band.
Remarkably, the magnitude of this brown dwarf increased regularly from U~19.5
mag at the beginning of the observation, peaked 6h later at U~18.4 mag, and
then decreased to U~18.65 mag in the next 2h. The first OM U-band measurement
is consistent with the quiescent level observed about one year later thanks to
ground follow-up observations. This brown dwarf was not detected in X-rays by
XMM-Newton during the OM observation. We discuss the possible sources of U-band
variability for this young brown dwarf, namely a magnetic flare, non-steady
accretion onto the substellar surface, and rotational modulation of a hot spot.
We conclude that this event is related to accretion from a circumsubstellar
disk, where the mass accretion rate was about a factor of 3 higher than during
the quiescent level.

synthetic distribution of the pulsators is, on average, brighter by about 0.1

derived in the K band for both fundamental and first overtone pulsators,
providing a useful tool for distance evaluations with an intrinsic uncertainty
of about 0.15 mag, which decreases to about 0.04 mag if the mass term is taken
into account. The constraints provided by the evolutionary models are used to
derive evolutionary (i.e, mass-independent) Period-Magnitude-Color relations

about 0.1 mag, once the intrinsic colors are well known. We also use model
computations from the literature to investigate the effect of metal content
both on the instability strip and on the evolutionary Period-Magnitude-Color

We use Gutzwiller projected fermionic variational wavefunctions to explore the
phase diagram and correlation functions of SU(N) spin models in the
self-conjugate representation, with Heisenberg bilinear and biquadratic
interactions. In 1D, the variational phase diagram of the SU(4) spin chain is
constructed by examining instabilities of the Gutzwiller projected free fermion
ground state to various broken symmetries, and it agrees well with exact
results.The spin and dimer correlations of the Gutzwiller projected free
fermion state with N flavors of fermions are also in good agreement with exact
and 1/N calculations for the critical points of SU(N) spin chains. In 2D, the
variational phase diagram on the square lattice is obtained by studying
instabilities of the Gutzwiller projected pi-flux state. The variational ground
state of the pure Heisenberg model is found to exhibit long range Neel order
for N=2,4 and spin Peierls order for N > 4. For N=4 and 6, biquadratic
interactions lead to a complex phase diagram which includes an extended valence
bond crystal in both cases, as well as a stable pi-flux phase for N=6. The spin
correlations of the projected pi-flux state at N=4 are in good agreement with
1/N calculations. We find that this state also shows strongly enhanced dimer
correlations, in qualitative accord with the large-N results. We compare our

which the unique electromagnetic response occurs. In this paper we present
three methods (unique to superconductors) to accomplish this tuning:
temperature, dc magnetic field, and rf magnetic field. Data are shown for dc
and rf magnetic field tuning of a single Nb split-ring resonator (SRR). It was
found that the dc field tuning was hysteritic in the resonant frequency data,
while the quality factor, $Q$, was less hystertic. The rf power tuning showed
no hysteresis, but did show supression of the $Q$ at high power.

strongly depends on the number of conduction electrons, their spin polarization
and the position of the unoccupied Mn 3d states with respect to Fermi energy.
Various magnetic phases are obtained depending on these characteristics. The
conditions leading to diverse magnetic behavior are identified. We find that in
the case of a large conduction electron spin polarization and the unoccupied Mn
3d states lying far above the Fermi level, an RKKY-like ferromagnetic
interaction is dominating. On the other hand, the antiferromagnetic
superexchange becomes important in the presence of large peaks of the
unoccupied Mn 3d states lying close to the Fermi energy. The overall magnetic
behavior depends on the competition of these two exchange mechanisms. The
obtained results are in very good agreement with the available experimental
data.

constraint on current transients compatible with d = 2.5 dimensionality. At
that time with no direct observations of the domains, it was not possible to
conclude whether this was a true Hausdorff dimension or a numerical artefact
caused by an approximation in the theory (which ignored the dependence of
domain wall velocity upon domain diameter). Recent data suggest that the
switching dimensionality is truly fractal with d = 2.5. The critical exponent
\beta characterizing the order parameter P(T) can be written as a continuous
function of dimension d as \beta(d)= [\nu(d)/2] [d+\eta(d)-2], which is exact
within hyperscaling; here \nu and \eta are the exponents characterizing the
pair correlation function G(r,T) and the structure factor S(q,T). For d=2.5 the
estimate is that \beta is approximately 1/4.

propose a solution procedure for Lagrangian finite element discretization of a
static nonlinear compressible Mooney-Rivlin hyperelastic solid. We consider the
case in which the boundary condition is a large prescribed deformation, so that
mesh tangling becomes an obstacle for straightforward algorithms. Our solution
procedure involves a largely geometric procedure to untangle the mesh: solution
of a sequence of linear systems to obtain initial guesses for interior nodal
positions for which no element is inverted. After the mesh is untangled, we
take Newton iterations to converge to a mechanical equilibrium. The Newton
iterations are safeguarded by a line search similar to one used in
optimization. Our computational results indicate that the algorithm is up to 70
times faster than a straightforward Newton continuation procedure and is also
more robust (i.e., able to tolerate much larger deformations). For a few
extremely large deformations, the deformed mesh could only be computed through
the use of an expensive Newton continuation method while using a tight
convergence tolerance and taking very small steps.

to be roughly $D_F \sim 2$ from a wide range of redshift surveys. If correct,
this statistic is of interest for two main reasons: fractal scaling is an
implicit representation of information content, and also the value itself is a
geometric signature of area. It is proposed that the fractal distribution of
galaxies may thus be interpreted as a signature of holography (``fractal
holography''), providing more support for current theories of holographic
cosmologies. Implications for entropy bounds are addressed. In particular,
because of spatial scale invariance in the matter distribution, it is shown
that violations of the spherical entropy bound can be removed. This holographic
condition instead becomes a rigid constraint on the nature of the matter
density and distribution in the Universe. Inclusion of a dark matter
distribution is also discussed, based on theoretical considerations of possible
universal CDM density profiles.

reverse in scales of order a Hubble time. We find that due to the dynamics of
gravity and nonlocal entanglement, a finite size system such as a DeSitter

phenomenon arises from the dynamic gravitational instabilities that develop
during a DeSitter epoch and turn catastrophic. A reversed arrow of time is
clearly in disagreement with observations. Thus we are led to conclude: Nature
forbids a fundamental $\Lambda$. Or else general relativity must be modified in
the IR regime when $\Lambda$ dominates the expansion of the Universe.

focused on the precision measurements of the nucleon-to-$\Delta$ transition by
means of electromagnetic probes. We confront the results of these measuremnts
with the state-of-the-art calculations based on chiral effective-field theories
(EFT), lattice QCD, large-$N_c$ relations, perturbative QCD, and QCD-inspired
models. We also discuss the link of the nucleon-to-$\Delta$ form factors to
generalized parton distributions (GPDs). Some of the theoretical approaches are
reviewed in detail, in particular, recent dynamical and unitary-isobar models
of pion electroproduction, which are extensively used in the interpretation of
experiments. Also, the novel extension of chiral EFTs to the energy domain of
the $\Delta$-resonance is described in detail. The two-photon exchange effects
in the electroexcitation of the $\De$-resonance are addressed here as well.

model-independent analytical analysis is presented. The CP-averaged branching
ratio difference $\Delta R = R_c - R_n$ in $B\to \pi K$ decays with $R_c =
2Br(\pi^0K^-)/Br(\pi^-\bar{K}^0)$ and $R_n =Br(\pi^+K^-)/2Br(\pi^0\bar{K}^0)$
is reduced though it remains larger than the prediction from the standard
model(SM) as both measured $R_n$ and $R_c$ are enhanced, which indicates that a
room for new physics becomes smaller. The present data of $\pi\pi$ decay reduce
the ratio $|C/T|$ from the previous value of $|C/T|\simeq 0.8 $ to $|C/T|
\simeq 0.65$, which is still larger than the theoretical estimations based on
QCD factorization and pQCD. Within SM and flavor SU(3) symmetry, the current
$\pi K$ data also diminish the ratio $|C'/T'|$ from the previous value $|C'/T'|
\simeq 2$ to $|C'/T'| \simeq 1.16$ with a large strong phase $\delta_{C'}
\simeq -2.65$, while its value remains much larger than the one extracted from
the $\pi \pi$ modes. The direct CP violation $A_{CP}(\pi^0\bar{K}^0)$ is
predicted to be $A_{CP}(\pi^0\bar{K}^0) = -0.15\pm0.03$, which is consistent
with the present data. Two kinds of new effects in both strong and weak phases
of the electroweak penguin diagram are considered. It is found that both cases
can reduce the ratio to $|C'/T'| = 0.40\sim 0.80$ and lead to roughly the same
predictions for CP violation in $\pi^0 K^0$.

perturbations and optimize their gauge around backgrounds with one
non-homogeneous dimension, namely of co-homogeneity 1, while preserving
locality in this dimension. Derivatively-gauged fields are shown to have a
purely algebraic action; they can be decoupled from the other fields through
gauge-invariant re-definitions; a potential for the other fields is generated
in the process; in the remaining action each gauge function eliminates one
field without residual gauge. The procedure applies to spherically symmetric
and to cosmological backgrounds in either General Relativity or gauge theories.
The widely used ``gauge invariant perturbation theory'' is closely related. The
supplied general proof elucidates the algebraic mechanism behind it as well as
the method's domain of validity and its assumptions.

field that begins its evolution in an effective initial state. The effective
initial state is a formalism that encodes the signatures of new physics in the
structure of the quantum state of a field; in an inflationary setting, these
signatures could include trans-Planckian effects. We treat both the scalar
field and gravity equivalently, considering each as a small quantum fluctuation
about a spatially independent background. The classical gravitational equations
of motion then arise as a tadpole condition on the graviton. The contribution
of the scalar field to these equations contains divergences associated with the
structure of the effective state. However, these divergences occur only at the
initial time, where the state was defined, and they accompany terms depending
solely upon the classical gravitational background. We define the
renormalization prescription that adds the appropriate counterterms at the
initial-time boundary to cancel these divergences, and illustrate it with
several examples evaluated at one-loop order.

  exposition of proof of Theorem 1.2",,,,"math.SG math.DS",,"  This paper introduces techniques of symplectic topology to the study of
homoclinic orbits in Hamiltonian systems. The main result is a strong
generalization of homoclinic existence results due to Sere and to Coti-Zelati,
Ekeland and Sere, which were obtained by variational methods. Our existence
result uses a modification of a construction due to Mohnke (originally in the
context of Legendrian chords), and an energy--capacity inequality of Chekanov.
In essence, we show the existence of a homoclinic orbit by showing a certain
Lagrangian embedding cannot exist. We consider a (possibly time dependent)
Hamiltonian system on an exact symplectic manifold (W, \omega = d \lambda) with
a hyperbolic rest point. In the case of periodic time dependence, we show the
existence of an orbit homoclinic to the rest point if \lambda(X_H) - H is
positive and proper, H is positive outside a compact set and proper, and (W,
\omega) admits the structure of a Weinstein domain. In the autonomous case, we
establish the existence of an orbit homoclinic to the rest point if the
critical level is of restricted contact-type, and the critical level has a
Hamiltonian displaceable neighbourhood.

is caused by the nonlinear energy transfer from lower harmonics to the

of spectrum by the nonlinearity. We show that any omega-limit trajectory has
the time-spectrum in the spectral gap [-m,m] and satisfies the original

Groeneboom, Maathuis and Wellner [Ann. Statist. (2008) 36 1031--1063] proved
that both types of estimators converge globally and locally at rate $n^{1/3}$.
We use these results to derive the local limiting distributions of the
estimators. The limiting distribution of the naive estimator is given by the
slopes of the convex minorants of correlated Brownian motion processes with
parabolic drifts. The limiting distribution of the MLE involves a new
self-induced limiting process. Finally, we present a simulation study showing
that the MLE is superior to the naive estimator in terms of mean squared error,
both for small sample sizes and asymptotically.

attributed to five processes: the direct knockout of a nuclear alpha cluster,
the knockout of four nucleons with a total charge number of 2, the formation of
the DeltaSi isobaric nucleus, the formation of the Delta isobar in the
interaction of the incident proton with a nuclear nucleon, and the production

lower bound on the rate of convergence of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithms as a function of the target density and proposal density. The bound
relies on approximating the second largest eigenvalue in the spectrum of the
MCMC operator using a variational principle and the approach is applicable to
problems with continuous state spaces. We apply the method to one dimensional
examples with Gaussian and quartic target densities, and we contrast the
performance of the Random Walk Metropolis-Hastings (RWMH) algorithm with a
``smart'' variant that incorporates gradient information into the trial moves.
We find that the variational method agrees quite closely with numerical
simulations. We also see that the smart MCMC algorithm often fails to converge
geometrically in the tails of the target density except in the simplest case we
examine, and even then care must be taken to choose the appropriate scaling of
the deterministic and random parts of the proposed moves. Again, this calls
into question the utility of smart MCMC in more complex problems. Finally, we
apply the same method to approximate the rate of convergence in
multidimensional Gaussian problems with and without importance sampling. There
we demonstrate the necessity of importance sampling for target densities which
depend on variables with a wide range of scales.

where pruning of neural connectivity (and neuron cell death) occurs in early
life, this feature is present also in our model, which is found to stabilize

initial conditions in nonlinear dynamical systems. The basic idea to avoid this
sensitivity is to run the model many times under several slightly-different
initial conditions, merging the resulting forecast in a combined product. We
argue that this blending procedure is unphysical, and that a single trajectory
should be chosen instead. We illustrate our case with a climate model. While
most of the current climate simulations use the ensemble average technique as
merging procedure, this paper shows that this choice presents several
drawbacks, including a serious underestimation of future climate extremes. It
is also shown that a sensible choice of a single estimate from the ensemble
solves this problem, partly overcoming the inherent sensitivity to initial
conditions of those non-linear systems with a large number of degrees of

time horizon before and after its well defined local maxima of the cusp-like
shape decorated with oscillations. The rising and falling paths of the index
peaks can be described by the Mittag-Leffler function superposed with various
types of oscillations. The latter is a solution of our model of index dynamics
defined by the nonhomogeneous fractional relaxation equation. This solution is
a generalised analog of an exactly solvable model of viscoelastic materials. We
found that the Warsaw Stock Exchange can be considered as an intermediate
system lying between two complex ones, defined by short and long-time limits of
the Mittag-Leffler function; these limits are given by the
Kohlraush-Williams-Watts law for the initial times, and the power-law or the
Nutting law for asymptotic time. Hence follows the corresponding short- and
long-time power-law behaviour (different universality classes) of the
time-derivative of the logarithm of WIG which can in fact be viewed as the
finger print of a dynamical critical phenomenon.

qubits with a Hamiltonian composed of nearest-neighbor two-body interactions -
such that the ground state is a universal resource for quantum computation
using single-qubit measurements. This ground state approximates a cluster state
that is encoded into a larger number of physical qubits. The Hamiltonian we use
is motivated by the projected entangled pair states, which provide a
transparent mechanism to produce such approximate encoded cluster states on
square or other lattice structures (as well as a variety of other quantum
states) as the ground state. We show that the error in this approximation takes
the form of independent errors on bonds occurring with a fixed probability. The
energy gap of such a system, which in part determines its usefulness for
quantum computation, is shown to be independent of the size of the lattice. In
addition, we show that the scaling of this energy gap in terms of the coupling
constants of the Hamiltonian is directly determined by the lattice geometry. As
a result, the approximate encoded cluster state obtained on a hexagonal lattice
(a resource that is also universal for quantum computation) can be shown to
have a larger energy gap than one on a square lattice with an equivalent
Hamiltonian.
