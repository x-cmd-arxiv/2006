directional recoil signal on the capabilities of a directional detector.
Specifically we consider variations in the nuclear recoil energy threshold, the
background rate, whether the detector measures the recoil momentum vector in 2
or 3 dimensions and whether or not the sense of the momentum vector can be
determined. We find that the property with the biggest effect on the required
exposure is the measurement of the momentum vector sense. If the detector
cannot determine the recoil sense, the exposure required is increased by an
order of magnitude for 3-d read-out and two orders of magnitude for 2-d
read-out. For 2-d read-out the required exposure, in particular if the senses
can not be measured, can be significantly reduced by analyzing the reduced
angles with the, time dependent, projected direction of solar motion
subtracted. The background rate effectively places a lower limit on the WIMP
cross-section to which the detector is sensitive; it will be very difficult to
detect WIMPs with a signal rate more than an order of magnitude below the
background rate. Lowering the energy threshold also reduces the required
exposure, but only for thresholds above 20 keV.

spectroscopic signatures of AGN activity, but almost all the other X-ray
detections are also likely to host an accreting black hole based on their X-ray
properties. The AGN exhibit a wide range in X-ray luminosity, from weak
Seyferts to bright QSOs. Optical spectroscopy identified approximately 1/3 of
the X-ray detected sources as broad line QSOs, 1/3 as narrow line AGN and 1/3
as normal star forming LBGs. The fraction of X-ray detected LBGs is 3%, much
lower than has been found for submm selected galaxies. 2 galaxies have X-ray
luminosities, spectra and f_x/f_opt values that are consistent with emission
from star formation processes and are candidate X-ray bright, pure starburst
galaxies at z~3. X-ray spectral analysis of the LBGs shows a mean photon index
1.96, similar to local AGN. There is evidence for absorption in at least 40% of
the objects. Significantly more absorption is evident in the narrow line AGN,
consistent with AGN unification schemes. After correction for absorption the
narrow and broad line objects show the same average luminosity. LBGs
spectroscopically classified as normal galaxies are less luminous in X-ray
indicating that the host galaxy is outshining any optical AGN signature. For
the LBGs without direct detections, stacking the X-ray flux in the 2 deepest
fields under consideration (the HDF-N and GWS) produced significant detections
in each. The detection in the HDF-N gives an X-ray derived SFR of 42.4+/-7.8

expected constraints on dark energy parameters. To address this issue, we
perform a likelihood analysis of an ideal cluster survey similar in size and
depth to the upcoming South Pole Telescope/Dark Energy Survey (SPT-DES). We
analyze a model in which the strength of the non-Gaussianity is parameterized
by the constant fNL; this model has been used extensively to derive Cosmic

us to make contact with those works. We find that the constraining power of the

non-Gaussianity provided that cluster redshift information is included in the

significantly current and future CMB constraints on non-Gaussianity. However,
when all systematics are under control, it could constitute a valuable cross
check to CMB observations.

differences in the material that is released as well as the time evolution of
this material.

is presented. For a range of plausible locations of the VHE gamma-ray emission
region and the allowable range of viewing angles, the de-absorbed, intrinsic
VHE gamma-ray spectra and total VHE photon fluxes and luminosities are
calculated and compared to luminosity constraints based on wind accretion onto
the compact object in LS 5039. It is found that (1) it is impossible to choose
the viewing angle and location of the VHE emission region in a way that the
intrinsic (deabsorbed) fluxes and spectra in superior and inferior conjunction
are identical; consequently, the intrinsic VHE luminosities and spectral shapes
must be fundamentally different in different orbital phases, (2) if the VHE
luminosity is limited by wind accretion from the companion star and the system
is viewed at an inclination angle of i > 40 deg., the emission is most likely
beamed by a larger Doppler factor than inferred from the dynamics of the
large-scale radio outflows, (3) the still poorly constrained viewing angle
between the line of sight and the jet axis is most likely substantially smaller
than the maximum of ~ 64 deg. inferred from the lack of eclipses.(4)
Consequently, the compact object is more likely to be a black hole rather than
a neutron star. (5) There is a limited range of allowed configurations for
which the expected > 1 TeV neutrino flux would actually anti-correlate with the
observed VHE gamma-ray emission. If hadronic models for the gamma-ray
production in LS 5039 apply, a solid detection of the expected VHE neutrino
flux and its orbital modulation with km^3 scale water-Cherenkov neutrino
detectors might require the accumulation of data over more than 3 years.

region in the Galactic anti-center reveal numerous isolated, small (a few pc in
size), and cold (T_k<400 K) HI clouds at low negative velocities, distinctly
separated from the HI disk emission (`low-velocity clouds', LVCs). These clouds
are most likely located in the transition region between the Galactic disk and
halo (at scale heights of 60--900 pc), yet they have properties of typical cold
neutral clouds. LVCs are colder and, most likely, smaller and less massive than
Lockman's clouds in the disk/halo interface region of the inner Galaxy. Our
observations demonstrate that the cloudy structure of the interface region is
most likely a general phenomenon, not restricted to the inner Galaxy. LVCs have
sizes and radial velocities in agreement with the expectations for clouds
formed in low-temperature fountain flows, although we measure a factor of ten
higher HI column densities. Alternatively, LVCs could represent the final
stages of the infalling intergalactic material in the on-going construction of
the Galaxy.

a typical compact high velocity cloud (HVC) with a well-defined core/envelope

of an eccentric binary with equal and unequal masses. We find that the
circumblack-hole disks are formed around each black holes regardless of
simulation parameters. There are two-step mechanisms to cause an accretion flow
from the circumbinary disk onto supermassive binary black holes: First, the
tidally induced elongation of the circumbinary disk triggers mass inflow
towards two closest points on the circumbinary disk from the black holes. Then,
the gas is increasingly accumulated on these two points owing to the
gravitational attraction of black holes. Second, when the gas can pass across
the maximum loci of the effective binary potential, it starts to overflow via
their two points and freely infalls to each black hole. In circular binaries,
the gas continues to be supplied from the circumbinary disk (i.e. the gap
between the circumbinary disk and the binary black hole is always closed.) In
eccentric binaries, the mass supply undergoes the periodic on/off transitions
during one orbital period because of the variation of periodic potential. The
gap starts to close after the apastron and to open again after the next
periastron passage. Due to this gap closing/opening cycles, the mass-capture
rates are eventually strongly phase dependent. This could provide observable
diagnosis for the presence of supermassive binary black holes in merged
galactic nuclei.

formation. The inclination-corrected HI column density in the two brightest HII

filtering of the CMB signal. One the one hand, the filter steerability renders
the computation of the local orientation of the CMB features affordable in
terms of computation time. On the other hand, the scale-space nature of the
wavelet filtering allows to explore the alignment of the local structures at
different scales, probing possible different phenomena. We present the WMAP
first-year data analysis recently performed by the same authors (Wiaux et al.),
where an extremely significant anisotropy was found. In particular, a preferred
plane was detected, having a normal direction with a northern end position
close to the northern end of the CMB dipole axis. In addition, a most preferred
direction was found in that plane, with a northern end direction very close to
the north ecliptic pole. This result synthesised for the first time previously
reported anomalies identified in the direction of the dipole and the ecliptic
poles axes. In a forthcoming paper (Vielva et al.), we have extended our
analysis to the study of individual frequency maps finding first indications
for discarding foregrounds as the origin of the anomaly. We have also tested
that the preferred orientations are defined by structures homogeneously
distributed in the sky, rather than from localised regions. We have also
analysed the WMAP 3-year data, finding the same anomaly pattern, although at a
slightly lower significance level.

double-sided jet. Although no optical counterpart has been found so far for 1E
1740.7-2942, its X-ray activity strongly points to a galactic nature. Aims. We
aim to improve our understanding of the hard X-ray and gamma-ray production in
the system, exploring whether the jet can emit significantly at high energies
under the light of the present knowledge. Methods. We have modeled the source
emission, from radio to gamma-rays, with a cold-matter dominated jet model.
INTEGRAL data combined with radio and RXTE data, as well as EGRET and HESS
upper-limits, are used to compare the computed and the observed spectra.
Results. From our modeling, we find out that jet emission cannot explain the
high fluxes observed at hard X-rays without violating at the same time the
constraints from the radio data, favoring the corona origin of the hard X-rays.
Also, 1E 1740.7-2942 might be detected by GLAST or AGILE at GeV energies, and
by HESS and HESS-II beyond 100 GeV, with the spectral shape likely affected by
photon-photon absorption in the disk and corona photon fields.

  Methods: Spitzer Space Telescope 5-35 micron spectra of 54 pre-main sequence

stars with unknown spectral type.
  Results: Compact PAH emission is detected towards at least 8 sources of which
5 are Herbig Ae/Be stars. The 11.2 micron PAH feature is detected in all of
these sources, as is the 6.2 micron PAH feature where short wavelength data are
available. However, the 7.7 and 8.6 micron features appear strongly in only 1
of these 4 sources. PAH emission is observed towards at least 3 T Tauri stars
(8% detection rate). The lowest mass source with PAHs in our sample is T Cha
(G8). All 4 sources in our sample with evidence for dust holes in their inner
disk show PAH emission, increasing the feature/continuum ratio. Typical 11.2
micron line intensities are an order of magnitude lower than those observed for
the more massive Herbig Ae/Be stars. Measured line fluxes indicate PAH
abundances that are factors of 10-100 lower than standard interstellar values.
Conversely, PAH features from disks exposed to stars with Teff<=4200K without
enhanced UV are predicted to be below the current detection limit, even for
high PAH abundances. Disk modeling shows that the 6.2 and 11.2 micron features
are the best PAH tracers for T Tauri stars, whereas the 7.7 and 8.6 micron

is known to be potentially overstable. We determine the vertical structure of
the disc and its modes, treating radiative energy transport in the diffusion
approximation. In the limit of very long radial wavelength, an analytical
criterion for viscous overstability is obtained, which involves the effective
shear and bulk viscosity, the adiabatic exponent and the opacity law of the
disc. This differs from the prediction of a two-dimensional model. On shorter
wavelengths (a few times the disc thickness), the criterion for overstability
is more difficult to satisfy because of the different vertical structure of the
mode. In a low-viscosity disc a third regime of intermediate wavelengths
appears, in which the overstability is suppressed as the horizontal velocity
perturbations develop significant vertical shear. We suggest that this effect
determines the damping rate of eccentricity in protoplanetary discs, for which
the long-wavelength analysis is inapplicable and overstability is unlikely to
occur on any scale. In thinner accretion discs and in decretion discs around Be
stars overstability may occur only on the longest wavelengths, leading to the
preferential excitation of global eccentric modes.

about half of the surveyed protostars and brown dwarfs. Overall, 136 out of 169

by the discrete nature of stars in stellar systems, especially in the case of

to statistical effects) affecting the integrated colours and mass--to--light

instabilities of a homogeneous state undergoing Keplerian shear. Previously
these have been analysed with simple hydrodynamic models. We instead employ a
kinetic theory, in which we solve the linearised moment equations derived in
Shu and Stewart 1985 for a dilute ring. This facilitates an examination of
velocity anisotropy and non-Newtonian stress, and their effects on the viscous
and viscous/gravitational instabilities thought to occur in Saturn's rings.
Because we adopt a dilute gas model, the applicability of our results to the
actual dense rings of Saturn are significantly curtailled. Nevertheless this
study is a necessary preliminary before an attack on the difficult problem of
dense ring dynamics. We find the Shu and Stewart formalism admits analytic
stability criteria for the viscous overstability, viscous instability, and
thermal instability. These criteria are compared with those of a hydrodynamic
model incorporating the effective viscosity and cooling function computed from
the kinetic steady state. We find the two agree in the `hydrodynamic limit'
(i.e. many collisions per orbit) but disagree when collisions are less
frequent, when we expect the viscous stress to be increasingly non-Newtonian
and the velocity distribution increasingly anisotropic. In particular,
hydrodynamics predicts viscous overstability for a larger portion of parameter
space. We also numerically solve the linearised equations of the more accurate
Goldreich and Tremaine 1978 kinetic model and discover its linear stability to
be qualitatively the same as that of Shu and Stewart's. Thus the simple
collision operator adopted in the latter would appear to be an adequate
approximation for dilute rings, at least in the linear regime.

small galaxy separations but breaks down beyond a certain separation that
depends mainly on the ratio sigma/R and to some degree on the power-law index,
gamma, of spatial clustering xi; sigma is the one-sigma width of the galaxy

local symmetry are used to determine the cracks paths. The bifurcation is
predicted at a given critical speed and at a specific branching angle: both
correlated very well with experiments. The curvature of the subsequent branches
is also studied: the sign of $T$, with $T$ being the non singular stress at the
initial crack tip, separates branches paths that diverge from or converge to
the initial path, a feature that may be tested in future experiments. The model
rests on a scenario of crack branching with some reasonable assumptions based
on general considerations and in exact dynamic results for anti-plane
branching. It is argued that it is possible to use a static analysis of the
crack bifurcation for plane loading as a good approximation to the dynamical
case. The results are interesting since they explain within a continuum
mechanics approach the main features of the branching instabilities of fast

This system was previously found, by explicit solution of the equations of

quantization of the chain center-of-mass velocity (dynamic pinning) solely
determined by the interface incommensurability. Starting now from this
quantized sliding state, in the underdamped regime of motion and in analogy to
what ordinarily happens for static friction, the dynamics exhibits a large
hysteresis under the action of an additional external driving force F_ext. A
critical threshold value F_c of the adiabatically applied force F_ext is
required in order to alter the robust dynamics of the plateau attractor. When
the applied force is decreased and removed, the system can jump to intermediate
sliding regimes (a sort of ``dynamic'' stick-slip motion) and eventually
returns to the quantized sliding state at a much lower value of F_ext. On the
contrary no hysteretic behavior is observed as a function of the external
driving velocity.

quantum detector connected to the contact. We detail two generic detectors: a
quantum two-level system and a harmonic oscillator. In these systems, for an
arbitrary relation between the voltage driving the point contact and the energy
scales of the detectors, the results can be expressed in terms of an effective
detector temperature T_eff. The third cumulant can be found from the dependence
of T_eff on the sign of the driving voltage. We find that proper ordering of
the fluctuation operators is relevant in the analysis of the transition rates.
This is reflected in the effective Fano factor for the third cumulant measured
in such setups: it depends on the ratio of the voltage and an energy scale
describing the circuit where the fluctuations are produced.

been discovered in various magnetic models. Such phases, which break spin
symmetry but have no net local magnetization, have also been proposed by
Nersesyan et al. (J. Phys.: Cond. Matt. 3, 3353 (1991)) in the context of
electronic models. We introduce a N-flavor microscopic model that interpolates
from the large-N limit, where mean-field is valid and such a nematic phase
occurs, to the more realistic N=1 case. By using a sign-free quantum
Monte-Carlo, we show the existence of a spin nematic phase (analogous to a spin
flux phase) for finite N; when N decreases, quantum fluctuations increase and
this phase ultimately disappears in favor of an s-wave superconducting state.
We also show that this nematic phase extends up to a finite critical charge
doping. Dynamical studies allow us to clarify the Fermi surface property: in
the nematic phase at half-filling, it consists of 4 points and the low-energy
structure has a Dirac cone-like shape. Under doping, we observe clear
signatures of Fermi pockets around these points.
  This is one of the few examples where numerical simulations show how quantum
fluctuations can destroy a large-N phase.

occupancies and the spin densities in the oxygen $2p$ orbitals are obtained by
means of tight-binding analyses of electric field gradients and anisotropic
Knight shifts. These quantities are compared with two other layered perovskite
ruthenates: the two-dimensional paramagnet Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and the
three-dimensional ferromagnet SrRuO$_3$. The hole occupancies at the oxygen
sites are very large, about one hole per ruthenium atom. This is due to the
strong covalent character of the Ru-O bonding in this compound. The magnitude
of the hole occupancy might be related to the rotation or tilt of the RuO$_6$
octahedra. The spin densities at the oxygen sites are also large, 20-40% of the
bulk susceptibilities, but in contrast to the hole occupancies, the spin

otherwise behaving much like TitForTat. The second type consists of a set of

distinguished individual Godfather strategy that plays OmegaTitForTat against
non-members while heavily profiting from the behaviour of the other members of
his group, the Hitman. The Hitman willingly let themselves being abused by
their Godfather while themselves lowering the scores of all other players as
much as possible, thus further maximizing the performance of their Godfather in
relation to other participants. The study of collusion in the simplified

We further provide evidence that it will be unavoidable that such group
strategies will dominate all future iterated prisoner's dilemma competitions as
they can be stealthy camouflaged as non-group strategies with arbitrary
subtlety. Moreover, we show that the general problem of recognizing stealth
colluding strategies is undecidable in the theoretical sense.

channel using low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We devise bilayer LDPC
codes to approach the theoretically promised rate of the decode-and-forward
relaying strategy by incorporating relay-generated information bits in
specially designed bilayer graphical code structures. While conventional LDPC
codes are sensitively tuned to operate efficiently at a certain channel
parameter, the proposed bilayer LDPC codes are capable of working at two
different channel parameters and two different rates: that at the relay and at
the destination. To analyze the performance of bilayer LDPC codes, bilayer
density evolution is devised as an extension of the standard density evolution
algorithm. Based on bilayer density evolution, a design methodology is
developed for the bilayer codes in which the degree distribution is iteratively
improved using linear programming. Further, in order to approach the
theoretical decode-and-forward rate for a wide range of channel parameters,
this paper proposes two different forms bilayer codes, the bilayer-expurgated
and bilayer-lengthened codes. It is demonstrated that a properly designed
bilayer LDPC code can achieve an asymptotic infinite-length threshold within
0.24 dB gap to the Shannon limits of two different channels simultaneously for
a wide range of channel parameters. By practical code construction,
finite-length bilayer codes are shown to be able to approach within a 0.6 dB
gap to the theoretical decode-and-forward rate of the relay channel at a block
length of $10^5$ and a bit-error probability (BER) of $10^{-4}$. Finally, it is
demonstrated that a generalized version of the proposed bilayer code
construction is applicable to relay networks with multiple relays.

black hole which is based on Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind. It is
believed that these Intermediate Mass Ratio Inspiral events (IMRI) are expected
to be seen in both the ground and space based detectors. Starting with the
post-Newtonian expansion from Black Hole Perturbation Theory, we introduce a
new Chebyshev approximation to the flux function, which due to a process called
Chebyshev economization gives a model with faster convergence than either
post-Newtonian or Pad\'e based methods. As well as having excellent convergence
properties, these polynomials are also very closely related to the elusive
minimax polynomial. We find that at the last stable orbit, the error between
the Chebyshev approximation and a numerically calculated flux is reduced, $<
1.8%$, at all orders of approximation. We also find that the templates
constructed using the Chebyshev approximation give better fitting factors, in
general $> 0.99$, and smaller errors, $< 1/10%$, in the estimation of the Chirp
mass when compared to a fiducial exact waveform, constructed using the
numerical flux and the exact expression for the orbital energy function, again

previously developed model where the decay of the vacuum energy into matter (or
vice versa) is due to the renormalization group (RG) running of the
cosmological constant (CC) term. The evolution of the CC depends on the single
parameter \nu, which characterizes the running of the CC produced by the
quantum effects of matter fields of the unknown high energy theory below the
Planck scale. The sign of \nu indicates whether bosons or fermions dominate in
the running. The spectrum of perturbations is computed assuming an adiabatic
regime and an isotropic stress tensor. Moreover, the perturbations of the CC
term are generated from the simplest covariant form suggested by the RG model
under consideration. The corresponding numerical analysis shows that for \nu>0
there is a depletion of the matter power spectrum at low scales (large wave
numbers) as compared to the standard LCDM model, whereas for \nu<0 there is an
excess of power at low scales. We find that the LSS data rule out the range
|\nu|> 10^{-4} while the values |\nu|< 10^{-6} look perfectly acceptable. For
\nu<0 the excess of power at low scales grows rapidly and the bound is more
severe. From the particle physics viewpoint, the values |\nu|\sim 10^{-6}
correspond to the ``desert'' in the mass spectrum above the GUT scale M_X\sim
10^{16} GeV. Our results are consistent with those obtained in other dynamical
models admitting an interaction between dark matter and dark energy. We find
that the matter power spectrum analysis is a highly efficient method to
discover a possible scale dependence of the vacuum energy.

supersymmetry broken on the IR brane. The SM hypermultiplet fields (fermions
and Higgs) live in the UV brane and we allow the vector supermultiplets
corresponding to the gauge bosons and a hypermultiplet corresponding to the
right handed neutrino to live in the bulk. We assume that there are Majorana
mass terms for the right handed neutrino superfield fixed on each brane and
that there is a Yukawa term involving the right handed neutrino, the left
handed neutrino and the Higgs fixed on the UV brane. Supersymmetry is broken by
a constant ``superpotential'' on the IR brane, which induces an F-term for the
radion hypermultiplet. This F-term leads to a B-term for the right handed
sneutrinos as well as a soft SUSY breaking gaugino mass in the 4D theory for
the zero modes. The gaugino mass naturally induces an A-term for the right
handed sneutrino, left handed sneutrino and the Higgs to be formed through
gaugino mediation with a non-trivial CP violating phase. Moreover, we show that
within the context of extra dimensions, the condition of out-of-equilibrium
decay and the phenomenological constraints on the neutrino mass are both
satisfied in a natural way, for UV Majorana masses of the order of the

from the ultraviolet behaviour of the amplitude, and determine universal form
factors for these rational parts by applying reduction techniques to the
Feynman diagrammatic representation of the amplitude. The method is valid for
massless and massive internal particles. We illustrate this method by
evaluating the rational terms of the one-loop amplitudes for gg --> H, the
4-photon and 4-gluon amplitude, the amplitude for 2 photons plus 3 gluons and
the 6-photon amplitude.

consider the modification of Newtonian inverse square law due to Yukawa type

To appear in JPAA","JPAA 210 (2007), No. 2, 465-471",,,"math.AC math.AG",,"  The purpose of this note is to characterize the finite Hilbert functions
which force all of their artinian algebras to enjoy the Weak Lefschetz Property
(WLP). Curiously, they turn out to be exactly those (characterized by Wiebe in
$[Wi]$) whose Gotzmann ideals have the WLP.
  This implies that, if a Gotzmann ideal has the WLP, then all algebras with
the same Hilbert function (and hence lower Betti numbers) have the WLP as well.
However, we will answer in the negative, even in the case of level algebras,
the most natural question that one might ask after reading the previous
sentence: If $A$ is an artinian algebra enjoying the WLP, do all artinian
algebras with the same Hilbert function as $A$ and Betti numbers lower than
those of $A$ have the WLP as well?
  Also, as a consequence of our result, we have another (simpler) proof of the
fact that all codimension 2 algebras enjoy the WLP (this fact was first proven
in $[HMNW]$, where it was shown that even the Strong Lefschetz Property holds).

RLC circuits as a geometric Birkhoffian system and to discuss in this context
the concepts of regularity, conservativeness, dissipativeness. An RLC circuit,
with no assumptions placed on its topology, will be described by a family of
Birkhoffian systems, parameterized by a finite number of real constants which
correspond to initial values of certain state variables of the circuit. The
configuration space and a special Pfaffian form, called Birkhoffian, are
obtained from the constitutive relations of the resistors, inductors and
capacitors involved and from Kirchhoff's laws. Under certain assumptions on the
voltage-current characteristic for resistors, it is shown that a Birkhoffian
system associated to an RLC circuit is dissipative. For RLC networks which
contain a number of pure capacitor loops or pure resistor loops the Birkhoffian
associated is never regular. A procedure to reduce the original configuration
space to a lower dimensional one, thereby regularizing the Birkhoffian, it is
also presented. In order to illustrate the results, specific examples are
discussed in detail.

exponent alpha>0 of a distribution is proposed. It is based on the fact that
block-maxima of size m of the independent and identically distributed data
scale at a rate of m^{1/alpha}. This scaling rate can be captured well by the
max-spectrum plot of the data that leads to regression based estimators.
Consistency and asymptotic normality of these estimators is established under
mild conditions on the behavior of the tail of the distribution. The results
are obtained by establishing bounds on the rate of convergence of moment-type
functionals of heavy-tailed maxima. Such bounds often yield exact rates of
convergence and are of independent interest. Practical issues on the automatic
selection of tuning parameters for the estimators and corresponding confidence
intervals are also addressed. Extensive numerical simulations show that the
proposed method proves competitive for both small and large sample sizes and
for a large range of tail exponents. The method is shown to be more robust than
the classical Hill plot and is illustrated on two data sets of insurance claims
and natural gas field sizes.

D.{\DJ}okovi\'{c}). Interestingly the conjecture C2 (and also stronger C3) is
not yet proven even for arbitrary four points in a plane. So far we have
verified the conjectures C2 and C3 for parallelograms, cyclic quadrilaterals
and some infinite families of tetrahedra. We have also proposed a strengthening
of conjecture C3 for configurations of four points (Four Points Conjectures).
For almost collinear configurations (with all but one point on a line) we
propose several new conjectures (some for symmetric functions) which imply C2
and C3. By using computations with multi-Schur functions we can do
verifications up to $n=9$ of our conjectures. We can also verify stronger
conjecture of {\DJ}okovi\' c which imply C2 for his nonplanar configurations
with dihedral symmetry. Finally we mention that by minimizing a geometrically
defined energy, figuring in these conjectures, one gets a connection to some
complicated physical theories, such as Skyrmions and Fullerenes.

strongly on the fluid rheology which shifts from Newtonian to shear-thinning

power and coming out energy with the emitted light. As an open system, a laser
should be in open equilibrium with thermodynamic forces, related to both energy
flows. Conditions of equilibria are expressed by a logistic map with specially
developed dynamic inverse pitchfork bifurcation diagrams for graphical
presentation of the solutions. The graphs explicitly confirm the triggering
nature of a laser where bistability is manifested by pitchfork ground and laser
branches, with the relative population equilibrium values close to 1 and 0
correspondingly. Simulation was run for a 2-level laser emitting light from far
infrared to short wave UV. A newly discovered feature of such a laser is the
line spectrum of up and down transitions of the laser excitable dwellers,
occurring between the laser and the ground pitchfork branches beyond

branches approach their limits. Transitions of both types are overlapping in
opposite phases. This effect is a new confirmation of the Einstein's
prohibition on practical realization of a 2-level laser. Wide enough gaps

processes with unpredictable dynamics. In this paper, we discuss asymmetries in
short term price movements that can not be associated with a long term positive
trend. These empirical asymmetries predict that stock index drops are more
common on a relatively short time scale than the corresponding raises. We
present several empirical examples of such asymmetries. Furthermore, a simple
model featuring occasional short periods of synchronized dropping prices for
all stocks constituting the index is introduced with the aim of explaining
these facts. The collective negative price movements are imagined triggered by
external factors in our society, as well as internal to the economy, that
create fear of the future among investors. This is parameterized by a ``fear
factor'' defining the frequency of synchronized events. It is demonstrated that
such a simple fear factor model can reproduce several empirical facts
concerning index asymmetries. It is also pointed out that in its simplest form,
the model has certain shortcomings.

present. The memory model and a related computational network for solving
Sudoku puzzles produce answers that contain implicit check-bits in the
representation of information across neurons, allowing a rapid evaluation of
whether the putative answer is correct or incorrect through a computation
related to visual 'pop-out'. This fact may account for our strong psychological
feeling of right or wrong when we retrieve a nominal memory from a minimal
clue. This information allows more difficult computations or memory retrievals
to be done in a serial fashion by using the fast but limited capabilities of a
computational module multiple times. The mathematics of the

walks is placed in the context of the emerging field of quantum computing.
Constructing a suitable quantum version of a random walk is not trivial: pure
quantum dynamics is deterministic, so randomness only enters during the
measurement phase, i.e., when converting the quantum information into classical
information. The outcome of a quantum random walk is very different from the
corresponding classical random walk, due to interference between the different
possible paths. The upshot is that quantum walkers find themselves further from
their starting point on average than a classical walker, and this forms the
basis of a quantum speed up that can be exploited to solve problems faster.
Surprisingly, the effect of making the walk slightly less than perfectly
quantum can optimize the properties of the quantum walk for algorithmic
applications. Looking to the future, with even a small quantum computer
available, development of quantum walk algorithms might proceed more rapidly
than it has, especially for solving real problems.

illustrated by means of a set of experimental schemes based on Mach-Zehnder
interferometry. In particu- lar, path detection via entanglement with a probe
system and (quantitative) quan- tum erasure are exhibited to constitute
instances of joint unsharp measurements of complementary pairs of physical
quantities, path and interference observables. The analysis uses the
representation of observables as positive-operator-valued measures (POVMs). The
reconciliation of complementary experimental options in the sense of
simultaneous unsharp preparations and measurements is expressed in terms of
uncertainty relations of different kinds. The feature of complementarity,
manifest in the present examples in the mutual exclusivity of path detection
and interference observation, is recovered as a limit case from the appropriate
uncertainty relation. It is noted that the complementarity and uncertainty
principles are neither completely logically independent nor logical
consequences of one another. Since entanglement is an instance of the
uncertainty of quantum properties (of compound systems), it is moot to play out
uncertainty and entanglement against each other as possible mechanisms
enforcing complementarity.
