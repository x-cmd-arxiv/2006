northeast of M31's center. Using these maps, we find that there is a fainter
shelf of comparable size on the western side as well. By choosing appropriate
structural and orbital parameters for an accreting dwarf satellite within the
accurate M31 potential model of Geehan et al. (2006), we produce a very similar
structure in an N-body simulation. In this scenario, the tidal stream produced
at pericenter of the satellite's orbit matches the observed southern stream,
while the forward continuation of this tidal stream makes up two orbital loops,
broadened into fan-like structures by successive pericentric passages; these
loops correspond to the NE and W shelves. The tidal debris from the satellite
also reproduces a previously-observed ""stream"" of counterrotating PNe and a
related stream seen in red giant stars. The debris pattern in our simulation
resembles the shell systems detected around many elliptical galaxies, though
this is the first identification of a shell system in a spiral galaxy and the
first in any galaxy close enough to allow measurements of stellar velocities
and relative distances. We discuss the physics of these partial shells,
highlighting the role played by spatial and velocity caustics in the
observations. We show that kinematic surveys of the tidal debris will provide a
sensitive measurement of M31's halo potential, while quantifying the surface
density of debris in the shelves will let us reconstruct the original mass and
time of disruption of the progenitor satellite.

relative to the disk, especially Mg, indicating that the bulge is enhanced in
Type~II supernova ejecta and most likely formed more rapidly than the disk. We
attribute a rapid decline of [O/Fe] to metallicity-dependent yields of oxygen
in massive stars, perhaps connected to the Wolf-Reyet phenomenon. he explosive
nucleosynthesis alphas, Si, Ca and Ti, possess identical trends with [Fe/H],
consistent with their putative common origin. We note that different behaviors
of hydrostatic and explosive alpha elements can be seen in the stellar
abundances of stars in Local Group dwarf galaxies. We also attribute the
decline of Si,Ca and Ti relative to Mg, to metallicity- dependent yields for
the explosive alpha elements from Type~II supernovae. The starkly smaller
scatter of [<SiCaTi>/Fe] with [Fe/H] in the bulge, as compared to the halo, is
consistent with expected efficient mixing for the bulge. The metal-poor bulge
[<SiCaTi>/Fe] ratios are higher than ~80% of the halo. If the bulge formed from
halo gas, the event occured before ~80% of the present-day halo was formed. The
lack of overlap between the thick and thin disk composition with the bulge does
not support the idea that the bulge was built by a thickening of the disk
driven by the bar. The trend of [Al/Fe] is very sensitive to the chemical
evolution environment. A comparison of the bulge, disk and Sgr dSph galaxy
shows a range of ~0.7 dex in [Al/Fe] at a given [Fe/H], presumably due to a

to be sensitive to the manner in which the burning is ignited. Studies of the
pre-supernova evolution suggest asymmetric, off-center ignition, and here we
explore its consequences in two- and three-dimensional simulations. Compared
with centrally ignited models, one-sided ignitions initially burn less and
release less energy. For the distributions of ignition points studied, ignition
within two hemispheres typically leads to the unbinding of the white dwarf,
while ignition within a small fraction of one hemisphere does not. We also
examine the spreading of the blast over the surface of the white dwarf that
occurs as the first plumes of burning erupt from the star. In particular, our
studies test whether the collision of strong compressional waves can trigger a
detonation on the far side of the star as has been suggested by Plewa et al.
(2004). The maximum temperature reached in these collisions is sensitive to how
much burning and expansion has already gone on, and to the dimensionality of
the calculation. Though detonations are sometimes observed in 2D models, none
ever happens in the corresponding 3D calculations. Collisions between the
expansion fronts of multiple bubbles also seem, in the usual case, unable to
ignite a detonation. ""Gravitationally confined detonation"" is therefore not a
robust mechanism for the explosion. Detonation may still be possible in these
models however, either following a pulsation or by spontaneous detonation if
the turbulent energy is high enough.

targets, the photon statistics are good enough to allow for basic X-ray
spectral analyses, which indicate the presence of intrinsic absorption
(~10^{22-23} cm^-2) and luminous X-ray emission (L_X>10^44 erg/s). Of the
remaining four targets, two are detected with only a few (3-6) X-ray counts,

kinematic properties without morphological pre-selection. Emission linewidths
provide kinematics for the bulk of blue galaxies. To fit the spatially resolved
kinematics, we fit models with both line-of-sight rotation amplitude and
velocity dispersion. Integrated linewidth correlates well with a combination of
the rotation gradient and dispersion, and is a robust measure of galaxy
kinematics. The spatial extents of emission and continuum are similar and there
is no evidence that linewidths are affected by nuclear or clumpy emission. The
measured rotation gradient depends strongly on slit PA alignment with galaxy
major axis, but integrated linewidth does not. Even for galaxies with
well-aligned slits, some have kinematics dominated by dispersion (V/sigma<1)
rather than rotation. These are probably objects with disordered velocity
fields, not dynamically hot stellar systems. About 35% of the resolved sample
are dispersion dominated; galaxies that are both dispersion dominated and
bright exist at high redshift but appear rare at low redshift. This kinematic
morphology is linked to photometric morphology in HST/ACS images: dispersion
dominated galaxies include a higher fraction of irregulars and chain galaxies,

1.0-1.5 mag internal to our sample without requiring calibration to a local TF
relation. There is evolution in both Tully-Fisher intercept and slope,
suggesting differential luminosity evolution. In J-band, there is evolution in
slope but little evolution in overall luminosity. The slope measurements imply
that bright, massive blue galaxies fade {\it more strongly} than fainter blue
galaxies from z ~ 1.2 to now. This conclusion runs counter to some previous
measurements and to our naive expectations, but we present a simple set of star
formation histories to show that it arises naturally if massive galaxies have
shorter timescales of star formation, forming most of their stars before z ~ 1,
while less massive galaxies form stars at more slowly declining rates. This
model predicts that the higher global star formation rate at z ~ 1 is mostly
due to higher SFR in massive galaxies. The amount of fading in B-band
constrains star formation timescale more strongly than redshift of formation.
Tully-Fisher and color-magnitude relations can provide global constraints on

from black-hole intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (BHIMXBs). In their model the
secondaries in BHIMXBs are assumed to possess anomalously high magnetic fields,
so that magnetic braking can lead to substantial loss of angular momentum. In
this paper we propose an alternative mechanism for orbital angular momentum
loss in BHIMXBs. We assume that a small fraction $\delta$ of the transferred
mass from the donor star form a circumbinary disc surrounding the binary
system. The tidal torques exerted by the disc can effectively drain orbital
angular momentum from the binary. We have numerically calculated the
evolutionary sequences of BHIMXBs, to examine the influence of the circumbinary
disc on the binary evolution. Our results indicate when $\delta\la 0.01-0.1$
(depending on the initial orbital periods), the circumbinary disc can cause
secular orbital shrinking, leading to the formation of compact
  BHLMXBs, otherwise the orbits always expand during the evolution. This
scenario also suggests the possible existence of luminous, persistent BHLMXBs,
but it suffers the same problem as in Justham, Rappaport & Podsiadlowski (2006)
that, the predicted effective temperatures of the donor stars are significantly
higher than those of the observed donor stars in BHLMXBs.

surrounding numerous dark subhalos as expected for a galaxy-sized halo in the

accretion events of subhalos into a disk are allowed in light of the observed
thinness of a disk. Several models of subhalos are considered in terms of their
internal density distribution, mass function, and spatial and velocity
distributions. Based on a series of N-body simulations, we find that the disk
thickening quantified by the change of its scale height, Delta z_d, depends
strongly on the individual mass of an interacting subhalo M_{sub}. This is
described by the relation, Delta z_d / R_d = 8 Sum_{j=1}^N (M_{sub,j}/M_d)**2,
where R_d is a disk scale length, M_d is a disk mass, and N is the total number
of accretion events of subhalos inside a disk region (< 3R_d). Using this
relation, we find that an observed thin disk has not ever interacted with
subhalos with the total mass of more than 15% disk mass. Also, a less massive
disk with smaller circular velocity V_c is more affected by subhalos than a
disk with larger V_c, in agreement with the observation. Further implications
of our results for the origin of a thick disk component are also discussed.

light on the behaviour of anomalous Cepheids whose representatives have been

observations have been obtained. The actual period and amplitude of pulsation
were determined by Fourier analysis. The long time scale behaviour of the
pulsation period was studied by the method of the O-C diagram using the
archival Harvard photographic plates and published photometric data. XZ Ceti
differs from the ordinary classical Cepheids in several respects. Its most
peculiar feature is cycle-to-cycle variability of the light curve. The radial
velocity phase curve is not stable either. The pulsation period is subjected to
strong changes on various time scales including a very short one. The ratio of
amplitudes determined from the photometric and radial velocity observations
indicates that this Cepheid performs an overtone pulsation, in accord with the
other known anomalous Cepheid in our Galaxy, BL Boo (V19 in the globular

observations of X-rays from such flows, came very much as a surprise. Inferred
shock velocities are considerably higher than what was previously known, hence
putting even larger energy demands on the driving sources of the jets. The
statistics of X-ray emitting jets are still poor, yet a few cases exist which
seem to imply a correlation between the presence of HeI 1.0830 mu emission and
X-ray radiation in a given source. Aims. This tentative correlation needs
confirmation and explanation. If the jet regions of HeI 1.0830 mu emission are
closely associated with those producing X-rays, high resolution infared
spectroscopy can be used to observationally study the velocity fields in the
hot plasma regions of the jets. This would provide the necessary evidence to
test and further develop theoretical models of intermediately fast (> 500 -
1500 km/s) interstellar shock waves. Methods. The HH 154 jet flow from the
embedded protostellar binary L 1551 IRS 5 provides a case study, since adequate
IR and X-ray spectroscopic data are in existence. The thermal X-ray spectrum is
fed into a photoionization code to compute, in particular, the line emission of
HeI and HI and to account for the observed unusual line intensity ratios.
Results. The advanced model is capable of accounting for most observables, but
shows also major weaknesses. It seems not unlikely that these could, in
principle, be overcome by a time dependent hydrodynamical calculation with
self-consistent cooling. However, such sophisticated model development is
decisively beyond the scope of the present work. Conclusions. Continued X-ray
observations, coordinated with simultaneous high resolution infrared
spectroscopy, are highly desirable.

on classical hydrostatic model atmospheres for cool stars using extensive line
lists. The results obtained are discussed in the framework of hot bottom
burning (HBB) and nucleosynthesis models. The complete sample is studied
attending to various observational properties such as the position of the stars
in the IRAS two-colour diagram ([12]-[25] vs [25]-[60]), Galactic distribution,
expansion velocity (derived from the OH maser emission) and period of
variability (when available). We conclude that a considerable fraction of the
sources observed are actually massive AGB stars (M > 3-4 solar masses)
experiencing HBB, as deduced from the strong Li overabundances found. A
comparison of our results with similar studies carried out in the past for the
Magellanic Clouds (MCs) reveals that, in contrast to MC AGB stars, our Galactic
sample does not show any indication of s-process element enrichment. The
differences observed are explained as a consequence of metallicity effects.
Finally, we discuss the results obtained in the framework of stellar evolution

the first results of the XI (XMM/IMACS) Groups Project, a study targeting, for
the first time, a redshift-selected, statistically unbiased sample of galaxy
groups using deep X-ray data. Combining this with radio observations of cold
gas and optical imaging and spectroscopy of the galaxy population, the project
aims to advance the understanding of how the properties and dynamics of group
galaxies relate to global group properties. Here, X-ray and optical data of the
first four galaxy groups observed as part of the project are presented. In two
of the groups we detect diffuse emission with a luminosity of L_X ~ 10^41
erg/s, among the lowest found for any X-ray detected group thus far, with a
comparable upper limit for the other two. Compared to typical X-ray selected
groups of similar velocity dispersion, these four systems are all surprisingly
X-ray faint. We discuss possible explanations for the lack of significant X-ray
emission in the groups, concluding that these systems are most likely
collapsing for the first time. Our results strongly suggest that, unlike our
current optically selected sample, previous X-ray selected group samples
represented a biased picture of the group population. This underlines the
necessity of a study of this kind, if one is to reach an unbiased census of the
properties of galaxy groups and the distribution of baryons in the Universe.

galaxies with L_B < 3 x 10e10 Lo. Thermal emission from hot gas with
temperatures between 0.2 and 0.8 keV comprises 5-70% of the total 0.5-2.0 keV
emission from these galaxies. We find that the total X-ray luminosity from
LMXBs (resolved plus the power-law component of the unresolved emission) scales
roughly linearly with the K-band luminosity of the galaxies with a
normalization comparable to that found in more luminous early-type galaxies.
All of the galaxies in our sample are gas poor with gas masses much less than
that expected from the accumulation of stellar mass loss over the life time of
the galaxies. The average ratio of gas mass to stellar mass in our sample is
M_{gas}/M_*=0.001, compared to more luminous early-type galaxies which
typically have M_{gas}/M_*=0.01. The time required to accumulate the observed
gas mass from stellar mass loss in these galaxies is typically 3 x 10e8 yr.
Since the cooling time of the gas is longer than the replenishment time, the
gas cannot be condensing out of the hot phase and forming stars, implying that
the gas is most likely being expelled from these galaxies in a wind (abridged).

Quantum Chemistry, Statistical Mechanics, Quantum Information Theory, Nuclear

aspects of the method and present some of the most relevant applications so as
to give an overview on the scope and possibilities of DMRG. We focus on the
most important extensions of the method such as the calculation of dynamical
properties, the application to classical systems, finite temperature
simulations, phonons and disorder, field theory, time-dependent properties and
the ab initio calculation of electronic states in molecules. The recent quantum
information interpretation, the development of highly accurate time-dependent
algorithms and the possibility of using the DMRG as the impurity-solver of the
Dynamical Mean Field Method (DMFT) give new insights into its present and
potential uses. We review the numerous very recent applications of these

of evaporating a sand bulk, and a gaseous transition starts at the surface
granular matter (GM) bed. Moreover the mixture of the grains in the whole bed
starts to move in a cooperative way which is far away from a Brownian
description. In a previous work we have shown that the key element to describe
the statistics of this behavior is the exclusion of volume principle, whereby
the system obeys a Fermi configurational approach. Even though the experiment
involves an archetypal non-equilibrium system, we succeeded in defining a
global temperature, as the quantity associated to the Lagrange parameter in a
maximum entropic statistical description. In fact in order to close our
approach we had to generalize the equipartition theorem for dissipative
systems. Therefore we postulated, found and measured a fundamental dissipative
parameter, written in terms of pumping and gravitational energies, linking the
configurational entropy to the collective response for the expansion of the
centre of mass (c.m.) of the granular bed. Here we present a kinetic approach
to describe the experimental velocity distribution function (VDF) of this
non-Maxwellian gas of macroscopic Fermi-like particles (mFp). The evaporation
transition occurs mainly by jumping balls governed by the excluded volume
principle. Surprisingly in the whole range of low temperatures that we measured
this description reveals a lattice-gas, leading to a packing factor, which is
independent of the external parameters. In addition we measure the mean free

  Engineering at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India",,,,"cs.NI cs.IT math.IT",,"  Information-theoretic arguments focus on modeling the reliability of
information transmission, assuming availability of infinite data at sources,
thus ignoring randomness in message generation times at the respective sources.
However, in information transport networks, not only is reliable transmission
important, but also stability, i.e., finiteness of mean delay incurred by
messages from the time of generation to the time of successful reception.
Usually, delay analysis is done separately using queueing-theoretic arguments,
whereas reliable information transmission is studied using information theory.
In this thesis, we investigate these two important aspects of data
communication jointly by suitably combining models from these two fields. In
particular, we model scheduled communication of messages, that arrive in a
random process, (i) over multiaccess channels, with either independent decoding
or joint decoding, and (ii) over degraded broadcast channels. The scheduling
policies proposed permit up to a certain maximum number of messages for
simultaneous transmission.
  In the first part of the thesis, we develop a multi-class discrete-time
processor-sharing queueing model, and then investigate the stability of this
queue. In particular, we model the queue by a discrete-time Markov chain
defined on a countable state space, and then establish (i) a sufficient
condition for $c$-regularity of the chain, and hence positive recurrence and
finiteness of stationary mean of the function $c$ of the state, and (ii) a
sufficient condition for transience of the chain. These stability results form
the basis for the conclusions drawn in the thesis.

classes such as P, SUBEXP, and PSPACE and on probabilistic classes such as BPP,
which differ on how the corresponding finite extension strategies are computed.
We give an alternative characterization of small sets via resource-bounded
Banach-Mazur games.
  As an application of the first notion, we show that for almost every language
A (i.e. all except a meager class) computable in subexponential time,
P(A)=BPP(A). We also show that almost all languages in PSPACE do not have small
nonuniform complexity.
  We then switch to the second Baire category notion (called
locally-computable), and show that the class SPARSE is meager in P. We show
that in contrast to the resource-bounded measure case, meager-comeager laws can
be obtained for many standard complexity classes, relative to
locally-computable Baire category on BPP and PSPACE.
  Another topic where locally-computable Baire categories differ from
resource-bounded measure is regarding weak-completeness: we show that there is
no weak-completeness notion in P based on locally-computable Baire categories,
i.e. every P-weakly-complete set is complete for P. We also prove that the
class of complete sets for P under Turing-logspace reductions is meager in P,
if P is not equal to DSPACE(log n), and that the same holds unconditionally for
quasi-poly time.
  Finally we observe that locally-computable Baire categories are incomparable
with all existing resource-bounded measure notions on small complexity classes,

understand the interaction between a large number of users with delayed

to be important to tackle concrete scenarios when implementing the model
proposed in [Baccelli McDonald Reynier 02] firstly the modeling of the maximum
TCP window size: this maximum can be reached quickly in many practical cases;
secondly the delay structure: the usual Little-like formula behaves really
poorly when queuing delays are variable, and may change dramatically the
evolution of the predicted queue size, which makes it useless to study
drop-tail or RED (Random Early Detection) mechanisms. Within proposed TCP
modeling improvements, we are enabled to look at a concrete example where RED
should be used in FIFO routers instead of letting the default drop-tail happen.
We study mathematically fixed points of the window size distribution and local
stability of RED. An interesting case is when RED operates at the limit when
the congestion starts, it avoids unwanted loss of bandwidth and delay
variations.

approach, gravity breaks this symmetry and the gravitational field equations
are not invariant under such a shift of the energy momentum tensor. I argue
that until this symmetry is restored, one cannot obtain a satisfactory solution
to the cosmological constant problem. I describe an alternative perspective to
gravity in which the gravitational field equations are [G_{ab} -\kappa T_{ab}]
n^an^b =0 for all null vectors n^a. This is obviously invariant under the
change T^a_b --> T^a_b +\rho \delta^a_b and restores the symmetry under
shifting the matter lagrangian by a constant. These equations are equivalent to
G_{ab} = \kappa T_{ab} + Cg_{ab} where C is now an integration constant so that
the role of the cosmological constant is very different in this approach. The
cosmological constant now arises as an integration constant, somewhat like the
mass M in the Schwarzschild metric, the value of which can be chosen depending
on the physical context. These equations can be obtained from a variational
principle which uses the null surfaces of spacetime as local Rindler horizons
and can be given a thermodynamic interpretation. This approach turns out to be
quite general and can encompass even the higher order corrections to Einstein's
gravity and suggests a principle to determine the form of these corrections in
a systematic manner.

from a worldsheet point of view. Whenever a D-brane cannot be adjusted to an

brane. The bulk perturbation then induces a renormalisation group flow on the

We derive the relevant RG equations in general and illustrate the phenomenon
with a number of examples, in particular the radius deformation of a free boson
on a circle. At the self-dual radius we can give closed formulae for the

have also demonstrated some of its applications when the data under study is an
unsupervised one and when several experts analyze the problem. Further, the
authors have introduced in this book multiexpert models using these three new
types of interval matrices. The new multi expert models dealt in this book are
FCIMs, FRIMs, FCInMs, FRInMs, IBAMs, IBBAMs, nIBAMs, FAIMs, FAnIMS, etc.
Illustrative examples are given so that the reader can follow these concepts
easily. This book has three chapters. The first chapter is introductory in
nature and makes the book a self-contained one. Chapter two introduces the
concept of fuzzy interval matrices. Also the notion of fuzzy interval matrices,
neutrosophic interval matrices and fuzzy neutrosophic interval matrices, can
find applications to Markov chains and Leontief economic models. Chapter three
gives the application of fuzzy interval matrices and neutrosophic interval
matrices to real-world problems by constructing the models already mentioned.
Further these models are mainly useful when the data is an unsupervised one and
when one needs a multi-expert model. The new concept of fuzzy interval matrices
and neutrosophic interval matrices will find their applications in engineering,
medical, industrial, social and psychological problems. We have given a long

example, a fixed point of a continuous, piecewise $\mathcal{C}^{1}$ map crosses
a boundary in state space. Although classical bifurcations have been much
studied, border-collision bifurcations are not well understood. This paper
considers a particular class of border-collision bifurcations, i.e.,
border-collision period-doubling bifurcations. We apply a subharmonic
perturbation to the bifurcation parameter, which is also known as alternate
pacing, and we investigate the response under such pacing near the original
bifurcation point. The resulting behavior is characterized quantitatively by a
gain, which is the ratio of the response amplitude to the applied perturbation
amplitude. The gain in a border-collision period-doubling bifurcation has a
qualitatively different dependence on parameters from that of a classical
period-doubling bifurcation. Perhaps surprisingly, the differences are more
readily apparent if the gain is plotted vs. the perturbation amplitude (with
the bifurcation parameter fixed) than if plotted vs. the bifurcation parameter
(with the perturbation amplitude fixed). When this observation is exploited,
the gain under alternate pacing provides a useful experimental tool to identify
a border-collision period-doubling bifurcation.

facilitating sharper and more extensive tests of existing theories and by
offering observational underpinnings for the development of new theories. Just
as experimental economics pushed the frontiers of economic thought by enabling
the testing of numerous theories of economic behavior in the environment of a
controlled laboratory, we believe that observing, often over extended periods
of time, real-world agents participating in market and nonmarket activity on
the Internet can lead us to develop and test a variety of new theories.
Internet data gathering is not controlled experimentation. We cannot randomly
assign participants to treatments or determine event orderings. Internet data
gathering does offer potentially large data sets with repeated observation of
individual choices and action. In addition, the automated data collection holds
promise for greatly reduced cost per observation. Our methods rely on
technological advances in automated data collection agents. Significant
challenges remain in developing appropriate sampling techniques integrating
data from heterogeneous sources in a variety of formats, constructing
generalizable processes and understanding legal constraints. Despite these
challenges, the early evidence from those who have harvested and analyzed large

understand the functioning of electronic commerce.

is its homotopy invariance. We use the notion of homological category weight to
study various generalizations of the Lusternik - Schnirelmann category which
appeared in the theory of closed one-forms and have applications in dynamics.
Our primary goal is to compare two such invariants $\cat(X,\xi)$ and
$\cat^1(X,\xi)$ which are defined similarly with reversion of the order of
quantifiers. We compute these invariants explicitly for products of surfaces

strong mass density contrast. Here we show that the transparency of the
interface increases dramatically at low frequencies. Rather counterintuitively,
almost all acoustic energy emitted by a sufficiently shallow monopole source
under water is predicted to be radiated into atmosphere. Physically, increased
transparency at lower frequencies is due to the increasing role of
inhomogeneous waves and a destructive interference of direct and
surface-reflected waves under water. The phenomenon of anomalous transparency
has significant implications for acoustic communication across the water-air
interface, generation of ambient noise, and detection of underwater explosions.

microdomain has many applications in cellular biology, because the number of
bounds is a quantitative signal, which can initiate a cascade of chemical
reactions and thus has physiological consequences. In the present article, we
propose to estimate the mean time spent by a Brownian molecule inside a
microdomain $\Omega$ which contains small holes on the boundary and agonist
molecules located inside. We found that the mean time depends on several
parameters such as the backward binding rate (with the agonist molecules), the
mean escape time from the microdomain and the mean time a molecule reaches the
binding sites (forward binding rate). In addition, we estimate the mean and the
variance of the number of bounds made by a molecule before it exits $\Omega$.
These estimates rely on a boundary layer analysis of a conditional mean first
passage time, solution of a singular partial differential equation. In
particular, we apply the present results to obtain an estimate of the mean time
spent (Dwell time) by a Brownian receptor inside a synaptic domain, when it
moves freely by lateral diffusion on the surface of a neuron and interacts
locally with scaffolding molecules.
