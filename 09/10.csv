examine the effects of viewing angle on the subsequent gamma ray bursts. We
carry out a series of high-resolution simulations of a jet propagating through
a stellar envelope in 2D cylindrical coordinates using the FLASH relativistic
hydrodynamics module. For the first time, simulations are carried out using an
adaptive mesh that allows for a large dynamic range inside the star while still
being efficient enough to follow the evolution of the jet long after it breaks
out from the star. Our simulations allow us to single out three phases in the
jet evolution: a precursor phase in which relativistic material turbulently
shed from the head of the jet first emerges from the star, a shocked jet phase
where a fully shocked jet of material is emerging, and an unshocked jet phase
where the jet consists of a free-streaming, unshocked core surrounded by a thin
boundary layer of shocked jet material. The appearance of these phases will be
different to observers at different angles. The precursor has a wide opening
angle and would be visible far off axis. The shocked phase has a relatively
narrow opening angle that is constant in time. During the unshocked jet phase
the opening angle increases logarithmically with time. As a consequence, some
observers see prolonged dead times of emission even for constant properties of
the jet injected in the stellar core. We also present an analytic model that is
able to reproduce the overall properties of the jet and its evolution. We
finally discuss the observational implications of our results, emphasizing the
possible ways to test progenitor models through the effects of jet propagation
in the star. In an appendix, we present 1D and 2D tests of the FLASH
relativistic hydrodynamics module.

population of giant planets orbiting their host stars even closer than the hot
Jupiters (HJ), with orbital periods below 3 days. The reason why radial
velocity surveys were not able to detect these very-hot Jupiters (VHJ) is under
discussion. A possible explanation is that these close-in planets are
short-lived, being evaporated on short time-scales due to UV flux of their host
stars. In this case, stars hosting transiting VHJ planets would be
systematically younger than those in the radial velocity sample. We have used
the UVES spectrograph (VLT-UT2 telescope) to obtain high resolution spectra of
5 faint stars hosting transiting planets, namely, OGLE-TR-10, 56, 111, 113 and
TrES-1. Previously obtained CORALIE spectra of HD189733, and published data on
the other transiting planet-hosts were also used. The immediate objective is to
estimate ages via Li abundances, using the Ca II activity-age relation, and
from the analysis of the stellar rotational velocity. For the stars for which
we have spectra, Li abundances were computed as in Israelian et al. (2004)
using the stellar parameters derived in Santos et al. (2006). The chromospheric
activity index $S_{US}$ was built as the ratio of the flux within the core of
the Ca II H & K lines and the flux in two nearby continuum regions. The index
$S_{US}$ was calibrated to Mount Wilson index $S_{MW}$ allowing the computation
of the Ca II H & K corrected for the photospheric contribution. These values
were then used to derive the ages by means of the Henry et al. (1996)
activity-age relation. Bearing in mind the limitations of the ages derived by
Li abundances, chromospheric activity, and stellar rotational velocities, none
of the stars studied in this paper seem to be younger than 0.5 Gyr.

the view that FLRW plus the strong energy condition (SEC) is what better fits
the GRB data. But this is not the whole story, since for a cosmological
constant $\Lambda \neq 0$ the FLRW+SEC analysis with undefined $p=p(\rho)$
suggests that $\Lambda$ is not constant anyhow, because it does not follows the
$p= \omega \rho$ HD, with $\omega=-1$. Thenceforth, one concludes that either
the cosmological constant does not exist at all, and consequently one is left
with the FLRW+SEC which fits properly the GRBs HD and there is no late-time
acceleration, or it does exist but should be time-varying. This all is contrary
to current views based on SNIa observations that advogate for an actual
constant $\Lambda$ and an accelerating universe. In connection to the results
above, this last argumentation would imply that either there is something wrong
with the SNIa interpretation regarding cosmic late-time acceleration

data for stars with kinematics typical of the Hercules stream and one for a
small number of dwarf stars high above the galactic plane. These indicate that
the thick disk is a homogeneous structure and that the Hercules stream perhaps
is part of the metal-rich thick disk. Furthermore, new abundance determinations
for Mn for stars with kinematics typical of the thin and the thick disk are
presented. From these results the suggestion is that the observed trends for Mn
in the Milky Way disks can be explained by metallicity dependent SN II yields.
The impacts of surveys on the studies of the elemental abundance trends in the
Galaxy are discussed. It is argued that when it comes to furthering our
understanding of the abundance structure in the Galactic disk future and
ongoing surveys' major impact will be in the form of catalogues to select
targets from for high resolution spectroscopic follow-up. For a correct

negative at zero temperature. This feature is present both for large ($c \gg

Fabry-P\'erot resonances or band curvature. In the opposite regime $c \lesssim
c_q$, a non trivial voltage dependence of the noise arises even for energy
independent transmission coefficients: at zero frequency the noise decreases
with voltage as a power law when $c < c_q/3$, while, at finite frequency,
regions of negative excess noise are present due to Andreev-type resonances.

channel between the sensor and the controller is considered. The sensor has
limited memory. At each time, the sensor transmits encoded symbol over the
channel and updates its memory. The controller receives a noisy version of the
transmitted symbol, and generates a control action based on all its past
observations and actions. This control action action is fed back into the
system. At each stage the system incurs an instantaneous cost depending on the
state of the plant and the control action. The objective is to choose encoding,
memory updating and control strategies to minimize the expected total costs
over a finite horizon, or the expected discounted cost over an infinite
horizon, or the expected average cost per unit time over an infinite horizon.
For each case we obtain a sequential decomposition of the optimization problem.
The results are extended to the case when the sensor makes an imperfect
observation of the state of the system.

morphology of the Grab nebula and the surface roughness generated as a solution

investigating the qualitative side of entanglement in any bipartite state
vector. Remote measurement (or, equivalently, remote orthogonal state
decomposition) from previous work is generalized to remote linearly-independent
complete state decomposition both in the non-selective and the selective
versions. The results are displayed in terms of commutative square diagrams,
which show the power and beauty of the physical meaning of the (antiunitary)
correlation operator inherent in the given bipartite state vector. This
operator, together with the subsystem states (reduced density operators),
constitutes the so-called correlated subsystem picture. It is the central part
of the antilinear representation of a bipartite state vector, and it is a kind
of core of its entanglement structure. The generalization of previously
elaborated disentanglement expounded in this article is a synthesis of the
antilinear representation of bipartite state vectors, which is reviewed, and
the relevant results of Cassinelli et al. [J. Math. Analys. and Appl., 210, 472

bases (finite or infinite) are shown to be almost as useful in some quantum
