afterglow of GRB050730, obtained with UVES@VLT about hours after the GRB
trigger. The spectrum shows that the ISM of the GRB host galaxy at z = 3.967 is
complex, with at least five components contributing to the main absorption
system. We detect strong CII*, SiII*, OI* and FeII* fine structure absorption
lines associated to the second and third component. For the first three
components we derive information on the relative distance from the site of the
GRB explosion. Component 1, which has the highest redshift, does not present
any fine structure nor low ionization lines; it only shows very high ionization
features, such as CIV and OVI, suggesting that this component is very close to
the GRB site. From the analysis of low and high ionization lines and fine
structure lines, we find evidences that the distance of component 2 from the
site of the GRB explosion is 10-100 times smaller than that of component 3. We
evaluated the mean metallicity of the z=3.967 system obtaining values about
0.01 of the solar metallicity or less. However, this should not be taken as
representative of the circumburst medium, since the main contribution to the
hydrogen column density comes from the outer regions of the galaxy while that
of the other elements presumably comes from the ISM closer to the GRB site.
Furthermore, difficulties in evaluating dust depletion correction can modify
significantly these values. The mean [C/Fe] ratio agrees well with that
expected by single star-formation event models. Interestingly the [C/Fe] of
component 2 is smaller than that of component 3, in agreement with GRB dust
destruction scenarios, if component 2 is closer than component 3 to the GRB
site.

are generated in the intra-cluster medium. In analogy to processes in supernova
remnants, these shock waves may generate a significant population of
relativistic electrons which, in turn, produce observable synchrotron emission.
The extended radio relics found at the periphery of several clusters and
possibly also a fraction of radio halo emission may have this origin. Here we
derive an analytic expression for (i) the total radio power in the downstream
region of a cosmological shock wave and (ii) the width of the radio-emitting
region. These expressions predict a spectral slope close to -1 for strong
shocks. Moderate shocks, such as those produced in mergers between clusters of
galaxies, lead to a somewhat steeper spectrum. Moreover, we predict an upper
limit for the radio power of cosmological shocks. Comparing our results to the
radio relics in Abell115, 2256, and 3667, we conclude that the magnetic field
in these relics is typically at a level of 0.1 mu G. Magnetic fields in the
intra-cluster medium are presumably generated by the shocks themselves, this
allows us to calculate the radio emission as a function of the cluster
temperature. The resulting emissions agree very well with the radio
power-temperature relation found for cluster halos. Finally, we show that
cosmic accretion shocks generate less radio emission than merger shock waves.
The latter may, however, be detected with upcoming radio telescopes.

clearly detected with an intensity of 3.5 ph cm^{-2} s^{-1} sr^{-1}$ (or line

could be hot gas in the Local Hot Bubble (LHB), charge exchange between oxygen
ions in the solar wind (SWCX) and geocoronal or interplanetary material, or a
combination of the two. If entirely from the LHB, the implied temperature and
emission measure would predict 1/4 keV emission in excess of observations.
There is no evidence in the X-ray light curve or solar wind data for a
significant contribution from geocoronal SWCX. In any case, the observed O VII
flux represents an upper limit to both the LHB emission and interplanetary SWCX

Assuming the LHB and SWCX components did not change, these increases can be
attributed to more distant Galactic disk, halo, or extragalactic emission. If

  ""Contents and structures of the universe"", 2006",,,"astro-ph hep-ph",,"  Recently, the primordial non-Gaussianity in the curvaton model has been
predicted assuming sudden decay of the curvaton. We extend the calculation to
non-instantaneous decay by employing delta N -formalism. The difference between
the sudden-decay approximation and our numerical result is larger than 1% only
if the non-linearity parameter is small, -1.16 < f_NL < 60. Thus it is safe to
use the sudden-decay approximation when deriving constraints for the curvaton
model from WMAP3 (f_NL < 114), but with the Planck forecast |f_NL| <5 one
should employ the fully numerical result. Often, the curvaton perturbations
$\delta\sigma$ have been assumed to be small compared to the background value
of the curvaton field $\sigma_0$. Consequently, the variance $\Delta^2 =
<\delta\sigma^2> / \sigma_0^2$ has been assumed to be negligible. However, the
measurements of CMB or large-scale structure perturbation amplitude do not
constrain the variance if the main contribution to it comes from the
ultraviolet (UV) scales, i.e., from smaller than observable scales. We discuss
how, even in this case, observational constraints on non-Gaussianity set an
upper bound to the small scale variance, Delta^2_UV < 90.

all-sky redshift survey to date and includes about 23,200 galaxies with

the expansion of these fields in Fourier-Bessel functions. Within this
framework, the linear redshift distortions only affect the density field in the
radial direction and can easily be deconvolved using a distortion matrix.
Moreover, in this coordinate system, the velocity field is related to the
density field by a simple linear transformation. The shot noise errors in the
reconstructions are suppressed by means of a Wiener filter which yields a
minimum variance estimate of the density and velocity fields. Using the
reconstructed real-space density fields, we identify all major superclusters

residual overburden only a few g/cm^2, atmospheric gamma rays are mainly
produced by a single interaction of primary cosmic rays with overlying
atmospheric nuclei. Thus, we can use these gamma rays to study the spectrum of
primary cosmic rays and their products in the atmosphere. From the observed
atmospheric gamma ray spectrum, we deconvolved the primary cosmic-ray proton

proton spectrum covers the energy range from 200GeV to 50TeV, which fills a gap
in the currently available primary cosmic-ray proton spectra. We also estimated
the atmospheric muon spectrum above 30GeV at high altitude from our gamma-ray

show that this fact can be exploited to integrate out the intermediate states
from the expressions for the scattering cross section. By this we obtain an
effective scattering cross section that only contains the initial and final

out to be a resonant scattering factor times a linear combination of the charge

couples with the spin of a spinor. The representation depends only on metric

we find the classical approximation is just Newtonian second law. The dynamical
connection $\Omega_\mu$ couples with the spin of a particle with a tiny energy
in weak field, which provides location and navigation functions for a spinor.

obtain the NN potential, we adopt a method recently proposed by CP-PACS

analysis of NN scattering data. By identifying the equal-time Bethe-Salpeter
wave function with the Schroedinger wave function for the two nucleon system,
the NN potential is reconstructed so that the wave function satisfies the
time-independent Schroedinger equation. In this report, we restrict ourselves
to the J^P=0^+ and I=1 channel, which enables us to pick up unambiguously the
``central'' NN potential V_{central}(r). The resulting potential is seen to
posses a clear repulsive core of about 500 MeV at short distance (r < 0.5 fm).
Although the attraction in the intermediate and long distance regions is still
missing in the present lattice set-up, our method is appeared to be quite
promising in reconstructing the NN potential with lattice QCD.

Markov chain, in the presence of a potential that interacts with the polymer
when it visits a particular site 0. We assume that probability of an excursion
of length $n$ is given by $n^{-c}\phi(n)$ for some $1<c<2$ and slowly varying
$\phi$. Disorder is introduced by having the interaction vary from one monomer
to another, as a constant $u$ plus i.i.d. mean-0 randomness. There is a
critical value of $u$ above which the polymer is pinned, placing a positive
fraction (called the contact fraction) of its monomers at 0 with high
probability. To see the effect of disorder on the depinning transition, we
compare the contact fraction and free energy (as functions of $u$) to the
corresponding annealed system. We show that for $c>3/2$, at high temperature,
the quenched and annealed curves differ significantly only in a very small
neighborhood of the critical point--the size of this neighborhood scales as
$\beta^{1/(2c-3)}$ where $\beta$ is the inverse temperature. For $c<3/2$, given
$\epsilon>0$, for sufficiently high temperature the quenched and annealed
curves are within a factor of $1-\epsilon$ for all $u$ near the critical point;
in particular the quenched and annealed critical points are equal. For $c=3/2$
the regime depends on the slowly varying function $\phi$.

$S\subset V$ where for every vertex $v$ in its boundary it holds that the

called global if it affects every vertex in $V\backslash S$, that is, $S$ is a
dominating set of $\Gamma$. The global offensive alliance number
$\gamma_o(\Gamma)$ (respectively, global strong offensive alliance number
$\gamma_{\hat{o}}(\Gamma)$) is the minimum cardinality of a global offensive
(respectively, global strong offensive) alliance in $\Gamma$. If $\Gamma$ has
global independent offensive alliances, then the \emph{global independent

all independent global offensive alliances of $\Gamma$. In this paper we study
mathematical properties of the global (strong) alliance number of cubic graphs.

Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_(NN)) = 62.4 GeV have been measured by the PHOBOS
experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National
Laboratory. The identification of particles relies on three different methods:
low momentum particles stopping in the first detector layers; the specific
energy loss (dE/dx) in the silicon Spectrometer, and Time-of-Flight
measurement. These methods cover the transverse momentum ranges 0.03-0.2,
0.2-1.0 and 0.5-3.0 GeV/c, respectively. Baryons are found to have
substantially harder transverse momentum spectra than mesons. The pT region in
which the proton to pion ratio reaches unity in central Au+Au collisions at
sqrt(s_(NN)) = 62.4 GeV fits into a smooth trend as a function of collision
energy. At low transverse momenta, the spectra exhibit a significant deviation
from transverse mass scaling, and when the observed particle yields at very low
pT are compared to extrapolations from higher pT, no significant excess is
found. By comparing our results to Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_(NN)) = 200 GeV,
we conclude that the net proton yield at midrapidity is proportional to the

quantities of astrophysical interest. We have reported for the first time the
transition probabilities for some forbidden transitions which are unavailable
in the literature; either theoretically or experimentally. We also discuss the
physical effects associated with these transitions. Our data can be used for
the identification of spectral lines arising from the coronal atmospheres of
Sun and Sun-like stars having an extended corona.

Phys. 9, 108 (2007)","10.1088/1367-2630/9/4/108",,"physics.comp-ph cond-mat.dis-nn physics.soc-ph",,"  Complex networks have established themselves along the last years as being
particularly suitable and flexible for representing and modeling several
complex natural and human-made systems. At the same time in which the
structural intricacies of such networks are being revealed and understood,
efforts have also been directed at investigating how such connectivity
properties define and constrain the dynamics of systems unfolding on such
structures. However, lesser attention has been focused on hybrid systems,
\textit{i.e.} involving more than one type of network and/or dynamics. Because
several real systems present such an organization (\textit{e.g.} the dynamics
of a disease coexisting with the dynamics of the immune system), it becomes
important to address such hybrid systems. The current paper investigates a
specific system involving a diffusive (linear and non-linear) dynamics taking
place in a regular network while interacting with a complex network of
defensive agents following Erd\""os-R\'enyi and Barab\'asi-Albert graph models,
whose nodes can be displaced spatially. More specifically, the complex network
is expected to control, and if possible to extinguish, the diffusion of some
given unwanted process (\textit{e.g.} fire, oil spilling, pest dissemination,
and virus or bacteria reproduction during an infection). Two types of pattern
evolution are considered: Fick and Gray-Scott. The nodes of the defensive
network then interact with the diffusing patterns and communicate between
themselves in order to control the spreading. The main findings include the
identification of higher efficiency for the Barab\'asi-Albert control networks.

pure strategies (cooperation or defection) are distributed on a two-dimensional
lattice. The rate of strategy adoption from a randomly chosen neighbors are
controlled by the payoff difference and a two-value pre-factor $w$
characterizing the players whom the strategy learned from. The reduced teaching
activity of players is distributed randomly with concentrations $\nu$ at the
beginning and fixed further on. Numerical and analytical calculations are
performed to study the concentration of cooperators as a function of $w$ and
$\nu$ for different noise levels and connectivity structures. Significant
increase of cooperation is found within a wide range of parameters for this
dynamics. The results highlight the importance of asymmetry characterizing the
exchange of master-follower role during the strategy adoptions.

with fixed coupling constants. The effect is stable against small fluctuations

protocol, here we develop a more efficient scheme compatible with active
purification of arbitrary errors. Using similar resources as the earlier
protocol, our approach intrinsically purifies leakage out of the logical
subspace and all errors within the logical subspace, leading to greatly
improved performance in the presence of experimental inefficiencies. Our
analysis indicates that our scheme could generate approximately one pair per 3
minutes over 1280 km distance with fidelity (F>78%) sufficient to violate
Bell's inequality.

Our results are two-fold: we show by an explicit construction that in the
traditional approach, where the reveal and guess probabilities form the
security criteria, no good schemes can exist: a+b is at least n. If, however,
we use a more liberal criterion of security, the accessible information, we
construct schemes where a=4 log n+O(1) and b=4, which is impossible
classically. Our findings significantly extend known no-go results for quantum
