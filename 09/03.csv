high-resolution echelle spectra at the Very Large Telescope using Ultraviolet
and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) at two different epochs for each object,
and measured the shifts in their RVs to identify candidates for binary/multiple
systems in the sample. The average time separation of the RV measurements is
21.6d, and our survey is sensitive to the binaries with separation < 0.1 au. We
found that 4 out of 17 objects (or 24^{+16}_{-13} per cent by fraction) show a
significant RV change in 4-33d time scale, and are considered as
binary/multiple `candidates.' We found no double-lined spectroscopic binaries
in our sample, based on the shape of cross-correlation curves. The RV
dispersion of the objects in UScoOB is found to be very similar to that of the
BD and VLM stars in Chamaeleon I (Cha I). We also found the distribution of the
mean rotational velocities (v sin i) of the UScoOB objects is similar to that
of the Cha I, but the dispersion of v sin i is much larger than that of the Cha
I objects.

by far the highest energy detected in interstellar space. It is observed in
absorption toward the galactic center star forming region Sgr B2. There is a
clear detection toward Sgr B2(M) and a likely one toward SgrB2(N). An upper
limit for emission is determined for Orion-KL. If we combine the (18,18) line
results from Sgr B2(M) with the previously measured (12,12) absorption line, we
find a rotation temperature of >1300 K for the absorbing cloud. This is at
least a factor of two higher than previously derived values from less highly
excited ammonia lines, giving a lower limit to the kinetic temperature. There
is a hot low density gas component in the envelope of SgrB2. It is possible
that the (18,18) line arises in this region. The radial velocity of the low
density, hot envelope is the same as that of the dense hot cores, so the
(18,18) line could also arise in the dense hot cores where non-metastable (J>K)
absorption lines from energy levels of up to 1350 K above the ground state have
been observed. A discussion of scenarios is presented.

($\sim 100$ Myr), masses, sizes of the two clusters and their projected
separation, we conclude that the cluster pair must have been born with an
initial separation of 15--20 pc. Clusters with a smaller initial separation
tend to merge in $\aplt 60$ Myr due to loss of angular momentum from escaping
stars. Clusters with a larger initial separation tend to become even more
widely separated due to mass loss from the evolving stellar populations. The
early orbital evolution of a binary cluster is governed by mass loss from the
evolving stellar population and by loss of angular momentum from escaping
stars. Mass loss by stellar winds and supernovae explosions in the first $\sim
30$ Myr causes the binary to expand and the orbit to become eccentric. The
initially less massive cluster expands more quickly than the binary separation
increases, and is therefore bound to initiate mass transfer to the more massive
cluster. This process is quite contrary to stellar binaries in which the more
massive star tends to initiate mass transfer. Since mass transfer proceeds on a
thermal timescale from the less massive to the more massive cluster, this
semi-detached phase is quite stable, even in an eccentric orbit until the
orbital separation reaches the gyration radius of the two clusters, at which
point both clusters merge to one.

In
particular they prevent true long range phase order from forming in one
dimensional condensates, even at zero temperature. Nevertheless, by dynamically
splitting the condensate into two parallel decoupled tubes, a macroscopic
relative phase, can be imposed on the system. This kind of setup can serve as a
matter wave interferometer, which relies on the interference between the
displaced condensates as a measure of the relative phase between them. Here we
show how the quantum phase fluctuations, which are so effective in equilibrium,
act to destroy the macroscopic relative phase that was imposed as a non
equilibrium initial condition of the interferometer. We show that the phase
coherence between the two condensates decays exponentially with a dephasing
time that depends on intrinsic parameters: the dimensionless interaction
strength, sound velocity and density. Interestingly, at low temperatures the
dephasing time is almost independent of temperature. At temperatures higher
than a crossover scale T* dephasing gains significant temperature dependance.
In contrast to the usual phase diffusion, which is essentially an effect of
confinement, the dephasing due to fluctuations in one dimension is a bulk
effect that survives the thermodynamic limit.

and investigating the concept of p-adic rigidity of arithmetic Hecke

Zariski dense set of arithmetic specializations. This paper develops tools for
explicit investigation into the structure of eigenvarieties for GL(N). We use
these tools to prove that known examples of non-sefldual cohomological
cuspforms for GL(3) are rigid. Moreover, we conjecture that for GL(3), rigidity
is equivalent to non-selfduality.

Chirality of maps and hypermaps is not merely a binary invariant but can be
quantified by two new invariants -- the chirality group and the chirality
index, the latter being the size of the chirality group. A detailed
investigation of the chirality groups of maps and hypermaps will be the main
objective of this paper. The most extreme type of chirality arises when the
chirality group coincides with the monodromy group. Such hypermaps are called
totally chiral. Examples of them are constructed by considering appropriate
``asymmetric'' pairs of generators for some non-abelian simple groups. We also
show that every finite abelian group is the chirality group of some hypermap,
whereas many non-abelian groups, including symmetric and dihedral groups,
cannot arise as chirality groups.

  10-13 Oct 2006, Minsk, Belarus",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  The influence of the relativistic motion of the reference frame on the light
reflection law is investigated. The method is based on applying the
relativistic aberration affect for three light signals: incident, normal and
reflected rays. The form of the reflection law in the moving reference frame is
substantially modified and includes an additional parameter which is the
velocity vector of the reference frame.
  It is shown that the reflected ray, as measured by a moving observer, would
not in general be in the same plane as the incident and normal rays. A general
method to transform the form of any rigid surface in 3-dimensional space with
respect to the arbitrary directed relative motion of the reference frame is
detailed. This method is based on the light signals processes and the
invariance of the light velocity under Lorentz transformations. It is shown
that a moving observer will measure a plane surface as a hyperboloid. That
observer will also measure a spherical surface as an ellipsoid. A right line in
the plane is seen by a moving observer as a hyperbola. The whole analysis is
extended to the case of a uniform media.

systems including a skewed node degree distribution and small-world topology.
These patterns suggest common organizational constraints and similar functional
consequences. Here, we investigate a structural pattern termed pathway
proliferation. Previous research enumerating pathways that link species
determined that as pathway length increases, the number of pathways tends to
increase without bound. We hypothesize that this pathway proliferation
influences the flow of energy, matter, and information in ecosystems. In this
paper, we clarify the pathway proliferation concept, introduce a measure of the
node--node proliferation rate, describe factors influencing the rate, and
characterize it in 17 large empirical food-webs. During this investigation, we
uncovered a modular organization within these systems. Over half of the
food-webs were composed of one or more subgroups that were strongly connected
internally, but weakly connected to the rest of the system. Further, these
modules had distinct proliferation rates. We conclude that pathway
proliferation in ecological networks reveals subgroups of species that will be
functionally integrated through cyclic indirect effects.
