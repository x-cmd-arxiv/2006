especially event rates, are known to depend on a significant number of input
model parameters with different degrees of sensitivity. At the same time, for
systems with relatively low formation rates, such simulations are heavily
computationally demanding and therefore the needed explorations of the
high-dimensional parameter space require major -- often prohibitive --
computational resources. In the present study, to better understand several key
event rates involving binary evolution and binaries with two compact objects in
Milky Way-like galaxies and to provide ways of reducing the computational costs
of complete parameter space explorations: (i) we perform a methodical parameter
study of the \emph{StarTrack} population synthesis code ; and (ii) we develop a
formalism and methodology for the derivation of {\em multi-dimensional fits}
for event rates. We significantly generalize our earlier study, and we focus on
ways of thoroughly assessing the accuracy of the fits. We anticipate that the
efficient tools developed here can be applied in lieu of large-scale population
calculations and will facilitate the exploration of the dependence of rate
predictions on a wide range binary evolution parameters. Such explorations can
then allow the derivation of constraints on these parameters, given empirical
rate constraints and accounting for fitting errors. Here we describe in detail
the principles and practice behind constructing these fits, estimating their
accuracy, and comparing them with observations in a manner that accounts for
their errors.

less than the bolometric output of the system. About 50% of the infrared
luminosity is indeed produced by a cold dust component that probably originates
from enshrouded star formation in the host galaxy. In the context of a coeval
growth of stellar bulges and massive black holes, this source might represent a
``transition'' object sharing properties with both quasars and luminous
starbursts. Study of such composite galaxies will help address how the star
formation and disk-accretion phenomena may have regulated each other at high

between the inclination angle and the near-IR and optical photometric

and their average projected expansion velocity becomes smaller.
  We compute two-dimensional models of stars embedded in dusty disks of various

disk-star combinations with reasonable parameters. To compare with the
observational data, we generate sets of model data by randomly varying the star

lines. In this paper, we present a detailed study of the resonant line
scattering process using Monte-Carlo method to constrain the optical depth, the
geometry and the kinematics of BAL Region (BALR). By comparing our results with
observed polarized spectra of BAL quasars, we find: (1) Resonant scattering can
produce polarization up to 9% at the absorption trough for doublet transitions
and up to 20% for singlet transitions in radially accelerated flows. To explain
the large polarization degree in the CIV, NV absorption line troughs detected
in a small fraction of BAL QSOs, a nonmonotonic velocity distribution along the
line of sight or/and additional contribution from the electron scattering
region is required. (2) The rotation of the flow can lead to the rotation of
the polarization position angle (PA) in the line trough. Large extending angle
of BALR is required to produce the observed large PA rotation in a few BAL
QSOs. (3) A large extending angle of BALR is required to explain a sub-trough
in the polarized flux that was observed in a number of BAL QSOs. (4) The
resonant-scattering can contribute a significant part of NV emission line in
some QSOs, and may give rise to anomalous strong NV lines in these quasars. (5)
The polarized flux and PA rotation produced by the resonant scattering in
non-BAL is uniquely asymmetric, which may be used to test the presence of BALR
in non-BAL QSOs.

formation in the Clouds for the last ~0.2 Gyr based on our chemodynamical

interaction induces the formation of asymmetric spiral arms with high gas
densities and consequently triggers star formation within the arms in the LMC.
Star formation rate in the present LMC is significantly enhanced just above the
eastern edge of the LMC's stellar bar owing to the tidal interaction. The
location of the enhanced star formation is very similar to the observed
location of 30 Doradus, which suggests that the formation of 30 Doradus is
closely associated with the last Magellanic collision about 0.2 Gyr ago. The
tidal interaction can dramatically compress gas initially within the outer part
of the SMC so that new stars can be formed from the gas to become intergalactic
young stars in the inter-Cloud region (e.g., the Magellanic Bridge). The

magn in 1000 d, suggesting that the system could belong to the sub-class of
symbiotic novae. Several outburst events are superposed on this slow decline.
Three independent periodicities are identified in the light curve. A
quasi-periodicity of 4650.7 d is detected for the outburst occurrence. We
suggest that it is a signature of a solar-type magnetic dynamo cycle in the
giant component. A period of 593.2 d modulates the quiescent light curve and it
is identified as the binary period of the system. During outburst events the
system shows a stable periodic oscillation of 551.4 d. We suggest that it is
the rotation period of the giant.The secondary minima detected at some epochs
of quiescence are probably due to dark spots on the surface of the rotating
giant.
  The difference between the frequencies of these two last periods is the
frequency of a tidal wave in the outer layers of the giant. A period which is a
beat between the magnetic cycle and the tidal wave period is also apparent in
the light curve. YY Her is a third symbiotic system exhibiting these cycles in
their light curve, suggesting that a magnetic dynamo process is prevalent in
the giant components of symbiotic stars, playing an important role in the
outburst mechanism of some of these systems.

an insulator with local magnetic moments and a Pc-derived valence band with a
width of 0.32 eV. In the intercalated compound $\rm K_2CuPc$ the additional
electrons that are introduced by potassium are fully transferred to the $e_g$
states of the Pc-ring. A molecular low spin state results, preserving, however,
the local magnetic moment on the copper ions. The degeneracy of the $e_g$
levels is split by a crystal field that quenches the orbital degeneracy and
gives rise to a band splitting of 110 meV. Molecular electronic Coulomb
interactions enhance this splitting in $\rm K_2CuPc$ to a charge gap of 1.4 eV.
The bandwidth of the conduction band is 0.56 eV, which is surprisingly large
for a molecular solid. This is line with the experimentally observation that
the system with additional potassium doping, $\rm K_{2.75}{CuPc}$, is a metal
as the unusually large bandwidth combined with the substantial carrier
concentration acts against localization and polaron formation, while strongly
promoting the delocalization of the charge carriers.

Tartakovsky and Veeravalli (2005) developed a general Bayesian asymptotic
change-point detection theory (in the classical setting) that is not limited to
a restrictive i.i.d. assumption. It was proved that Shiryaev's detection
procedure is asymptotically optimal under traditional average false alarm
probability constraint, assuming that this probability is small. In the present
paper, we consider a less conventional approach where the constraint is imposed
on the global, supremum false alarm probability. An asymptotically optimal

significant, holomorphic Siegel cusp forms F of genus 2, which are neither of
Saito-Kurokawa type, in which case the degree 4 spinor L-function L(s, F) is
divisible by an abelian L-function, nor of Yoshida type, in which case L(s,F)
is a product of L-series of a pair of elliptic cusp forms. Two key examples are
the forms F defined by the symmetric cube of a non-CM elliptic curve E over the
rationals, and those defined by anticyclotomic twists (of even non-zero weight)
of the base change of such an E to an imaginary quadratic field K. One of the
main ingredients is the transfer, albeit indirect, of cusp forms \pi on GL(4)
to GSp(4) with many of the expected properties, and this might be of
independent interest. The transfer information is shown to be complete when \pi
is regular and associated to an \ell-adic Galois representation. We also appeal
to the (independent) results of Laumon and Weissauer on the zeta functions of
Siegel modular threefolds.

random variables with values in $(c,1]$, for some $c>0$. For almost every
realization of the environment $\lambda$ the zero-range process has product
invariant measures $\{{\nu_{\lambda, v}}:0\le v\le c\}$ parametrized by $v$,
the average total jump rate from any given site. The density of a measure,
defined by the asymptotic average number of particles per site, is an
increasing function of $v$. There exists a product invariant measure ${\nu
_{\lambda, c}}$, with maximal density. Let $\mu$ be a probability measure
concentrating mass on configurations whose number of particles at site $x$
grows less than exponentially with $\|x\|$. Denoting by $S_{\lambda}(t)$ the
semigroup of the process, we prove that all weak limits of $\{\mu
S_{\lambda}(t),t\ge 0\}$ as $t\to \infty$ are dominated, in the natural partial
order, by ${\nu_{\lambda, c}}$. In particular, if $\mu$ dominates ${\nu
_{\lambda, c}}$, then $\mu S_{\lambda}(t)$ converges to ${\nu_{\lambda, c}}$.
The result is particularly striking when the maximal density is finite and the
initial measure has a density above the maximal.

excess by subtraction of the decay sources. The shape of the resulting mass
spectrum shows some non-trivial centrality dependence, but is largely
consistent with a dominant contribution from pi+pi- ->rho ->mu+mu-
annihilation. The associated rho spectral function exhibits considerable
broadening, but essentially no shift in mass. The pT-differential mass spectra
show the excess to be much stronger at low pT than at high pT. The results are
compared to theoretical model predictions; they tend to rule out models linking
hadron masses directly to the chiral condensate.

averaging is used to reject the background noise of the instrument. All the
known methods make use of a mixer, used either as a saturated phase detector or
as a linear synchronous detector. Unfortunately, AM noise is taken in through
the power-to-dc-offset conversion mechanism that results from the mixer
asymmetry. The measurement of some mixers indicates that the unwanted
amplitude-to-voltage gain is of the order of 5-50 mV, which is 12-35 dB lower
than the phase-to-voltage gain of the mixer. In addition, the trick of setting
the mixer at a sweet point -- off the quadrature condition -- where the
sensitivity to AM nulls, works only with microwave mixers. The HF-VHF mixers
have not this sweet point. Moreover, we prove that if the AM noise comes from
the oscillator under test, it can not be rejected by correlation. At least not
with the schemes currently used. An example shows that at some critical
frequencies the unwanted effect of AM noise is of the same order -- if not
greater -- than the phase noise. Thus, experimental mistakes are around the
corner.
