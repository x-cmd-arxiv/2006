detected by HETE-2 in order to derive its afterglow emission parameters and to
determine the reason for its optical faintness when compared to other events.
Observations were taken in the optical (2.0m Himalayan Chandra Telescope, 1.34m
Tautenburg, 4.2m William Herschel Telescope) and in X-rays (Swift/XRT) between
2.7 hours and 10 days after the onset of the event. The data can be interpreted
by collimated emission in a jet with a typical value of $p$ = 2.4 which is
moving in an homogeneous interstellar medium and with a cooling frequency
nu_{c} still above the X-rays at 0.5 days after the burst onset. GRB 051028 can
be classified as a ``gray'' or ``potentially dark'' GRB. On the basis of the
combined optical and Swift/XRT data, we conclude that the reason for the
optical dimness is not extra absorption in the host galaxy, but rather the GRB
taking place at high-redshift.We also notice the very striking similarity with
the optical lightcurve of GRB 050730, a burst with a spectroscopic redshift of
3.967, although GRB 051028 is about 3 mag fainter. We suggest that the bump
could be explained by multiple energy injection episodes and that the burst is
intrinsically faint when compared to the average afterglows detected since
1997. The non-detection of the host galaxy down to R = 25.1 is also consistent
with the burst arising at high redshift, compatible with the published pseudo-z
of 3.7 +/- 1.8.

to be difficult. This situation is not helped by current data samples where the

galaxies in the catalog with the same morphological types, in terms of their
photometric parameters, rotational velocities, dust contents, or the total mass
of gas in comparison with galaxies of similar linear sizes and disk angular

HI to H_2. Galaxies with bars and active nuclei are found more frequently among

high M_{mol}/M_{HI} ratios are caused by the overestimation of M_{mol} due to a
low conversion factor for the translation of CO-line intensities into the
number of H_2 molecules along the line of sight. It is argued that the
""molecularization"" of the bulk of the gas mass could be due 1) to the
concentration of gas in the inner regions of the galactic disks, resulting to a
high gas pressure and 2) to relatively low star-formation rate per unit mass of
molecular gas which indeed takes place in galaxies with high M_{mol}/M_{HI}

the shock luminosity associated with the shocks associated with the jets of an

that the luminosity of our galaxies evolves as an old and passively evolving
population formed at high redshift without any need for additional
redshift-dependent evolution. Models with a prolonged stellar mass growth are
rejected by the data with high confidence. The data also reject models in which
the age of the stars is the same at all redshifts. Similarly, the
characteristic stellar mass evolves, in the last two thirds of the universe
age, as expected for a stellar population formed at high redshift. Together
with the old age of stellar populations derived from fundamental plane studies,
our data seems to suggest that massive early-type cluster galaxies have been
completely assembled at high redshift, and not only that their stars are old.
The quality of the data allows us to derive the LF and mass evolution
homogeneously over the whole redshift range, using a single estimator. The
Schechter function describes the galaxy luminosity function well. The
characteristic luminosity at z=0.5 is found to be 16.30 mag, with an

(Z_{Fe}~0.4 Z_o) in the redshift range z~0.3-0.5, approaching the value
measured locally in the inner 0.15 R_{vir} radii for a mix of cool-core and non

characterizing the physical properties of the grains. With the availability of
stellar databases and far-infrared data from Infrared Space Observatory (ISO)
it is possible to compare the optical and infrared properties of dust, and
derive the far-infrared emissivity with respect to the optical extinction.
  In this paper we present the results of a systematic analysis of the FIR
emissivity of interstellar clouds observed with ISOPHOT (the photometer onboard
ISO) at least at two infrared wavelengths, one close to ~100um and one at
200um. We constructed FIR emission maps, determined dust temperatures, created
extinction maps using 2MASS survey data, and calculated far-infrared emissivity
for each of these clouds. We present the largest homogeneously reduced database
constructed so far for this purpose. During the data analysis special care was
taken on possible systematic errors. We find that far-infrared emissivity has a
clear dependence on temperature.
  The emissivity is enhanced by a factor of usually less than 2 in the low dust
temperature regime of 12K<=T_d<=14K. This result suggests larger grain sizes in
those regions. However, the emissivity increase of typically below 2 restricts
the possible grain growth processes to ice-mantle formation and coagulation of
silicate grains, and excludes the coagulation of carbonaceous particles on the
scales of the regions we investigated.
  In the temperature range 14K<=T_d<=16K a systematic decrease of emissivity is
observed with respect to the values of the diffuse interstellar matter.
Possible scenarios for this behaviour are discussed in the paper.

surface and inhomogeneously distributed about the star. However some regions of
the stellar surface, which contain wind bearing open field lines, are dark in
X-rays. From simulated X-ray light curves, obtained using stellar parameters
from the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project, we calculate X-ray periods and make
comparisons with optically determined rotation periods. We find that X-ray

sequential star formation triggered by massive star feedback (Oliveira et al.

excellent opportunity to study at high spatial resolutions the local star
formation laws. In this first paper, we investigate the correlation of H2, HI,
and total gas surface densities with the star forming activity, derived from
the radio continuum (RC), along radial averages out to radii of 12kpc.
  We have created a complete map of M51 in 12CO 2-1 at a resolution of 450kpc
using HERA at the IRAM-30m telescope. These data are combined with maps of HI
and the radio-continuum at 20cm wavelength. The latter is used to estimate the
star formation rate (SFR), thus allowing to study the star formation efficiency
and the local Schmidt law. The velocity dispersion from CO is used to study the
critical surface density and the gravitational stability of the disk.
  The critical gas velocity dispersions needed to stabilize the gas against
gravitational collapse in the differentially rotating disk of M51 using the
Toomre criterion, vary with radius between 1.7 and 6.8 km/s. Observed radially
averaged dispersions derived from the CO data vary between 28 km/s in the

by factors Q_gas of 1 to 5. We speculate that the gravitational potential of

the heating effects during the flare eruption. We find that the nonthermal

inner edge, while the temperature at the inner edge seems higher. On the other
hand, the results show that nonthermal effects increase rapidly in the rise
phase and decrease quickly in the decay phase, but the atmospheric temperature
can still keep relatively high for some time after getting to its maximum. For
the two kernels that we analyze, the maximum energy fluxes of the electron
beams are $\sim$ 10$^{10}$ and 10$^{11}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively.
However, the atmospheric temperatures are not so high, i.e., lower than or
slightly higher than that of the weak flare model F1 at the two kernels. We
discuss the implications of the results for two-ribbon flare models.

apply the assumed dynamical model of Kaiser et al. (1997) to a number of FR II
type radio galaxies observed at different radio frequencies, and fit - for each
frequency separately - the model free parameters to the observed sources'
quantities. Such a procedure, using enlarged in fact a number of observables,
enables us to determine relatively precise ages and other crucial
characteristics of the analyzed sources. The resulting age estimates agree very
well with those obtained by means of `classical' spectral ageing method for
objects not older than 10 Myr, for which good-quality spectral data are
available. The presented method is however also applicable in the case of the
sources older than this, and/or the ones for which the only available
low-resolution radio data do not allow for detailed spectral ageing studies.
Our analysis indicates that the main factor precluding precise age
determination for FR II type radio galaxies regards the poorly known shape of
the initial electron energy distribution injected by the jet terminal shocks to
the expanding lobes/cocoons. We briefly consider this issue, and conclude that
the broad-band single power-law form assumed here may be accurate enough for
the presented estimates, although most likely it does not strictly correspond
to some well-defined realistic particle acceleration process. Instead, it
should be considered as a simplest model approximation of the initial electron
continuum, averaged over a very broad energy range and over the age of the
source, with the effective spectral index which may be different for different
sources.

collective excitations and their interactions. These quantum-mechanical
excitations are characterized by an energy E and a momentum \hbar k which are
related through their dispersion E_k. The coupling of two excitations may lead
to abrupt changes (kinks) in the slope of the dispersion. Such kinks thus carry
important information about interactions in a many-body system. For example,
kinks detected at 40-70 meV below the Fermi level in the electronic dispersion
of high-temperature superconductors are taken as evidence for phonon or
spin-fluctuation based pairing mechanisms. Kinks in the electronic dispersion
at binding energies ranging from 30 to 800 meV are also found in various other
metals posing questions about their origins. Here we report a novel, purely
electronic mechanism yielding kinks in the electron dispersions. It applies to
strongly correlated metals whose spectral function shows well separated Hubbard
subbands and central peak as, for example, in transition metal-oxides. The
position of the kinks and the energy range of validity of Fermi-liquid (FL)
theory is determined solely by the FL renormalization factor and the bare,
uncorrelated band structure. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)
experiments at binding energies outside the FL regime can thus provide new,
previously unexpected information about strongly correlated electronic systems.

evaluate the dispersion (non-contact van der Waals) interaction between two

to that of two insulating wires in an identical geometry, where the dispersion
interaction is modelled both within a pairwise summation framework, and by
adding a pinning potential to our theory leading to a standard oscillator-type
model of insulating dielectric behavior. Our results provide a further example

explores a region of relatively close coupling where, although the electronic
clouds do not overlap, we are still far from the asymptotic region where a
single power law describes the dispersion energy. We find that strong
differences in dispersion attraction between metallic and semiconducting /

pristine state exhibits phase separation comprising ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic phases. The metastable states with reduced magnetization were
obtained by successive number of quick coolings of the sample placed in
container with kerosene-oil mixture. By an increasing number of quick coolings
(> 6) the long time relaxation appeared at 10 K and the magnetization reversed
its sign and became strongly negative in wide temperature range, even under an
applied magnetic field of 15 kOe. The observed field and temperature
dependences of the magnetization in this state are reversed in comparison with
the ordinary ferromagnetic ones. Above TC, the observed diamagnetic
susceptibility of the reversed magnetization state at T = 120 K is ~ - 0.9 x
10-4 emu g-1 Oe-1. Only after some storage time at room temperature, the
abnormal magnetic state is erasable. It is suggested that the negative
magnetization observed results from a specific coupling of the nano/micro-size
ferromagnetic regions with a surrounding diamagnetic matrix formed, in a
puzzled way, by the repeating training (quick cooling) cycles.

electrons with dispersionless phonons by considering the Hubbard-Holstein model
at half-filling within the dynamical mean-field theory. In particular we
calculate the isotope effects on the quasi-particle spectral weight $Z$, the
renormalized phonon frequency, and the static charge and spin susceptibilities.
In the weakly correlated regime $U/t \lesssim 1.5$, where $U$ is the Hubbard
repulsion and $t$ is the bare electron half-bandwidth, the physical properties
are qualitatively similar to those characterizing the Holstein model in the
absence of Coulomb repulsion, where the bipolaronic binding takes place at
large electron-phonon coupling, and it reflects in divergent isotope responses.
On the contrary in the strongly correlated regime $U/t \gtrsim 1.5$, where the
bipolaronic metal-insulator transition becomes of first order, the isotope
effects are bounded, suggesting that the first order transition is likely
driven by an electronic mechanism, rather then by a lattice instability. These
results point out how the isotope responses are extremely sensitive to phase
boundaries and they may be used to characterize the competition between the
electron-phonon coupling and the Hubbard repulsion.

fluences of 30 keV Ga$^+$ ions. Structural modifications were subsequently
studied using the longitudinal (LMOKE) and quadratic (QMOKE) magneto-optical

similar behavior upon irradiation: they are nearly constant up to ion fluences
of $\approx6\times10^{15}$ ion/cm$^2$, while they decrease with further
increasing fluences and finally vanish at a fluence of $\approx9\times10^{16}$

spin-orbit coupling, which already happens at small fluences of 30 keV Ga$^+$

Static dielectric constants are determined from the low-T limiting behavior of

cm^{-3} implies a radius comparable to the interatomic spacing, consistent with
the small polaron picture established from prior transport studies near room
temperature and above on nearby compositions. Relaxation peaks in the
dielectric loss associated with charge-carrier hopping yield activation
energies in good agreement with low-T hopping energies determined from
variable-range hopping fits of the dc resistivity. The doping dependence of
these energies suggests that the orthorhombic, canted antiferromagnetic ground
state tends toward an insulator-metal transition that is not realized due to
the formation of the ferromagnetic insulating state near Mn(4+) concentration ~

the diagonal and mixed derivatives of pressure with respect to the quark number
(proportional to baryon number) chemical potential ($\mu_0$) and isospin
chemical potential upto sixth order have been extracted at $\mu_0 = \mu_I = 0$.
These derivatives give the generalized susceptibilities with respect to quark
and isospin numbers. Similar estimates for the flavour diagonal and
off-diagonal susceptibilities are also presented. Comparison to Lattice QCD
(LQCD) data of some of these susceptibilities for which LQCD data are
available, show similar temperature dependence, though there are some
quantitative deviations above the crossover temperature. We have also looked at
the effects of instanton induced flavour-mixing coming from the $U_A(1)$ chiral
symmetry breaking 't Hooft determinant like term in the NJL part of the model.
The diagonal quark number and isospin susceptibilities are completely
unaffected. The off-diagonal susceptibilities show significant dependence near
the crossover. Finally we present the chemical potential dependence of specific
heat and speed of sound within the limits of chemical potentials where neither
diquarks nor pions can condense.

kG to be the smallest integer l such that the composition of any l ghosts
between finite-dimensional G-representations factors through a projective. In

showing that a weaker version of the generating hypothesis, where the target of
the ghost is fixed to be the trivial representation k, holds for all p-groups.
We then compute the ghost numbers of all cyclic p-groups and all abelian
2-groups with C_2 as a summand. We obtain bounds on the ghost numbers for
abelian p-groups and for all 2-groups which have a cyclic subgroup of index 2.
Using these bounds we determine the finite abelian groups which have ghost

The quark matter phase is described by a 3-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model
that accounts for scalar diquark condensation and vector meson interactions
while the nuclear matter phase is obtained within the
Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (DBHF) approach using the Bonn-A potential. We

of generators and loads in order to eliminate the network overloads associated
with a damaged system. We also provide a simple model for the operator's
response to various contingency events that is not always optimal due to either
failure of the state estimation system or due to the incorrect subjective
assessment of the severity associated with these events. This further allows us
to use a game theoretic framework for casting the optimization of the
operator's response into the choice of the optimal strategy which minimizes the
operating cost. We use a simple strategy space which is the degree of tolerance
to line overloads and which is an automatic control (optimization) parameter
that can be adjusted to trade off automatic load shed without propagating
cascades versus reduced load shed and an increased risk of propagating
cascades. The tolerance parameter is chosen to describes a smooth transition
from a risk averse to a risk taken strategy...

sequences is a long-standing goal in computational/molecular biology. The
successful discrimination of protein folds would help to improve the accuracy
of protein 3D structure prediction. Results: In this work, we propose a method
based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for recognizing proteins belonging
to 30 different folds using the occurrence of amino acid residues in a set of
1612 proteins. The present method could discriminate the globular proteins from
30 major folding types with the sensitivity of 37%, which is comparable to or
better than other methods in the literature. A web server has been developed
for predicting the folding type of the protein from amino acid sequence and it
is available at http://granular.com/PROLDA/. Conclusions:Linear discriminant
analysis based on amino acid occurrence could successfully recognize protein
folds. The present method has several advantages such as, (i) it directly
predicts the folding type of a protein without performing pair-wise
comparisons, (ii) it can discriminate folds among large number of proteins and
(iii) it is very fast to obtain the results. This is a simple method, which can
be easily incorporated in any other structure prediction algorithms.

interpretation question was not settled at this conference and no consensus was

interpretation of quantum theory, so it is important to re-evaluate the
historical sources and keep the interpretation debate open. In this spirit, we
provide a complete English translation of the original proceedings (lectures
and discussions), and give background essays on the three main interpretations
presented: de Broglie's pilot-wave theory, Born and Heisenberg's quantum
mechanics, and Schroedinger's wave mechanics. We provide an extensive analysis
of the lectures and discussions that took place, in the light of current
debates about the meaning of quantum theory. The proceedings contain much
unexpected material, including extensive discussions of de Broglie's pilot-wave
theory (which de Broglie presented for a many-body system), and a ""quantum
mechanics"" apparently lacking in wave function collapse or fundamental time
evolution. We hope that the book will contribute to the ongoing revival of

historical development of quantum physics. A more detailed description of the

is shown to appear in three manifestations, in the form of uncertainty
relations: for the widths of the position and momentum distributions in any

quantities; and for the inaccuracy of a measurement of one of the quantities

conceptually distinct, these three kinds of uncertainty relations are shown to
