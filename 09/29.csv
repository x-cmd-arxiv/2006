  emulateapj6","Astrophys.J.672:888-903,2008","10.1086/523880",,"astro-ph",,"  Nearby dwarf galaxies exhibit tight correlations between their global stellar
and dynamical properties, such as circular velocity, mass-to-light ratio,
stellar mass, surface brightness, and metallicity. Such correlations have often
been attributed to gas or metal-rich outflows driven by supernova energy
feedback to the interstellar medium. We use high-resolution cosmological
simulations of high-redshift galaxies with and without energy feedback, as well
as analytic modeling, to investigate whether the observed correlations can
arise without supernova-driven outflows. We find that the simulated dwarf
galaxies exhibit correlations similar to those observed as early as z~10,
regardless of whether supernova feedback is included. We also show that the
correlations can be well reproduced by our analytic model that accounts for
realistic gas inflow but assumes no outflows, and star formation rate obeying
the Kennicutt-Schmidt law with a critical density threshold. We argue that
correlations in simulated galaxies arise due to the increasingly inefficient
conversion of gas into stars in low-mass dwarf galaxies rather than
supernova-driven outflows. We also show that the decrease of the observed
effective yield in low-mass objects, often used as an indicator of gas and
metal outflows, can be reasonably reproduced in our simulations without
outflows. We show that this trend can arise if a significant fraction of metals
in small galaxies is spread to the outer regions of the halo outside the
stellar extent via mixing. In this case the effective yield can be
significantly underestimated if only metals within the stellar radius are taken
into account. Measurements of gas metallicity in the outskirts of gaseous disks
of dwarfs would thus provide a key test of such explanation.

distributions to stellar data in colour-magnitude space. This allows one to
include (for example) binary stars in an isochronal population. The method also
allows one to derive formal uncertainties for fitted parameters, and assess the
likelihood that a good fit has been found. We use the method to derive an age
of 38.5 +3.5/-6.5 Myrs and a true distance modulus of 7.79 +0.11/-0.05 mags
from the V vs V-I diagram of NGC2547 (the uncertainties are 67 percent
confidence limits, and the parameters are insensitive to the assumed binary
fraction). These values are consistent with those previously determined from
low-mass isochronal fitting, and are the first measurements to have
statistically meaningful uncertainties. The age is also consistent with the
lithium depletion age of NGC2547, and the HIPPARCOS distance to the cluster is
consistent with our value.
  The method appears to be quite general and could be applied to any
N-dimensional dataset, with uncertainties in each dimension. However, it is
particularly useful when the data are sparse, in the sense that both the
typical uncertainties for a datapoint and the size of structure in the function
being fitted are small compared with the typical distance between datapoints.
In this case binning the data will lose resolution, whilst the method presented
here preserves it.

continuum emission that are several $\kpc$ long are identified, as well as
large variations in pitch angle along spiral arms, of a few tens of degrees. We
find two types of arms of polarized radio emission: one has a ridge close to
the ridge of CO, with similar pitch angles for the CO and polarization spirals
and the regular magnetic field; the other does not always coincide with the CO
arm and its pitch angle differs from the orientation of its regular magnetic
field. The offsets between ridges of regular magnetic field, dense gas and warm
dust are compatible with the sequence expected from spiral density wave
triggered star formation, with a delay of a few tens of millions of years
between gas entering the shock and the formation of giant molecular clouds and
a similar interval between the formation of the clouds and the emergence of
young star clusters. At the position of the CO arms the orientation of the
regular magnetic field is the same as the pitch angle of the spiral arm, but
away from the gaseous arms the orientation of the regular field varies
significantly. Spiral shock compression can explain the generation of one type
of arm of strong polarized radio emission but a different mechanism is probably
responsible for a second type of polarization arm. (Shortened abstract.)

these stars and then focus on an analysis of the s-process under the physical
conditions encountered during the shell-carbon burning. We show that the recent
compilation of the Ne22(alpha,n)Mg25 rate leads to a remarkable reduction of
the efficiency of the s-process during core He-burning. In particular, this
rate leads to the lowest overproduction factor of Kr80 found to date during
core He-burning in massive stars. The s-process yields resulting from shell
carbon burning turn out to be very sensitive to the structural evolution of the
carbon shell. This structure is influenced by the mass fraction of C12 attained
at the end of core helium burning, which in turn is mainly determined by the
C12(alpha,gamma)O16 reaction. The still present uncertainty in the rate for
this reaction implies that the s-process in massive stars is also subject to
this uncertainty. We identify some isotopes like Zn70 and Rb87 as the
signatures of the s-process during shell carbon burning in massive stars. In
determining the relative contribution of our s-only stellar yields to the solar
abundances, we find it is important to take into account the neutron exposure
of shell carbon burning. When we analyze our yields with a Salpeter Initial
Mass Function, we find that massive stars contribute at least 40% to s-only
nuclei with mass A <= 87. For s-only nuclei with mass A >90, massive stars
contribute on average ~7%, except for Gd152, Os187, and Hg198 which are ~14%,

their mass. Clearly, stars with masses >10 M_sun exist, so there must be a way
for them to form. The problem may be solved by non-spherical accretion, which
allows some of the stellar photons to escape along the symmetry axis where the
density is lower. The recent detection of rotating disks and toroids around
very young massive stars has lent support to the idea that high-mass (> 8
M_sun) stars could form in this way. Here we report observations of an ammonia

scales to ~10 AU scales, for durations that cover the main fragmentation phase,
using three-dimensional gravito-radiation hydrodynamics. We find that for a
wide range of initial conditions radiation feedback from accreting protostars
inhibits the formation of fragments, so that the vast majority of the collapsed

gravitational instability by rapid accretion, producing rapid mass and angular
momentum transport that allows most of the gas to accrete onto the central star
rather than forming fragments. In contrast, a control run using the same
initial conditions but an isothermal equation of state produces much more
fragmentation, both in and out of the disk. We conclude that massive cores with
observed properties are not likely to fragment into many stars, so that, at
least at high masses, the core mass function probably determines the stellar
initial mass function. Our results also demonstrate that simulations of massive

the Galaxy. They are extremely long-lived and because they are much smaller in
mass than the Sun (between 0.5 and 0.08 MSun), their temperature and stellar
luminosity are low and peaked in the red. We have re-examined what is known at
present about the potential for a terrestrial planet forming within, or
migrating into, the classic liquid-surface-water habitable zone close to an M
dwarf star. Observations of protoplanetary disks suggest that planet-building
materials are common around M dwarfs, but N-body simulations differ in their
estimations of the likelihood of potentially-habitable, wet planets residing
within their habitable zones, which are only ~ 1/5 to 1/50 of the width of that
for a G star. Particularly in light of the claimed detection of the planets
with masses as small as 5.5 and 7.5 MEarth orbiting M stars, there seems no
reason to exclude the possibility of terrestrial planets. Tidally locked
synchronous rotation within the narrow habitable zone doesn't necessarily lead
to atmospheric collapse, and active stellar flaring may not be as much of an
evolutionarily disadvantageous factor as has previously been supposed. We
conclude that M dwarf stars may indeed be viable hosts for planets on which the
origin and evolution of life can occur. A number of planetary processes such as
cessation of geothermal activity, or thermal and non-thermal atmospheric loss
processes may limit the duration of planetary habitability to periods far
shorter than the extreme lifetime of the M dwarf star. Nevertheless, it makes
sense to include M dwarf stars in programs that seek to find habitable worlds
and evidence of life.

kilometric radiation ('striated' AKR) based on observations from the Cluster
wideband receiver during 2002-2005. We show that the observed characteristics,
including frequency drift rate and direction, narrow bandwidth, observed
intensity, and beaming angular sizes are all consistent with triggering by
upward traveling ion solitary structures (`ion holes'). We calculate the
expected perturbation of a horseshoe electron distribution function by an ion
hole by integrating the resonance condition for a cyclotron maser instability
(CMI) using the perturbed velocity distribution. We find that the CMI growth
rate can be strongly enhanced as the horseshoe velocity distribution contracts
inside the passing ion hole, resulting in a power gain increase greater than
100 dB. The gain curve is sharply peaked just above the R-mode cut-off
frequency, with an effective bandwidth ~50 Hz, consistent with the observed
bandwidth of striated AKR emission. Ion holes are observed in situ in the
acceleration region moving upward with spatial scales and speeds consistent
with the observed bandwidth and slopes of SAKR bursts. Hence, we suggest that
SAKR bursts are a remote sensor of ion holes and can be used to determine the
frequency of occurrence, locations in the acceleration region, and lifetimes of
these structures.

These correlations suggest the existence of gas produced by a range of nuclear

helium-burning and nitrogen depletion, to regions containing enriched products
of oxygen-burning. The latter exhibit a gradual, linear rise of [Ni II]
emission with increasing argon enrichment, whereas gas with less nuclear
processing shows markedly different [Ni II] emission characteristics, including
the highest derived abundances. This suggests two origins for stable,
neutron-rich nickel in the nebula: a type of ""alpha-rich freezeout"" in the more
highly processed material, and possibly removal of ions from the neutron star
in other regions. In addition, the data indicate that anomalously strong
observed [C I] emission comes from broad, low-ionization zones. Although the
strongest He I emission could also be enhanced in similar low-ionization gas,
correlations between relevant line ratios argue against that interpretation,
strengthening the case for an exceptionally high helium mass fraction in some

distinct populations of small bodies evolving in the outer regions of the Solar
System. Whereas their collisional activity is now quiet, gravitational
interactions with giant planets may have shaped these populations both
dynamically and collisionally during their formation. Using a hybrid approach
(Charnoz & Morbidelli 2003), the present paper tries to couple the primordial
collisional and dynamical evolution of these three populations in a
self-consistent way. A critical parameter is the primordial size-distribution.
We show that the initial planetesimal size distribution that allows an
effective mass depletion of the Kuiper belt by collisional grinding, would
decimate also the population of comet-size bodies that end in the Oort Cloud
and, in particular, in the Scattered Disk. As a consequence, the Scattered Disk
and the Oort Cloud would be too anemic, by a factor 20 to 100, relative to the
estimates achieved from the observation of the fluxes of long period and
Jupiter family comets, respectively. For these two reservoirs to have a
sufficient number of comets, the initial size distribution in the planetesimal
disk had to be such that the mass depletion by collisional erosion of in the
Kuiper belt was negligible. Consequently, the current mass deficit of the
Kuiper belt, needs to be explained by dynamical mechanisms.

deficit of near-IR flux that could be a consequence of an embedded Jupiter-mass
planet partially clearing an inner hole in the circumstellar disc. Here, we use
two-dimensional numerical simulations of the planet-disc interaction, in
concert with simple models for the dust dynamics, to quantify how a planet
influences the dust at different radii within the disc. We show that pressure
gradients at the outer edge of the gap cleared by the planet act as a filter -
letting particles smaller than a critical size through to the inner disc while
holding back larger particles in the outer disc. The critical particle size
depends upon the disc properties, but is typically of the order of 10 microns.
This filtration process will lead to discontinuous grain populations across the
planet's orbital radius, with small grains in the inner disc and an outer
population of larger grains. We show that this type of dust population is
qualitatively consistent with SED modelling of systems that have optically thin
inner holes in their circumstellar discs. This process can also produce a very
large gas-to-dust ratio in the inner disc, potentially explaining those systems
with optically thin inner cavities that still have relatively high accretion
rates.

from close binaries. In addition to the much--studied neutron star + neutron
star and black hole + neutron star cases usually considered good candidates for
short--duration bursts, there are other possibilities. In particular neutron
star + massive white dwarf has several desirable features. These systems are
likely to produce long--duration GRBs, in some cases definitely without an
accompanying supernova, as observed recently. This class of burst would have a
strong correlation with star formation, and occur close to the host galaxy.
However rare members of the class need not be near star--forming regions, and
could have any type of host galaxy. Thus a long--duration burst far from any
star--forming region would also be a signature of this class. Estimates based
on the existence of a known progenitor suggest that this type of GRB may be
quite common, in agreement with the fact that the absence of a supernova can
only be established in nearby bursts.

eccentricities, we also require fewer low-mass stars than expected from a
Salpeter mass function, giving strong evidence for a significantly

Center. We also note that the maximum possible eccentricities attainable from

line emission is distributed in a 10' long North-South elongated lane with two
strong maxima, CG12 N(orth) and CG12 S(outh). In CG12 S the high density
tracers delineate a compact core, DCO+ core, which is offset by 15"" from the
C18O maximum. The observed strong C18O emission traces the surface of the DCO+
core or a separate, adjacent cloud component. The emission in high density
tracers is weak in CG12 N and especially the H13CO+, DCO+ and N2H+ lines are
+0.5 km/s offset in velocity with respect to the C18O lines. Evidence is

of RXTE observations of GX340+0 using the emission model previously shown to
describe the dipping LMXB. In our Z-track model, the soft apex is a quiescent
state of the source with lowest luminosity. Moving away from this point by
ascending the normal branch the strongly increasing luminosity of the Accretion
Disc Corona (ADC) Comptonized emission L_ADC provides substantial evidence for
a large increase of mass accretion rate Mdot. There are major changes in the
neutron star blackbody emission, kT increasing to high values, the blackbody
radius R_BB decreasing, these changes continuing monotonically on both normal
and horizontal branches. The blackbody flux increases by a factor of ten to
three times the Eddington flux so that the physics of the horizontal branch is
dominated by the high radiation pressure of the neutron star, which we propose
disrupts the inner disc, and an increase of column density is detected. We
further propose that the very strong radiation pressure is responsible for the
launching of the jets detected in radio on the horizontal branch. On the
flaring branch, we find that L_ADC is constant, suggesting no change in Mdot so
that flaring must consist of unstable nuclear burning. At the soft apex, the
mass accretion rate per unit area on the neutron star m_dot is minimum for the
horizontal and normal branches and about equal to the theoretical upper limit
for unstable burning. Thus it is possible that unstable burning begins as soon
as the source arrives at this position, the onset being consistent with theory.
The large increase in R_BB in flaring is reminiscent of radius expansion in
X-ray bursts. Finally, in our model, Mdot does not increase monotonically along
the Z-track as often previously thought.

the $\Omega_m$ parameter obtained tends to decrease, reaching values compatible

provides ambiguous results due to the complex structure of the ICM that induces
a dependence of the gas fraction with temperature, radius, and redshift which
cannot be accounted by a self similar argument expected in pure gravitational
heating of the ICM. The use of gas fraction in X-ray clusters to constrain

to reproduce the downsizing of AGNs within the hierarchical LambdaCDM
cosmogony, and that the most likely responsible for this downsizing is the
stellar kinetic feedback that arises in star-forming bulges as a consequence of
the high level of turbulence and leads to a massive removal of cold gas in
small elliptical galaxies. At the same time, to obtain good fits to the number
of bright quasars we need to require that quasar-triggered galactic winds
self-limit the accretion onto BHs. In all cases, the predicted BH--bulge
relation steepens considerably with respect to the observed one at bulge masses
<10^{11} Msun; this problem is related to a known excess in the predicted
number of small bulges, common to most similar models, so that the reproduction
of the correct number of faint AGNs is done at the cost of underestimating
their BH masses. This highlights an insufficient downsizing of elliptical
galaxies, and hints for another feedback mechanism able to act on the compact
discs that form and soon merge at high redshift. The results of this paper
reinforce the need for direct investigations of the feedback mechanisms in
active galaxies, that will be possible with the next generation of astronomical

assumption is usually made that all quantities, except for the Green functions,
are slowly varying functions of energy. When this so-called Fermi Surface
Restricted Approximation is combined with the assumption that impurities can be
represented by delta-function potentials of arbitrary strength, many reasonable
looking results can be obtained. The agreement with experiments is not entirely
satisfactory and one reason for this might be the assumption that the impurity
potential has zero range. The generalization to finite range potentials appears
to be straightforward, independent of the strength of the potential. However,
the selfenergy resulting from scattering off finite range impurities of
infinite strength such as hard spheres, diverges in this approximation at
frequencies much larger than the gap amplitude! To track down the source of
this unacceptable result we consider the normal state. The elementary results
for scattering off a hard sphere, including the result that even an infinitely
strong delta-function potential does not lead to scattering at all in systems
of two and more dimensions, are recovered only when the energy dependencies of
all quantities involved are properly taken into account. To obtain resonant
scattering, believed to be important for the creation of mid-gap states, the

partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP). This model fits to the
cases where a Markov process is observed by a single sensor which needs to be
dynamically adjusted or by a set of sensors which are selected one at a time in
a way that maximizes the information acquisition from the process. Similar to
conventional POMDP problems, in this model the control action is based on all
past measurements; however here this action is not for the control of state
process, which is autonomous, but it is for influencing the measurement of that
process. This POMDP is a controlled version of the hidden Markov process, and
we show that its optimal observability problem can be formulated as an average
cost Markov decision process (MDP) scheduling problem. In this problem, a
policy is a rule for selecting sensors or adjusting the measuring device based
on the measurement history. Given a policy, we can evaluate the estimation
entropy for the joint state-measurement processes which inversely measures the
observability of state process for that policy. Considering estimation entropy
as the cost of a policy, we show that the problem of finding optimal policy is
equivalent to an average cost MDP scheduling problem where the cost function is
the entropy function over the belief space. This allows the application of the

have been proposed. The typical structure of these schemes has the permutation
and the diffusion stages performed alternatively. The confusion and diffusion
effect is solely contributed by the permutation and the diffusion stage,
respectively. As a result, more overall rounds than necessary are required to
achieve a certain level of security. In this paper, we suggest to introduce
certain diffusion effect in the confusion stage by simple sequential
add-and-shift operations. The purpose is to reduce the workload of the
time-consuming diffusion part so that fewer overall rounds and hence a shorter
encryption time is needed. Simulation results show that at a similar
performance level, the proposed cryptosystem needs less than one-third the
encryption time of an existing cryptosystem. The effective acceleration of the
encryption speed is thus achieved.

the Pomeron using a two-gluon ladder. A third approach, the Bialas Peschanski

discuss the Golec-Biernat-W\""usthoff (GBW) saturation model which takes into
account saturation effects. The best description of all avaible measurements
can be achieved with either the PSF based model or the BEKW approach. In
particular, the BEKW prediction allows to include the highest $\beta$
measurements, which are dominated by higher twists effects and provide an
efficient and compact parametrisation of the diffractive cross section. The two
other models also give a good description of cross section measurements at
small $x$ with a small number of parameters. The comparison of all predictions
allows us to identify interesting differences in the behaviour of the effective
pomeron intercept and in the shape of the longitudinal component of the
diffractive structure functions. In this last part, we present some features
that can be discriminated by new experimental measurements, completing the HERA

out singly charged scalar masses smaller than 590 GeV (5.04 TeV) in case of
normal (inverse) neutrino mass hierarchy. Conversely, decay branching ratios of
the non-standard scalars of the model can be fixed by the measured neutrino
angles (and mass scale). Thus, if the scalars of the model are light enough to
be produced at the LHC or ILC, measuring their decay properties would serve as
a direct test of the model as the origin of neutrino masses.

Abelian gauge by taking into account the effects of the Gribov horizon. The
Gribov approximation, previously introduced in [1], is improved through the
introduction of the horizon function, which is constructed under the
requirements of localizability and renormalizability. By following Zwanziger's
treatment of the horizon function in the Landau gauge, we prove that, when cast
in local form, the horizon term of the maximal Abelian gauge leads to a
quantized theory which enjoys multiplicative renormalizability, a feature which
is established to all orders by means of the algebraic renormalization.
Furthermore, it turns out that the horizon term is compatible with the local
residual U(1) Ward identity, typical of the maximal Abelian gauge, which is
easily derived. As a consequence, the nonrenormalization theorem,
Z_{g}Z_{A}^{1/2}=1, relating the renormalization factors of the gauge coupling
constant Z_{g} and of the diagonal gluon field Z_{A}, still holds in the
presence of the Gribov horizon. Finally, we notice that a generalized dimension
two gluon operator can be also introduced. It is BRST invariant on-shell, a
property which ensures its multiplicative renormalizability. Its anomalous
dimension is not an independent parameter of the theory, being obtained from
the renormalization factors of the gauge coupling constant and of the diagonal
antighost field.

semirealistic compactifications of string theory remains one of the most
difficult problems in string phenomenology. We argue that right-handed neutrino
Majorana masses are induced by non-perturbative instanton effects in certain
classes of string compactifications in which the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson has a
St\""uckelberg mass. The induced operators are of the form $e^{-U}\nu_R\nu_R$
where $U$ is a closed string modulus whose imaginary part transforms
appropriately under $B-L$. This mass term may be quite large since this is not
a gauge instanton and $Re U$ is not directly related to SM gauge couplings.
Thus the size of the induced right-handed neutrino masses could be a few orders
of magnitude below the string scale, as phenomenologically required. It is also
argued that this origin for neutrino masses would predict the existence of
R-parity in SUSY versions of the SM. Finally we comment on other
phenomenological applications of similar instanton effects, like the generation
of a $\mu$-term, or of Yukawa couplings forbidden in perturbation theory.

including the interaction with external charges. This Maxwell-Chern-Simons-like
model may be rewritten in terms of the interacting modes of a massless scalar
model and a topologically massive model \cite{mcs}, that are mapped, through
duality, into interacting massless Maxwell and massive self-dual modes
\cite{sd}. It is also shown that these dual modes might be represented into an
unified rank-two self-dual model that represents the direct dual of the vector
Maxwell-Chern-Simons-like model.

treating the metric $g_{\alpha\beta}$ and the symmetric affine connection
$\Gamma_{\mu\nu}^\lambda$ as independent variables. For $d > 2$ tertiary
constraints naturally arise; if these are all first class, there are $d(d-3)$
independent variables in phase space, the same number that a symmetric tensor
gauge field $\phi_{\mu\nu}$ possesses. If $d = 2$, the Hamiltonian becomes a
linear combination of first class constraints obeying an SO(2,1) algebra. These
constraints ensure that there are no independent degrees of freedom. The
transformation associated with the first class constraints is not a
diffeomorphism when $d = 2$; it is characterized by a symmetric matrix
$\xi_{\mu\nu}$. We also show that the canonical analysis is different if
$h^{\alpha\beta} = \sqrt{-g} g^{\alpha\beta}$ is used in place of
$g^{\alpha\beta}$ as a dynamical variable when $d = 2$, as in $d$ dimensions,
$\det h^{\alpha\beta} = - (\sqrt{-g})^{d-2}$. A comparison with the formalism
used in the ADM analysis of the Einstein-Hilbert action in first order form is

challenges. These models are not translationally invariant, and the absence of
this symmetry complicates both the derivation of a functional recurrence for
the generating function, and solving for it. In this paper we consider a model
of partially directed walks from the origin in the square lattice confined to
both a symmetric wedge defined by $Y = \pm pX$, and an asymmetric wedge defined
by the lines $Y= pX$ and Y=0, where $p > 0$ is an integer. We prove that the
growth constant for all these models is equal to $1+\sqrt{2}$, independent of
the angle of the wedge. We derive functional recursions for both models, and
obtain explicit expressions for the generating functions when $p=1$. From these
we find asymptotic formulas for the number of partially directed paths of
length $n$ in a wedge when $p=1$.
  The functional recurrences are solved by a variation of the kernel method,
which we call the ``iterated kernel method''. This method appears to be similar
to the obstinate kernel method used by Bousquet-Melou. This method requires us
to consider iterated compositions of the roots of the kernel. These
compositions turn out to be surprisingly tractable, and we are able to find
simple explicit expressions for them. However, in spite of this, the generating
functions turn out to be similar in form to Jacobi $\theta$-functions, and have
natural boundaries on the unit circle.

symmetry term of the nuclear Equation of State (EoS) At low energies the
behavior of the symmetry energy around saturation influences dissipation and
fragment production mechanisms. Predictions are shown for deep-inelastic and
fragmentation collisions induced by neutron rich projectiles. Differential flow
measurements will also shed lights on the controversial neutron/proton
effective mass splitting in asymmetric matter. The high density symmetry term
can be derived from isospin effects on heavy ion reactions at relativistic
energies (few AGeV range), that can even allow a ``direct'' study of the
covariant structure of the isovector interaction in the hadron medium. Rather
sensitive observables are proposed from collective flows and from pion/kaon
production. The possibility of the transition to a mixed hadron-quark phase, at
high baryon and isospin density, is finally suggested. Some signatures could

particular what can be learned about collisional broadening by a hot and dense

broadening effects but disfavor mass shift scenarios where the $\rho$-meson

which predict at finite density a dropping of the $\rho$-meson mass that is
stronger than that of the quark condensate are clearly ruled out since they are
also accompanied by a sharpening of the spectral function.

show that, by stirring the mixture at a sufficiently large amplitude, we excite
the diffusion and overwhelm the segregation to create a homogeneous liquid. At
intermediate amplitudes we see regions of bubbles coexisting with regions of
hyperdiffusive filaments. Thus, the problem possesses two dominant length
scales, associated with the bubbles and filaments. For simplicity, we use use a
chaotic flow that mimics turbulent stirring at large Prandtl number. We compare
our results with the case of variable mobility, in which growth of bubble size
is dominated by interfacial rather than bulk effects, and find qualitatively
similar results.
