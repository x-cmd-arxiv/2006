cosmic reionization, which utilizes a N-body algorithm for dark matter,
physically motivated prescriptions for baryons and star formation, and an
adaptive ray tracing algorithm for radiative transfer of ionizing photons. Two
test simulations each with 3 billion particles and 400 million rays in a 50
Mpc/h box have been run to give initial results. Halos are resolved down to
virial temperatures of 10^4 K for the redshift range of interest in order to
robustly model star formation and clumping factors. This is essential to
correctly account for ionization and recombination processes. We find that the
halos and sources are strongly biased with respect to the underlying dark
matter, re-enforcing the requirement of large simulation boxes to minimize
cosmic variance and to obtain a qualitatively correct picture of reionization.
We model the stellar initial mass function (IMF), by following the spatially
dependent gas metallicity evolution, and distinguish between the first
generation, Population III (PopIII) stars and the second generation, Population
II (PopII) stars. The PopIII stars with a top-heavy IMF produce an order of
magnitude more ionizing photons at high redshifts z>10, resulting in a more
extended reionization. In our simulations, complete overlap of HII regions
occurrs at z~6.5 and the computed mass and volume weighted residual HI
fractions at 5<z<6.5 are both in good agreement with high redshift quasar
absorption measurements from SDSS. The values for the Thomson optical depth are
consistent within 1-sigma of the current best-fit value from third-year WMAP.

only to increase to 0.96+-0.21 AA in a later date spectrum. The MgII doublet

being closer to 1:1 (saturated regime) when the lines are stronger and becoming
closer to 2:1 (unsaturated regime) when the lines are weaker, consistent with
expectations based on atomic physics. We have investigated and rejected the
possibility of any instrumental or atmospheric effects causing the observed
strong variations. Our discovery of clearly variable intervening FeII and MgII
lines lends very strong support to their scenario, in which the characteristic
size of intervening patches of MgII ``clouds'' is comparable to the GRB beam

discs orbiting rapidly rotating Kerr black holes with spin a > 0.9953 for
Keplerian discs and a > 0.99979 for marginally stable thick discs. Aschenbach
(2004) has identified the maximal rate of change of the orbital velocity within
the ""humpy"" profile with a locally defined critical frequency of disc
oscillations, but it has been done in a coordinate-dependent form. We define
the critical ""humpy"" frequency H in general relativistic, coordinate
independent form, and relate the frequency defined in the LNRF to distant
observers. At radius of its definition, so-called ""humpy"" radius r_h, the
""humpy"" frequency H is compared to the radial (R) and vertical (V) epicyclic
frequencies and the orbital frequency of the disc. For Keplerian thin discs, we
show that the epicyclic resonance radii r_31 and r_41 (with V:R = 3:1 or 4:1)
are located in vicinity of r_h where efficient triggering of oscillations with
frequencies ~ H could be expected. Asymptotically (for 1-a < 10^(-4)) the ratio
of the epicyclic and Keplerian frequencies and the humpy frequency is nearly
constant, i.e., almost independent of spin, being for the radial epicyclic
frequency R:H ~ 3:2. For thick discs the situation is more complex due to
dependence on distribution of the specific angular momentum l determining the
disc properties. For l = const tori and 1-a < 10^(-6) the frequency ratios of
the humpy frequency and the orbital and epicyclic frequencies are again nearly
constant and independent of both a and l, being for the radial epicyclic
frequency R:H close to 4. In the limiting case of very slender tori (l ~ l_ms)
the epicyclic resonance radius r_41 ~ r_h for spin 1-a < 2x10^(-4).

infer the orbital elements of planets with masses that are too small to detect

show the potential that this planet detection technique has to detect and
characterize secondary planets in transiting systems. These results have
important ramifications for planetary transit searches since each transiting
system presents an opportunity for additional discoveries through a TTV
analysis. I present such an analysis for 13 transits of the HD 209458 system
that were observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. This analysis indicates
that a putative companion in a low-order, mean-motion resonance can be no
larger than the mass of the Earth and constitutes, to date, the most sensitive
probe for extrasolar planets that orbit main sequence stars. The presence or
absence of small planets in low-order, mean-motion resonances has implications
for theories of the formation and evolution of planetary systems. Since TTV is
most sensitive in these regimes, it should prove a valuable tool not only for
the detection of additional planets in transiting systems, but also as a way to
determine the dominant mechanisms of planet formation and the evolution of

between those from the broad and narrow (emission) line regions (BLR and NLR).
We present evidence that these emission lines arise from the same gas
responsible for most of the high-column UV and X-ray absorption (component
``D+E'') that we see in outflow at a distance of ~0.1 pc from the central
nucleus. The gas in this intermediate-line region (ILR) shields the NLR and has
a global covering factor of ~0.4, based on the observed C IV fluxes, indicating
mass outflow over a large solid angle centered on the accretion disk's axis. A
large transverse velocity (> 2100$ km/s) compared to the radial velocity
centroid (-490$ km/s) indicates that the kinematics is dominated by rotation at
this distance, but has a significant outflow component. The mass outflow rate
at 0.1 pc is ~0.16 solar masses/yr, which is about 10 times the accretion rate.
Based on physical conditions in the gas and dynamical considerations, models
that invoke magnetocentrifugal acceleration (e.g., in an accretion-disk wind)
are favored over those that rely on radiation driving or thermal expansion as
the principal driving mechanism for the mass outflow.

observations of silicate features may be correlated with spectral type of the
central star and/or disk geometry. In this paper, we show that grain size, as
probed by the 10 um silicate feature peak-to-continuum and 11.3-to-9.8 um flux
ratios, is inversely proportional to log L_star. These trends can be understood
using a simple two-layer disk model for passive irradiated flaring disks,
CGPLUS. We find that the radius, R_10, of the 10 um silicate emission zone in
the disk goes as (L_star/L_sun)^0.56, with slight variations depending on disk
geometry (flaring angle, inner disk radius). The observed correlations,
combined with simulated emission spectra of olivine and pyroxene mixtures,
imply a grain size dependence on luminosity. Combined with the fact that R_10
is smaller for less luminous stars, this implies that the apparent grain size
of the emitting dust is larger for low-luminositysources. In contrast, our
models suggest that the crystallinity is only marginally affected, because for
increasing luminosity, the zone for thermal annealing (assumed to be at T>800
K) is enlarged by roughly the same factor as the silicate emission zone. The
observed crystallinity is affected by disk geometry, however, with increased
crystallinity in flat disks. The apparent crystallinity may also increase with
grain growth due to a corresponding increase in contrast between crystalline
and amorphous silicate emission bands.

the insufficiency of their fuel supply. Seyferts, which are weakly clustered,

presentation are the outer shock instability and the inner core g-mode
oscillations. The former sets the stage for the latter, which damp by the
generation of sound. This sound propagates outward to energize the explosion
and is relevant only if the core has not exploded earlier by some other means.
Hence, it is a more delayed mechanism than the traditional neutrino mechanism
that has been studied for the last twenty years since it was championed by
Bethe and Wilson. We discuss protoneutron star convection,
accretion-induced-collapse, gravitational wave emissions, pulsar kicks, the
angular anisotropy of the neutrino emissions, a subset of numerical issues, and
a new code we are designing that should supercede our current supernova code

not just in the galactic plane, as expected for WIMP annihilation b) it shows
an interesting substructure in the form of a doughnut shaped ring at 14 kpc
from the centre of the galaxy, where a ring of stars indicated the probable
infall of a dwarf galaxy. From the spectral shape of the excess the WIMP mass
is estimated to be between 50 and 100 GeV, while from the intensity the halo
profile is reconstructed, which is shown to explain the peculiar change of
slope in the rotation curve at about 11 kpc (due to the ring of DM at 14 kpc).
  Recently it was claimed by Bergstrom et al. that the DM interpretation of the
EGRET gamma ray excess is excluded by the antiproton fluxes, since in their
propagation model with isotropic diffusion the flux of antiprotons would be far
beyond the observed flux. However, the propagation can be largely anisotropic,
because of the convection of particles perpendicular to the disc and
inhomogeneities in the local environment. It is shown that anisotropic
propagation can reduce the antiproton yield by an order of magnitude, while
still being consistent with the B/C ratio.
  Therefore it is hard to use antiprotons to search for {\it light} DM
particles, which yield a similar antiproton spectrum as the background, but the
antiprotons are a perfect means to tune the many degenerate parameters in the
propagation models.

extremely rare events implicating cells of up to n=1600 sides embedded in an

expected to proceed via a two-stage process. When the Kondo temperatures of
each channel are widely separated, on cooling, the dot passes through a broad
cross-over regime dominated by underscreened Kondo physics. A singular, or
non-fermi liquid correction to the conductance develops in this regime. At the
lowest temperatures, destructive interference between resonant scattering in
both channels leads to the eventual suppression of the conductance of the dot.
We develop a model to describe the growth, and ultimate suppression of the

its two channels. Our model is based upon large-N approximation in which the
localized spin degrees of freedom are described using the Schwinger boson

core of algebraic signal processing is the concept of a linear signal model
defined as a triple (A, M, phi), where familiar concepts like the filter space
and the signal space are cast as an algebra A and a module M, respectively, and
phi generalizes the concept of the z-transform to bijective linear mappings
from a vector space of, e.g., signal samples, into the module M. A signal model
provides the structure for a particular linear signal processing application,
such as infinite and finite discrete time, or infinite or finite discrete
space, or the various forms of multidimensional linear signal processing. As
soon as a signal model is chosen, basic ingredients follow, including the
associated notions of filtering, spectrum, and Fourier transform. The shift
operator is a key concept in the algebraic theory: it is the generator of the
algebra of filters A. Once the shift is chosen, a well-defined methodology
leads to the associated signal model. Different shifts correspond to infinite
and finite time models with associated infinite and finite z-transforms, and to
infinite and finite space models with associated infinite and finite
C-transforms (that we introduce). In particular, we show that the 16 discrete
cosine and sine transforms are Fourier transforms for the finite space models.
Other definitions of the shift naturally lead to new signal models and to new
transforms as associated Fourier transforms in one and higher dimensions,
separable and non-separable. We explain in algebraic terms shift-invariance
(the algebra of filters A is commutative), the role of boundary conditions and
signal extensions, the connections between linear transforms and linear finite
Gauss-Markov fields, and several other concepts and connections.

Applying the formalism of variational integrators (discrete Lagrangian systems)
with nonholonomic constraints and introducing suitable discrete constraints, we
construct a discretization of the n-dimensional generalization of the Chaplygin
sphere problem, which preserves the same first integrals as the continuous
model, except the energy. We then study the discretization of the classical
3-dimensional problem for a class of special initial conditions, when an analog
of the energy integral does exist and the corresponding map is given by an
addition law on elliptic curves. The existence of the invariant measure in this

study of how theoretical physics reacts to experimental findings that are
incompatible with established theoretical notions. One such notion that is
discussed is the model of electric conductivity implied by Drude's electron
theory of metals, and the derivation of the Wiedemann-Franz law within this
framework. After summarizing the experimental knowledge on superconductivity
around 1920, the topic is then discussed both on a phenomenological level in
terms of implications of Maxwell's equations for the case of infinite
conductivity, and on a microscopic level in terms of suggested models for
superconductive charge transport. Analyzing Einstein's manuscripts and
correspondence as well as his own 1922 paper on the subject, it is shown that
Einstein had a sustained interest in superconductivity and was well informed
about the phenomenon. It is argued that his appointment as special professor in
Leiden in 1920 was motivated to a considerable extent by his perception as a
leading theoretician of quantum theory and condensed matter physics and the
hope that he would contribute to the theoretical direction of the experiments
done at Kamerlingh Onnes' cryogenic laboratory. Einstein tried to lived up to
these expectations by proposing at least three experiments on the phenomenon,
one of which was carried out twice in Leiden. Compared to other theoretical
proposals at the time, the prominent role of quantum concepts was
characteristic of Einstein's understanding of the phenomenon. The paper
concludes with comments on Einstein's epistemological reflections on the
problem.
