with an extra component of z>8 sources with a IRB contribution around 0.4 nW

that expected for unresolved, faint galaxies at lower redshifts with Vega
magnitudes fainter than 23 with a total 3.6 micron intensity between 0.1 to 0.8

decreases rapidly when the unresolved clustering spectrum is measured from a

optical colors and photometric redshifts of galaxies that are selected using
common color selection techniques, including distant red galaxies (DRGs),
star-forming and passive BzKs, and the rest-frame UV-selected BM, BX, and Lyman
break galaxies (LBGs). These techniques are effective at isolating large
samples of high redshift galaxies, but none provide complete or uniform samples
across the targeted redshift ranges. The DRG and BM/BX/LBG criteria identify
populations of red and blue galaxies, respectively, as they were designed to
do. The star-forming BzKs have a very wide redshift distribution, a wide range
of colors, and may include galaxies with very low specific star formation
rates. In comparison, the passive BzKs are fewer in number, have a different
distribution of K magnitudes, and have a somewhat different redshift
distribution. By combining these color selection criteria, it appears possible
to define a reasonably complete sample of galaxies to our flux limit over
specific redshift ranges. However, the redshift dependence of both the
completeness and sampled range of rest-frame colors poses an ultimate limit to
the usefulness of these techniques.

have a longer timescale than typical lifetime of molecular clouds. Another
possible reason is mass loss in very beginning of cluster evolution in the form

unprecedented look at the spectral and temporal evolution of the prompt and

characteristic of a shot-noise process, with individual shots well-modelled by
a fast-rise and exponential decay spanning a broad range in rise-times and

the photon index and source intensity are highly correlated with the spectrum
being significantly harder when brighter, consistent with the movement of the

dense disk with hyperaccretion onto a few solar-mass black hole. We investigate
where the magnetorotational instability (MRI) actively operates in the
hyperaccretion disk, which can cause angular momentum transport in the disk.
The inner region of hyperaccretion disks can be neutrino opaque, and the
energy- and momentum-transport by neutrinos could affect the growth of the MRI
significantly. Assuming reasonable disk models and a weak magnetic field $B
\lesssim 10^{14} \rm{G}$, it is found that the MRI is strongly suppressed by
the neutrino viscosity in the inner region of hyperaccretion disks. On the
other hand, the MRI can drive active MHD turbulence in the outer
neutrino-transparent region regardless of the field strength. This suggests
that the baryonic matter is accumulated into the inner dead zone where the MRI
grows inactively and the angular momentum transport is inefficient. When the
dead zone gains a large amount of mass and becomes gravitationally unstable,
intense mass accretion onto the central black hole would occur episodically
through the gravitational torque. This process can be a physical mechanism of
the short-term variability in the prompt emission of GRBs. Finally, the origin
of flaring activities in the X-ray afterglow is predicted in the context of our
episodic accretion scenario.

intrinsic dispersion of less than 7% in distance. The Hubble flow sample, which
is of critical importance to all cosmological uses of SN Ia, is the largest
ever presented with homogeneous distances. We find the Hubble flow supernovae
with Hd >= 7400 km/s yield an expansion rate that is 6.5 +/- 1.8% lower than
the rate determined from supernovae within that distance, and this can have a
large effect on measurements of the dark energy equation of state with SN Ia.

unique possibilities for probing the Dark Matter and Dark Energy in the
Universe. In this review, we summarise the theoretical and observational state
of the subject, focussing on the statistical aspects of weak lensing, and
consider the prospects for weak lensing surveys in the future. Weak
gravitational lensing surveys are complementary to both galaxy surveys and
cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations as they probe the unbiased
non-linear matter power spectrum at modest redshifts. Most of the cosmological
parameters are accurately estimated from CMB and large-scale galaxy surveys, so
the focus of attention is shifting to understanding the nature of Dark Matter
and Dark Energy. On the theoretical side, recent advances in the use of 3D
information of the sources from photometric redshifts promise greater
statistical power, and these are further enhanced by the use of statistics
beyond two-point quantities such as the power spectrum. The use of 3D
information also alleviates difficulties arising from physical effects such as
the intrinsic alignment of galaxies, which can mimic weak lensing to some
extent. (Abridged)

attains maximum strength in the mid-L dwarfs, while H2O absorption becomes
systematically stronger towards later spectral types. Narrow resolved features
broaden markedly after the M to L transition. Our high resolution spectra also
reveal that the disappearance of neutral Al lines at the boundary between M and
L dwarfs is remarkably abrupt, presumably because of the formation of grains.
Neutral Fe lines can be traced to mid-L dwarfs before Fe is removed by
condensation. The neutral potassium (K I) doublets that dominate the J-band
have pressure broadened wings that continue to broaden from ~50 km/s (FWHM) at

various mixtures. Masses ranging from 0.01 Earth masses to 10 Jupiter masses at

planets, our models are the first to couple planetary evolution to stellar
irradiation over a wide range of orbital separations (0.02 to 10 AU) through a
non-gray radiative-convective equilibrium atmosphere model. Stellar irradiation
retards the contraction of giant planets, but its effect is not a simple
function of the irradiation level: a planet at 1 AU contracts as slowly as a
planet at 0.1 AU. For hydrogen-helium planets, we consider cores up to 90% of
the total planet mass, comparable to those of Uranus and Neptune. If ""hot
Neptunes"" have maintained their original masses and are not remnants of more
massive planets, radii of 0.30-0.45 times Jupiter's radius are expected. Water
planets are ~40-50% larger than rocky planets, independent of mass. Finally, we
provide tables of planetary radii at various ages and compositions, and for
ice-rock-iron planets we fit our results to analytic functions, which will
allow for quick composition estimates, given masses and radii, or mass
estimates, given only planetary radii. These results will assist in the
interpretation of observations for both the current transiting planet surveys

Sun. With a mass of about 8 Msun, the travel time from the Galactic centre is
of about 100 Myr, much longer than its main sequence lifetime. Given the
relatively small distance to the LMC (18 kpc), we consider it likely that
HE0437-5439 originated in the cloud rather than in the Galactic centre, like
the other hypervelocity stars. The minimum ejection velocity required to travel

Such a high velocity can only be obtained in a dynamical encounter with a

binary encounters a massive black hole and find that a black hole more massive

investigate this by means of highly resolved, numerical simulations of initial
magnetized Bonnor-Ebert-Spheres that undergo collapse and cooling. By comparing
three different cases - an isothermal collapse, a collapse with radiative
cooling, and a magnetized collapse - we show that massive stars assemble
quickly with mass accretion rates exceeding 10^-3 Msol/yr. We confirm that the
mass accretion during the collapsing phase is much more efficient than
predicted by selfsimilar collapse solutions, i.e. dM/dt ~ c^3/G. We find that
during protostellar assembly the mass accretion reaches 20 - 100 c^3/G.
Furthermore, we determined the self-consistent structure of bipolar outflows
that are produced in our three dimensional magnetized collapse simulations.
These outflows produce cavities out of which radiation pressure can be
released, thereby reducing the limitations on the final mass of massive stars
formed by gravitational collapse. Moreover, we argue that the extraction of
angular momentum by disk-threaded magnetic fields and/or by the appearance of
bars with spiral arms significantly enhance the mass accretion rate, thereby
helping the massive protostar to assemble more quickly.

of the Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) HB3 (G132.7+1.3). Published
observations have revealed that a curvature is present in the radio spectrum of
this SNR, indicating that a single synchrotron component appears is
insufficient to adequately fit the spectrum. We present here a fit to this
spectrum using a combination of a synchrotron component and a thermal
bremsstrahlung component. We discuss properties of this latter component and
estimate the ambient density implied by the presence of this component to be n
\~ 10 cm^-3. We have also analyzed extracted X-ray spectra from archived {\it
ASCA} GIS observations of different regions of HB3 to obtain independent
estimates of the density of the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). From
this analysis, we have derived electron densities of 0.1-0.4 f^-1/2 cm^-3 for
the ISM for the three different regions of the SNR, where f is the volume
filling factor. By comparing these density estimates with the estimate derived
from the thermal bremsstrahlung component, we argue that the radio thermal
bremsstrahlung emission is emitted from a thin shell enclosing HB3. The
presence of this thermal bremsstrahlung component in the radio spectrum of HB3
suggests that this SNR is in fact interacting with an adjacent molecular cloud
associated with the HII region W3. By extension, we argue that the presence of
thermal emission at radio wavelengths may be a useful tool for identifying
interactions between SNRs and molecular clouds, and for estimating the ambient
density near SNRs using radio continuum data.

provide a unifying scheme involving one- dimensional orbital wave ordering

thus both the amplitude and phase of the orbital wave play important roles.

for developing the general behavior for such orbital wave ordering. Ordered
AlV2O4 will be seen to organize into three equivalent chains in 2D Kagome
planes coupled so as to form units of three dimer bonds. Three additional

While these problems have been studied in detail for desktop filesystem
workloads, this study examines newer systems such as scalable object stores and
multimedia repositories. Such systems use a get/put interface to store objects.
In principle, databases and filesystems can support such applications
efficiently, allowing system designers to focus on complexity, deployment cost
and manageability. Although theoretical work proves that certain storage
policies behave optimally for some workloads, these policies often behave
poorly in practice. Most storage benchmarks focus on short-term behavior or do
not measure fragmentation. We compare SQL Server to NTFS and find that
fragmentation dominates performance when object sizes exceed 256KB-1MB. NTFS
handles fragmentation better than SQL Server. Although the performance curves
will vary with other systems and workloads, we expect the same interactions
between fragmentation and free space to apply. It is well-known that
fragmentation is related to the percentage free space. We found that the ratio
of free space to object size also impacts performance. Surprisingly, in both
systems, storing objects of a single size causes fragmentation, and changing
the size of write requests affects fragmentation. These problems could be
addressed with simple changes to the filesystem and database interfaces. It is
our hope that an improved understanding of fragmentation will lead to
predictable storage systems that require less maintenance after deployment.

under a complexity-theoretically motivated type system. The programming
formalism, ATR, has its first-order programs characterize the polynomial-time
computable functions, and its second-order programs characterize the type-2
basic feasible functionals of Mehlhorn and of Cook and Urquhart. (The ATR-types
are confined to levels 0, 1, and 2.) The type system comes in two parts, one
that primarily restricts the sizes of values of expressions and a second that
primarily restricts the time required to evaluate expressions. The
size-restricted part is motivated by Bellantoni and Cook's and Leivant's
implicit characterizations of polynomial-time. The time-restricting part is an
affine version of Barber and Plotkin's DILL. Two semantics are constructed for
ATR. The first is a pruning of the naive denotational semantics for ATR. This
pruning removes certain functions that cause otherwise feasible forms of
recursion to go wrong. The second semantics is a model for ATR's time
complexity relative to a certain abstract machine. This model provides a
setting for complexity recurrences arising from ATR recursions, the solutions
of which yield second-order polynomial time bounds. The time-complexity
semantics is also shown to be sound relative to the costs of interpretation on
the abstract machine.

the student only uses examples from the moving teacher. However, the

in large networks where users contact each other in a random uncoordinated
manner, and users upload one piece per unit time. The underlying motivation is
the design and analysis of piece selection protocols for peer-to-peer networks
which disseminate files by dividing them into pieces. We first investigate
one-sided protocols, where piece selection is based on the states of either the
transmitter or the receiver. We show that any such protocol relying only on
pushes, or alternatively only on pulls, is inefficient in disseminating all
pieces to all users. We propose a hybrid one-sided piece selection protocol --
INTERLEAVE -- and show that by using both pushes and pulls it disseminates $k$
pieces from a single source to $n$ users in $10(k+\log n)$ time, while obeying
the constraint that each user can upload at most one piece in one unit of time,
with high probability for large $n$. An optimal, unrealistic centralized
protocol would take $k+\log_2 n$ time in this setting. Moreover, efficient
dissemination is also possible if the source implements forward erasure coding,
and users push the latest-released coded pieces (but do not pull). We also
investigate two-sided protocols where piece selection is based on the states of
both the transmitter and the receiver. We show that it is possible to
disseminate $n$ pieces to $n$ users in $n+O(\log n)$ time, starting from an
initial state where each user has a unique piece.

the assignment of suitable transmission powers to wireless devices/stations
such that the resulting communication graph satisfies certain desired

of the stations such that all other stations are within reach of at least one
of the selected stations. We improve the running time for obtaining a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate solution for this problem from

Rayleigh fading amplify-and-forward MIMO relay channel without direct link
between source and destination are derived in the large array limit. The
analysis is based on the replica trick and covers both spatially independent
and correlated fading in the first and the second hop, while beamforming at all
terminals is restricted to deterministic weight matrices. Expressions for mean
and variance of the mutual information are obtained. Their parameters are
determined by a nonlinear equation system. All higher cumulants are shown to
vanish as the number of antennas n goes to infinity. In conclusion the
distribution of the mutual information I becomes Gaussian in the large n limit
and is completely characterized by the expressions obtained for mean and
variance of I. Comparisons with simulation results show that the asymptotic
results serve as excellent approximations for systems with only few antennas at
each node. The derivation of the results follows the technique formalized by
Moustakas et al. in [1]. Although the evaluations are more involved for the
MIMO relay channel compared to point-to-point MIMO channels, the structure of
the results is surprisingly simple again. In particular an elegant formula for
the mean of the mutual information is obtained, i.e., the ergodic capacity of
the two-hop amplify-and-forward MIMO relay channel without direct link.

superpartner masses and couplings will allow us to probe the origins of
supersymmetry breaking. However, to connect the collider-scale Lagrangian soft
parameters to the more fundamental theory from which they arise, it is usually
necessary to evolve them to higher scales. The apparent unification of gauge
couplings restricts the possible forms of new physics above the electroweak
scale, and suggests that such an extrapolation is possible. Even so, this task
is complicated if the low scale spectrum is not measured completely or
precisely, or if there is new physics at heavy scales beyond the reach of
collider experiments. In this work we study some of these obstacles to running
up, and we investigate how to get around them. Our main conclusion is that even
though such obstacles can make it very difficult to accurately determine the
values of all the soft parameters at the high scale, there exist a number of
special combinations of the soft parameters that can avoid these difficulties.

masses can be a consequence of the peculiar way they are generated through a
see-saw mechanism, determining 1) How the present experimental data restrict
the structure of the high-energy seesaw parameters and 2) Which choices, among
the allowed ones, produce more naturally the observed pattern of neutrino
masses. We have studied in particular if starting with hierarchical neutrino
Yukawa couplings, as for the other fermions, one can naturally get the observed
h~ 6 ratio. To perform the analysis we have put forward a top-down
parametrization of the see-saw mechanism in terms of (high-energy)
basis-independent quantities. Among the main results, we find that in most
cases m_2/m_1 >> m_3/m_2, so m_1 should be extremely tiny. Also, the V_R matrix
associated to the neutrino Yukawa couplings has a far from random structure,
naturally resembling V_CKM. In fact we show that identifying V_R and V_CKM, as

signatures related to the unknown neutrino parameters. As one of the
determinants in dictating the efficiency of resonant flavor conversion, the
local density profile near the MSW resonance in a supernova environment is,
however, not so well understood. In this analysis, variable power-law functions
are adopted to represent the independent local density profiles near the
locations of resonance. It is shown that the uncertain matter density profile
in a supernova, the possible neutrino mass hierarchies, and the undetermined
1-3 mixing angle would result in six distinct scenarios in terms of the
survival probabilities of $\nu_{e}$ and $\bar{\nu_{e}}$. The feasibility of
probing the undetermined neutrino mass hierarchy and the 1-3 mixing angle with
the supernova neutrinos is then examined using several proposed experimental
observables. Given the incomplete knowledge of the supernova matter profile,
the analysis is further expanded to incorporate the Earth matter effect. The
possible impact due to the choice of models, which differ in the average energy
and in the luminosity of neutrinos, is also addressed in the analysis.

model with T-parity (LHT) not only predicts a set of new fermions in addition
to the heavy gauge bosons of the original Little Higgs model, but also provides
a new candidate for dark matter. In this paper, we study two particularly

with boundaries. We consider the concrete case of a scalar field propagating on
R_+ x R^{D-1} which leads us to study the associated heat kernel through a one
dimensional (worldline) path integral. To calculate the latter we map it onto
an auxiliary path integral on the full R^D using an image charge. The main
technical difficulty lies in the fact that a smooth potential on R_+ x R^{D-1}
extends to a potential which generically fails to be smooth on R^D. This
implies that standard perturbative methods fail and must be improved. We
propose a method to deal with this situation. As a result we recover the known
heat kernel coefficients on a flat manifold with geodesic boundary, and compute
two additional ones, A_3 and A_{7/2}. The calculation becomes sensibly harder
as the perturbative order increases, and we are able to identify the complete
A_{7/2} with the help of a suitable toy model. Our findings show that the
worldline approach is viable on manifolds with boundaries. Certainly, it would
be desirable to improve our method of implementing the worldline approach to
further simplify the perturbative calculations that arise in the presence of
non-smooth potentials.

logarithmically with the spin. Recent multi-loop QCD calculations of twist-two
anomalous dimensions revealed the existence of interesting structure of the
subleading corrections suppressed by powers of the Lorentz spin. We argue that
this structure is a manifestation of the `self-tuning' property of the
multi-loop anomalous dimensions - in a conformal gauge theory, the anomalous
dimension of Wilson operators is a function of their conformal spin which is
modified in higher loops by an amount proportional to the anomalous dimension.
Making use of the parity property of this function and incorporating the
beta-function contribution, we demonstrate the existence of (infinite number
of) relations between subleading corrections to the twist-two anomalous
dimensions in QCD and its supersymmetric extensions. They imply that the
subleading corrections to the anomalous dimensions suppressed by odd powers of
the conformal spin can be expressed in terms of the lower-loops corrections
suppressed by smaller even powers of the spin. We show that these relations
hold true in QCD to all loops in the large beta0 limit. In the N=4 SYM theory,
we employ the AdS/CFT correspondence to argue that the same relations survive
in the strong coupling regime for higher-twist scalar operators dual to a
folded string rotating on the AdS3xS1.

second-order partial differential operators on $L_2(\Ri^d)$. First, if $m \in

that $D(H^\alpha) \subseteq D(\Delta^{\alpha \gamma})$ for all $\alpha \in

estimate \[ c \|(I+H)^\alpha \phi\|_2\geq \|\Delta^{\alpha \gamma} \phi\|_2 \]
is valid for all $\phi\in D(H^\alpha)$ where $H$ denotes the self-adjoint
closure of $H_0$. In particular, if the coefficients of $H_0$ are in

are vector fields on $\Ri^d$ with coefficients in $C_b^\infty(\Ri^d)$
satisfying a uniform version of H\""ormander's criterion for hypoellipticity,
then $H_0$ satisfies the subellipticity condition for $\gamma=r^{-1}$ where $r$

data-driven selection of a linear model ${\mathcal{S}}$, among a given

climate models (RCMs) nested into the same run of the same Atmospheric Global
Circulation Model (AGCM) regarding their representation of the statistical
properties of the hydrological balance of the Danube river basin for 1961-1990.
We also consider the datasets produced by the driving AGCM, from the ECMWF and
NCEP-NCAR reanalyses. The hydrological balance is computed by integrating the
precipitation and evaporation fields over the area of interest. Large
discrepancies exist among RCMs for the monthly climatology as well as for the
mean and variability of the annual balances, and only few datasets are
consistent with the observed discharge values of the Danube at its Delta, even
if the driving AGCM provides itself an excellent estimate. Since the considered
approach relies on the mass conservation principle and bypasses the details of
the air-land interface modeling, we propose that the atmospheric components of
RCMs still face difficulties in representing the water balance even on a
relatively large scale. Their reliability on smaller river basins may be even
more problematic. Moreover, since for some models the hydrological balance
estimates obtained with the runoff fields do not agree with those obtained via
precipitation and evaporation, some deficiencies of the land models are also
apparent. NCEP-NCAR and ERA-40 reanalyses result to be largely inadequate for
representing the hydrology of the Danube river basin, both for the
reconstruction of the long-term averages and of the seasonal cycle, and cannot
in any sense be used as verification. We suggest that these results should be
carefully considered in the perspective of auditing climate models and
assessing their ability to simulate future climate changes.

fairly accurately reproduced some experimental denaturation curves and the

attainable by the network in the context of an analytic model of particle

constrained to low molecule numbers and reasonable response times, can
transduce more information than a simple binary switch and, in fact, manages to
achieve close to the optimal information transmission fidelity. These
high-information solutions are robust to tenfold changes in most of the

networks containing cycles with an odd number of negative regulators (overall
negative feedback) due to their decreased molecular noise (a result which we
derive analytically). Finally, we demonstrate that a single circuit can support

for the successful performance of physiological roles expected of the family.
This presents a unique problem: there must be preservation of the active site;
simultaneously there should be specificity of protein action according to
subfamily. Though the classification into subfamilies is by no means a
formalized one, it is most times based on the character of regulation of the
primary function. The function of a subfamily is a modification of when the
protein performs its function, for example, by changing the protein's
sensitivity to regulatory factors. Rarely, a subfamily possesses a function
completely different for its family. A study of these details is necessary for
understanding the fine-tuning of protein function. I describe a theory for

light-directed in situ synthesis we fabricate DNA microarrays with
comprehensive sets of cognate point-mutated probes, allowing us to

influential factor. This positional effect which is almost identical for the
different point-mutation types, is biased from the local sequence environment.
The impact of the MM type is largely determined by the type of base pair
(either AT or CG) affected by the mismatch. We observe that single base
insertions next to like-bases result in considerably larger hybridization
signals than insertions next to nonidentical bases. The latter as well as the
