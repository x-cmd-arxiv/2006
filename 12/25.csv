to date. However, successful reverberation mapping has yet to be performed for
quasars of either high luminosity (above L_opt~10^{46} erg/s) or high redshift
(z>0.3). Over the past six years, we have carried out, at the Hobby-Eberly
Telescope, rest-frame-ultraviolet spectrophotometric monitoring of a sample of
six quasars at redshifts z=2.2--3.2, with luminosities of
L_opt~10^{46.4}--10^{47.6} erg/s, an order of magnitude greater than those of
previously mapped quasars. The six quasars, together with an additional five
having similar redshift and luminosity properties, were monitored
photometrically at the Wise Observatory during the past decade. All 11 quasars
monitored show significant continuum variations of order 10%--70%. This is
about a factor of two smaller variability than for lower luminosity quasars
monitored over the same rest-frame period. In the six objects which have been
spectrophotometrically monitored, significant variability is detected in the
CIV1550 broad emission line. In several cases the variations track the
continuum variations in the same quasar, with amplitudes comparable to, or even
greater than, those of the corresponding continua. In contrast, no significant
Ly\alpha variability is detected in any of the four objects in which it was
observed. Thus, UV lines may have different variability trends in
high-luminosity and low-luminosity AGNs. For one quasar, S5~0836+71 at z=2.172,
we measure a tentative delay of 595 days between CIV and UV-continuum
variations, corresponding to a rest-frame delay of 188 days and a central
black-hole mass of 2.6\times10^9 M_\odot.

Space Telescope (HST), Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and Galaxy Evolution Explorer;
the mid-infrared images from Spitzer Space Telescope; and the narrow-band Ha
image and optical spectra from the NAOC 2.16m telescope. Based on the HST

a complex of five young massive star clusters, within a region of ~ 0.95""
radius (127pc) in size. The ages and masses of the star clusters in this
complex and other regions were estimated using HST broadband photometries and
the Starburst99 synthesis models. The star clusters in this complex are very
young (within ages of ~ 3-5 Myr) and massive (masses of ~ 10^5 Msun). The
ionization parameter and metallicity of the complex were estimated using the
emission line ratios, and the star formation rates were calculated using
monochromatic 24um, FUV, and Ha line luminosities. We speculate that ARP 24 may
formed by a retrograde fly-by encounter indicated by its one-armed appearance
and fan-like structure, and the formation of the YSCs in this galaxy is
triggered by the interaction. The clusters in the YSC complex may formed in a
single giant molecular cloud simultaneously. From the ultraviolet to
mid-infrared spectral energy distributions, we found that the region of the YSC
complex is relatively bluer in optical and has higher 24um dust emission
relative to the starlight and 8um emission. This warm infrared color may due to
strong UV radiation field or other mechanisms (e.g., shocks) within this region
which may destroy the Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and enhance the small
grain emission at 24um.

noise of index $\alpha$ and intensity $DD for three different generic types of

truncated harmonic potential. For the low noise intensity regime we recover the
previously proposed algebraic dependence on $D$ of the characteristic escape
time, $T_{\mathrm{esc}}\simeq C(\alpha)/D^{\mu(\alpha)}$, where $C(\alpha)$ is
a coefficient. It is shown that the exponent $\mu(\alpha)$ remains
approximately constant, $\mu\approx 1$ for $0<\alpha<2$; at $\alpha=2$ the
power-law form of $T_{\mathrm{esc}}$ changes into the known exponential
dependence on 1/D; it exhibits a divergence-like behavior as $\alpha$
approaches 2. In this regime we observe a monotonous increase of the escape
time $T_{\mathrm{esc}}$ with increasing $\alpha$ (keeping the noise intensity
$D$ constant). The probability density of the escape time decays exponentially.
In addition, for low noise intensities the escape times correspond to barrier
crossing by multiple Levy steps. For high noise intensities, the escape time
curves collapse for all values of $\alpha$. At intermediate noise intensities,
the escape time exhibits non-monotonic dependence on the index $\alpha$, while
still retaining the exponential form of the escape time density.

to describe the dynamics of the boundaries of voids or cracks in such systems
when they are subjected to remote, time-dependent tractions. The theory is
illustrated here for the case of a circular hole in an infinite two-dimensional
plate, a highly symmetric situation that allows us to solve much of the problem
analytically. In spite of its special symmetry, this example contains many
general features of systems in which stress is concentrated near free
boundaries and deforms them irreversibly. We depart from conventional
treatments of such problems in two ways. First, the STZ analysis allows us to
keep track of spatially heterogeneous, internal state variables such as the
effective disorder temperature, which determines plastic response to subsequent
loading. Second, we subject the system to stress pulses of finite duration, and
therefore are able to observe elasto-plastic response during both loading and
unloading. We compute the final deformations and residual stresses produced by
these stress pulses. Looking toward more general applications of these results,
we examine the possibility of constructing a boundary-layer theory that might
be useful in less symmetric situations.

RG effects in the SM, and in the MSSM with small $\tan \beta$. The usual
constraints on neutrino masses, Majorana phases or $\tan \beta$ stemming from
RG running arguments can then be relaxed. We quantify the extent of Planck
effects on the mixing angles in terms of ""mismatch phases"" which break the
symmetries leading to TBM. In particular, we show that when the mismatch phases
vanish, the mixing angles are not affected in spite of the Planck scale
contribution. Similar statements may be made for $\mu$-$\tau$ symmetric mass
matrices.

is found to be very active in improving the performance of existing detectors,
and in preparation for the development coming in the near future. The former
includes excellent performance of SNO 3He detector, successful reconstruction
of SK III, and KamLAND's new ``4pi'' calibration. The next data release from
these experiments will be very exciting. The latter includes effort for
lowering threshold in SK III, KamLAND's purification by which geo-neutrino
observation becomes much cleaner, and the forthcoming 7Be neutrino measurement
by BOREXINO and KamLAND. Possible detection of relic supernova neutrinos and
non-zero effect of theta_{13} would bring us great excitement. Furthermore,
improved new measurement of heavy element abundance in the solar atmosphere
resulted in a solar model with much lower CNO \nu flux and with disagreement
with helioseismology, thereby bringing us a new solar puzzle.

descriptions of chiral medium. After analyzing several possible reasons for the
traditional restriction, we show that strong chirality parameter leads to
positive energy without any frequency-band limitation in the weak spatial
dispersion. Moreover, strong chirality does not result in a strong spatial
dispersion, which occurs only around the traditional limit point. For strong
spatial dispersion where higher-order terms of spatial dispersion need to be
considered, the energy conversation is also valid. Finally, we show that strong
chirality need to be realized from the conjugated type of spatial dispersion.

show that our attack is more effective than the individual attack, which had
been the best attack up to present. As a result of this, the recent experiment
with communication distance of 100km reported by Diamanti et al. turns out to
be insecure. Moreover it can be shown that in a practical experimental setup
