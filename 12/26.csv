dynamics due to the strong interaction between the normal modes of a magnetar's
crust and a continuum of Magneto-Hydro-Dynamic (MHD) modes in its fluid core.
We study the dynamics using a simple model of a magnetar possessing a uniform
magnetic field and a thin spherical crust. Firstly, we show that global
torsional modes only exist when one introduces unphysically large dissipative
terms into the equations of motion; thus global modes are not helpful for
understanding the magnetar Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs). Secondly, we
solve the initial-value problem by simulating the sudden release of an
initially strained crust and monitoring the subsequent crustal motion. We find
that the crustal torsional modes quickly exchange their energy with the MHD
continuum in the core, and decay by several orders of magnitude over the course
of about 10 oscillation periods. After the initial rapid decay, the crustal
motion is stabilized and several time-varying QPOs are observed. The dynamical
spectrum of the simulated crustal motion is in qualitative agreement with that
of the x-ray light-curve in the tail of a giant magnetar flare. The asymptotic
frequencies of some of the QPOs are associated with the special spectral
points--the turning points or edges--of the MHD continuum, and are not related
to those of the crust. The observed steady low-frequency QPO at 18 Hz is almost
certainly associated with the lowest frequency of the MHD continuum, or its
first overtone. We also find that drifting QPOs get amplified when they come
near the frequencies of the crustal modes. This explains why some of the
observed QPOs have frequencies close to the expected crustal frequencies, and
why these QPOs are highly variable with time.

thermal conductivity and specific heat strongly depend on x. Upon increasing x
from 0 to 30, the lattice parameter increases by 3%, from 10.446 to 10.726 A,

decreases and disappears for x > 20, evolving into the anomalous glass-like

model relates relaxation to a hierarchical sequence of excitation events each
involving the probability of accumulating sufficient kinetic energy on a
separate excitable unit. Super-Arrhenius behavior of the relaxation rates, and
the known correlation of kinetic with thermodynamic fragility, both follow from
the way the rugged landscape induces fluctuations in the partitioning of energy
between vibrational and configurational manifolds. A relation is derived in
which the configurational heat capacity, rather than the configurational
entropy of the Adam Gibbs equation, controls the temperature dependence of the
relaxation times, and this gives a comparable account of the experimental

the eternally inflating universe, the main question in this context is to
obtain statistical predictions for quantities observed at a random location. I
describe the problems arising within this statistical framework, such as the
need for a volume cutoff and the dependence of cutoff schemes on time slicing
and on the initial conditions. After reviewing different approaches and
mathematical techniques developed in the past two decades for studying these
issues, I discuss the existing proposals for extracting predictions and give
examples of their applications.

there exist families of future-directed non-spacelike curves which also

experiments were performed in ceramic wall capillary discharges at currents of
up to 120 kA, with an available ID of between 3 and 8 mm and with lengths from
60 to 100 mm. Initial plasma conditions in the capillary exploit transient
hollow cathode effects in a preionizing discharge. A laser focussed onto the
back surface of the cathode initiates both beam activity in the capillary
volume and plasma injection. To promote metal ablation into the pinch channel
of elements other than the ceramic wall material, a number of graded ring
schemes have been tried. The plasma is observed axially using both time and
energy resolved soft X-ray pin hole images as well as from time resolved soft
X-ray spectra. By varying the rate of rise of the current of the main
discharge, and the preionizing conditions the diameter and the stability of the
Z-pinch column are seen to be affected. The ratio of the species from the
ablated wall material to the plasma formed from the graded ring structure is
found to depend both on the capillary dimensions as well as the other operating
conditions.

a classic package model in which distinct information carriers or templates are

binary division. The combined dynamics of vesicles and templates is described
by a multitype branching process which allows us to write equations for the
average number of the different types of vesicles as well as for their
extinction probabilities. The threshold phenomenon associated to the extinction
of the vesicle population is studied quantitatively using finite-size scaling
techniques. We conclude that the resultant coexistence is too frail in the
