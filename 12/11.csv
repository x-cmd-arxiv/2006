just over half of the sources we find that these spectra and other properties

interacting with their pre-explosion stellar wind. The rate of appearance of
new radio sources identified with these supernova events suggests that an
unusually large fraction of core collapse supernovae in Arp 220 are highly
luminous; possibly implying a radically different stellar initial mass function
or stellar evolution compared to galactic disks. Another possible explanation
invokes very short (~3 x 10^5 year) intense (~10^3 M_Sol year^-1) star
formation episodes with a duty cycle of ~10%. A second group of our detected
sources, consisting of the brightest and longest monitored sources at 18 cm do
not easily fit the radio supernova model. These sources show a range of
spectral indexes from -0.2 to -1.9. We propose that these are young supernova
remnants which have just begun interacting with a surrounding ISM with a
density between 10^4 and 10^5 cm^-3. One of these sources is probably resolved
at 3.6 cm wavelength with a diameter 0.9 pc. In the western nucleus we estimate
that the ionized component of the ISM gives rise to foreground free-free
absorption with opacity at 18 cm of <0.6 along the majority of lines of sight.
Other sources may be affected by absorption with opacity in the range 1 to 2.
These values are consistent with previous models as fitted to the radio
recombination lines and the continuum spectrum.

independently from evolutionary models. We use the adaptive optics
integral-field spectrograph SINFONI at the VLT for near-infrared spectroscopy
from 1.1 to 2.5 um with a resolution of R = 2500--4000. We compare these
spectra with synthetic atmospheric models (GAIA v2.0 cond). From the complete

100 K and surface gravity of log{g} = 3.7 +/- 0.5. Combined with a slightly
revised luminosity of log(L/L_(\sun)) = -2.25 +/- 0.24 for the companion, we
determine a radius of R = 3.50 (+1.50/-1.03) Jupiterradii and thus a mass of ~
25 Jupitermasses. Due to the large uncertainty of the surface gravity, the mass
could range from 4 to 155 Jupitermasses. By comparing the paramaters of the

well as the regions affected by their molecule-dissociating radiation. We
follow the thermal, chemical, and dynamical evolution of the primordial gas, as
it becomes incorporated into the protogalaxy. While the IGM is, in general,
optically thick to LW photons only over physical distances of > 30 kpc at
redshifts z < 20, the high molecule fraction that is built up in relic H II
regions and their increasing volume-filling fraction renders even the local IGM
optically thick to LW photons over physical distances of the order of a few
kiloparsecs. We find that efficient accretion onto Population III relic black
holes may occur after ~ 60 Myr from the time of their formation, by which time
the photo-heated relic H II region gas can cool and re-collapse into the 10^6
M_solar minihalo which hosts the black hole. Also, Pop II.5 stars, postulated

variable OH airglow emission lines from 1-2.5um spectra has imposed severe
restrictions on observational strategy. For integral field spectroscopy, where
the field of view is limited, the standard technique is to observe blank sky
frames at regular intervals. However, even this does not usually provide
sufficient compensation if individual exposure times are longer than 2-3minutes
due to (1) changes in the absolute flux of the OH lines, (2) variations in flux
among the individual OH lines, and (3) effects of instrumental flexure which
can lead to `P-Cygni' type residuals. The data processing method presented here
takes all of these effects into account and serendipitously also improves
background subtraction between the OH lines. It allows one, in principle, to
use sky frames taken hours or days previously so that observations can be
performed in a quasi-stare mode. As a result, the observing efficiency (i.e.
fraction of time spent on a source) at the telescope can be dramatically
increased.

z~4 in halos that are chemically isolated and located far away from the biggest
progenitor of the final system. As a result, if the Population III initial mass
function allows stars with low enough mass to survive until z=0 (< 0.8 Msol),
they would be distributed throughout the Galactic halo. On the other hand, the
oldest stars form in halos that collapsed close to the highest density peak of
the final system, and at z=0 they are located preferentially in the central

are not sensitive to the merger histories of the disk galaxies or the

results are consistent with our N-body results in Paper I, and lend further
weight to the conclusion that surveys of low-metallicity stars in the Galactic

ZAMS between 5 M_sun and 10 M_sun, with and without overshooting. Our main
goals are to determine the nature of the remnants of massive intermediate-mass
primordial stars and to check the influence of overshooting in their evolution.
Our calculations cover stellar evolution from the main sequence phase until the
formation of the degenerate cores and the thermally pulsing phase. We have
obtained the values for the limiting masses of Population III progenitor stars
leading to carbon-oxygen and oxygen-neon compact cores. Moreover, we have also
obtained the limiting mass for which isolated primordial stars would lead to
core-collapse supernovae after the end of the main central burning phases.
Considering a moderate amount of overshooting the mass thresholds at the ZAMS
for the formation of carbon-oxygen and oxygen-neon degenerate cores shifts to
smaller values by about 2 M_sun. As a by-product of our calculations, we have
also obtained the structure and composition profiles of the resulting compact
remnants. Opposite to what happens with solar metallicity objects, the final
fate of primordial stars is not straightforward determined from the mass of the
compact cores at the end of carbon burning. Instead, the small mass-loss rates
typically associated to stellar winds of low metallicity stars might allow the
growth of the resulting degenerate cores up to the Chandrasekhar mass, on time
scales one or two orders of magnitude shorter than the time required to loose

light curves were correlated with the variations of SV Cep in the V-band. A
remarkable correlation was found between the optical and the far-infrared light
curves. In the mid-infrared regime the amplitude of variations is lower, with a
hint for a weak anti-correlation with the optical changes. In order to
interpret the observations, we modelled the spectral energy distribution of SV
Cep assuming a self-shadowed disc with a puffed-up inner rim, using a
2-dimensional radiative transfer code. We found that modifying the height of
the inner rim, the wavelength-dependence of the long-term optical-infrared
variations is well reproduced, except the mid-infrared domain. The origin of
variation of the rim height might be fluctuation in the accretion rate in the
outer disc. In order to model the mid-infrared behaviour we tested to add an
optically thin envelope to the system, but this model failed to explain the
far-infrared variability. Infrared variability is a powerful tool to
discriminate between models of the circumstellar environment. The proposed
mechanism of variable rim height may not be restricted to UXOR stars, but might

formation rate (SFR) density at 3<z<6 for a reasonable range of model
parameters. While simple photoionization feedback produces the correct shape of
LF at z = 6, for $z = 3$ we need additional feedback that suppresses star
formation in halos with 10<log(M/M_\odot)<11. Models with prolonged continuous
star formation activities are preferred over those with short bursts as they
are consistent with the existence of a Balmer break in considerable fraction of
observed galaxies even at z~6. The halo number density evolution from the
standard LCDM structure formation model that fits LF up to z=6 is consistent
with the upper limits on z~7 LF and source counts at 8<z<12 obtained from the
HUDF observations without requiring any dramatic change in the nature of star
formation. However, to reproduce the observed LF at 6<z<10, obtained from the
near-IR observations around strong lensing clusters, we need a strong evolution
in the IMF, reddening correction and the mode of star formation at z>8.
Molecular cooled halos, which may be important for reionizing the universe, are
not detectable in the present deep field observations. However, their presence
and contribution to reionization can be inferred indirectly from the redshift
evolution of the LF at 6<z< 12.Accurately measuring the LF at high z can be
used to understand the nature of star formation in the dark ages and probe the
history of reionization. (Abridged)

the SMG in LAB1 is likely to be starburst dominated and heavily obscured

expected from starlight) and hosts a hard X-ray source at the proposed location
of the SMG, consistent with the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN).
We conclude that LAB1 and LAB2 appear to have very different energy sources

it remains unclear whether on-going star-formation or periodic AGN heating is
responsible for the extended Lyman-alpha emission. We find that the
mid-infrared properties of the SMGs lying in LAB1 and LAB2 are similar to those
of the wider SMG population, and so it is possible that extended Lyman-alpha
haloes are a common feature of SMGs in general.

model assumes that the delta pulse photoexcitation creates two interpenetrating
electronic subsystems, initially comprising a dilute energy-wise higher-lying
non-degenerate hot electron subsystem, and a relatively dense, lower-lying
electron subsystem which is degenerate. In the femtosecond time regime the
relaxation process is taken to be dominated by the electron-(multi) phonon
interaction, resulting in a quasi-continuous electron energy loss to the phonon
bath. The kinetic model is given for this time regime, beacuse in this time
regime the usual Two Temperature model is not applicable. The Two Temperature
model assumes that the hot electrons and phonons are in their respective
equilibrium states (Fermi and Bose) but at a different temperatures. One uses
the Bloch-Boltzmann-Peierls transport formula to calculate the energy transfer
rate. In the present Kinetic model a novel physical feature of slowing down
(due to Fermionic blocking of interaction phase space) of electron-phonon
relaxation mechanism near the Fermi energy of degenerate electronic subsystem
is considered. This leads to a peaking of the calculated hot electron
distribution at the Fermi energy. This feature, as well as the entire evolution
of the hot electron distribution, may be time-resolved by a femto-second

cardinality of a discrete set to approximately sampling elements of the set. An
important application of our work is to approximating the partition function
$Z$ of a discrete system, such as the Ising model, matchings or colorings of a
graph. The typical approach to estimating the partition function $Z(\beta^*)$
at some desired inverse temperature $\beta^*$ is to define a sequence, which we
call a {\em cooling schedule}, $\beta_0=0<\beta_1<...<\beta_\ell=\beta^*$ where
Z(0) is trivial to compute and the ratios $Z(\beta_{i+1})/Z(\beta_i)$ are easy
to estimate by sampling from the distribution corresponding to $Z(\beta_i)$.
Previous approaches required a cooling schedule of length $O^*(\ln{A})$ where
$A=Z(0)$, thereby ensuring that each ratio $Z(\beta_{i+1})/Z(\beta_i)$ is
bounded. We present a cooling schedule of length $\ell=O^*(\sqrt{\ln{A}})$.
  For well-studied problems such as estimating the partition function of the
Ising model, or approximating the number of colorings or matchings of a graph,
our cooling schedule is of length $O^*(\sqrt{n})$, which implies an overall
savings of $O^*(n)$ in the running time of the approximate counting algorithm
(since roughly $\ell$ samples are needed to estimate each ratio).

(MAP) estimators are often used to minimize the error rate on the estimated

All the paths in the trellis which do not lead to a valid sequence length are
suppressed. This paper presents an analytic method to assess the expected error
resilience of a VLC when trellis decoding with a sequence length constraint is
used. The approach is based on the computation, for a given code, of the amount
of information brought by the constraint. It is then shown that this quantity
as well as the probability that the VLC decoder does not re-synchronize in a
strict sense, are not significantly altered by appropriate trellis states
aggregation. This proves that the performance obtained by running a
length-constrained Viterbi decoder on aggregated state models approaches the
one obtained with the bit/symbol trellis, with a significantly reduced
complexity. It is then shown that the complexity can be further decreased by
projecting the state model on two state models of reduced size.

similar to one used long ago to show the ""effective equivalence"" between GR and

radiation with Rayleigh-Jeans distribution for the low energy radiation. In
four dimensions, the critical scalar theory is shown to be equivalent to the
Einstein field equation in the ansatz of conformally flat metrics and to the

dispersive and non-dispersive evolution equations based on the global canonical
transforms and the underlying global microlocal analysis. For this purpose, the
Egorov-type theorem is established with canonical transformations in the form
of a class of Fourier integral operators, and their weighted L2-boundedness
properties are derived. This allows us to globally reduce general dispersive
equations to normal forms in one or two dimensions. Then, several comparison
principles are introduced to relate different smoothing estimates by comparing
certain expressions involving their symbols. As a result, it is shown that the
majority of smoothing estimates for different equations are equivalent to each
other. Moreover, new estimates as well as several refinements of known results
are obtained. The proofs are considerably simplified. A comprehensive analysis

as Roper resonance, has been a state with many question marks - despite of its
4-star ranking in the particle data book. One reason is that it does not
produce any explicit resonance-like structures in the observables of $\pi$N or
$\gamma$N reactions. Only in partial wave analyses of $\pi$N scattering data a
clear resonance strcuture gets obvious in the $P_{11}$ partial wave. Very
recent measurements of the J/$\Psi$ decay by the BES collaboration and of the
$pp \to np\pi^+$ reaction at 1.3 GeV by the CELSIUS-WASA collaboration show for
the first time a clear resonance structure in the invariant $n\pi^+$ mass
spectrum for the Roper resonance at M $\approx$ 1360 MeV with a width of about
150 MeV. These values agree very favorably with the pole position results of
recent $\pi$N phase shift analyses. In consequence of this very low-lying pole
postion, which is roughly 100 MeV below the nominal value, the decay properties
have to be reinvestigated. From our two-pion production data we see that the
decay mainly proceeds via N$^* \to $N$\sigma$, i.e. a monopole transition as
expected for the breathing mode of the nucleon.

create more. The behavior depends in a subtle way on the population parameters:
the population size, the beneficial mutation rate, and the distribution of the
fitness increments of the potential beneficial mutations. The
mutation-selection balance leads to a continually evolving population with a
steady-state fitness variation. This variation increases logarithmically with
both population size and mutation rate and sets the rate at which the
population accumulates beneficial mutations, which thus also grows only
logarithmically with population size and mutation rate. These results imply
that mutator phenotypes are less effective in larger asexual populations. They
also have consequences for the advantages (or disadvantages) of sex via the
Fisher-Muller effect; these are discussed briefly.

He's protocol by the attack is trivial. Thus Chau's conclusion that all quantum

computation is proposed, which is based on an error-detecting code. Each
computational step is mediated by transfer of quantum information into an
ancilla system embedding error-detection capability. Photons are assumed to be
subjected to both photon loss and depolarization, and the threshold region of
their strengths for scalable quantum computation is obtained, together with the
amount of physical resources consumed. Compared to currently known results, the
present scheme reduces the resource requirement, while yielding a comparable
threshold region.

Submitted to PTP special issue for QMC2006",,"10.1143/PTPS.166.85",,"quant-ph",,"  Recently it was found that the dynamics in a Heisenberg spin-chain subjected
to a sequence of periodic pulses from an external, parabolic, magnetic field
can have a close correspondence with the quantum kicked rotor (QKR). The QKR is
a key paradigm of quantum chaos; it has as its classical limit the well-known
Standard Map. It was found that a single spin excitation could be converted
into a pair of non-dispersive, counter-propagating spin coherent states
equivalent to the accelerator modes of the Standard Map. Here we consider how
other types of quantum chaotic systems such as a double-kicked quantum rotor or
a quantum rotor with a double-well potential might be realized with spin
chains; we discuss the possibilities regarding manipulation of the one-magnon
spin waves.

gedanken experiment. In our experiment, single photon described by a
superposition state with two terms dynamically interacts with an atom.
Preparation of the atom in any of two excited states can be realized
practically in the last moment before interaction. For atom in the first
excited state there is practically none dynamical interaction between atom and
photon so that the interference effects on the photon can be detected later by
a photo plate. For atom in the second excited state dynamical interaction
between photon and atom causes certainly the stimulated emission of a new
photon that moves coherently with the first photon. Both photons do a
super-system described by an entangled quantum state. But in this case photo
plate, that realizes simultaneously sub-systemic measurement at any photon,
does not detect interference effects. We suggest a simple explanation of given
as well as original variant of the delayed choice experiment in full agreement
with standard quantum mechanical formalism.
