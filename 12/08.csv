strongest effect when A(t) is small, decelerating collapse perpendicular to the
field lines, due to magnetic pressure, and accelerating collapse along the
field lines, due to magnetic tension, while the vacuum energy dominates at late
time, driving accelerated expansion.

Their soft spectrum can be due to cosmological effects (high redshift), an
off-axis view of the jet or can be intrinsic to the source. We use SWIFT
observations to investigate different scenarios proposed to explain their
origin. We have made a systematic analysis of the afterglows of XRFs with known
redshift observed by SWIFT. We derive their redshift and luminosity
distributions, and compare their properties with a sample of normal GRBs
observed by the same instrument. The high distance hypothesis is ruled out by
the redshift distribution of our sample of XRFs, indicating that, at least for
our sample, the off-axis and sub-energetic hypotheses are preferred. Of course,
this does not exclude that some XRFs without known redshift could be at high
distance. However we find that taking into account the sensitivity of the BAT
instrument, XRFs cannot be detected by SWIFT beyond ~ 3. The luminosity
distribution of XRF afterglows is similar to the GRB one. This would rule out
most off-axis models, but for the homogeneous jet model. However this model
predicts a GRB rate uncomfortably near the observed rate of supernovae. This
implies that XRFs, at least those of our sample, are intrinsically soft.

superb fit to our data with a redshift-averaged quasar bias of b_Q =

the quasar classification efficiency across our full sample as a = 95.6 +/-

steeper halo profiles than currently found in simulations. Alternatively,
quasar binaries with separation <35 kpc/h may trace merging galaxies, with
typical dynamical merger times t_d~(610+/-260)m^{-1/2} Myr/h, for quasars of
host halo mass m x 10^{12} Msolar/h. We find UVX quasars at ~28 kpc/h cluster
>5 times higher at z > 2, than at z < 2, at the $2.0\sigma$ level. However, as
the space density of quasars declines as z increases, an excess of quasar
binaries (over expectation) at z > 2 could be consistent with reduced merger
rates at z > 2 for the galaxies forming UVX quasars. Comparing our clustering
at ~28 kpc/h to a $\xi(r)=(r/4.8\Mpch)^{-1.53}$ power-law, we find an upper

condition on temperature. For small magnetic fields or small wavenumbers,
instability occurs in any atmosphere where the temperature and pressure
gradients point in the same direction. We refer to the resulting convective
instability as the magnetothermal instability (MTI). We present fully
three-dimensional simulations of the MTI and show that saturation results in an
atmosphere with different vertical structure, dependent upon the boundary
conditions. When the temperature at the boundary of the unstable layer is
allowed to vary, the temperature gradient relaxes until the unstable region is
almost isothermal. When the temperature at the boundary of the unstable region
is fixed, the magnetic field is reoriented to an almost vertical geometry as a
result of buoyant motions. This case exhibits more vigorous turbulence. In both
cases the resulting saturated heat flux is almost one-half of the value
expected if the conduction were purely isotropic. The action of the MTI results
in dynamical processes that lead to significant transport perpendicular to the
initial direction of the magnetic field. The resulting magnetoconvection in
both cases amplifies the magnetic field until it is almost in equipartition
with sustained subsonic turbulence. These results are relevant to understanding
measurements of the temperature profiles of the intracluster medium of clusters

the mid-photospheric to low-chromospheric layers of the solar atmosphere in
internetwork regions is investigated. The treatment of radiative cooling via
spectral lines of carbon monoxide (CO) has been added to the radiation
chemo-hydrodynamics code CO5BOLD. [...] The CO opacity indeed causes additional
cooling at the fronts of propagating shock waves in the chromosphere. There,
the time-dependent approach results in a higher CO number density compared to
the equilibrium case and hence in a larger net radiative cooling rate. The
average gas temperature stratification of the model atmosphere, however, is
only reduced by roughly 100 K. Also the temperature fluctuations and the CO
number density are only affected to small extent. A numerical experiment
without dynamics shows that the CO cooling process works in principle and
drives the atmosphere to a cool radiative equilibrium state. At chromospheric
heights, the radiative relaxation of the atmosphere to a cool state takes
several 1000 s. The CO cooling process thus would seem to be too slow compared
to atmospheric dynamics to be responsible for the very cool temperature regions
observed in the solar atmosphere. The hydrodynamical timescales in our solar
atmosphere model are much too short to allow for the radiative relaxation to a
cool state, thus suppressing the potential thermal instability due to carbon

time-series, and spectropolarization of the model, as seen from various viewing
angles. All model observables are critically evaluated against examples of
well-observed, standard Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). We explore the
consequences of the intrinsic model asphericity by studying the dependence of
the model emission on viewing angle, and by quantifying the resulting
dispersion in (and internal correlations between) various model observables.
These statistical properties of the model are also evaluated against those of
the available observational sample of SNe Ia. On the whole, the DFD model shows
good agreement with a broad range of SN Ia observations. Certain deficiencies
are also apparent, and point to further developments within the basic
theoretical framework. We also identify several intriguing orientation effects
in the model which suggest ways in which the asphericity of SNe Ia may
contribute to their photometric and spectroscopic diversity and, conversely,
how the relative homogeneity of SNe Ia constrains the degree of asymmetry
allowable in the models. The comprehensive methodology adopted in this work
proves an essential component of developing and validating theoretical
supernova models, and helps motivate and clearly define future directions in
both the modeling and the observation of SNe Ia.

the evolution of K^{*} over the redshift range 0.2 < z < 0.5 is consistent with
a scenario where the majority of stars in cluster galaxies form at
high-redshift (z_{f} > 1.5) and evolve passively thereafter. The best-fit for
the faint-end slope of the luminosity function is alpha = -0.84 pm 0.08, which
indicates that it does not evolve between z = 0 and z = 0.3. Using Principal
Component Analysis of the spectra we classify cluster galaxies as either
star-forming/recently-star-forming (EM+BAL) or non-starforming (ELL) and
compute their respective luminosity functions. The faint-end slope of the ELL
luminosity function is much shallower than for the EM+BAL galaxies at z = 0.3,
and suggests the number of faint ELL galaxies in clusters decreases by a factor
of ~3 from z = 0 to z = 0.3. The redshift evolution of K^{*} for both EM+BAL

detect 485 and 273 GCs (and GC candidates) in the near-ultraviolet (NUV; 2267
A) and far-ultraviolet (FUV; 1516 A), respectively. Comparing M31 data with
those of Galactic GCs in the UV with the aid of population models, we find that
the age ranges of old GCs in M31 and the Galactic halo are similar. Three
metal-rich ([Fe/H]>-1) GCs in M31 produce significant FUV flux making their
FUV-V colors unusually blue for their metallicities. These are thought to be
analogs of the two peculiar Galactic GCs NGC 6388 and NGC 6441 with extended
blue HB stars. Based on the models incorporating helium enriched subpopulations
in addition to the majority of the population that have a normal helium
abundance, we suggest that even small fraction of super-helium-rich
subpopulations in GCs can reproduce the observed UV bright metal-rich GCs.
Young clusters in M31 show distinct UV and optical properties from GCs in Milky
Way. Population models indicate that their typical age is less than ~ 2 Gyrs. A
large fraction of young GCs have the kinematics of the thin, rapidly rotating
disk component. However, a subset of the old GCs also shares the thin-disk
kinematics of the younger clusters. The existence of young GCs on the outskirts
of M31 disk suggests the occurrence of a significant recent star formation in
the thin-disk of M31. Old thin-disk GCs may set constraints on the epoch of
early formation of the M31 thin-disk. We detect 12 (10) intermediate-age GC
candidates in NUV (FUV). We suggest that some of spectroscopically identified
intermediate-age GCs may not be truly intermediate in age, but rather older GCs

quasi-perpendicular shock waves is investigated by means of one-dimensional
electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations. We find that energetic electrons
are generated through the following two steps: (1) electrons are accelerated
nearly perpendicular to the local magnetic field by shock surfing acceleration
at the leading edge of the shock transition region. (2) the preaccelerated
electrons are further accelerated by shock drift acceleration. As a result,
energetic electrons are preferentially reflected back to the upstream. Shock
surfing acceleration provides sufficient energy required for the reflection.
Therefore, it is important not only for the energization process by itself, but
also for triggering the secondary acceleration process. We also present a
theoretical model of the two-step acceleration mechanism based on the
simulation results, which can predict the injection efficiency for subsequent
diffusive shock acceleration process. We show that the injection efficiency
obtained by the present model agrees well with the value obtained by Chandra
X-ray observations of SN 1006. At typical supernova remnant shocks, energetic
electrons injected by the present mechanism can self-generate upstream Alfven
waves, which scatter the energetic electrons themselves.

the highest TeV $\gamma$-ray fluxes are predicted at $\sim$7 hrs before and

suggest that Cherenkov telescopes should concentrate on these range of phases
since the TeV flux can vary by a factor of $\sim$20 with the period of the Cyg
X-1 binary system. Moreover, the model predicts clear anticorrelation of the

Jupiter masses. However, Alpha Centauri usually appears in star catalogues
surrounded by a large void area, due to the strong diffused light. Aims: We
searched for faint comoving companions to Alpha Cen located at angular
distances of the order of a few tens of arcseconds, up to 2-3 arcmin. As a
secondary objective, we built a catalogue of the detected background sources.

reduced to a master equation are investigated. Systems that can be partitioned
into a quantum-classical subsystem interacting with a classical bath are
considered. Starting with an exact non-Markovian equation for the diagonal

matrix is derived. One contribution to this equation contains the bath average
of a memory kernel that accounts for all coherences in the system. It is shown
to be a rapidly decaying function, motivating a Markovian approximation on this
term in the evolution equation. The resulting subsystem density matrix equation
is still non-Markovian due to the fact that bath degrees of freedom have been
projected out of the dynamics. Provided the computation of non-equilibrium
average values or correlation functions is considered, the non-Markovian
character of this equation can be removed by lifting the equation into the full

distribution for the energies of the minima, but at the same time the
distribution of the hyperareas for the basins of attraction surrounding the
minima follows a power-law. To explore how both these features can
simultaneously be true, we introduce an ``egg-box'' model. In these model
landscapes, the Gaussian energy distribution is used as a starting point and we
examine whether a power-law basin area distribution can arise as a natural
consequence through the swallowing up of higher-energy minima by larger
low-energy basins when the variance of this Gaussian is increased sufficiently.
Although the basin area distribution is substantially broadened by this
process,it is insufficient to generate power-laws, highlighting the role played
by the inhomogeneous distribution of basins in configuration space for actual
PELs.

non-interacting null dust streams can be conveniently interpreted as the
radiation atmosphere of a star, which also receives exterior radiation.
Formally, such a superposition of sources is equivalent to an anisotropic
fluid. Therefore, there is a preferred time function in the system, defined by
this reference fluid. This internal time is employed as a canonical coordinate,
in order to linearize the Hamiltonian constraint. This turns to be helpful in
the canonical quantization of the geometry of the radiating atmosphere.

violate the vacuum stability (particle-creating backgrounds). Our aim is to
study the exact form of the final quantum state (the density operator at a
final instant of time) that has emerged from a given arbitrary initial state
(from a given arbitrary density operator at the initial time instant) in the
course of the evolution. We find a generating functional that allows us to have
the density operators for any initial state. Averaging over states of a
subsystem of antiparticles (particles), we obtain explicit forms for reduced
density operators for subsystems of particles (antiparticles). Studying
one-particle correlation functions, we establish a one-to-one correspondence
between these functions and the reduced density operators. It is shown that in
the general case a presence of bosons (e.g. gluons) in an initial state
increases the creation rate of the same kind of bosons. We discuss the question
(and its relation to the initial stage of quark-gluon plasma formation) whether
a thermal form of one-particle distribution can appear even if the final state
of the complete system is not a thermal equilibrium. In this respect, we
discuss some cases when a pair creation by an electric-like field can mimic a
one-particle thermal distribution. We apply our technics to some QFT problems
in slowly varying electric-like backgrounds: electric, SU(3) chromoelectric,
and metric. In particular, we study the time and temperature behavior of mean
numbers of created particles provided switching on and off effects of the
external field are negligible. It is shown that at high temperatures and in

total universe stable but non-BPS. The parent universe generates baby universes

invariant generalization of the renormalization group method for obtaining

earlier paper, a technique was described for adapting this method to open
strings in gravitational backgrounds. However unlike the flat space case, these
equations cannot be derived from an action and are therefore not complete. This
is because there are ambiguities in the method that involve curvature couplings
that cannot be fixed by appealing to gauge invariance alone but need a more
complete treatment of the closed string background. An indirect method to
resolve these ambiguities is to require symmetricity of the second derivatives
of the action. In general this will involve modifying the equations by terms
with arbitrarily high powers of curvature tensors. This is illustrated for the
massive spin 2 field. It is shown that in the special case of an AdS or dS

$B=(B_{t})_{t\geq0}$ is a Brownian motion, $v$ is a positive function and
$\theta=(\theta_{t})_{t\geq0}$ is a c\'{a}dl\'{a}g strong Markov process. The
random process $\theta$ is unobservable. We assume also that the asset price
$S_{t}$ is observed only at random times $0<\tau_{1}<\tau_{2}<....$ This is an
appropriate assumption when modeling high frequency financial data (e.g.,
tick-by-tick stock prices).
  In the above setting the problem of estimation of $\theta$ can be approached
as a special nonlinear filtering problem with measurements generated by a
multivariate point process $(\tau_{k},\log S_{\tau_{k}})$. While quite natural,
this problem does not fit into the ``standard'' diffusion or simple point
process filtering frameworks and requires more technical tools. We derive a
closed form optimal recursive Bayesian filter for $\theta_{t}$, based on the
observations of $(\tau_{k},\log S_{\tau_{k}})_{k\geq1}$. It turns out that the
filter is given by a recursive system that involves only deterministic
Kolmogorov-type equations, which should make the numerical implementation
relatively easy.

order we obtain a reduction to a cubic nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLS) for
the breather envelope. However, this does not support stable soliton solutions,
so we pursue a higher-order analysis yielding a generalised NLS, which includes
known stabilising terms. We present numerical results which suggest that
long-lived stationary and moving breathers are supported by the lattice. We
find breather solutions which move in an arbitrary direction, an ellipticity
criterion for the wavenumbers of the carrier wave, asymptotic estimates for the
breather energy, and a minimum threshold energy below which breathers cannot be
found. This energy threshold is maximised for stationary breathers, and becomes
vanishingly small near the boundary of the elliptic domain where breathers
attain a maximum speed. Several of the results obtained are similar to those
obtained for the square FPU lattice (Butt & Wattis, J Phys A, 39, 4955,

different properties in regard to the generation of harmonics, and the isotropy
of the generalised NLS equation.

asymmetry in the system: an excited wavepacket always moves inward on the
attractive molecular potential. For a positive chirp, the resonance condition
moves outward in time, while for a negative chirp, it moves inward, in the same
direction as the excited wavepacket; this allows multiple interactions between
the wavepacket and the light, enabling the wavepacket to be returned coherently
to the ground state. Classical and quantum calculations support this
interpretation.

desirable, as they allow for the production of high energy beams by means of
compact and cheap setups. The new laser-plasma acceleration technique appears
to constitute the more promising breakthrough in this direction, delivering
unprecedent field gradients up to TV/m. In this article we give a quantitative
description of the impact of longitudinal wake fields on the electron beam. Our
paper is based on the solution of Maxwell's equations for the longitudinal
field. Our conclusions are valid when the acceleration distance is much smaller
than the the overtaking length, that is the length that electrons travel as a
light signal from the tail of the bunch overtakes the head of the bunch. This
condition is well verified for laser-plasma devices. We calculate a closed
expression for the impedance and the wake function that may be evaluated
numerically. It is shown that the rate of energy loss in the bunch due to
radiative interaction is equal to the energy emitted through coherent radiation
in the far-zone. Furthermore, an expression is found for the asymptotic limit
of a large distance of the electron beam from the accelerator compared with the
overtaking length. Such expression allows us to calculate analytical solutions
for a Gaussian transverse and longitudinal bunch shape. Finally, we study the
feasibility of Table-Top Free-Electron Lasers in the Vacuum Ultra-Violet
(TT-VUV FEL) and X-ray range (TT-XFEL), respectively based on 100 MeV and 1 GeV
laser-plasma accelerator drivers. Numerical estimations presented in this paper
indicate that the effects of the time-dependent energy change induced by the
longitudinal wake pose a serious threat to the operation of these devices.

at present it is the most hopeful route to solving some of the planet's

  background density","to appear in Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical
  Simulation",,,,"physics.plasm-ph physics.comp-ph",,"  A standard starting point for the simulation of collisionless reconnection is
the Harris equilibrium which is made up of a current sheet that separates two
regions of opposing magnetic field. Magnetohydrodynamic simulations of
collisionless reconnection usually include a homogeneous background density for
reasons of numerical stability. While, in some cases, this is a realistic
assumption, the background density may introduce new effects both due to the
more involved structure of the distribution function or due to the fact that
the Alfv\`en speed remains finite far away from the current sheet. We present a
fully kinetic Vlasov simulation of the perturbed Harris equilibrium using a
Vlasov code. Parameters are chosen to match the Geospace Environment Modeling
(GEM) Magnetic Reconnection Challenge but excluding the background density.
This allows to compare with earlier simulations [Schmitz, Grauer, Phys. Plasmas
13 (2006) 092309] which include the background density. It is found that the
absence of a background density causes the reconnection rate to be higher. On
the other hand, the time until the onset of reconnection is hardly affected.
Again the off diagonal elements of the pressure tensor are found to be
important on the X--line but with modified importance for the individual terms.

areas, there are no domain-specific parameters to set, and it does not require
specific background knowledge. At the highest level the FHR tracings were
clustered according to an unanticipated feature, namely the technology used in
signal acquisition. At the lower levels all tracings with abnormal or
suspicious patterns were clustered together, independent of the technology
used. Moreover, FHR tracings with future poor neonatal outcomes were included
in the cluster with other suspicious patterns.

between two atomic ensembles using non-resonant stimulated Raman scattering.
Entanglement can be generated by direct detection or balanced homodyne
detection of the Stokes fields from the two cells, after they interfere on a
beam splitter. The entanglement of the collective atomic fields can be
transferred to the anti-Stokes fields in a readout process. By measuring the
operator moments of the anti-Stokes fields, we can verify the presence of
entanglement. We model the effects of practical factors such as Stokes field
detector quantum efficiency and additive thermal noise in the entanglement
generating process, and anti-Stokes field losses in the entanglement
verification process, and find achievable regimes in which entanglement can be
verified at the levels of tens to hundreds of atomic excitations in the
ensembles.

called Lorentz-positive if M[L_m] is contained in L_n. We extend the notion of
concurrence, which was initially introduced to quantify the entanglement of
bipartite density matrices, to Lorentz-positive maps and provide an explicite
formula for it. This allows us to obtain formulae for the concurrence of
arbitrary positive operators taking 2 x 2 complex hermitian matrices as input
and consequently of arbitrary bipartite density matrices of rank 2. Namely, let
P: H(2) \to H(d) be a positive operator, and let \lambda_1,...,\lambda_4 be the
generalized eigenvalues of the pencil \sigma_2(P(X)) - \lambda det X, in
decreasing order, where \sigma_2 is the second symmetric function of the
spectrum. Then the concurrence is given by the expression C(P;X) =
2\sqrt{\sigma_2(P(X)) - \lambda_2 det X}. As an application, we compute the
concurrences of the density matrices of all graphs with 2 edges. Similar
results apply for a function which we call I-fidelity, with the second largest
generalized eigenvalue \lambda_2 replaced by the smallest eigenvalue \lambda_4.
