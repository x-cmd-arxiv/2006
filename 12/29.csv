weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) scheme modified with anti-diffusive
flux corrections, in order to solve the temperature and ionization profiles
around a point source of photons in the reionization epoch. Algorithms for such
simulation must be able to handle the following two features: 1. the sharp
profiles of ionization and temperature at the ionizing front (I-front) and the
heating front (T-front), and 2. the fraction of neutral hydrogen within the
ionized sphere is extremely small due to the stiffness of the rate equations of
atom processes. The WENO scheme can properly handle these two features, as it
has been shown to have high order of accuracy and good convergence in capturing
discontinuities and complicated structures in fluid as well as to be
significantly superior over piecewise smooth solutions containing
discontinuities. With this algorithm, we show the time-dependence of the
preheated shell around a UV photon source. In the first stage the I-front and
T-front are coincident, and propagate with almost the speed of light. In later
stage, when the frequency spectrum of UV photons is hardened, the speeds of
propagation of the ionizing and heating fronts are both significantly less than
the speed of light, and the heating front is always beyond the ionizing front.
In the spherical shell between the I- and T-fronts, the IGM is heated, while
atoms keep almost neutral. The time scale of the preheated shell evolution is
dependent on the intensity of the photon source. We also find that the details
of the pre-heated shell and the distribution of neutral hydrogen remained in
the ionized sphere are actually sensitive to the parameters used. The WENO
algorithm can provide stable and robust solutions to study these details.

variability in rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) stars. We analysed high
signal-to-noise time-series observations of ten sharp-lined roAp stars obtained
with the high-resolution spectrographs attached to the VLT and CFHT telescopes.
We investigated in detail the variations of Pr III, Nd II, Nd III and Tb III
lines and discovered a prominent change of the profile variability pattern with
height in the atmospheres of all studied roAp stars. In every investigated star
profile variability of at least one rare-earth ion is characterized by unusual
blue-to-red moving features - a behaviour inexplicable in the framework of the
standard oblique pulsator model of slowly rotating roAp stars. Using analysis
of the line profile moments and spectrum synthesis calculations, we demonstrate
that unusual oscillations in spectral lines of roAp stars arise from the
pulsational modulation of line widths. This variation occurs approximately in
quadrature with the radial velocity changes, and its amplitude rapidly
increases with height in stellar atmosphere. We propose that the line width
modulation is a consequence of the periodic expansion and compression of
turbulent layers in the upper atmospheres of roAp stars. Thus, the line profile
changes observed in slowly rotating magnetic pulsators should be interpreted as
a superposition of two types of variability: the usual time-dependent velocity
field due to an oblique low-order pulsation mode and an additional line width
modulation, synchronized with the changes of stellar radius. Our explanation of
the line profile variations of roAp stars solves the long-standing
observational puzzle and opens new possibilities for constraining geometric and
physical properties of the stellar magnetoacoustic pulsations.

account the nonperturbative quantum dynamics of the inflaton consistently
coupled to the dynamics of the (classical) cosmological metric. For chaotic

initial state with all the energy in the zero mode. For new inflation it allows
a consistent treatment of the explosive particle production due to spinodal
instabilities. Quantum field inflation (under conditions that are the quantum
analog of slow roll) leads, upon evolution, to the formation of a condensate
starting a regime of effective classical inflation. We compute the primordial
perturbations taking the dominant quantum effects into account. The results for
the scalar, vector and tensor primordial perturbations are expressed in terms
of the classical inflation results. For a N-component field in a O(N) symmetric
model, adiabatic fluctuations dominate while isocurvature or entropy
fluctuations are negligible. The results agree with the current WMAP
observations and predict corrections to the power spectrum in classical
inflation. Such corrections are estimated to be of the order of m^2/H^2 where m
is the inflaton mass and H the Hubble constant at horizon crossing. This turns
to be about 4% for the cosmologically relevant scales. This quantum field
treatment of inflation provides the foundations to the classical inflation and
permits to compute quantum corrections to it.

absorbs 0.037 +/- 0.004 of the flux. The error includes some but not all of the
uncertainty in the continuum level. The remaining part gives relative errors of
approximately 0.21 when we report the mean absorption in eight independent
redshift intervals, and 0.047 when we average over all redshifts. We find 1.46
times more absorption from the low density intergalactic medium than comes from
Ly-alpha lines that Bechtold et al. 2002 listed in the same spectra. The amount
of absorption increases with z and can be fit by a power law in (1+z) with

used the fact that the turbulence within WNM is subsonic. This theory predicts
${\cal N}(M) \propto M ^{-5/3}$ in 2D and ${\cal N}(M) \propto M ^{-16/9}$ in
3D. We compute the velocity and the density power-spectra and conclude that,
although the latter is rather flat, as observed in supersonic isothermal
simulations, the former follows the Kolmogorov prediction and is dominated by
its solenoidal component. This is due to the bistable nature of the flow which
produces large density fluctuations even when the rms Mach number (of WNM) is
not large. We also find that, whereas the energy at large scales is mainly in
the WNM, at smaller scales, it is dominated by the kinetic energy of the CNM
fragments.}

X-ray maps, as a bright nuclear sources from which emerge single or double
long, thin jets (Thomson et al., 1993). When observed with high angular
resolution these jets show structure with bright knots separated by relatively
dark regions. High percentages of polarization, sometimes more then 50% in some
objects, indicates the nonthermal nature of the radiation which is well
explained as the synchrotron radiation of the relativistic electrons in an
ordered magnetic field.
  A strong collimation of jets is most probably connected with ordered magnetic
fields. The mechanism of magnetic collimation, first suggested by
Bisnovatyi-Kogan et al. (1969), was based on the initial charge separation,
leading to creation of oscillating electrical current, which produces azimuthal
magnetic field, preventing jet expansion and disappearance. Here we consider
magnetic collimation, connected with torsional oscillations of a cylinder with
elongated magnetic field. Instead of initial blobs with charge separation, we
consider a cylinder with a periodically distributed initial rotation around the
cylinder axis. The stabilizing azimuthal magnetic field is created here by
torsional oscillations, where charge separation is not necessary. Approximate
simplified model is developed. Ordinary differential equation is derived, and
solved numerically, what gives a possibility to estimate quantitatively the
range of parameters where jets may be stabilized by torsional oscillations.

LMXBs may be explained as a resonant coupling between the neutron star spin and
epicyclic modes of accretion disk oscillations. We propose a new model for
these QPOs based on forced oscillations induced in the accretion disk due to a
stellar asymmetric rotating gravitational or magnetic field. It is shown that
particles evolving in a rotating non-axisymmetric field are subject to three
kinds of resonances: a corotation resonance, a Lindblad resonance due to a
driving force, and a parametric resonance due to the time varying epicyclic
frequencies. These results are extends by means of 2D numerical simulations of
a simplified version of the accretion disk. The simulations are performed for
the Newtonian gravitational potential, as well as for a pseudo-general
relativistic potential, which enables us to explore the behavior of the
resonances around both rotating neutron stars and black holes. Density
perturbations are only significant in the region located close to the inner
edge of the disk near the ISCO where the gravitational or magnetic perturbation
is maximal. It is argued that the nearly periodic motion induced in the disk
will produce high quality factor QPOs.
  Finally, applying this model to a typical neutron star, we found that the
strongest response occurs when the frequency difference of the two modes equals
either the spin frequency (for ""slow rotators"") or half of it (for ""fast
rotators""). The two main excited modes may both be connected to vertical
oscillations of the disk. We emphasize that strong gravity is not needed to
excite the modes.

(HTSE) results, is proposed for optimizing the expression for thermodynamic
observables of ferromagnets exhibiting critical behavior at $\Tc$. This
``extended scaling'' scheme leads to a protocol for the choice of scaling
variables, $\tau=(T-\Tc)/T$ or $(T^2 - \Tc^2)/T^2$ depending on the observable
instead of $(T-\Tc)/\Tc$, and more importantly to temperature dependent
non-critical prefactors for each observable. The rule corresponds to scaling of
the leading of the reduced susceptibility above $\Tc$ as $\chi_{\rm
c}^{*}(T)\sim \tau^{-\gamma}$ in agreement with standard practice with scaling
variable $\tau$, and for the leading term of the second-moment correlation
length as $\xi_{\rm c}^{*}(T)\sim T^{-1/2}\tau^{-\nu}$. For the specific heat
in bipartite lattices the rule gives $C_{\rm c}^{*}(T) \sim T^{-2}[(T^2
-\Tc^2)/T^2]^{-\alpha}$. The latter two expressions are not standard. The
scheme can allow for confluent and non-critical correction terms. A stringent
test of the extended scaling is made through analyses of high precision
numerical and HTSE data, or {\it real} data, on the three-dimensional canonical
Ising, XY, and Heisenberg ferromagnets.

the nonequilibrium metastable state is due, as in equilibrium, to the
competition between the surface and the bulk. This suggests one to accept a
nonequilibrium ""free-energy"" at a mesoscopic/cluster level, and it ensues a
nonequilibrium ""surface tension"" with some peculiar low-T behavior. We
illustrate the occurrence of intriguing nonequilibrium phenomena, including:
(i) Noise-enhanced stabilization of nonequilibrium metastable states; (ii)
reentrance of the limit of metastability under strong nonequilibrium
conditions; and (iii) resonant propagation of domain walls. The cooperative
behavior of our system may also be understood in terms of a Langevin equation
with additive and multiplicative noises. We also studied metastability in the
case of open boundaries as it may correspond to a magnetic nanoparticle. We
then observe burst-like relaxation at low T, triggered by the additional
surface randomness, with scale-free avalanches which closely resemble the type
of relaxation reported for many complex systems. We show that this results from
the superposition of many demagnetization events, each with a well- defined
scale which is determined by the curvature of the domain wall at which it
originates. This is an example of (apparent) scale invariance in a
nonequilibrium setting which is not to be associated with any familiar kind of

previously (PRE \textbf{73}, 046101, (2006)), is systematically explored to

consider each higher order neighborhood as a network in itself, represented by
a corresponding adjacency matrix. Usual network indices are then used to
evaluate the properties of each neighborhood. Results for a large number of
typical networks are presented and discussed. Further, the information from all
neighborhoods is condensed in a single neighborhood matrix, which can be
explored for visualizing the neighborhood structure. On the basis of such
representation, a distance is introduced to compare, in a quantitative way, how
far apart networks are in the space of neighborhood matrices. The distance
depends both on the network topology and the adopted node numbering. Given a
pair of networks, a Monte Carlo algorithm is developed to find the best
numbering for one of them, holding fixed the numbering of the second network,
obtaining a projection of the first one onto the pattern of the other. The
minimal value found for the distance reflects differences in the neighborhood
structures of the two networks that arise from distinct topologies. Examples

with the Drude part exhibits a linear-temperature dependence over a wide range

consistency with exact diagonalization results based on the t-J model. The
underlying physics is attributed to the high-energy spin-charge separation in

spectrum. It is assumed that only third generation sfermions which are
contained in ${\bf 10}(Q, U^c, E^c)$ of SU(5) can have a different mass from
the others. This mass spectrum is led from $E_6$ GUT model with horizontal
symmetries. It is shown that branching ratios of $\tau \to \mu \gamma$ and $\mu
\to e \gamma$ depend strongly on a right-handed stau mass. The weak scale
stability requires the light stau, so large decay rates can be expected in this
scenario. When stau is around 150 GeV and $\tan \beta \sim 10$, the branching
ratios can be larger than $Br(\tau \to \mu \gamma) \simeq 10^{-8}$ and $Br(\mu
\to e \gamma) \simeq 5\times 10^{-12}$, which are within reach of future
experiments. In addition, this model has an interesting feature that the final

an important tool and the definition of the field should be made precise, a

entropy solutions in the class of bounded measurable functions and in the class

solely enjoy the $L^1$ contraction property and leads to a unique contractive

the flux of the conservation law and a given vector field ensuring that the
total variation of the solution along the integral curves of the vector field
is non-increasing in time. Our results are next specialized to the important
case of a flow on the 2-sphere, and examples of flux are discussed. Second, we
establish the convergence of the finite volume methods based on numerical
flux-functions satisfying monotonicity properties. Our proof requires detailed
estimates on the entropy dissipation, and extends to general manifolds an
earlier proof by Cockburn, Coquel, and LeFloch in the Euclidian case.

harmonically depends on time is studied for the case of large perturbation, in
which the rate of transition calculated from the Fermi golden rule (FGR) is
about or exceeds the frequency of perturbation. For this case the models of
Hamiltonian with random non-correlated matrix elements demonstrate that the
energy evolution retains its diffusive character, but the rate of diffusion
increases slower than the square of the magnitude of perturbation, thus
destroying the quantum-classical correspondence for the energy diffusion and
the energy absorption in the classical limit $\hbar \to 0$. The numerical
calculation carried out for a model built from the first principles (the
quantum analog of the Pullen - Edmonds oscillator) demonstrates that the
evolving energy distribution, apart from the diffusive component, contains a
ballistic one with the energy dispersion that is proportional to the square of
time. This component originates from the chains of matrix elements with
correlated signs and vanishes if the signs of matrix elements are randomized.
The presence of the ballistic component formally extends the applicability of
the FGR to the non-perturbative domain and restores the quantum-classical
correspondence.
