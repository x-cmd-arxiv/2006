SGRs within the framework of a thermally emitting magnetar model. Using our
detailed atmosphere models and taking into account reprocessing of the surface
emission by the magnetosphere, we show that the hardness of the surface spectra
increases with increasing temperature and hence the changes in the effective
temperatures of the outer layers of the star alone can account for the observed
correlations. We conclude that the slow release of the heat deposited in the
deep crust during a magnetar burst naturally accounts for the spectral changes
during the afterglow. The correlations are further enhanced by changes in the
structures of the magnetic currents during or following a burst. However, the
additional hardening produced by scattering of the surface photons off the
magnetospheric charges saturates at moderate values of the scattering optical
depth.

the radio-loud ultra luminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) PKS1345+12, based on high
resolution HST imaging and long slit spectra taken with the WHT. While the
images clearly show bright knots suggestive of super star clusters(SSC), the
spectra reveal the presence of YSP in the diffuse light across the full extent
of the halo of the merging-double nucleus system. Spectral synthesis modelling
has been used to estimate the ages of the YSP for both the SSC and the diffuse
light sampled by the spectra. For the SSC we find ages t{SSC} < 6 Myr with
reddenings 0.2 < E(B-V) < 0.5 and masses 10e6 < M{SSC} < 10e7 M{solar}.
However, in some regions of the galaxy we find that the spectra of the diffuse
light component can only be modelled with a relatively old post-starburst YSP
(0.04 - 1.0 Gyr) or with a disk galaxy template spectrum. The results
demonstrate the importance of accounting for reddening in photometric studies
of SSC, and highlight the dangers of focussing on the highest surface
brightness regions when trying to obtain a general impression of the star
formation activity in the host galaxies of ULIRGs. The case of PKS1345+12
provides clear evidence that the star formation histories of the YSP in ULIRGs
are complex. Intriguingly, our long-slit spectra show line splitting at the
locations of the SSC, indicating that they are moving at up to 450km s-1 with
respect to the local ambient gas. Given their kinematics, it is plausible that
the SSC have been formed either in fast moving gas streams/tidal tails that are
falling back into the nuclear regions as part of the merger process, or as a
consequence of jet-induced star formation linked to the extended, diffuse radio
emission detected in the halo of the galaxy

terminates the supersonic expansion of the baryonic wind which is driven by
neutrino heating off the surface of (non-magnetized) new-born neutron stars in

spherical symmetry. In agreement with previous relativistic wind studies, we
find that the neutrino-driven outflow accelerates to supersonic velocities and
in case of a compact, about 1.4 solar mass (gravitational mass) neutron star
with a radius of about 10 km, the wind reaches entropies of about 100 k_B per
nucleon. The wind, however, is strongly influenced by the environment of the
supernova core. It is decelerated and shock-heated abruptly by a termination
shock that forms when the supersonic outflow collides with the slower preceding
supernova ejecta. The radial position of this reverse shock varies with time
and depends on the strength of the neutrino wind and the different conditions
in progenitor stars with different masses and structure. Its basic properties
and behavior can be understood by simple analytic considerations. We
demonstrate that the entropy of matter going through the reverse shock can
increase to a multiple of the asymptotic wind value. Seconds after the onset of
the explosion it therefore can exceed 400 k_B per nucleon. The temperature of
the shocked wind has typically dropped to about or less than 10^9 K, and
density and temperature in the shock-decelerated matter continue to decrease
only very slowly. Such conditions might strongly affect the important phases of
supernova nucleosynthesis in a time and progenitor dependent way. (abridged)

for counterparts of four novae with earlier outbursts. For comparison with the
X-ray data we created a catalogue of optical novae in M31 based on our own nova
search programs and on all novae reported in the literature. We collected all
known properties and named the novae consistently following the CBAT scheme. We
detect eleven out of 34 novae within a year after the optical outburst in
X-rays. While for eleven novae we detect the end of the supersoft source phase,
seven novae are still bright more than 1200, 1600, 1950, 2650, 3100, 3370 and
3380 d after outburst. One nova is detected to turn on 50 d, another 200 d
after outburst. Three novae unexpectedly showed short X-ray outbursts starting
within 50 d after the optical outburst and lasting only two to three months.
The X-ray emission of several of the novae can be characterized as supersoft
from hardness ratios and/or X-ray spectra or by comparing HRC-I count rates

Sunward acceleration of 8.74 +/- 1.33 x 10^-10 m s^-2 seen in the behaviour of
the Pioneer probes. Two hypotheses are made: (1) Inertia is a reaction to Unruh
radiation and (2) this reaction is weaker for low accelerations because some
wavelengths in the Unruh spectrum do not fit within a limiting scale (twice the
Hubble distance) and are disallowed: a process similar to the Casimir effect.
When these ideas are used to model the Pioneer crafts' trajectories there is a
slight reduction in their inertial mass, causing an anomalous Sunward
acceleration of 6.9 +/- 3.5 x 10^-10 m s^-2 which agrees within error bars with
the observed Pioneer anomaly beyond 10 AU from the Sun. This new scheme is
appealingly simple and does not require adjustable parameters. However, it also
predicts an anomaly within 10 AU of the Sun, which has not been observed.
Various observational tests for the idea are proposed.

starless/protostellar on the basis of infrared and/or outflow detections and
Class I/Class 0 on the basis of Tbol, Lbol/Lsmm and F_{3.6}/F_{850}. In order
to investigate the dependence of these evolutionary indicators on mass, we
construct radiative transfer models of Class 0 sources. Of the submm cores,
56/103 (54%) are confirmed protostars on the basis of infrared emission or
molecular outflows. Of these, 22 are classified Class 1 on the basis of three

not always appropriate to use a fixed threshold to separate Class 0 and Class I

emission in H$\alpha$ is not persistent, but shows long-term variability
between a flare value of $\sim$100 $\AA$ and a quiescent value of $\sim$25

QSOs. The validity of this approach can be tested by studying objects in which
the N IV] and N III] lines, in addition to N V, are unusually strong and easily

metallicity, it implies that the large N V strengths observed in most QSOs are
not due to some peculiarity of the N V 1240 line. This test had previously been
applied to Q0353-383, a QSO long known to have extremely strong N III] and N
IV] lines, with the result supporting high metallicity in that object. Here we
make the same check in two other QSOs with very strong nitrogen lines, as a
step towards using such QSOs to better probe the early chemical enrichment
histories of their host galaxies. J1254+0241 has a metallicity of about 10x
solar, with good agreement between the abundance results from different line

low-ionization emission line spectrum similar to some low-ionization BAL QSOs

supernova SN2006gy in NGC1260, revealing that it reached a peak magnitude of

what powers the total radiated energy of 1e51 erg, but we argue that any
mechanism -- thermal emission, circumstellar interaction, or 56Ni decay --
requires a very massive progenitor star. The circumstellar interaction
hypothesis would require truly exceptional conditions around the star probably
experienced an LBV eruption like the 19th century eruption of eta Carinae.
Alternatively, radioactive decay of 56Ni may be a less objectionable
hypothesis. That power source would imply a large Ni mass of 22 Msun, requiring
that SN2006gy was a pair-instability supernova where the star's core was
obliterated. SN2006gy is the first supernova for which we have good reason to
suspect a pair-instability explosion. Based on a number of lines of evidence,
we rule out the hypothesis that SN 2006gy was a ``Type IIa'' event. Instead, we
propose that the progenitor may have been a very massive evolved object like
eta Carinae that, contrary to expectations, failed to completely shed its
massive hydrogen envelope before it died. Our interpretation of SN2006gy
implies that the most massive stars can explode earlier than expected, during
the LBV phase, preventing them from ever becoming Wolf-Rayet stars. SN2006gy
also suggests that the most massive stars can create brilliant supernovae
instead of dying ignominious deaths through direct collapse to a black hole.

Mars-mass protoplanets that formed through oligarchic growth in a disk
comparable to the minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN), through N-body simulation
including random torques exerted by disk turbulence due to
Magneto-Rotational-Instability. For the torques, we used the semi-analytical
formula developed by Laughlin et al.(2004). The damping of orbital
eccentricities (in all runs) and type-I migration (in some runs) due to the
tidal interactions with disk gas are also included. We found that the orbital
eccentricities pumped up by the turbulent torques and associated random walks
in semimajor axes tend to delay isolation of planets, resulting in more
coagulation of planets than in the case without turbulence. The eccentricities
are still damped after planets become isolated. As a result, the number of
final planets decreases with increase in strength of the turbulence, while
Earth-mass planets with small eccentricities are still formed. In the case of
relatively strong turbulence, the number of final planets are 4-5 at 0.5-2AU,
which is consistent with Solar system, for relatively wide range of disk
surface density (~10^{-4}-10^{-2} times MMSN).

compared to other SN Ic, with the characteristic broad NIR peak seen in all
three bands. We find that the rise profile before the peak is largely
independent of NIR wavelength, each band appearing to transition into a plateau
phase around day 10--13. Since the light curve is in the plateau phase when our
observations end at day 16, we can only place limits on the peak absolute
magnitudes, but we estimate that SN 2006aj is one of the lowest NIR luminosity
XRF/GRB associated SNe observed to date. The broad peaks observed in the {\em

flux output from days 10--16. This evolution can be seen in the broad color and
SED diagrams constructed using {\em UBVRIJHK$_s$} monochromatic flux
measurements for the first 16 days of the event. Ultimately, a 10-day rise time
would make SN 2006aj an extremely fast rise SN Ic event, faster than SN 1998bw
and SN 2003dh, which combined with its underluminous nature, indicates a lower
amount of $^{56}$Ni ejected by the progenitor compared to other XRF/GRB-SNe.

  Methods. Photometric monitoring as well as spectroscopic observations of
Westerlund2 are used to search for light variability and to establish the
spectral types of the early-type stars in the cluster core.
  Results. The first light curves of the eclipsing binary WR20a in B and V
filters are analysed and a distance of 8kpc is inferred. Three additional
eclipsing binaries, which are probable late O or early B-type cluster members,
are discovered, but none of the known early O-type stars in the cluster
displays significant photometric variability above 1% at the 1-sigma level. The
twelve brightest O-type stars are found to have spectral types between O3 and
O6.5, significantly earlier than previously thought.
  Conclusions. The distance of the early-type stars in Westerlund2 is
established to be in excellent agreement with the distance of WR20a, indicating
that WR20a actually belongs to the cluster. Our best estimate of the cluster
distance thus amounts to 8.0pm1.4kpc. Despite the earlier spectral types, the
currently known population of early-type stars in Westerlund2 does not provide
enough ionizing photons to account for the radio emission of the RCW49 complex.
This suggests that there might still exist a number of embedded early O-stars
in RCW49.

Our code is able to reconstruct the semi-analytic test equilibrium with high
accuracy. The stationary MHD optimization code developed here has about the
same accuracy as its predecessor, a non-linear force-free optimization code.
The computing time for MHD-equilibria is, however, longer than for force-free
magnetic fields. We also extended a well-known class of nonlinear force-free
equilibria to the non-force-free regime for purposes of testing the code.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the code works in principle using tests with
analytical equilibria, but it still needs to be applied to real data.

massive stars (10-50 Msun) or very massive ones (140-1000 Msun) or a

abundance (after WMAP) and the observed ``Spite plateau'' cannot be due to
astration by a generation of massive Pop. III stars, as recently suggested,

metallicity disribution may well be understood in the framework of hierarchical

from Compton scattering of low energy seed photons by relativistic electrons in
a relativistic jet oriented close to the line of sight. However there are a
number of possible models for the origin of the seed photons. In Paper I
(McHardy et al 1999) we showed that the X-ray and IR variability from 3C273 was
highly correlated in 1997, with the IR flux leading the X-rays by ~0.75 +/-
0.25 days. The strong correlation, and lag, supports the Synchrotron
Self-Compton (SSC) model, where the seed photons are synchroton photons from
the jet itself. The previous correlation was based on one moderately well
sampled flare and another poorly sampled flare, so the possibility of chance
correlated variability exists. Here we report on further X-ray and IR
observations of 3C273 which confirm the behaviour seen in Paper I. During a 2
week period of observations we see a flare of amplitude ~25%, lasting for ~5
days, showing a high correlation between IR and X-ray variations, with the
X-rays lagging by ~1.45+/- 0.15 days. These observations were not scheduled at
any special time, implying that the same mechanism - almost certainly SSC -
dominates the X-ray emission on most occasions and that the structure of the
emission region is similar in most small flares.

  A pure geometric triangulation of coronal features leads to ambiguities
because the dilute plasma emissions complicates the association of features in

stereoscopic reconstruction is not unique and multiple solutions occur.
  We demonstrate how these ambiguities can be resolved with the help of
different coronal magnetic field models (potential, linear and non-linear
force-free fields). The idea is that, due to the high conductivity in the
coronal plasma, the emitting plasma outlines the magnetic field lines.
  Consequently the 3D coronal magnetic field provides a proxy for the
stereoscopy which allows to eliminate inconsistent configurations.

it has to be extrapolated from photospheric measurements into the corona. AIMS:
We test the quality of a non-linear force-free coronal magnetic field
extrapolation code with the help of a known analytical solution. METHODS: The
non-linear force-free equations are numerically solved with the help of an
optimization principle. The method minimizes an integral over the force-free
and solenoidal condition. As boundary condition we use either the magnetic
field components on all six sides of the computational box in Case I or only on
the bottom boundary in Case II. We check the quality of the reconstruction by
computing how well force-freeness and divergence-freeness are fulfilled and by
comparing the numerical solution with the analytical solution. The comparison
is done with magnetic field line plots and several quantitative measures, like
the vector correlation, Cauchy Schwarz, normalized vector error, mean vector
error and magnetic energy. RESULTS: For Case I the reconstructed magnetic field
shows good agreement with the original magnetic field topology, whereas in Case
II there are considerable deviations from the exact solution. This is
corroborated by the quantitative measures, which are significantly better for
Case I. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the strong nonlinearity of the considered
force-free equilibrium, the optimization method of extrapolation is able to
reconstruct it; however, the quality of reconstruction depends significantly on
the consistency of the input data, which is given only if the known solution is
provided also at the lateral and top boundaries, and on the presence or absence
of flux concentrations near the boundaries of the magnetogram.

dusty, star-forming galaxies. Energetically, the CIB is very important as it
contains as much energy as the extragalactic optical background. The nature and
evolutionary status of the objects making up the background are, however,
unclear. The CIB peaks at ~150 microns, and as such is most effectively studied
from space. The limited apertures of space-borne telescopes set the angular
resolution that can be attained, and so even Herschel, with its 3.5m diameter,
will be confusion-limited at this wavelengths at ~5mJy. The bulk of the
galaxies contributing to the CIB are fainter than this, so it is difficult to
study them without interferometry. Here we present the results of a preliminary
study of an alternative way of probing fainter than the continuum confusion
limit using far-IR imaging spectroscopy. An instrument capable of such
observations is being planned for SPICA - a proposed Japanese mission with an
aperture equivalent to that of Herschel and more than 2 orders of magnitude
more sensitive. We investigate the potential of imaging spectrometers to break
the continuum confusion limit. We have simulated the capabilities of a
spectrometer with modest field of view (2'x2'), moderate spectral resolution
(R~1-2000) and high sensitivity. We find that such an instrument is capable of
not only detecting line emission from sources with continuum fluxes
substantially below the confusion limit, but also of determining their
redshifts and, where multiple lines are detected, some emission line
diagnostics. We conclude that 3-D imaging spectrometers on cooled far-IR space
telescopes will be powerful new tools for extragalactic far-IR astronomy.

ii) it requires an IMF peculiarly enhanced in the intermediate mass stars. The

critical behavior is studied at zero branching rate of kinks, through analysis
spreading of '+' and '-' spins and, of the kink density. Impurities exert a
strong effect on the critical behavior only for a particular choice of

impurity strengths such that diffusion is nearly blocked. In this regime, the

one-dimensional diluted contact process, with Griffiths-like behavior for the

to reconstruct the hidden FD by using a voice adapted (self-consistent)
part-tone decomposition of the speech signal. The universality and robustness
of human pitch perception encourages the reconstruction of a band-limited FD in
the frequency range of the pitch. The self-consistent decomposition of voiced
continuants generates several part-tones which can be confirmed to be
topologically equivalent to corresponding acoustic modes of the excitation on
the transmitter side. As topologically equivalent image of a glottal master
oscillator, the self-consistent FD is suited to serve as low frequency part of
the basic time-scale separation of auditive perception and to describe the
broadband voiced excitation as entrained (synchronized) and/or modulated
primary response. Being guided by the acoustic correlates of pitch and loudness
perception, the time-scale separation avoids the conventional assumption of
stationary excitation and represents the basic decoding step of an advanced
precision transmission protocol of self-consistent (voiced) acoustic objects.

``kludge'' waveforms generated in highly-accurate, numerically-generated

with comparable mass and spin. In order to maximize their impact on the
produced waveforms, we have considered tori that are compact, massive and close
to the central black hole, investigating under what conditions the LISA

portion of the space of parameters the waveforms produced by EMRIs in these
black hole-torus systems are indistinguishable from pure-Kerr waveforms. Hence,
a ``confusion problem'' will be present for observations carried out over a
timescale below or comparable to the dephasing time.

m_s. We show that the theory can be compatible with CMB observations if g_s /
\sqrt{p} ~ 10^{-7}, where g_s is the string coupling, and if m_s < 10^{-6} M_p.
A red-tilted spectrum is predicted, and the scalar-to-tensor ratio is bounded
from above as r < 0.006. The p-adic theory is shown to have identical
inflationary predictions to a local theory with superPlanckian parameter
values, but with the advantage that the p-adic theory is ultraviolet complete.

between noncommuative (NC) field theory and gravity, shortly referred to as the
NCFT/Gravity correspondence. I elucidate why a gauge theory in NC spacetime
should be a theory of gravity. A basic reason for the NCFT/Gravity
correspondence is that the $\Lambda$-symmetry (or B-field transformations) in
NC spacetime can be considered as a par with diffeomorphisms, which results
from the Darboux theorem. This fact leads to a striking picture about gravity:
Gravity can emerge from a gauge theory in NC spacetime. Gravity is then a
collective phenomenon emerging from gauge fields living in fuzzy spacetime.

that its origin is related to experiments on colloidal chemistry. We present
two methods of computing Casimir forces, namely: the global method introduced
by Casimir, based on the idea of zero-point energy of the quantum
electromagnetic field, and a local one, which requires the computation of the
energy-momentum stress tensor of the corresponding field. As explicit examples,
we calculate the (standard) Casimir forces between two parallel and perfectly
conducting plates and discuss the more involved problem of a scalar field
submitted to Robin boundary conditions at two parallel plates. A few comments
are made about recent experiments that undoubtedly confirm the existence of
this effect. Finally, we briefly discuss a few topics which are either
elaborations of the Casimir effect or topics that are related in some way to
this effect as, for example, the influence of a magnetic field on the Casimir
effect of charged fields, magnetic properties of a confined vacuum and
radiation reaction forces on non-relativistic moving boundaries.

states, focusing on the massive modes of spin-3/2 and spin-2 fields. To this
end we determine the spontaneously broken gauge symmetries associated to these
`higher spin' states and construct the unbroken phase of the Kaluza-Klein
theory. We show that for the particular background AdS_3 x S*3 x S*3 a
consistent coupling of the first massive spin-3/2 multiplet requires an
enhancement of local supersymmetry, which in turn will be spontaneously broken
in the Kaluza-Klein vacuum. The corresponding action is constructed as a gauged
maximal supergravity in D=3. Subsequently, the symmetries underlying an
infinite tower of massive spin-2 states are analyzed in case of a Kaluza-Klein
compactification of four-dimensional gravity to D=3. It is shown that the
resulting gravity-spin-2 theory is given by a Chern-Simons action of an affine
algebra. The global symmetry is determined, which contains an affine extension
of the Ehlers group. We show that the broken phase can in turn be constructed
via gauging a certain subgroup of the global symmetry group. Finally,
deformations of the Kaluza-Klein theory on AdS_3 x S*3 x S*3 and the
corresponding symmetry breakings are analyzed as possible applications for the

eight out of the original 32 supercharges and as a consequence the low-energy
effective action can be written in terms of couplings which are closely related
to the couplings of four-dimensional N=2 theories. This generalizes the
previously studied case of SU(3) backgrounds in that the left- and right-moving
sector each have a different globally defined spinor. Given a truncation to a
finite number of modes, these backgrounds lead to a conventional
four-dimensional low-energy effective theory. The results are manifestly mirror
symmetric and give terms corresponding to the mirror dual couplings of
Calabi-Yau compactifications with magnetic fluxes. It is argued, however, that
generically such backgrounds are non-geometric and hence the supergravity
analysis is not strictly valid. Remarkably, the naive generalization of the
geometrical expressions nonetheless appears to give the correct low-energy
effective theory.

situations which can be described as having relatively few moderately large
coefficients. Such situations lead to some very subtle statistical problems. In
particular, Ingster and Donoho and Jin have considered a sparse normal means
testing problem, in which they described the precise demarcation or detection
boundary. Meinshausen and Rice have shown that it is even possible to estimate
consistently the fraction of nonzero coordinates on a subset of the detectable
region, but leave unanswered the question of exactly in which parts of the
detectable region consistent estimation is possible. In the present paper we
develop a new approach for estimating the fraction of nonzero means for
problems where the nonzero means are moderately large. We show that the
detection region described by Ingster and Donoho and Jin turns out to be the
region where it is possible to consistently estimate the expected fraction of
nonzero coordinates. This theory is developed further and minimax rates of
convergence are derived. A procedure is constructed which attains the optimal
rate of convergence in this setting. Furthermore, the procedure also provides
an honest lower bound for confidence intervals while minimizing the expected
length of such an interval. Simulations are used to enable comparison with the
work of Meinshausen and Rice, where a procedure is given but where rates of
convergence have not been discussed. Extensions to more general Gaussian
mixture models are also given.

underlying Markov chain, in the presence of a potential thatinteracts with the
polymer when it visits a particular site 0. Disorder is introduced by having
the interaction vary from one monomer to another, as a constant $u$ plus i.i.d.
mean-0 randomness. There is a critical value of $u$ above which the polymer is
pinned, placing a positive fraction (called the contact fraction) of its
monomers at 0 with high probability. When the excursions of the underlying
chain have a finite mean but no finite exponential moment, it is known that the
depinning transition (more precisely, the contact fraction) in the
corresponding annealed system is discontinuous. One generally expects the
presence of disorder to smooth transitions, and it was proved by Giacomin and
Toninelli that when the excursion length distribution has power-law tails, the
quenched system has a continuous transition even if the annealed system does
not. We show here that when the underlying chain is transient but the finite
part of the excursion length distribution has exponential tails, then the
depinning transition is discontinuous even in the quenched system, and the
quenched and annealed critical points are strictly different. By contrast, in
the recurrent case, the depinning behavior depends on the subexponential
prefactors on the exponential decay of the excursion length distribution, and
when these prefactors decay with an appropriate power law, the quenched
transition is continuous even though the annealed one is not.

in the deterministic (multiplication processes) has long intrigued researchers
in Benford's Law. In this article it is argued that it springs from one common
intrinsic feature of their density curves. On the other hand, the profound
dichotomy between the random and the deterministic in the context of Benford's
Law is noted here, acknowledging the need to distinguish between them. From its
very inception, the field has been suffering from a profound confusion and
mixing of these two very different logarithmic flavors, causing mistaken
conclusions. One example is Allaart's proof of equality of sums along digital
lines, which can only be applied to deterministic processes. Random data lack
this equality and consistently show significantly larger sums for lower digits,
thus rendering any attempt at test of summation equality irrelevant and futile
in the context of forensic analysis regarding accounting and financial fraud
detection.
  Another digital regularity is suggested here, one that is found in
logarithmic as well as non-logarithmic random data sets. In addition, chains of
distributions that are linked via parameter selection are found to be
logarithmic, either in the limit where the number of the sequences in the chain
approaches infinity, or where the distributions generating the parameters are
themselves logarithmic.
  A new forensic data analysis method in the context of fraud detection is
suggested here even for data types that do not obey Benford's Law, and in
particularly regarding tax evasion applications. This can also serve as a
robust forensic tool to investigate fraudulent fake data provided by the
sophisticated cheater already aware of Benford's Law, a challenge that would
become increasing problematic to tax authorities in the future as Benford's Law
becomes almost common knowledge.

canonical map is a split epimorphism of modules of the non-commutative base
algebra of H, relative injectivity of the H-comodule algebra A is related to
the Galois property of the extension B\subseteq A and also to the equivalence
of the category of relative Hopf modules to the category of B-modules. This
extends a classical theorem by H.-J. Schneider on Galois extensions by a Hopf
algebra. Our main tool is an observation that relative injectivity of a
comodule algebra is equivalent to relative separability of a forgetful functor,
a notion introduced and analysed hereby.
  In the first version of this submission, we heavily used the statement that
two constituent bialgebroids in a Hopf algebroid possess isomorphic comodule
categories. This statement was based on \cite[Brz3,Theorem 2.6], whose proof
turned out to contain an unjustified step. In the revised version we return to
an earlier definition of a comodule of a Hopf algebroid, that distinguishes
between comodules of the two constituent bialgebroids, and modify the
statements and proofs in the paper accordingly.

functions and constant interest and dividend rates, the European Put prices are
transformed into European Call prices by the simultaneous exchanges of the
interest and dividend rates and of the strike and spot price of the underlying.
This paper investigates such a Call Put duality for perpetual American options.
It turns out that the perpetual American Put price is equal to the perpetual
American Call price in a model where, in addition to the previous exchanges
between the spot price and the strike and between the interest and dividend
rates, the local volatility function is modified. We prove that equality of the
dual volatility functions only holds in the standard Black-Scholes model with
constant volatility. Thanks to these duality results, we design a theoretical
calibration procedure of the local volatility function from the perpetual Call
and Put prices for a fixed spot price $x_0$. The knowledge of the Put (resp.
Call) prices for all strikes enables to recover the local volatility function
on the interval $(0,x_0)$ (resp. $(x_0,+\infty)$).

week mixing found in theoretical exercises, atmospheric data and LES. The
correct asymptotes exclude the need for a critical Richardson number in the FOC
formulation. Further, we analysed the FOC quality as functions of the integral
PBL stability and the vertical model resolution. We show that the FOC is never
perfect because the turbulence in the upper half of the PBL is not generated by
the local gradients. Accordingly, the parameterized and LES fluxes decorrelate
in the upper PBL. With this imperfection in mind, we show that there is no
systematic quality deterioration of the FOC in strongly stable PBLs provided
the vertical model resolution is better than 10 levels within the PBL. In
agreement with previous studies, we found that the quality improves slowly with
the vertical resolution refinement. It is generally wise to not overstretch the
mesh in the lowest 500 m of the atmosphere where majority of the observed,
simulated and theoretically predicted stably stratified PBLs are located.

under solid-body rotation are studied via high-resolution direct numerical
simulations. For strong rotation the nonlinear energy cascade exhibits
depletion and a pronounced anisotropy with the energy flux proceeding mainly
perpendicularly to the rotation axis. This corresponds to a transition towards
a quasi-two-dimensional flow similar to a linear Taylor-Proudman state. In
contrast to the energy spectrum along the rotation axis which does not scale
self-similarly, the perpendicular spectrum displays an inertial range with
$k^{-2}_\perp$-behavior. A new phenomenology gives a rationale for the
observations. The scaling exponents $\zeta_p$ of structure functions up to
order $p=8$ measured perpendicular to the rotation axis indicate reduced
intermittency with increasing rotation rate. The proposed phenomenology is
consistent with the inferred asymptotic non-intermittent behavior
$\zeta_p=p/2$.

micro/nano-particles in a magnetophoretic microsystem that consists of an array
of integrated soft-magnetic elements embedded beneath a microfluidic channel.
The elements, which are polarized by a bias field, produce a nonuniform field
distribution that gives rise to a force on magnetic particles within the
microchannel. The equations governing particle motion are derived using
analytical expressions for the dominant magnetic and fluidic forces. The
magnetic force is obtained using an analytical expression for the field
distribution in the microchannel combined with a linear magnetization model for
the magnetic response of particles. The theory takes into account particle size
and material properties, the bias field, the dimensions of the microchannel,
the fluid properties, and the flow velocity. The equations of motion are solved
to study particle transport and capture. The analysis indicates that the
particles exhibit an oscillatory motion as they traverse the microsystem, and
that a high capture efficiency can be obtained in practice.

Raman scattering (SRS) in weakly compressed hydrogen, had been observed;
qualitative and quantitative results had been obtained, and are given in this
article. .An attempt to interpret this emission on a phenomenological basis is
presented, on the basis of a model in which the influence of hydrogen molecule
anharmonicity is taken into account, leading to two main effects:1) possible
existence of an intermediate state involving a vibrationally excited
quasiparticle system, the lifetime of which should be very short (0.1-1 ps); 2)
nonlinear coupling between the Stokes light wave and the longitudinal
propagating waves associated to the quasiparticle system. Moreover, several
processes are also to be taken into account; existence of a macroscopic
longitudinal electric field, due to coulombian interactions; electrostriction
effect giving rise to a ""piezoelectric"" character for the quasiparticle system;
Cherenkov-type and anomalous relativistic Doppler effects. Then, the source of
the coherent microwave radiation might be the in phase quadrature part of the
longitudinal polarisation associated to the quasiparticle waves, and its
emission should appear like parametric instabilities. Concerning the SRS
process itself, an additional contribution to the Raman gain should arise from
the laser induced electro-optic effect.

transition and folding rates of globular proteins on the number of amino acid
residues, $N$, using lattice models with side chains,off-lattice Go models and
the available experimental data. A dimensionless measure of cooperativity,
$\Omega_c$ ($0 < \Omega_c < \infty$), scales as $\Omega_c \sim N^{\zeta}$. The
results of simulations and the analysis of experimental data further confirm
the earlier prediction that $\zeta$ is universal with $\zeta = 1 +\gamma$,
where exponent $\gamma$ characterizes the susceptibility of a self-avoiding
walk. This finding suggests that the structural characteristics in the
denaturated state are manifested in the folding cooperativity at the transition
temperature. The folding rates $k_F$ for the Go models and a dataset of 69
proteins can be fit using $k_F = k_F^0 \exp(-cN^\beta)$. Both $\beta = 1/2$ and
2/3 provide a good fit of the data. We find that $k_F = k_F^0
\exp(-cN^{{1/2}})$, with the average (over the dataset of proteins) $k_F^0
\approx (0.2\mu s)^{-1}$ and $c \approx 1.1$, can be used to estimate folding
rates to within an order of magnitude in most cases. The minimal models give
identical $N$ dependence with $c \approx 1$. The prefactor for off-lattice Go
models is nearly four orders of magnitude larger than the experimental value.
