spectroscopic redshift from the Subaru telescope, is the first gamma-ray burst
to be identified from beyond the epoch of reionization. Since the progenitors
of long gamma-ray bursts have been identified as massive stars, this event
offers a unique opportunity to investigate star formation environments at this
epoch. Apart from its record redshift, the burst is remarkable in two respects:
first, it exhibits fast-evolving X-ray and optical flares that peak
simultaneously at t~470 s in the observer frame, and may thus originate in the
same emission region; and second, its afterglow exhibits an accelerated decay
in the near-infrared (NIR) from t~10^4 s to t~3 10^4 s after the burst,
coincident with repeated and energetic X-ray flaring activity. We make a
complete analysis of available X-ray, NIR, and radio observations, utilizing
afterglow models that incorporate a range of physical effects not previously
considered for this or any other GRB afterglow, and quantifying our model
uncertainties in detail via Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. In the process,
we explore the possibility that the early optical and X-ray flare is due to
synchrotron and inverse Compton emission from the reverse shock regions of the
outflow. We suggest that the period of accelerated decay in the NIR may be due
to suppression of synchrotron radiation by inverse Compton interaction of X-ray
flare photons with electrons in the forward shock; a subsequent interval of
slow decay would then be due to a progressive decline in this suppression. The
range of acceptable models demonstrates that the kinetic energy and circumburst
density of GRB 050904 are well above the typical values found for low-redshift
GRBs.

  Information, all in one PDF file","Nature 444:730-733,2006","10.1038/NATURE05389",,"astro-ph",,"  A long-standing question is whether active galactic nuclei (AGN) vary like
Galactic black hole systems when appropriately scaled up by mass (refs 1-3). If
so, we can then determine how AGN should behave on cosmological timescales by
studying the brighter and much faster varying Galactic systems. As X-ray
emission is produced very close to the black holes, it provides one of the best
diagnostics of their behaviour. A characteristic timescale, which potentially
could tell us about the mass of the black hole, is found in the X-ray
variations from both AGN and Galactic black holes (refs 1-6), but whether it is
physically meaningful to compare the two has been questioned (ref 7). Here we
report that, after correcting for variations in the accretion rate, the
timescales can be physically linked, revealing that the accretion process is
exactly the same for small and large black holes. Strong support for this
linkage comes, perhaps surprisingly, from the permitted optical emission lines
in AGN whose widths (in both broad-line AGN and narrow-emission-line Seyfert 1
galaxies) correlate strongly with the characteristic X-ray timescale, exactly
as expected from the AGN black hole masses and accretion rates. So AGN really
are just scaled-up Galactic black holes.

about 30% of the baryons. We further find that the ratio of broad to narrow
Ly\alpha absorbers is higher at z<0.4 than at 1.5<z<3.6, implying that a larger
fraction of the low redshift universe is hotter and/or more kinematically
disturbed. We base these conclusions on an analysis of 7 QSOs observed with
both FUSE and the HST/STIS E140M ultraviolet echelle spectrograph. Our sample
has 341 HI absorbers with a total unblocked redshift path of 2.064. The
observed absorber population is complete for log N_HI>13.2, with a column
density distribution f(N_HI) \propto N^-\beta_HI. For narrow (b<40 km/s)
absorbers \beta = 1.76+/-0.06. The distribution of the Doppler parameter b at
low redshift implies two populations: narrow (b<40 km/s) and broad (b>40 km/s)
Ly\alpha absorbers (referred to as NLAs and BLAs, respectively). Both the NLAs
and some BLAs probe the cool (T~10^4 K) photoionized IGM. The BLAs also probe
the highly-ionized gas of the warm-hot IGM (T~10^5-10^6 K). The distribution of

distributions in the light of Swift 2-year data, focusing in particular on the
relatively large sample of GRBs detected at z>2.5. We show that models in which
GRBs trace the cosmic star formation and are described by a constant LF are
ruled out by the number of high-z Swift detections. This conclusion does not
depend on the redshift distribution of bursts that lack of optical
identification, nor on the existence of a decline in star formation rate at

explained by assuming that the LF varies with redshift and/or that GRB

  COSMOS Special Issue",,"10.1086/516589",,"astro-ph",,"  zCOSMOS is a large redshift survey that is being undertaken in the COSMOS
field using 600 hours of observation with the VIMOS spectrograph on the 8-m
VLT. The survey is designed to characterise the environments of COSMOS galaxies
from the 100 kpc scales of galaxy groups up to the 100 Mpc scale of the cosmic
web and to produce diagnostic information on galaxies and active galactic
nuclei. The zCOSMOS survey consists of two parts: (a) zCOSMOS-bright, a
magnitude-limited I-band IAB < 22.5 sample of about 20,000 galaxies with 0.1 <
z < 1.2 covering the whole 1.7 deg2 COSMOS ACS field and designed to mimic the
parameters of the 2dfGRS; and (b) zCOSMOS-deep, a survey of approximately
10,000 galaxies selected through colour-selection criteria to have 1.4 < z <
3.0, within the central 1 deg2. This paper describes the survey design and the
construction of the target catalogues, and briefly outlines the observational
program and the data pipeline. In the first observing season, spectra of 1303
zCOSMOS-bright targets and of 977 zCOSMOS-deep targets have been obtained.
These are briefly analysed to demonstrate the characteristics that may be
expected from zCOSMOS, and particularly zCOSMOS-bright, when it is finally
completed between 2008-2009. The power of combining spectroscopic and
photometric redshifts is demonstrated, especially in correctly identifying the
emission line in single-line spectra and in determining which of the less
reliable spectroscopic redshifts are correct and which are incorrect. Our
zCOSMOS-deep spectra demonstrate the effectiveness of our selection techniques
to isolate high redshift galaxies at 1.4 < z < 3.0 and of VIMOS to measure
their redshifts using ultraviolet absorption lines.

significantly interacted with either the Milky Way or M31. Additionally,
Keck/Deimos spectroscopic observations identify this galaxy as a distinct
kinematic population possessing a systematic velocity of $-87\pm2{\rm km\
s^{-1}}$ and with a velocity dispersion of $17\pm2{\rm km s^{-1}}$; while
tentative, these data also suggest that Cetus possesses a moderate rotational
velocity of $\sim8{\rm km s^{-1}}$. The population is confirmed to be
relatively metal-poor, consistent with ${\rm [Fe/H]\sim-1.9}$, and, assuming
virial equilibrium, implies that the Cetus dwarf galaxy possesses a
$M/L\sim70$. It appears, therefore, that Cetus may represent a primordial dwarf
galaxy, retaining the kinematic and structural properties lost by other members
of the dwarf population of the Local Group in their interactions with the large
galaxies. An analysis of Cetus's orbit through the Local Group indicates that
it is at apocentre; taken in conjunction with the general dwarf population,
this shows the mass of the Local Group to be $\gta2\times10^{12}M_\odot$.

selection criteria are f(24um) > 0.9mJy, nu fnu(24um)/nu fnu(8um) > 3.16 and nu
fnu(24um)/nu fnu(0.7um) > 10. Of the 52 spectra, 47 (90%) produced measurable
redshifts based solely on the mid-IR spectral features, with the majority
(35/47=74%) at 1.5<z<3.2. Keck spectroscopy of a sub-sample (17/47) agrees with
the mid-IR redshift measurements. The observed spectra fall crudely into three
categories -- (1) 33% (17/52) have strong PAH emission, and are probably
powered by star formation with total IR luminosity roughly a factor of 5 higher
than the local starburst ULIRGs. (2) 33% (17/52) have only deep silicate
absorption at 9.8um, indicative of deeply embedded dusty systems. The energetic
nature of the heating sources in these systems can not be determined by these
data alone. (3) The remainder 34% are mid-IR continuum dominated systems with
either weak PAH emission and/or silicate absorption. This third of the sample
are probably AGNs. From the silicate absorption feature, we estimate that
roughly two-thirds of the sample have optical depth tau(9.8um) > 1. Their
$L_{1600\AA}$ and $L_{\rm IR}$ suggest that our sample is among the most
luminous and most dust enshrouded systems of its epoch . Our study has revealed
a significant population of dust enshrouded galaxies at z~2, whose enormous
energy output, comparable to that of quasars, is generated by AGN as well as
starburst. This IR luminous population has very little overlap with sub-mm and

the velocities and visibility of the satellites vary with phase. This behavior
is similar to emission line profile variations recently reported in the low
state of AM Her, which were interpreted as being due to magnetically-confined
gas motions in large loops near the secondary. Our low-state spectroscopy of ST
LMi is discussed in terms of extreme chromospheric activity on the secondary
star. Concurrent photometry indicates that occasional low-level accretion may
be present, as well as cool regions on the secondary near L1. Furthermore, we
report a new ``extreme low-state'' of the system at V~18.5mag. Our orbital
high-state spectroscopy reveals changes in the emission line profiles with
orbital phases that are similar to those reported by earlier high-state
studies. The complicated emission line profiles generally consist of two main
components. The first has radial velocity variations identical to that of the
major emission H-alpha component seen in the low state. The second is an
additional red-shifted component appearing at the phases of maximum visibility
of the accreting column of the white dwarf; it is interpreted as being due to
infall velocities on the accreting magnetic pole of the white dwarf. At the
opposite phases, an extended blue emission wing appears on the emission line
profiles. We confirm the presence of a broad absorption feature near 6275Ang

H-alpha. This feature appears at just those phases when the accretion pole
region is mostly directly visible and most nearly face-on to the observer.

from the recent analysis by Pessah and Psaltis, and other MRI results in the

outstanding problems in accretion disc theory. The discs would be thicker than
standard (Shakura-Sunyaev) discs at the same radius and accretion rate, and
would tend to have higher colour temperatures. If they transport angular
momentum according to an alpha-prescription, they would be stable against the
thermal and viscous instabilities that are found in standard disc models. In
discs fuelling active galactic nuclei, magnetic pressure support could also
alleviate the restriction on accretion rate imposed by disc self-gravity.

atmospheres of magnetic chemically peculiar (CP) stars. The Lorentz force,
which results from the interaction between the magnetic field and the induced

rotational variability of the hydrogen Balmer lines. To study this phenomena we
have initiated a systematic spectroscopic survey of the Balmer lines variation
in magnetic CP stars. In this paper we continue presentation of results of the
program focusing on the high-resolution spectral observations of A0p star \aur
(HD 40312). We have detected a significant variability of the H$\alpha$,
H$\beta$, and H$\gamma$ spectral lines during full rotation cycle of the star.
This variability is interpreted in the framework of the model atmosphere
analysis, which accounts for the Lorentz force effects. Both the inward and
outward directed Lorentz forces are considered under the assumption of the
axisymmetric dipole or dipole+quadrupole magnetic field configurations. We
demonstrate that only the model with the outward directed Lorentz force in the
dipole+quadrupole configuration is able to reproduce the observed hydrogen line
variation. These results present new strong evidences for the presence of
non-zero global electric currents in the atmosphere of an early-type magnetic

anisotropic system that hosts a central supermassive black hole (SBH). Such
systems have never been tested before for stability, although high anisotropies
have been considered in the dynamical models that were used to estimate the
masses of the central putative supermassive black holes. A family of analytical
anisotropic spherical Hernquist models with and without a black hole were
investigated by means of N-body simulations. A clear trend emerges that the
supermassive black hole has a significant effect on the overall stability of
the system, i.e. an SBH with a mass of a few percent of the total mass of the
galaxy can prevent or reduce the bar instabilities in anisotropic systems. Its
mass not only determines the strength of the instability reduction, but also
the time in which this occurs. These effects are most significant for models
with strong radial anisotropies. Furthermore, our analysis shows that unstable
systems with similar SBH but with different anisotropy radii evolve
differently: highly radial systems become oblate, while more isotropic models
tend to form into prolate structures. In addition to this study, we also
present a Monte-Carlo algorithm to generate particles in spherical anisotropic
systems.

combines first-principles calculations and low-temperature STM experiments.
Density functional theory calculations show that Fe-Ni alloy surfaces are
buckled with the Fe atoms slightly shifted outwards and the Ni atoms inwards.
This is consistent with the observation that the atoms in the surface layer can
be chemically distinguished in the STM image: brighter spots (corrugation
maxima with increased apparent height) indicate iron atoms, darker ones nickel
atoms. This chemical contrast reveals a c2x2 chemical order (50% Fe) with
frequent Fe-rich defects on Invar alloy surface. The calculations also indicate
that subsurface composition fluctuations may additionally modulate the apparent
height of the surface atoms. The STM images show that this effect is pronounced
compared to the surfaces of other disordered alloys, which suggests that some
chemical order and corresponding concentration fluctuations exist also in the
subsurface layers of Invar alloy. In addition, detailed electronic structure
calculations allow us to identify the nature of a distinct peak below the Fermi
level observed in the tunneling spectra. This peak corresponds to a surface
resonance band which is particularly pronounced in iron-rich surface regions
and provides a second type of chemical contrast with less spatial resolution
but one that is essentially independent of the subsurface composition.

nanoparticles in the presence of a metal subsystem (metal nanocrystals). In the
presence of metal nanocrystals, the Foerster process can become faster and more
long-range. The enhancement of Foerster transfer occurs due to the effect of
plasmon-assisted amplification of electric fields inside the nanoscale
assembly. Simultaneously, metal nanocrystals lead to an increase of energy
losses during the Foerster transfer process. We derive convenient equations for
the energy transfer rates, photoluminescence intensities, and energy
dissipation rates in the please of plasmon resonances. Because of strong
dissipation due to the metal, an experimental observation of plasmon-enhanced
Foerster transfer requires special conditions. As possible experimental
methods, we consider cw- and time-resolved photoluminescence studies and
describe the conditions to observe plasmon-enhanced transfer. In particular, we
show that the photoluminescence spectra should be carefully analyzed since the
plasmon-enhanced Foerster effect can appear together with strong exciton energy
dissipation. Our results can be applied to a variety of experimental nanoscale
systems.

light emitted by a chaotic source, highlighting the importance of two-photon
correlations and stimulating the development of modern quantum optics . The
quantum interpretation of bunching relies upon the constructive interference
between amplitudes involving two indistinguishable photons, and its additive
character is intimately linked to the Bose nature of photons. Advances in atom
cooling and detection have led to the observation and full characterisation of
the atomic analogue of the HBT effect with bosonic atoms. By contrast, fermions
should reveal an antibunching effect, i.e., a tendency to avoid each other.
Antibunching of fermions is associated with destructive two-particle
interference and is related to the Pauli principle forbidding more than one
identical fermion to occupy the same quantum state. Here we report an
experimental comparison of the fermion and the boson HBT effects realised in
the same apparatus with two different isotopes of helium, 3He (a fermion) and
4He (a boson). Ordinary attractive or repulsive interactions between atoms are
negligible, and the contrasting bunching and antibunching behaviours can be
fully attributed to the different quantum statistics. Our result shows how
atom-atom correlation measurements can be used not only for revealing details
in the spatial density, or momentum correlations in an atomic ensemble, but
also to directly observe phase effects linked to the quantum statistics in a
many body system. It may thus find applications to study more exotic situations

that the geometry of Au$_{19}$ is exactly identical to that of Au$_{20}$ with
one missing corner atom (called as vacancy). Surprisingly, our calculated heat
capacities for this nearly identical pair of gold cluster exhibit dramatic
differences. Au$_{20}$ undergoes a clear and distinct solid like to liquid like
transition with a sharp peak in the heat capacity curve around 770 K. On the
other hand, Au$_{19}$ has a broad and flat heat capacity curve with continuous
melting transition. This continuous melting transition turns out to be a
consequence of a process involving series of atomic rearrangements along the
surface to fill in the missing corner atom. This results in a restricted
diffusive motion of atoms along the surface of Au$_{19}$ between 650 K to 900 K
during which the shape of the ground state geometry is retained. In contrast,
the tetrahedral structure of Au$_{20}$ is destroyed around 800 K, and the
cluster is clearly in a liquid like state above 1000 K. Thus, this work clearly
demonstrates that (i) the gold clusters exhibit size sensitive variations in
the heat capacity curves and (ii) the broad and continuous melting transition
in a cluster, a feature which has so far been attributed to the disorder or
absence of symmetry in the system, can also be a consequence of a defect

  Programming","Theory and Practice of Logic Programming, 8 (1): 33-80, 2008",,,"cs.PL",,"  This paper presents a new type analysis for logic programs. The analysis is
performed with a priori type definitions; and type expressions are formed from
a fixed alphabet of type constructors. Non-discriminative union is used to join
type information from different sources without loss of precision. An operation
that is performed repeatedly during an analysis is to detect if a fixpoint has
been reached. This is reduced to checking the emptiness of types. Due to the
use of non-discriminative union, the fundamental problem of checking the
emptiness of types is more complex in the proposed type analysis than in other
type analyses with a priori type definitions. The experimental results,
however, show that use of tabling reduces the effect to a small fraction of
analysis time on a set of benchmarks.

only the sellers have a price - time elasticity, whereas the buyers are assumed
to be impatient. Sellers select their selling price as a best response to all

Internet today. In one form of a DDoS attack, a large number of compromised
hosts send unwanted traffic to the victim, thus exhausting the resources of the
victim and preventing it from serving its legitimate clients. One of the main
mechanisms that have been proposed to deal with DDoS is filtering, which allows
routers to selectively block unwanted traffic. Given the magnitude of DDoS
attacks and the high cost of filters in the routers today, the successful
mitigation of a DDoS attack using filtering crucially depends on the efficient
allocation of filtering resources. In this paper, we consider a single router,
typically the gateway of the victim, with a limited number of available
filters. We study how to optimally allocate filters to attack sources, or
entire domains of attack sources, so as to maximize the amount of good traffic
preserved, under a constraint on the number of filters. We formulate the
problem as an optimization problem and solve it optimally using dynamic
programming, study the properties of the optimal allocation, experiment with a
simple heuristic and evaluate our solutions for a range of realistic
attack-scenarios. First, we look at a single-tier where the collateral damage
is high due to the filtering at the granularity of domains. Second, we look at
the two-tier problem where we have an additional constraint on the number of
filters and the filtering is performed on the granularity of attackers and
domains.

quantum trace anomaly to this issue. The trace anomaly implies additional terms
in the low energy effective theory of gravity, which amounts to a non-trivial

Equivalence Principle. We show that the new dynamical degrees of freedom the

cosmological scales. We consider possible signatures of the restoration of
conformal invariance predicted by the fluctuations of these new scalar degrees
of freedom on the spectrum and statistics of the CMB, in light of the latest
bounds from WMAP. Finally we assess the prospects for a new cosmological model

boundary, and therefore remains naturally of order H^2 at all times without

possible orbifold groups that lead to co-dimension four singularities. We
describe how to blow up such singularities, and then derive the moduli Kaehler
potential for M-theory on the resulting class of G_2 manifolds. To consider the
singular limit it is necessary to derive the supergravity action for M-theory
on the orbifold C^2/Z_N. We do this by coupling 11-dimensional supergravity to
a seven-dimensional Yang-Mills theory located on the orbifold fixed plane. We
show that the resulting action is supersymmetric to leading non-trivial order

reduce M-theory on a toroidal G_2 orbifold with co-dimension four
singularities, taking explicitly into account the additional gauge fields at

bifurcation point in circular Couette flow has been investigated. The
disturbance is represented by a Fourier integral over all possible axial
wavenumbers, and an integrodifferential equation for the amplitude-density
function of a continuous spectrum is derived. The equations describing the
evolution of monochromatic waves and slowly-varying wave-packets of classical
weakly nonlinear instability theories are shown to be special limiting cases.
Numerical integration of the integrodifferential equation shows that the final
equilibrium state depends on the initial disturbance, as observed
experimentally, and it is not unique. The predicted range of wavenumbers for
stable supercritical Taylor vortices is found to be narrower than the span of
the neutral curve from linear theory. Taylor-vortex flows with wavenumbers
outside this range are found to be unstable and to decay, but to excite another
wave inside the narrow band. This result is in agreement with the Eckhaus and
Benjamin-Feir sideband instability. The presence of multiple solutions at a
fixed Reynolds number for a given geometry in Taylor-Couette flows has been
known since Coles monumental contribution in 1965. It is worthwhile to note
that the existence of multiple solutions, found by Coles, differs from current
popular bifurcation theories. The multiple solutions in Coles sense have also
been found for mixed-convection flows (Yao & Ghosh Moulic 1993, 1994) besides
the Taylor-Couette flows. We believe that the nonuniqueness of Coles sense,
which complements the bifurcation theories, is a generic property for all fluid
flows.

(DPD) simulation method we are able to address the coupled diffusion,
self-assembly, and chemical reaction processes, required to model a full life
cycle of the protocell, the protocell being composed of coupled genetic,
metabolic, and container subsystems. Utilizing this minimal structural and

been revisited due to the dynamical contraction of the whole phase space onto
attractors. In particular the standard framework of the
""fluctuation-dissipation"" theorem breaks down and new resonances can show up
oustside the powerspectrum. In previous papers we proposed and used new
numerical methods to demonstrate the presence of the new resonances predicted
by Ruelle in a model of chaotic neural network. In this article we deal with
simpler models which can be worked out analytically in order to gain more
insights into the genesis of the ``stable'' resonances and their consequences
on the linear response of the system. We consider a class of 2-dimensional
time-discrete maps describing simple rotator models with a contracting radial
dynamics onto the unit circle and a chaotic angular dynamics $\theta_{t+1} = 2
\theta_t (\mod 2\pi)$. A generalisation of this system to a network of
interconnected rotators is also analysed and related with our previous studies
\cite{CS1,CS2}. These models permit us to classify the different types of
resonances in the susceptibility and to discuss in particular the relation
between the relaxation time of the system to equilibrium with the {\em mixing}
time given by the decay of the correlation functions. Also it enables one to
propose some general mechanisms responsible for the creation of stable
resonances with arbitrary frequencies, widths, and dependency on the pair of
perturbed/observed variables.

fused to a bound nuclear system in the final state. The first exclusive

CELSIUS-WASA for the fusion reactions leading to d, $^3$He and $^4$He nuclei in

the formation of a strongly attractive $\Delta\Delta$ system. The data for the

It
is a central magnitude in finance closely related to the risk of holding a
certain asset. Despite its popularity on trading floors, the volatility is
unobservable and only the price is known. Diffusion theory has many common
points with the research on volatility, the key of the analogy being that
volatility is the time-dependent diffusion coefficient of the random walk for
the price return. We present a formal procedure to extract volatility from
price data, by assuming that it is described by a hidden Markov process which
together with the price form a two-dimensional diffusion process. We derive a
maximum likelihood estimate valid for a wide class of two-dimensional diffusion
processes. The choice of the exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (expOU) stochastic
volatility model performs remarkably well in inferring the hidden state of
volatility. The formalism is applied to the Dow Jones index. The main results
are: (i) the distribution of estimated volatility is lognormal, which is
consistent with the expOU model; (ii) the estimated volatility is related to
trading volume by a power law of the form $\sigma \propto V^{0.55}$; and (iii)
future returns are proportional to the current volatility which suggests some
degree of predictability for the size of future returns.

mechanics and electromagnetism we predict the presence of a universal
attractive depolarisation radiation (DR) Lorentz force ($F$) between quantum
entities, each being either an IED matter particle or light quantum, in a
vacuuonic dielectric vacuum. Given two quantum entities $i=1,2$ of either kind,
of characteristic frequencies $\nu_i^0$, masses $m_i^0=h\nu_i^0 / c^2$ and
separated at a distance r^0, the solution is $F=- G m_1^0 m_2^0/ (r^0)^2$,
where $G= \chi_0^2 e^4/12 \pi^2 \epsilon_0^2 \rho_\lambda$, $\chi_0$ is the
susceptibility and $\rho_\lambda$ is the reduced linear mass density of the
dielectric vacuum. This force $F$ is accurate at the weak $F$ limit and
resembles in all respects Newton's gravity; hence $G$ is the gravitational
constant. The DR wave fields and hence the gravity is propagated in the
dielectric vacuum at the speed of light $c$; these can not be shielded by
matter. A test particle $\mu$ of mass $m^0$ at $r^0$ apart from a large mass
$M$ is therefore gravitated by all of the building particles of M directly, by
a total gravitational potential $V = -G M m^0/ r^0$. For a finite $V$ and hence
a total Hamiltonian $H= m^0 c^2 +V$, solution for the eigenvalue equation of
$\mu$ presents a red-shift in the eigen frequency $\nu= \nu^0 (1- GM/r^0 c^2)$
and accordingly other wave variables. The quantum solutions combined with the
wave nature of the gravity further lead to dilated gravito optical distance
$r=r^0/(1- GM/r^0 c^2) $ and time $t=t^0/(1- GM/r^0 c^2) $, and modified
Newton's gravity and Einstein's mass energy relation. Applications of these
give predictions of the general relativistic effects manifested in the four
classical test experiments of Einstein's general relativity (GR), in direct
agreement with the experiments and the predictions given based on GR.

and ion temperatures from tens of millikelvin to a few kelvin. They represent a
new frontier in the study of neutral plasmas, which traditionally deals with
much hotter systems, but they also blur the boundaries of plasma, atomic,
condensed matter, and low temperature physics. Modelling these plasmas
challenges computational techniques and theories of non-equilibrium systems, so
the field has attracted great interest from the theoretical and computational
physics communities. By varying laser intensities and wavelengths it is
possible to accurately set the initial plasma density and energy, and
charged-particle-detection and optical diagnostics allow precise measurements
for comparison with theoretical predictions. Recent experiments using optical
probes demonstrated that ions in the plasma equilibrate in a strongly coupled
fluid phase. Strongly coupled plasmas, in which the electrical interaction
energy between charged particles exceeds the average kinetic energy, reverse
the traditional energy hierarchy underlying basic plasma concepts such as Debye
screening and hydrodynamics. Equilibration in this regime is of particular
interest because it involves the establishment of spatial correlations between
particles, and it connects to the physics of the interiors of gas-giant planets
and inertial confinement fusion devices.

function from steady states. This leads to the interesting question, how
metabolic networks avoid complex dynamics and maintain a steady-state behavior.
Here, we expose metabolic network topologies to binary dynamics generated by
simple local rules. We find that the networks' response is highly specific:
Complex dynamics are systematically reduced on metabolic networks compared to
randomized networks with identical degree sequences. Already small topological
modifications substantially enhance the capacity of a network to host complex
dynamic behavior and thus reduce its regularizing potential. This exceptionally
pronounced regularization of dynamics encoded in the topology may explain, why
steady-state behavior is ubiquitous in metabolism.

deformation of the usual SU(2) algebra in order to obtain the effective
Hamiltonian describing correctly the dynamics for any initial states. In
particular we study two cases: In the first one we consider each atom initially

Kuperberg's algorithm for the HSP in the dihedral group, in which quantum
states are adaptively combined and measured according to the decomposition of
tensor products into irreducible representations. This ``quantum sieve'' starts
with coset states, and works its way down towards representations whose
probabilities differ depending on, for example, whether the hidden subgroup is
trivial or nontrivial.

longer optimal and degrades with increasing N . We found that optimality can be
restored by an effective preparation of the probe states and present explicitly
calculations for the 2-user case.

introduced by Kempf is generalized to a Lorentz-covariant algebra describing a

as a special case. The deformed Poincar\'e transformations leaving the algebra
invariant are identified. Uncertainty relations are studied. In the case of D=1
and one nonvanishing parameter, the bound-state energy spectrum and
wavefunctions of the Dirac oscillator are exactly obtained.

dimensions, depicting a particle moving in a semi-infinite layer, is
re-examined in the light of recent theories describing superintegrable
two-dimensional systems with integrals of motion that are quadratic functions
of the momenta. To get the energy spectrum a quadratic algebra approach is used
together with a realization in terms of deformed parafermionic oscillator
operators. In this process, the importance of supplementing algebraic
considerations with a proper treatment of boundary conditions for selecting
physical wavefunctions is stressed. Some new results for matrix elements are
derived. Finally, the two-dimensional model is extended to two integrable and
exactly solvable (but not superintegrable) models in three dimensions,
depicting a particle in a semi-infinite parallelepipedal or cylindrical
channel, respectively.
