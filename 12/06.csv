molecular cloud with an ionising source at its centre. The gas in the cloud is
self-gravitating, although the cloud is prevented from globally collapsing. We
find that the shell driven by the HII region fragments to form numerous
self--gravitating objects. We repeat our calculations at four numerical
resolutions to ensure that they are converged. We compare our results to the
analytical model of Whitworth et al, 1994 and show that our simulations and the
predictions of Whitworth et al are in good agreement in the sense that the
shell fragments at the time and radius predicted by Whitworth et al to within
20% and 25% respectively. Most of the fragments produced in our two highest
resolution calculations are approximately half the mass of those predicted, but
this conclusion is robust against both numerical resolution and the presence of
random noise (local fluctuations in density of a factor of $\sim2$) in the
initial gas distribution. We conclude that such noise has little impact on the
fragmentation process.

key role on the formation and evolution of galaxies through its gravitational
influence. On microscopic scales, dark matter particles are expected to
annihilate amongst themselves into different products, with some fraction of
the energy being transferred to the baryonic component. It is the aim of the
present work to show that, in the innermost regions of dark matter halos,
heating by dark matter annihilation may be comparable to the cooling rate of
the gas. We use analytical models of the dark matter and gas distributions in
order to estimate the heating and cooling rates, as well as the energy
available from supernova explosions. Depending on the model parameters and the
precise nature of dark matter particles, the injected energy may be enough to
balance radiative cooling in the cores of galaxy clusters. On galactic scales,
it would inhibit star formation more efficiently than supernova feedback. Our
results suggest that dark matter annihilation prevents gas cooling and star
formation within at least $0.01-1$ per cent of the virial radius.

  Method: Archival VLT near infrared K band spectra (R=8900) of three massive
young stellar objects and one Wolf-Rayet star are examined for
spectro-astrometric signatures. The young stellar objects display emission
lines such as Brackett gamma, CO 2-0 and CO 3-1 that are characteristic of
ionised regions and molecular disks respectively. Two of the sample sources
also display emission lines such as NIII and MgII that are characteristic of
high temperatures.
  Results: Most of the emission lines show spectro-astrometric signal at
various levels resulting in different positional displacements. The shapes and
magnitudes of the positional displacements imply the presence of large
disk/envelopes in emission and expanding shells of ionised gas. The results
obtained for the source 18006-2422nr766 in particular provide larger estimates

massive (1-3 x 10^5 msun) and appear to be of roughly solar metallicity.
Additionally, the three clusters appear to be relatively large (R_eff = 10-20

weak influence of the tidal field of the galaxy. All three clusters have
velocities consistent with the general trend of the HI velocities in the tidal

properties of galaxies. The structure of the cores has been shown to vary
methodically with global and nuclear properties, as cores respond to the
mechanisms by which galaxies form/evolve. The dynamical centers of galaxies
have been found capable of hosting two seemingly disparate objects:
supermassive black holes (SBHs) and compact stellar nuclei. In a drastic
departure from previous beliefs, it has been discovered that both structures
are common: galaxies lacking SBHs and/or stellar nuclei are the exception,
rather than the norm. This review explores the connection between cores, SBHs
and stellar nuclei in early-type galaxies, as revealed by the ACS Virgo Cluster
Survey. We find that, from parsec to kiloparsec scales, the surface brightness
profiles of early-type galaxies are well described by a Sersic model -- a
parametrization that is shown to be preferable to the so called `Nuker' model.
Relative to the inward extrapolation of the best fitting Sersic model, the
profiles within the inner few tens of parsecs transition from luminosity
`deficits', in the brightest (M_B < ~-20) galaxies, to luminosity `excesses' in
the faintest. The compact stellar nuclei responsible for such luminosity
excesses comprise approximatively 0.2% of the total galactic mass. Remarkably,
this is the same fraction believed to reside in the SBHs, which are
predominantly found in the brightest galaxies showing luminosity deficits.

Early attempts to predict planet yields generally resulted in overly optimistic
detection rates that have not been realized. I point out where these estimates
likely went wrong, and emphasize the strong biases and sensitivity to detection
thresholds inherent in transit surveys. I argue that meaningful comparisons
between observed and predicted detection rates require proper calibration of
these biases and thresholds. In the few cases where this has been done, the
observed rates agree with the results from radial velocity surveys for similar
stellar environments. I then go on to describe recent, detailed calculations
which should provide more accurate rates, which can be critically compared to
observed yields. Finally, I discuss expectations for future all-sky synoptic
surveys, which may have the sensitivity to detect hundreds or thousands of
close-in transiting planets. Realizing the enormous potential of these surveys
will require novel methods of coping with the overwhelming number of

redshift z_g \sim 0.22, atmospheric hydrogen column y_H \approx 1 g cm^-2, and
magnetic field B \approx (3-4)x10^12 G; the values for the temperature and
magnetic field indicate an effective average over the surface. We also
calculate a more realistic model, which accounts for magnetic field and
temperature variations over the neutron star surface as well as general
relativistic effects, to determine pulsations; we find there exist viewing
geometries that produce pulsations near the currently observed limits. The
origin of the thin atmospheres required to fit the data is an important
question, and we briefly discuss mechanisms for producing these atmospheres.
Our model thus represents the most self-consistent picture to date for
explaining all the observations of RX J1856.5-3754.

allows one to probe the shape distortions of galaxy substructures, which can
potentially provide much more independent shear measurements than the

  Archeops maps for both Mirage and coaddition map-making, have been found to

the evolution of red luminosity densities, i.e. stellar mass density and
specific star formation rate. Photometric redshift techniques, when applied to

tunnel-barriers. We derive results for arbitrary tunnelling rates and arbitrary
(positive) Ehrenfest time, $\tau_{\rm E}$. For all Ehrenfest times, we show
that the shot-noise is enhanced by the tunnelling, while the weak-localization
is suppressed. In the opaque barrier limit (small tunnelling rates with large
lead widths, such that Drude conductance remains finite), the weak-localization
goes to zero linearly with the tunnelling rate, while the Fano factor of the
shot-noise remains finite but becomes independent of the Ehrenfest time. The
crossover from RMT behaviour ($\tau_{\rm E}=0$) to classical behaviour
($\tau_{\rm E}=\infty$) goes exponentially with the ratio of the Ehrenfest time
to the paired-paths survival time. The paired-paths survival time varies
between the dwell time (in the transparent barrier limit) and half the dwell
time (in the opaque barrier limit). Finally our method enables us to see the
physical origin of the suppression of weak-localization; it is due to the fact
that tunnel-barriers ``smear'' the coherent-backscattering peak over reflection

the anomalous scaling dimensions of the dominant scalar operators with $2s$

for ordinary, metallic systems (Wigner-Dyson classes), an infinite number of

We explore the possibility to compare, in symmetry class D, the

Two significant deeply connected features of this spin model are: a special

size-dependent mean value of magnetisation in the low-temperature phase that
goes to zero (according to the Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg theorem) in the
thermodynamic limit. We focus our attention on the asymptotic behaviour of the
spin-spin correlation function and the probability distribution of
magnetisation. The analytic approach is based on the spin-wave approximation
valid for the low-temperature regime and an expansion in the parameters which
characterise the deviation from completely homogeneous configuration of
impurities. We further support the analytic considerations by Monte Carlo
simulations performed for different concentrations of impurities and compare
analytic and MC results. We present as the main quantitative result of the work
the exponent of the spin-spin correlation function power law decay. It is non
universal depending not only on temperature as in the pure model but also on

consideration that the Landau levels quantization can follow directly from the
existence of a topological winding number. The microscopic computation of the
current can then be performed within the Keldysh formalism in a systematic way
at finite magnetic fields $B$ (i.e. beyond the semi-classical limit $B =

long as the gradient expansion theory is applicable. As a result, the total
current is expressed in terms of edge contributions only. We obtain the first

processes, and derive in a transparent way the quantization of the Hall
conductance. Finally, we point out qualitatively the importance of
inhomogeneities of the vortex density to capture the dissipative longitudinal

of a prime knot tied into a polymer ring. In the good solvent regime the
polymer is modelled by a self avoiding polygon of N steps on cubic lattice and
l is the number of steps over which the knot ``spreads'' in a given
configuration. An analysis of extensive Monte Carlo data in equilibrium shows
that the probability distribution of l as a function of N obeys a scaling of
the form p(l,N) ~ l^(-c) f(l/N^D), with c ~ 1.25 and D ~ 1. Both D and c could
be independent of knot type. As a consequence, the knot is weakly localized,
i.e. <l> ~ N^t, with t=2-c ~ 0.75. For a ring with fixed knot type, weak
localization implies the existence of a peculiar characteristic length l^(nu) ~
N^(t nu). In the scaling ~ N^(nu) (nu ~0.58) of the radius of gyration of the
whole ring, this length determines a leading power law correction which is much
stronger than that found in the case of unrestricted topology. The existence of
such correction is confirmed by an analysis of extensive Monte Carlo data for
the radius of gyration. The collapsed regime is studied by introducing in the
model sufficiently strong attractive interactions for nearest neighbor sites
visited by the self-avoiding polygon. In this regime knot length determinations
can be based on the entropic competition between two knotted loops separated by
a slip link. These measurements enable us to conclude that each knot is
delocalized (t ~ 1).

determines a distribution over potentially a very large number of classical

  Loosely speaking, a $T$-function is a map of $n$-bit words into $n$-bit words
such that each $i$-th bit of image depends only on low-order bits $0,..., i$ of
the pre-image. For example, all arithmetic operations (addition,
multiplication) are $T$-functions, all bitwise logical operations ($\XOR$,
$\AND$, etc.) are $T$-functions. Any composition of $T$-functions is a
$T$-function as well. Thus $T$-functions are natural computer word-oriented
functions.
  It turns out that $T$-functions are continuous (and often differentiable!)
functions with respect to the so-called 2-adic distance. This observation gives
a powerful tool to apply 2-adic analysis to construct wide classes of
$T$-functions with provable cryptographic properties (long period, balance,
uniform distribution, high linear complexity, etc.); these functions currently
are being used in new generation of fast stream ciphers. We consider these
ciphers as specific automata that could be associated to dynamical systems on
the space of 2-adic integers. From this view the lectures could be considered
as a course in cryptographic applications of the non-Archimedean dynamics; the
latter has recently attracted significant attention in connection with
applications to physics, biology and cognitive sciences.
  During the course listeners study non-Archimedean machinery and its
applications to stream cipher design.

exerted on matter at the scale of elementary particles by a perfect fluid.
Under the condition that Newtonian gravity must be recovered in the

gravity, giving a new theory in the compressible case. Here the theory is
reinterpreted so as to describe the relativistic effects, by extending the
Lorentz-Poincar\'e interpretation of special relativity which is first
recalled. Gravitational space-contraction and time-dilatation are postulated,
as a consequence of the principle of local equivalence between the effects of
motion and gravitation. The space-time metric (expressing the proper time along
a trajectory) is hence curved also in the proposed theory. As the result of a
modified Newton law, it is proved that free test particles follow geodesic
lines of this metric. In the spherical static situation, Schwarzschild's
exterior metric is exactly recovered and with it the experimental support of
general relativity, but the interior solution as well as the problematic of
singularities are different in the proposed theory, e.g. the radius of the body

only exist in a theory where Lorentz symmetry is gauged, and a theory with
spin-spin interactions is not perturbatively renormalizable. But this is not
true. By studying the motion of a spinning particle in gravitational field, it
is found that there exist spin-spin interactions in gauge theory of gravity.
Its mechanism is that a spinning particle will generate gravitomagnetic field
in space-time, and this gravitomagnetic field will interact with the spin of
another particle, which will cause spin-spin interactions. So, spin-spin
interactions are transmitted by gravitational field. The form of spin-spin
interactions in post Newtonian approximations is deduced. This result can also
be deduced from the Papapetrou equation. This kind of interactions will not
affect the renormalizability of the theory. The spin-spin interactions will
violate the weak equivalence principle, and the violation effects are
detectable. An experiment is proposed to detect the effects of the violation of

quantities obtained using the Iwasaki and DBW2 improved gauge actions, and
actions with larger rectangle coefficients, on $16^3\times32$ lattices. We seek
parameter values at which both the chiral symmetry breaking residual mass due
to the finite lattice extent in the fifth dimension and the Monte Carlo time
history for topological charge are acceptable for this set of quark masses at
lattice spacings above 0.1 fm. We find that the Iwasaki gauge action is best,
demonstrating the feasibility of using QCDOC to generate ensembles which are
good representations of the QCD path integral on lattices of up to 3 fm in
spatial extent with lattice spacings in the range 0.09-0.13 fm. Despite large
residual masses and a limited number of sea quark mass values with which to
perform chiral extrapolations, our results for light hadronic physics scale and
agree with experimental measurements within our statistical uncertainties.

assumption that $A$ is a unital separable simple C*-algebra of tracial rank
zero, or $A$ is a unital purely infinite simple C*-algebra. When they are
approximately homotopic, we also give a bound for the length of the homotopy.
Suppose that $h: C(X)\to A$ is a monomorphism and $u\in A$ is a unitary (with
$[u]=\{0\}$ in $K_1(A)$). We prove that, for any $\ep>0,$ and any compact
subset ${\cal F}\subset C(X),$ there exists $\dt>0$ and a finite subset ${\cal

$\dt$ and ${\cal G}$ are universal (independent of $A$ or $h$). In the case
that ${\rm dim} X=1,$ this provides an improvement of the so-called the Basic

  Moreover, we show that $\dt$ and ${\cal G}$ can not be universal whenever

be dependent on a measure distribution but independent of $A$ and $h.$

of the mod p cohomology of a finite group G such that H^*(G) is detected and
determined by H^d(C_G(V)) for d no bigger than d_0(G) and d_1(G), with V < G
p-elementary abelian. We study how to calculate these invariants.
  We define a number e(G) that measures the image of the restriction of H^*(G)
to its maximal central p-elementary abelian subgroup. Using Benson--Carlson
duality, we show that when $G$ has a p-central Sylow subgroup P, d_0(G) =
d_0(P) = e(P), and a similar exact formula holds for d_1(G). In general, we
show that d_0(G) is bounded above by the maximum of the e(C_G(V))'s, if
Benson's Regularity Conjecture holds. In particular, the inequality holds for
all groups such that the p--rank of G minus the depth of H^*(G) is at most 2.
When we look at examples with p=2, we learn that d_0(G) is at most 7 for all
groups with 2--Sylow subgroup of order up to 64, unless the Sylow subgroup is
isomorphic to that of either Sz(8) (and d_0(G) = 9) or SU(3,4) (and d_0(G)=14).
  Enroute we recover and strengthen theorems of Adem and Karagueuzian on

theorems about the structure of cohomology primitives associated to central
extensions.

signal-transduction, and neural networks. Coupled dynamical systems of such
threshold elements are investigated, in an effort to find differentiation of
elements induced by the interaction. Through global diffusive coupling, novel
states are found to be generated that are not the original attractor of
single-element threshold dynamics, but are sustained through the interaction
with the elements located at the original attractor. This stabilization of the
novel state(s) is not related to symmetry breaking, but is explained as the
truncation of transient trajectories to the original attractor due to the
coupling. Single-element dynamics with winding transient trajectories located
at a low-dimensional manifold and having turning points are shown to be
essential to the generation of such novel state(s) in a coupled system.

cascade model which allows for energy exchange between different scales. We
show that inclusion of the cascade process is sufficient to regularize the
well-known finite time singularity of the Restricted Euler dynamics. At the
same time, the model retains topological and geometrical features of real
turbulent flows: these include the alignment between vorticity and the
intermediate eigenvector of the strain-rate tensor and the typical teardrop
shape of the joint probability density between the two invariants, $R-Q$, of
the gradient tensor. The model also possesses skewed, non-Gaussian longitudinal
gradient fluctuations and the correct scaling of energy dissipation as a
function of Reynolds number. Derivative flatness coefficients are in good

where $k$ is the momentum of the atom and $b = 2174.0$ a.u. is a constant

contact of ultra-cold atoms with the surface, allows for the possibility of
confinement and storage of cold antihydrogen atoms. We calculate the life-time
of confinement as a function of antihydrogen energy. We develop a theory of
$\bar{H}$ in a wave-guide and propose its application to fundamental
measurements. In particular, for measurement of retardation corrections in the
long-range component of the antiatom - wall potential. We demonstrate, for

found out. Further investigations shows second order splitting of local-time
peak. From this result arise a supposition that space-time heterogeneity, which
following from local-time effect existence probably has fractal character.

small-world effect, the scale-free degree distribution, and recently discovered
topological fractal structure, have presented the possibility of a unique
growth mechanism and allow for uncovering universal origins of collective
behaviors. However, highly clustered scale-free network, with power-law degree
distribution, or small-world network models, with exponential degree
distribution, are not self-similarity. We investigate networks growth mechanism
of the branching-deactivated geographical attachment preference that learned
from certain empirical evidence of social behaviors. It yields high clustering
and spectrums of degree distribution ranging from algebraic to exponential,
average shortest path length ranging from linear to logarithmic. We observe
that the present networks fit well with small-world graphs and scale-free
networks in both limit cases (exponential and algebraic degree distribution
respectively), obviously lacking self-similar property under a length-scale
transformation. Interestingly, we find perfect topological fractal structure
emerges by a mixture of both algebraic and exponential degree distributions in
a wide range of parameter values. The results present a reliable connection
among small-world graphs, scale-free networks and topological fractal networks,
and promise a natural way to investigate universal origins of collective

stochastic differential equations based on the rate equation involving chemical
concentrations are often adopted. When the number of molecules is very small,
however, the discreteness in the number of molecules cannot be neglected since
the number of molecules must be an integer. This discreteness can be important
in biochemical reactions, where the total number of molecules is not
significantly larger than the number of chemical species. To elucidate the
effects of such discreteness, we study autocatalytic reaction systems
comprising several chemical species through stochastic particle simulations.
The generation of novel states is observed; it is caused by the extinction of
some molecular species due to the discreteness in their number. We demonstrate
that the reaction dynamics are switched by a single molecule, which leads to
the reconstruction of the acting network structure. We also show the strong
dependence of the chemical concentrations on the system size, which is caused
by transitions to discreteness-induced novel states.

(RSA) has become a widespread method for analyzing spatial patterns of animal
relocations obtained from telemetry studies. Recently, mechanistic home range
models have been proposed as an alternative framework for studying patterns of
animal space use. In contrast to RSA models, mechanistic home range models are
derived from underlying mechanistic descriptions of individual movement
behavior and yield spatially-explicit predictions for patterns of animal
space-use. In addition, their mechanistic underpinning means that, unlike RSA,
mechanistic home range models can also be used to predict changes in space-use
following perturbation. In this paper, we develop a formal reconciliation
between these two methods of home range analysis, showing how differences in
the habitat preferences of individuals give rise to spatially-explicit patterns
of space-use. The resulting unified framework combines the simplicity of
resource selection analysis with the spatially-explicit and predictive
capabilities of mechanistic home range models.

  Abstract: Mathematically the axioms of representation are subtle, and
critical. The CNS expresses its function via its internal neuronal networks in
multidimensional, intrinsic frames. CNS operation can be represented by tensor
transformations within and among general frames of reference. So-called
metaorganization principle is transforming the dual representations of
intention from one to another. The property of intentionality refers to the
fact that consciousness is about objects or events, and is modulated by
attention. To construct a new neural framework we must outgoing basicly from
the competitive interactions among widely distributed groups of neurons. A
major system in this regard is the thalamocortical system. The integrative
dynamics of conscious experience suggests that the thalamocortical system
behaves as a functional cluster that interacts mainly with itself.

GC content and protein length distribution in a unified theoretical framework.
Especially, the simulations of the evolution of amino acid frequencies and the
codon position GC content agree dramatically with the results based on the data
of all known genomes so far. Furthermore, we found that the space of average
protein length in proteome and ratio of amino acid frequencies is useful to
describe the phylogeny and evolution. Amazingly, the dots of all the species in
this space form an evolutionary flow. We believe that the amino acid gain and

frequencies. The linguistic mechanism is helpful to unveil the origin of the

developing an understanding of modern concepts in quantum optics and quantum
electronics. In this work, however, these two scenarios are utilized to
consider and discuss the salient features of quantum behaviors resulting from

spontaneous emission, etc., and to apply a measure of entanglement in analyzing
the nature of the interacting systems. ... For the coupled linear and

through the introduction of a function $\xi_k$ which depends on the boson
frequency and renormalized tunneling. The results are as follows:(1) the
non-equilibrium correlation function $P(t)$, the dynamical susceptibility
$\chi''(\omega)$ and the equilibrium correlation function $C(t)$ are
analytically obtained for $s\leq 1$; (2) the phase diagram of thermodynamic
transition shows the delocalized-localized transition point $\alpha_l$ which
agrees with exact results and numerical data from the Numerical Renormalization
Group; (3) the dynamical transition point $\alpha_c$ between coherent and
incoherent phase is explicitly given for the first time. A crossover from the
coherent oscillation to incoherent relaxation appears with increasing coupling
(for $\alpha > \alpha_c $, the coherent dynamics disappear); (4) the Shiba's
relation and sum rule are exactly satisfied when $\alpha \leq \alpha_c $; (5)
an underdamping-overdamping transition point $\alpha_c^{*}$ exists in the
function $S(\omega)$. Consequently, the dynamical phase diagrams in both ohmic
