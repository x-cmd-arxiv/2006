variability and confinement of the winds of massive stars. To date, the only
magnetic field detected in O-type stars are those of theta 1 Ori C (HD 37022;
Donati et al. 2002), the brightest and most massive member of the Orion Nebula
Cluster (ONC), and HD 191612 (Donati et al. 2006). Notably, theta 1 Ori C is an
intense X-ray emitter, and the source of these X-rays is thought to be strong
shocks occurring in its magnetically-confined wind (Babel & Montmerle 1997a,
Donati et al. 2002).
  Recently, Stelzer et al. (2005) found significant X-ray emission from all
massive stars in the ONC. Periodic rotational modulation in X-rays and other
indicators suggested that theta 1 Ori C may be but one of many magnetic B- and
O-type stars in this star-forming region. In 2005B we carried out sensitive
ESPaDOnS observations to search for direct evidence of such fields, detecting
unambiguous Zeeman signatures in two objects.

recent Paper I, using the partially screened gap (PSG) model of inner

subpulses observed in a radio-band and the thermal X-ray luminosity from polar
caps heated by the back-flow particle bombardment. This relationship can be
tested for pulsars in which the so-called carousel rotation time $P_4$,
reflecting the \EB plasma drift, and the thermal X-ray luminosity $L_x$ from
the hot polar cap are known. To test the model we used only two available
pulsars: PSRs B0943+10 and B1133+16. They both satisfied the model prediction,
although due to low photon statistics the thermal component could not be firmly
identified from the X-ray data. Nevertheless, these pulsars were at least
consistent with PSG pulsar model.
  In the present paper we consider two more pulsars: PSRs B0656+14 and
B0628-28, whose data have recently become available. In PSR B0656+14 the
thermal radiation from the hot polar cap was clearly detected, and PSR B0628-28
also seems to have such a component.
  In all cases for which both $P_4$ and $L_x$ are presently known, the PSG
pulsar model seems to be fully confirmed. Other available models of inner
acceleration region fail to explain the observed relationship between radio and
X-ray data. The pure vacuum gap model predicts too high $L_x$ and too low
$P_4$, while the space charge limited model predicts too low $L_x$ and the
origin of the subpulse drift has no natural explanation.

cases where the dark matter follows a pure NFW profile and where an initial NFW

find that both of these scenarios can produce a reasonable fit to the observed

c_{vir}=51 that is well outside the range predicted in LCDM cosmology and is
therefore disfavoured. An adiabatically contracted NFW halo favors an initial

line with the cosmological expectations for a galaxy of the size of M31. The
best-fit mass is consistent with published estimates from Andromeda Stream
kinematics, satellite galaxy radial velocities, and planetary nebulae studies.
Finally, using the known linear correlation between rotation curve shear and

degrees of the plane of the sky, or they are only mildly relativistic, and are
pointing at an angle between 30 - 50 degrees from the plane of the sky. The
arcsecond resolution VLA data enable us to investigate the large scale
structure of the radio source. The morphology of the low frequency radio lobes
clearly indicates that they are associated with the cavities present in the
X-ray emission. Low frequency observations also reveal an extension to the
south corresponding to an X-ray hole. The age of these bubbles, computed from
the sound speed, the buoyancy time and the radiative age are all in fair
agreement with each other. Estimates of the power necessary to inflate these

phase in which its X-ray light curve is dominated, for some time, by thermal
emission from an accretion disk surrounding the black hole. The accretion
physics in the thermal-dominant state is understood better than in any other,
and it is therefore the best state for comparing observations to theoretical
models. Here, I present simulations that study the way a thermally-emitting
disk might be expected to behave immediately after a large-scale, steady jet
has been removed from the system in the form of a sudden ejection. I simulate
the ejection's effect on the disk by allowing the strength of turbulence
(modeled by the alpha parameter of Shakura and Sunyaev) to increase rapidly in
time, and I show how this change can lead to an outburst in an otherwise-steady
disk. The motivation for treating the jet removal in this way is the fact that
many models for jets involve large-scale magnetic fields that should inhibit
the magnetorotational instability believed to drive turbulence; this should
naturally lead to a rapid increase in turbulence when the magnetic field is
ejected from the system or otherwise destroyed during the ejection event. I
show how the timescale and luminosity of the outburst can be controlled by the
manner in which alpha is allowed to change, and I briefly discuss ways in which
these simulations can be compared to observations of X-ray binaries, in
particular GRS 1915+105, which shows the most complex and variable behavior of

charged colloid (macroion) in an electrolyte solution is studied in the
framework of the primitive model. Hydrodynamic interactions are fully taken
into account by applying a hybrid simulation scheme, where the charged ions
(i.e. macroion and electrolyte), propagated via molecular dynamics (MD), are
coupled to a Lattice Boltzmann (LB) fluid. In a recent experiment it was shown
that, for multivalent salt ions, the mobility $\mu$ initially increases with
charge density $\sigma$, reaches a maximum and then decreases with further
increase of $\sigma$. The aim of the present work is to elucidate the behaviour
of $\mu$ at high values of $\sigma$. Even for the case of monovalent microions,
we find a decrease of $\mu$ with $\sigma$. A dynamic Stern layer is defined
that includes all the counterions that move with the macroion while subject to
an external electrical field. The number of counterions in the Stern layer,
$q_0$, is a crucial parameter for the behavior of $\mu$ at high values of
$\sigma$. In this case, the mobility $\mu$ depends primarily on the ratio
$q_0/Q$ (with $Q$ the valency of the macroion). The previous contention that
the increase in the distortion of the electric double layer (EDL) with
increasing $\sigma$ leads to the lowering of $\mu$ does not hold for high
$\sigma$. In fact, we show that the deformation of the EDL decreases with
increase of $\sigma$. The role of hydrodynamic interactions is inferred from
direct comparisons to Langevin simulations where the coupling to the LB fluid
is switched off. Moreover, systems with divalent counterions are considered. In
this case, at high values of $\sigma$ the phenomenon of charge inversion is
found.

The design, calibrations, procedure for data analysis and interpretation of the

neutron background from rock at the Boulby Underground Laboratory, a site used
for dark matter and other experiments, requiring shielding from cosmic ray
muons. The experiment was performed using a liquid scintillation detector. A
6.1 litre volume stainless steel cell was filled with an in-house made liquid
scintillator loaded with Gd to enhance neutron capture. A two-pulse signature
(proton recoils followed by gammas from neutron capture) was used to identify
the neutron events from much larger gamma background from PMTs. Suppression of
gammas from the rock was achieved by surrounding the detector with high-purity
lead and copper. Calibrations of the detector were performed with various gamma
and neutron sources. Special care was taken to eliminate PMT afterpulses and
correlated background events from the delayed coincidences of two pulses in the
Bi-Po decay chain. A four month run revealed a neutron-induced event rate of
1.84 +- 0.65 (stat.) events/day. Monte Carlo simulations based on the GEANT4
toolkit were carried out to estimate the efficiency of the detector and the
energy spectra of the expected proton recoils. From comparison of the measured
rate with Monte Carlo simulations the flux of fast neutrons from rock was
estimated as (1.72 +- 0.61 (stat.) +- 0.38 (syst.))*10^(-6) cm^(-2) s^(-1)

work, we study how the different scenarios can be distinguished. We summarize
the expected signals for vacuum magnetic dichroism (rotation) and birefringence
(ellipticity) for the different types of particles - including new results for
the case of millicharged scalars. The sign of the rotation and ellipticity
signals as well as their dependencies on experimental parameters, such as the
strength of the magnetic field and the wavelength of the laser, can be used to
obtain information about the quantum numbers of the particle candidates and to
discriminate between the different scenarios. We perform a statistical analysis
of all available data resulting in strongly restricted regions in the parameter
space of all scenarios. These regions suggest clear target regions for upcoming
experimental tests. As an illustration, we use preliminary PVLAS data to
demonstrate that near future data may already rule out some of these scenarios.

parabolic coordinates. It is done through expansion twice as much of the domain
G so that instead of the half plane (u,v>0) now the entire plane (u,v) should
be used accompanied with new identification rules over the boundary points.
Solutions of the Klein-Fock and Schrodinger equations are constructed in terms
of parabolic cylinder functions. Four types of solutions are possible:
\Psi_{++}, \Psi_{--} ; \Psi_{+-}, \Psi_{-+}. The first two \Psi_{++}, \Psi_{--}
provide us with single-valued functions of the vectorial space points, whereas
last two \Psi_{+-},\Psi_{-+} have discontinuities in the frame of vectorial
space and therefore they must be rejected in this model. All four types of
functions are continuous ones being regarded in the spinor space. It is
established that all solutions \Psi_{++}, \Psi_{--}, \Psi_{+-}, \Psi_{-+} are
orthogonal to each other provided that integration is done over extended domain

$k$ client stations. The server station is an infinite server queueing system,
and client stations are single-server queueing systems with autonomous service,
i.e. every client station serves customers (units) only at random instants
generated by a strictly stationary and ergodic sequence of random variables.
The total number of units in the network is $N$. The expected times between
departures in client stations are $(N\mu_j)^{-1}$. After a service completion
in the server station, a unit is transmitted to the $j$th client station with
probability $p_{j}$ $(j=1,2,...,k)$, and being processed in the $j$th client
station, the unit returns to the server station. The network is assumed to be
in a semi-Markov environment. A semi-Markov environment is defined by a finite
or countable infinite Markov chain and by sequences of independent and
identically distributed random variables. Then the routing probabilities
$p_{j}$ $(j=1,2,...,k)$ and transmission rates (which are expressed via
parameters of the network) depend on a Markov state of the environment. The
paper studies the queue-length processes in client stations of this network and
is aimed to the analysis of performance measures associated with this network.

$C^2$), and let $d^M(x,y)$ be the (asymmetric) distance associated to $M$.
Given an open domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ of class $C^2$, let
$d_{\Omega}(x) := \inf\{d^M(x,y); y\in\partial\Omega\}$ be the Minkowski
distance of a point $x\in\Omega$ from the boundary of $\Omega$. We prove that a
suitable extension of $d_{\Omega}$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$ (which plays the r\""ole of
a signed Minkowski distance to $\partial \Omega$) is of class $C^2$ in a
tubular neighborhood of $\partial \Omega$, and that $d_{\Omega}$ is of class
$C^2$ outside the cut locus of $\partial\Omega$ (that is the closure of the set
of points of non--differentiability of $d_{\Omega}$ in $\Omega$). In addition,
we prove that the cut locus of $\partial \Omega$ has Lebesgue measure zero, and
that $\Omega$ can be decomposed, up to this set of vanishing measure, into
geodesics starting from $\partial\Omega$ and going into $\Omega$ along the
normal direction (with respect to the Minkowski distance). We compute
explicitly the Jacobian determinant of the change of variables that associates
to every point $x\in \Omega$ outside the cut locus the pair $(p(x),
d_{\Omega}(x))$, where $p(x)$ denotes the (unique) projection of $x$ on
$\partial\Omega$, and we apply these techniques to the analysis of PDEs of
Monge-Kantorovich type arising from problems in optimal transportation theory

predict and describe a bottleneck accumulation of the energy spectrum at the
classical-quantum crossover scale $\ell$. Demanding the same energy flux
through scales, the value of the energy at the crossover scale should exceed
the Kolmogorov-41 spectrum by a large factor $\ln^{10/3} (\ell/a_0)$ ($\ell$ is
the mean intervortex distance and $a_0$ is the vortex core radius) for the
classical and quantum spectra to be matched in value. One of the important
consequences of the bottleneck is that it causes the mean vortex line density

into account in (re)interpretation of new (and old) experiments as well as in
further theoretical studies.
