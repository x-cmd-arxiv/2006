Interestingly, we find that recent CMB data seem to favor a contribution of a
primordial isocurvature mode where the entropy perturbation is positively
correlated with the primordial curvature perturbation and has a large spectral
index (niso ~ 3). With 4 additional parameters we obtain a better fit to the
CMB data by Delta chi^2 = 9.7 compared to an adiabatic model. For this best-fit
model the nonadiabatic contribution to the CMB temperature variance is 4%.
According to a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis the nonadiabatic contribution
is positive at more than 95% C.L. The exact C.L. depends somewhat on the choice
of priors, and we discuss the effect of different priors as well as additional

classify the matched sources by comparing the seven-band photometry to model
colors constructed for different classes of astrophysical objects. For sources
with photometric errors <0.3 mag, the corresponding typical AB-magnitude limits
are m_FUV~21.5, m_NUV~22.5 for AIS, and m_FUV~24, m_NUV~24.5 for MIS. At AIS
depth, the number of Galactic and extragalactic objects are comparable, but the
latter predominate in the MIS. Based on our stellar models, we estimate the
GALEX surveys detect hot White Dwarfs throughout the Milky Way halo (down to a
radius of 0.04 R_sun at MIS depth), providing an unprecedented improvement in
the Galactic WD census. Their observed surface density is consistent with Milky
Way model predictions. We also select low-redshift QSO candidates, extending
the known QSO samples to lower magnitudes, and providing candidates for
detailed z~1 follow-up investigations. SDSS optical spectra available for a

provide on the heliosheath, the region of the heliosphere between the
termination shock and heliopause. To search for evidence of heliosheath
absorption, we conduct a systematic inspection of stellar Ly-alpha lines
reconstructed after correcting for ISM absorption (and
heliospheric/astrospheric absorption, if present). Most of the stellar lines
are well centered on the stellar radial velocity, as expected, but the three
lines of sight with the most downwind orientations relative to the ISM flow
(Chi1 Ori, HD 28205, and HD 28568) have significantly blueshifted Ly-alpha
lines. Since it is in downwind directions where heliosheath absorption should
be strongest, the blueshifts are almost certainly caused by previously
undetected heliosheath absorption. We make an initial comparison between the
heliosheath absorption and the predictions of a pair of heliospheric models. A
model with a complex multi-component treatment of plasma within the heliosphere
predicts less absorption than a model with a simple single-fluid treatment,
which leads to better agreement with the data. Finally, we find that
nonplanetary energetic neutral atom (ENA) fluxes measured by the ASPERA-3
instrument on board Mars Express, which have been interpreted as being from the
heliosheath, are probably too high to be consistent with the relative lack of
heliosheath absorption seen by HST. This would argue for a local interplanetary
source for these ENAs instead of a heliosheath source.

the universe is 64Gyr/h old, long enough for halos to essentially reach
dynamical equilibrium. We quantify the importance of hierarchical merging on
the halo mass accretion history, the substructure population, and the
equilibrium density profile. We modify the mass accretion history function of
Wechsler et al. (2002) by introducing a parameter, \gamma, that controls the
rate of mass accretion, dln(M) / dln(a) ~ a^(-\gamma), and find that this form
characterizes both hierarchical and monolithic formation. Subhalo decay rates
are exponential in time with a much shorter time scale for WDM halos. At the
end of the simulations, we find truncated Hernquist density profiles for halos
in both the CDM and WDM cosmologies. There is a systematic shift to lower
concentration for WDM halos, but both cosmologies lie on the same locus
relating concentration and formation epoch. Because the form of the density
profile remains unchanged, our results indicate that the equilibrium halo
density profile is set independently of the halo formation process.

to select red galaxies in two redshift bins at 2<z<3 and 3<z<4.5, respectively.
  From the FIRES catalogs of the HDF-S (4.7 arcmin^2) and MS 1054-03 (26.3

different median redshifts of the two samples. The space densities of the Js-H

The rest-frame U-B colors of galaxies in both samples are similarly red (as
expected from the definition of the color criteria), but the rest-frame UV
properties are different: galaxies in the higher-redshift H-K selected sample
have blue NUV-optical colors and UV slopes similar to those of Lyman Break
Galaxies, while the J-H galaxies are generally red over the entire wavelength
range observed. Synthetic template fits indicate that the distinct rest-NUV
properties of the two samples are primarily a result of dust: we find mean
A_V=1 mag (J-H sample) and A_V=0.2 mag (H-K). The median stellar mass
determined from the template fits decreases by a factor of ~5 from z=2.4 to
3.7, which, coupled with the fact that the space density of such galaxies

suppression occurs up to a characteristic mass scale of ~ 1,000,000 solar
masses, which suggests that pressure has a central role in determining the
properties of the first luminous objects at early times. We show that the
expected characteristic mass scale is in fact substantially lower (by a factor
of ~ 3-10, depending on redshift), and thus the effect of baryonic pressure on
the formation of galaxies up to reionization is only moderate. This result is
due to the influence on perturbation growth of the high pressure that prevailed
in the period from cosmic recombination to z ~ 200, when the gas began to cool
adiabatically and the pressure then dropped. At z ~ 10 the suppression of the
baryon fluctuations is still sensitive to the history of pressure in this
high-redshift era. We calculate the fraction of the cosmic gas that is in
minihalos and find that it is substantially higher than would be expected with
the previously-estimated characteristic mass. Expanding our investigation to
the non-linear regime, we calculate in detail the spherical collapse of
high-redshift objects in a Lambda-CDM universe. We include the gravitational
contributions of the baryons and radiation and the memory of their kinematic

profiles after a proper SFR calibration of the UV luminosity and K-band
mass-to-light ratio are adopted. The (FUV-K) profiles were first corrected for
foreground Galactic extinction and later for internal extinction using the
ratio of the total-infrared (TIR) to FUV emission. For those objects where
TIR-to-FUV-ratio radial profiles were not available, the (FUV-NUV) color
profiles as a measure of the UV slope. The sSFR radial gradients derived from
these profiles allow us to quantify the inside-out scenario for the growth of
spiral disks for the first time in the local Universe.
  We find a large dispersion in the slope of the sSFR profiles with a slightly
positive mean value, which implies a moderate inside-out disk formation. There
is also a strong dependency of the value of this slope on the luminosity and
size of the disks, with large systems showing a uniform, slightly positive
slope in almost all cases and low-luminosity small disks showing a large
dispersion with both positive and negative large values. While a majority of
the galaxies can be interpreted as forming stars gradually either from inside
out or from outside in, a few disks require episodes of enhanced recent growth
with scale lengths of the SFR (or gas infall) being significantly larger at
present than in the past. We do not find any clear dependence of the sSFR
gradient on the environment (local galaxy density or presence of close
neighbors).

redshift 0.4<z<0.7. By determining an accurate radio luminosity function for
early-type galaxies in this redshift range, we can investigate the cosmic
evolution of the radio-galaxy population over a wide range in radio luminosity.
  The low-power radio galaxies in our LRG sample (those with 1.4 GHz radio
luminosities in the range 10^{24} to 10^{25} W/Hz, corresponding to FR I radio
galaxies in the local universe) undergo significant cosmic evolution over the
redshift range 0<z<0.7, consistent with pure luminosity evolution of the form
(1+z)^k where k=2.0+/-0.3. Our results appear to rule out (at the 6-7 sigma
level) models in which low-power radio galaxies undergo no cosmic evolution.
The most powerful radio galaxies in our sample (with radio luminosities above
10^{26} W/Hz) may undergo more rapid evolution over the same redshift range.
  The evolution seen in the low-power radio-galaxy population implies that the
total energy input into massive early-type galaxies from AGN heating increases
with redshift, and was roughly 50% higher at z~0.55 (the median redshift of the

  Role of density concentration and pressure anisotropy","16 pages, 18 figures, accepted by Astronomy & Astrophysics",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20066425",,"astro-ph",,"  In this paper we study the infall, by dynamical friction, of rigid
""satellites"" taken in a variety of initial configurations and models. We thus
measure how dynamical friction depends on the density concentration and on the
pressure anisotropy of the host galaxy and, separately, the response of the
galaxy during the process.
  The investigation is carried out by using a numerical laboratory set up in
previous papers of this series.
  We find that the pressure anisotropy present in the host galaxy has little
effect on dynamical friction. Instead, the shape of the galaxy density profile
is very important. The classical idealized description appears to be applicable
to galaxy models characterized by a small density gradient but not to
concentrated models. In contrast to the behavior found in small density
gradient models, the orbits of satellites captured in concentrated models are
not circularized by dynamical friction.
  The induced evolution in the host galaxy reflects the initial conditions
adopted for the captured satellite. Satellites spiraling in on quasi-circular
orbits tend to modify the pressure tensor of the host galaxy in the tangential
direction and the galaxy shape from spherical to oblate, while satellites
captured along quasi-radial orbits tend to induce pressure anisotropy in the
radial direction and to generate a prolate shape. This result suggests that the
shape of early-type galaxies may result from occasional mergers rather than
being directly related to the effectiveness of the radial-orbit instability
during the process of formation via collisionless collapse, as often argued in
the past.

spectral variability on time-scales from a few tens of ksec to years. We found
in both cases highly significant spectral variability below ~ 6 keV down to the
shortest time-scales investigated. These variations can be naturally explained
in terms of variations in the low energy cut-off due to obscuring matter along
the line of sight. If the cut-off is modeled by two neutral absorption
components, one fully covering the source and the second covering only a
fraction of the source, the shortest time-scale of variability of a few days
constrains the location of the obscuring matter to within 3.4 X 10^4
Schwarzschild radii from the central X-ray source. This is consistent with the
distance of the Broad Emission Line Region, as inferred from reverberation
mapping, and difficult to reconcile with the parsec scale dusty molecular torus
of Krolik & Begelman (1988). We have also explored a more complex absorption
structure, namely the presence of an ionized absorber. Although the behaviour
of the ionization parameter is nicely consistent with the expectations, the
results are not completely satisfactory from the statistical point of view.
  The overall absorption during the 2001 December observation is lower than in
all other historical observations with similar 2-10 keV flux. This suggests
that absorption variability plays a crucial role in the observed flux
variability of this source.

ultrasonic wave in a liquid can be generated by applying the periodically
alternating external pressure with the angular frequency that corresponds to
the ultrasound. If the perturbation introduced by such process is weak - its
statistical-mechanical treatment can be done with the use of the linear
response theory. We treat the liquid as a system of interacting sites, so that
all the response/aftereffect functions as well as the energy dissipation and
generalized (wave-vector and frequency dependent) ultrasonic absorption
coefficient are obtained in terms of familiar site-site static and time

play a crucial role in the construction of the effective exchange Hamiltonian.
This internal symmetry combines continuous spin symmetry SU(2) and discrete

attached to metallic leads, the set of dot operators appearing in the effective
exchange Hamiltonian generate a group which is refereed to as the dynamical

discuss some specific examples. In particular we concentrate on the difference
between the chain geometry and the ring geometry. When a perpendicular magnetic
field is applied in the ring geometry, its gauge symmetry U(1) is involved in
the interplay with the spin and orbital dynamics of the dot.

in quantum information science, including for example as quantum logic gates
and as sources of entangled states. An important advance was achieved recently
when strong coupling between excitons and cavity photons was reported for the
first time for localized quantum dots (QDs) in micron-size solid state
cavities. This has significance in terms of scalability and integration with
other optical devices, and could lead to the emergence of ""quantum optics on a

the linear regime, corresponding to coupling to the vacuum field (vacuum Rabi
splitting); they are not a true QED effect and can equally well be described by
classical physics as the coupling between two oscillators. In this paper, we
present evidence for a purely quantum phenomenon for the QD/cavity photon
system, namely the increase in splitting of the levels when the mean number of
photons in the cavity is increased. This corresponds to non-linearities on the
single-photon scale: the presence of a single excitation in the cavity changes
the level structure, affecting the emission energies for a second photon. Such
results are a first step in demonstrating the promise of quantum dots for CQED

model, which represents the situation referred to by the text. We have

the optimal strategy of dirty paper coding to that achieved with sub-optimal
and lower complexity linear precoding (e.g., zero-forcing and block
diagonalization) transmission. Both strategies utilize all available spatial
dimensions and therefore have the same multiplexing gain, but an absolute
difference in terms of throughput does exist. The sum rate difference between
the two strategies is analytically computed at asymptotically high SNR, and it
is seen that this asymptotic statistic provides an accurate characterization at
even moderate SNR levels. Furthermore, the difference is not affected by
asymmetric channel behavior when each user a has different average SNR.
Weighted sum rate maximization is also considered, and a similar quantification
of the throughput difference between the two strategies is performed. In the
process, it is shown that allocating user powers in direct proportion to user
weights asymptotically maximizes weighted sum rate. For multiple antenna users,
uniform power allocation across the receive antennas is applied after
distributing power proportional to the user weight.

For a generic f(R) lagrangian, we show that the metric can be solved as the
product of a scalar function times a rank-two tensor (or auxiliary metric). The
scalar function is sensitive to the local energy-momentum density. The
auxiliary metric satisfies a set of equations very similar to Einstein's
equations and, for weak sources, it can be approximated by the Minkowski
metric. According to this, the metric coupled to the matter strongly departs
from the Minkowskian one in the neighbourhood of any microscopic physical
system. As a consequence, new gravitationally-induced interactions arise and
lead to observable effects at microscopic and macroscopic scales. In
particular, test body trajectories experience self-accelerations which depend
on the internal structure and composition of the body. These facts make very
unlikely the viability of Palatini f(R) models designed to change the late-time

independent groups. While the chaotic behavior of binary black hole orbits is
no longer argued, it remains difficult to quantify the importance of chaos to
the evolutionary dynamics of a pair of comparable mass black holes. None of our
existing approximations are robust enough to offer convincing quantitative
conclusions in the most highly nonlinear regime. It is intriguing to note that
in three different approximations to a black hole pair built of a spinning
black hole and a non-spinning companion, two approximations exhibit chaos and
one approximation does not. The fully relativistic scenario of a spinning
test-mass around a Schwarzschild black hole shows chaos, as does the
Post-Newtonian Lagrangian approximation. However, the approximately equivalent
Post-Newtonian Hamiltonian approximation does not show chaos when only one body
spins. It is well known in dynamical systems theory that one system can be
regular while an approximately related system is chaotic, so there is no formal
conflict. However,the physical question remains, Is there chaos for comparable
mass binaries when only one object spins? We are unable to answer this question
given the poor convergence of the Post-Newtonian approximation to the fully
relativistic system. A resolution awaits better approximations that can be
trusted in the highly nonlinear regime.

for many years - from the work of Hermann Bondi - that energy and momentum of
gravitational sources could be determined by similar integrals of the
asymptotic Weyl tensor. Recently we observed that there were certain overlooked
structures, {defined at future null infinity,} that allowed one to determine
(or define) further properties of both electromagnetic and gravitating sources.
These structures, families of {complex} `slices' or `cuts' of Penrose's null
infinity, are referred to as Universal Cut Functions, (UCF). In particular, one
can define from these structures a (complex) center of mass (and center of
charge) and its equations of motion - with rather surprising consequences. It
appears as if these asymptotic structures contain in their imaginary part, a
well defined total spin-angular momentum of the source. We apply these ideas to
the type II algebraically special metrics, both twisting and twist-free.

  The fact that the fluctuation spectrum can be extracted from the inflationary
scenario through an analysis that involves quantum field theory in curved
space-time, and that it coincides with the observational data has lead to a
certain complacency in the community, which prevents the critical analysis of
the obscure spots in the derivation. The point is that the inhomogeneity and
anisotropy of our universe seem to emerge from an exactly homogeneous and
isotropic initial state through processes that do not break those symmetries.
This article gives a brief recount of the problems faced by the arguments based
on established physics, which comprise the point of view held by a large
majority of researchers in the field.
  The conclusion is that we need some new physics to be able to fully address
the problem. The article then exposes one avenue that has been used to address
the central issue and elaborates on the degree to which, the new approach makes
different predictions from the standard analyses.
  The approach is inspired on Penrose's proposals that Quantum Gravity might
lead to a real, dynamical collapse of the wave function, a process that we
argue has the properties needed to extract us from the theoretical impasse
described above.

how the equations reduce to the Vaidya spacetime in a non-null coordinate

reduces to the Schwarzschild spacetime when all matter variables vanish. We
then describe the formulation of an initial value problem, whereby a general
fluid ball with vacuum exterior is established on an initial spacelike slice.
As the system evolves, the fluid ball collapses and emanates null radiation
such that a region of Vaidya spacetime develops. Therefore, on any subsequent
spacelike slice there exists three regions; general fluid, Vaidya and
Schwarzschild, all expressed in a single coordinate patch with two
free-boundaries determined by the equations. This implies complicated matching
schemes are not required at the interfaces between the regions, instead, one
simply requires the matter variables tend to the appropriate equations of
state. We also show the reduction of the system of equations to the static
cases, and show staticity necessarily implies zero ``heat flux''. Furthermore,
the static equations include a generalization of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff
equations for hydrostatic equilibrium to include anisotropic stresses in

order to simulate dissipation effects due to the transfer of photons and/or

the strength of the shock increases the speed of the fluid to relativistic
values and for some critical ones is larger than light speed. In addition, we
find that energy conditions are very sensible to the anisotropy, specially the

sequence of analytic approximations where we assume a strictly peaked momentum

expansion of the energy, we point out a {\em residual} time-dependent phase
which, coupled with the {\em spreading/slippage} effects, can subtly modify the
neutrino oscillation parameters and limits. Such second-order effects are
usually ignored in the relativistic wave packet treatment, but they present an
evident dependence on the propagation regime so that some small modifications
to the oscillation pattern, even in the ultra-relativistic limit, can be
quantified. These modifications are implemented in the confront with the
neutrino oscillation parameter range (mass-squared difference $\Delta m^{\2}$
and the mixing-angle $\theta$) where we assume the same wave packet parameters
previously noticed in the literature in a kind of {\em toy model} for some

experimental purposes which concern with higher precision parameter

simple reason that they are too heavy in these models. However, a simple
extension of the Standard Model (SM) particle content, including mirror
fermions, two $SU(2)_L$ triplet and one singlet Higgs fields, leads to a
scenario in which the see-saw mechanism is realized with the Majorana mass
$M_R$ of the right-handed neutrino being of the order of the electroweak scale
or smaller. A custodial SU(2) symmetry arising from the two triplet Higgs
fields ensures that $\rho=1$ at tree level even when their vacuum expectation
values (VEV) which determine the value of $M_R$, can be as large as the
electroweak scale. $M_R$ is found to obey the bound $\frac{M_Z}{2} \leq M_R <
246 GeV $ which makes it accessible experimentally (Tevatron, LHC or ILC)

this we construct the unbroken phase given by the decompactification limit, in
which the higher Kaluza-Klein modes are massless. The latter admits an
infinite-dimensional extension of the three-dimensional diffeomorphism group as
local symmetry and, moreover, a current algebra associated to SL(D-2,R)
together with the diffeomorphism algebra of the internal manifold as global
symmetries. It is shown that the `broken phase' can be reconstructed by gauging
a certain subgroup of the global symmetries. This deforms the three-dimensional
diffeomorphisms to a gauged version, and it is shown that they can be governed
by a Chern-Simons theory, which unifies the spin-2 modes with the Kaluza-Klein
vectors. This provides a reformulation of D-dimensional Einstein gravity, in
which the physical degrees of freedom are described by the scalars of a gauged
non-linear sigma model based on SL(D-2,R)/SO(D-2), while the metric appears in
a purely topological Chern-Simons form.

generic infinitesimal changes of matrix variables (vector fields). Ward
identities correspond to vector fields preserving measure and action. The
former are analogous to Makeenko-Migdal equations and the latter to
Slavnov-Taylor identities. Loop equations correspond to leading large-N
Schwinger-Dyson equations. Ward identities correspond to 1/N^2 suppressed
Schwinger-Dyson equations. But they become leading equations since loop
equations for non-anomalous vector fields are vacuous. We show that symmetries
at infinite N persist at finite N, preventing mixing with multi-trace
correlations. For one matrix, there are no non-anomalous infinitesimal
symmetries. For two or more matrices, measure preserving vector fields form an
infinite dimensional graded Lie algebra, and non-anomalous action preserving
ones a subalgebra. For Gaussian, Chern-Simons and Yang-Mills models we identify
up to cubic non-anomalous vector fields, though they can be arbitrarily
non-linear. Ward identities are homogeneous linear equations. We use them with
the loop equations to determine some correlations of these models. Ward
identities alleviate the underdeterminacy of loop equations. Non-anomalous
symmetries give a naturalness-type explanation for why several linear
combinations of correlations in these models vanish.

shows that Hawking radiation is very robust up to frequencies of 96 T_H or 270

variance. We also give an example which shows that in contradiction to the
intuition of physicists, the WR algorithm can have an asymptotic variance
larger than the one of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. However, in the
particular case of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm called Boltzmann
algorithm, we prove that the WR algorithm is asymptotically better than the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

Here, we consider the case V=L^1 where differentiability fails.
  We establish another kind of differentiability for certain X, including R^n

H does not bi-Lipschitz embed into L^1, as conjectured by J. Lee and A. Naor.
When combined with their work, this provides a natural counter example to the
Goemans-Linial conjecture in theoretical computer science; the first such

bounded variation, which permits us to exploit recent work on the structure of
BV functions on the Heisenberg group.

choice of cyclic order of the edges around each vertex. Among other results, we
obtain a combinatorial interpretation for each of the evaluations T_G(i,j),

the connected subgraphs of G (counted by T_G(1,2)) and the root-connected
orientations. We also obtain a bijection between the forests (counted by
T_G(2,1)) and outdegree sequences which specializes into a bijection between
spanning trees (counted by T_G(1,1)) and root-connected outdegree sequences. We
also define a bijection between spanning trees and recurrent configurations of

we explicitly connect the ring structure on spaces of modular forms with
branching problems in the representation theory of real semisimple Lie groups.
Furthermore, we construct a family of intertwining operators from discrete
series representations into tensor products of other discrete series
representations. This collection of intertwining operators provides the
well-known ring structure on spaces of holomorphic modular forms. An analytic
subtlety prevents this collection of intertwining operators from directly
yielding a ring structure on some spaces of modular forms. We discuss discrete
decomposability, and its role in constructing ring structures.

\cite{nspec} have led to counterexamples to Fugelde's Spectral Set Conjecture
in both directions. Namely, in $\RR^5$ Tao produced a spectral set which is not
a tile, while Kolountzakis and Matolcsi showed an example of a non-spectral
tile. In search of lower dimensional non-spectral tiles we were led to
investigate the Universal Spectrum Conjecture (USC) of Lagarias and Wang
\cite{lagwang}. In particular, we prove here that the USC and the ``tile $\to$
spectral'' direction of Fuglede's conjecture are equivalent in any dimensions.
Also, we show by an example that the sufficient condition of Lagarias and
Szab\'o \cite{lagszab} for the existence of universal spectra is not necessary.
This fact causes considerable difficulties in producing lower dimensional
examples of tiles which have no spectra. We overcome these difficulties by
invoking some ideas of R\'ev\'esz and Farkas \cite{revfark}, and obtain
non-spectral tiles in $\RR^3$.

forms. It has been proved by J. Arias-de-Reyna \cite{ARIAS}, that %for
${\mathbb C}^n$, the so-called $n^{\rm th}$ linear polarization constant
$c_n({\mathbb C}^n)$ is $n^{n/2}$, for arbitrary $n\in\NN$. The same value for
$c_n({\mathbb R}^n)$ is only conjectured. In a recent work A. Pappas and S.
R{\'e}v{\'e}sz prove that $c_n({\mathbb R}^n)=n^{n/2}$ for $n \le 5$. Moreover,
they show that if the linear forms are given as $f_j(x)=< x,a_j>$, for some
unit vectors $a_j$ $(1\leq j\leq n)$, then the product of the $f_j$'s attains
at least the value $n^{-n/2}$ at the normalized signed sum of the vectors
$\{a_j\}_{j=1}^{n}$ having maximal length. Thus they asked whether this
phenomenon remains true for arbitrary $n\in{\mathbb N}$. We show that for
vector systems $\{a_j\}_{j=1}^{n}$ close to an orthonormal system, the
Pappas-R{\'e}v{\'e}sz estimate does hold true. Furthermore, among these vector
systems the only system giving $n^{-n/2}$ as the norm of the product is the
orthonormal system. On the other hand, for arbitrary vector systems we answer
the question of A. Pappas and S. R{\'e}v{\'e}sz in the negative when $n\in
{\mathbb N}$ is large enough. We also discuss various further examples and
counterexamples that may be instructive for further research towards the
determination of $c_n(\RR^n)$.

chloride/water, we have systematically investigated the pattern formation for a
set of substrate temperatures and solute concentrations in an open system. The
flow patterns evolve with time, driven by surface-tension fluctuations due to
evaporation and the Soret effect, while the air-liquid interface does not
deform. A shadowgraph method is used to follow the pattern formation in time.
The patterns are mainly composed of polygons and rolls. The mean pattern size
first decreases slightly, and then gradually increases during the evolution.
Evaporation affects the pattern formation mainly at the early stage and the
local evaporation rate tends to become spatially uniform at the film surface.
The Soret effect becomes important at the later stage and affects the mixture
for a large mean solute concentration where the Soret number is significantly
above zero. The strength of convection increases with the initial solute
concentration and the substrate temperature. Our findings differ from the
theoretical predictions in which evaporation is neglected.

of nodes representing individual spaces and links if the corresponding spaces
are intersected. It turns out in the space syntax literature that some defined
topological metrics can capture human movement rates in individual spaces. In
other words, the topological metrics are significantly correlated to human
movement rates, and individual spaces can be ranked by the metrics for
predicting human movement. However, this correlation has never been well
justified. In this paper, we study the same issue by applying the weighted
PageRank algorithm to the connectivity graph or space-space topology for
ranking the individual spaces, and find surprisingly that (1) the PageRank
scores are better correlated to human movement rates than the space syntax
metrics, and (2) the underlying space-space topology demonstrates small world
and scale free properties. The findings provide a novel justification as to why
space syntax, or topological analysis in general, can be used to predict human
movement. We further conjecture that this kind of analysis is no more than
predicting a drunkard's walking on a small world and scale free network.

approach the algebra itself would carry the symmetries of translation,
rotation, etc. Our suggestion is illustrated in a preliminary way by using a
particular generalized Clifford Algebra proposed originally by Weyl, which
approaches the ordinary Heisenberg algebra in a suitable limit. We thus obtain
a certain insight into how quantum mechanics may be regarded as a purely
algebraic theory, provided that we further introduce a new set of
""neighbourhood operators"", which remove an important kind of arbitrariness that
has thus far been present in the attempt to treat quantum mechanics solely in

fragile, the major hurdle in building such a computer is overcoming noise.
  Developed over the last couple of years, new schemes for achieving fault
tolerance based on error detection, rather than error correction, appear to
tolerate as much as 3-6% noise per gate -- an order of magnitude better than
previous procedures. But proof techniques could not show that these promising
fault-tolerance schemes tolerated any noise at all.
  With an analysis based on decomposing complicated probability distributions
into mixtures of simpler ones, we rigorously prove the existence of constant
tolerable noise rates (""noise thresholds"") for error-detection-based schemes.
Numerical calculations indicate that the actual noise threshold this method
yields is lower-bounded by 0.1% noise per gate.
