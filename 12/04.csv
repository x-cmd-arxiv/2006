XTE J1739-285, together with the measurement of the mass of the binary
millisecond pulsar PSR J0751+1807 (2.1 +- 0.2 solar masses) can finally allow
us to put strong, model-independent observational constraints to the equation
of state of compact stars. We show that the measurement of the moment of
inertia of PSR J0737+3039A, together with these constraints, could allow to
discriminate further the details of the inner structure of neutron stars.
Moreover, we show that if XTE J1739-285 is constituted of nucleonic matter, any
equation of state allows only a narrow range of very high masses, and this
could explain why up to now compact stars spinning faster than a millisecond
have been so difficult to detect.

of models based upon arbitrary assumptions has led to some confusion about the
origin of ordinary chondrites. Major element fractionation among chondrites has
been discussed for decades as ratios relative to Si or Mg. Expressing ratios
relative to Fe leads to a new relationship admitting the possibility that
ordinary chondrite meteorites are derived from two components: one is a
relatively undifferentiated, primitive component, oxidized like the CI or C1
chondrites; the other is a somewhat differentiated, planetary component, with
oxidation state like the reduced enstatite chondrites. Such a picture would
seem to explain for the ordinary chondrites, their major element compositions,
their intermediate states of oxidation, and their ubiquitous defiencies of
refractory siderophile elements. I suggest that the planetary component of
ordinary chondrite formation consists of planet Mercury's missing complement of
elements, presumably separated from protoplanetary Mercury during its
formation.

in a biconical geometry is discussed. Microlensing amplification in this
anisotropic model is not directly related to the bicone's intrinsic size but
depends on the orientation of the bicone axis and on the cone aperture. The
orientation of the projected bicone with respect to the shear of the
magnification pattern can induce very interesting effects, like the
quasi-periodic enhancements of the red/blue part of the emission line profile
or the lack of correlation between the broad line region (BLR) and continuum
light curves of QSOs. The emission line profiles of a BLR moving in a high
caustic concentration exhibit sharp features that are well defined in
wavelength. These features (spikes) correspond to the scanning of the
kinematics of the BLR by the caustic clusters. The biconical model can
qualitatively reproduce with a transversal (with respect to the shear) movement
of the BLR, the recurrent blue-wing enhancement detected in the emission line
profile of the A image of the quasar lensed system SDSS J1004+4112. The
probability of observing this repetitive event is almost a 2% for a fraction of

corresponds roughly to Delta r_comoving=53 h^-1 Mpc) for 9176 galaxies with
R<=23.65, M_B(Vega)-5log h<=-18, and z<= 0.7, in three COMBO-17 fields

approximately sigma_z/(1+z)~0.015. In the Chandra Deep Field South we identify
a region that is underdense by almost a factor 2 compared to the other two
fields in the same redshift range (0.25<~ z <~0.4). This can be used for an
investigation of the variation of the colour-dependent luminosity function with
environment: We calculate the luminosity function in this redshift range for
red sequence and blue cloud galaxies (as defined by Bell et al. 04) in each of
the fields separately. While the luminosity function of the blue galaxies
remains unaffected by different density contrasts, the luminosity function of
the red galaxies clearly has a more positive faint-end slope in the Chandra
Deep Field South as compared to the other two COMBO-17 fields. The underdensity
there is thus mainly due to a deficiency of faint red galaxies. This result is
in qualitative agreement with the trends seen at z=0.1, e.g. in the 2dFGRS

selected this way tend to comprise the majority of high X-ray luminosity AGN,
whereas AGN selected via other IRAC color-color criteria might contain more
star-formation dominated galaxies. Approximately half of these IR power-law
galaxies in the CDF-S are detected in deep (1Ms) Chandra X-ray imaging,
although in the CDF-N (2Ms) about 77% are detected at the 3sigma level. The
SEDs and X-ray upper limits of the sources not detected in X-rays are
consistent with those of obscured AGN, and are significantly different from
those of massive star-forming galaxies. About 40% of IR power-law galaxies
detected in X-rays have SEDs resembling that of an optical QSO and morphologies
dominated by bright point source emission. The remaining 60% have SEDs whose UV
and optical continuum are much steeper (obscured) and more extended
morphologies than those detected in X-rays. Most of the IR power-law galaxies
not detected in X-rays have IR (8-1000micron above 10^12Lsun, and X-ray (upper
limits) to mid-IR ratios similar to those of local warm (ie, hosting an AGN)
ULIRGs. The SED shapes of power-law galaxies are consistent with the obscured
fraction (4:1) as derived from the X-ray column densities, if we assume that
all the sources not detected in X-rays are heavily absorbed. IR power-law
galaxies may account for between 20% and 50% of the predicted number density of
mid-IR detected obscured AGN. The remaining obscured AGN probably have
rest-frame SEDs dominated by stellar emission.

availability of an efficient cophasing system: once available, what has so far
postponed the relevance of direct imaging with an interferometer will vanish.
This paper focuses on the actual limits of snapshot imaging, inherent to the
use of a sparse aperture: the number of telescopes and the geometry of the
array impose the maximum extent of the field of view and the complexity of the
sources. A second limitation may arise from the beam combination scheme.
Comparing already available solutions, we show that the so called
hypertelescope mode (or densified pupil) is ideal. By adjusting the direct
imaging field of view to the useful field of view offered by the array, the
hypertelescope makes an optimal use of the collected photons. It optimizes
signal to noise ratio, drastically improves the luminosity of images and makes
the interferometer compatible with coronagraphy, without inducing any loss of
useful field of view.

underline that it is fundamental to take into account that younger stars suffer

qubits in a quantum Heisenberg XY spin star environment in the thermodynamic

technique. In this approach, the transformed Hamiltonian becomes effectively
Jaynes-Cumming like and thus the analysis is also relevant to cavity quantum
electrodynamics. This special operator technique is mathematically simple and
physically clear, and allows us to treat systems and environments that could
all be strongly coupled mutually and internally. To study their entanglement
evolution, the concurrence of the reduced density matrix of the two coupled
central spins is also obtained exactly. It is shown that the dynamics of the
entanglement depends on the initial state of the system and the coupling
strength between the two coupled central spins, the thermal temperature of the
spin environment and the interaction between the constituents of the spin

be controlled by the strength of a locally applied external magnetic field. It
is found that the detuning has a significant effect on the entanglement

dot magnet is studied theoretically in the incoherent tunneling regime. We
consider a model describing a single-level quantum dot, magnetically coupled to
an additional local spin, the latter representing the total molecular spin s.
We also assume that the system is in the strong Coulomb blockade regime, i.e.,
double occupancy on the dot is forbidden. The master equation approach to FCS
introduced in Ref. [12] is applied to derive a generating function yielding the
FCS of charge and current. In the master equation approach, Clebsch-Gordan
coefficients appear in the transition probabilities, whereas the derivation of
generating function reduces to solving the eigenvalue problem of a modified
master equation with counting fields. To be more specific, one needs only the
eigenstate which collapses smoothly to the zero-eigenvalue stationary state in
the limit of vanishing counting fields. We discovered that in our problem with
arbitrary spin s, some quartic relations among Clebsch-Gordan coefficients
allow us to identify the desired eigenspace without solving the whole problem.
Thus we find analytically the FCS generating function in the following two
cases: i) both spin sectors lying in the bias window, ii) only one of such spin
sectors lying in the bias window. Based on the obtained analytic expressions,
we also developed a numerical analysis in order to perform a similar
contour-plot of the joint charge-current distribution function, which have
recently been introduced in Ref. [13], here in the case of molecular quantum

interacting gases up to Fermi liquids which develop a coherent state at low

is the Bernoulli potential in superconductors which compensates forces from
dielectric currents. This Bernoulli potential allows to access material
parameters. Though within the surface potential these contributions are largely
canceled, the bulk measurements with NMR can access this potential. Recent
experiments are explained and new ones suggested. The underlying quantum
statistical theory in nonequilibrium is the nonlocal kinetic theory developed

Recently, it has been appreciated that also the nearby dielectric has an
unexpectedly strong influence. The mechanisms responsible for this influence
are not understood. To investigate these mechanisms we have studied transport
through organic single crystal FETs with different gate insulators. We find
that the temperature dependence of the mobility evolves from metallic-like to
insulating-like with increasing the dielectric constant of the insulator. The
phenomenon is accounted for by a two-dimensional Frohlich polaron model that
quantitatively describes our observations and shows that increasing the

present a new analysis method to extract the slip length. Enhancing the slip of
liquids is an important issue for microfluidic devices that demand for high
throughput at low pumping power. We study the velocity of short-chained liquid
polystyrene (PS) films dewetting from non-wettable solid substrates. We show
how the dynamics of dewetting is influenced by slippage and we compare the
results of two types of substrates that give rise to different slip lengths. As
substrates, Si wafers were used that have been coated by
octadecyl-trichlorosilane (OTS) or dodecyl-trichlorosilane (DTS), respectively.
Our results demonstrate that the dewetting velocity for PS films on DTS is
significantly larger than on OTS and that this difference originates from the
different slip lengths of the liquid on top of the two surfaces. For PS films
of thicknesses between 130 nm and 230 nm we find slip lengths between 400 nm

new protocol for Geographic Gossip, in which counter-intuitively, we use {\it

to accelerate the averaging process. The dependence of the number of
transmissions used by our algorithm on the number of sensors $n$ is $n
\exp(O(\log \log n)^2) = n^{1 + o(1)}$. For the previous algorithm, this
dependence was $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$. The exponent 1+ o(1) of our algorithm is
asymptotically optimal. Our algorithm involves a hierarchical structure of
$\log \log n$ depth and is not completely decentralized. However, the extent of
control exercised by a sensor on another is restricted to switching the other

data-compression algorithm. It is known that if the universal LZ77 data

error-free compression for the particular individual sequence X is achieved, as
$N$ tends to infinity. The best possible compression that may be achieved by
any universal data compression algorithm for finite N-blocks is discussed. It
is demonstrated that context tree coding essentially achieves it. Next,
consider a device called classifier (or discriminator) that observes an

gravitational fields it should be a valid approximation. Such an approach could
be used to point out problems and prospects inherent in a more exact theory of
quantum gravity, yet to be discovered. Newtonian quantum gravity, e.g., shows
promise for prohibiting black holes altogether (which would eliminate
singularities and also solve the black hole information paradox), breaks the
equivalence principle of general relativity, and supports non-local
interactions (quantum entanglement). Its predictions should also be testable at
length scales well above the ""Planck scale"", by high-precision experiments
feasible even with existing technology. As an illustration of the theory, it
turns out that the solar system, superficially, perfectly well can be described
as a quantum gravitational system, provided that the $l$ quantum number has its
maximum value, $n-1$. This results exactly in Kepler's third law. If also the
$m$ quantum number has its maximum value ($\pm l$) the probability density has
a very narrow torus-like form, centered around the classical planetary orbits.
However, as the probability density is independent of the azimuthal angle
$\phi$ there is, from quantum gravity arguments, no reason for planets to be
located in any unique place along the orbit (or even \textit{in} an orbit for
$m \neq \pm l$). This is, in essence, a reflection of the ""measurement problem""
inherent in all quantum descriptions.

For D=1, the gauge theory reduces to quantum mechanics on the gauge group; for

lattice. The deconfined phase is associated with a ground state which breaks
Z(N) symmetry, and Svetitsky-Yaffe critical universality emerges naturally for
D>1. A minimal model is proposed which naturally reproduces approximate Casimir
scaling for a range of couplings. Different classes of potentials lead to
different pictures of how confinement is realized. Such potential energy terms
also modify string tension scaling laws, as we demonstrate using two

gluons, and the other arising from magnetic monopoles in certain confining
supersymmetric theories.

in the coupling constant, a dominant subclass of tadpole diagrams.
  This method, originally proposed for the Wilson gluon action, is extended
here to encompass all possible gluon actions made of closed Wilson loops; any
fermion action can be employed as well. The effect of resummation is to replace
various parameters in the action (coupling constant, Symanzik and clover
coefficient) by ``dressed'' values; the latter are solutions to certain coupled
integral equations, which are easy to solve numerically.
  Some positive features of this method are: a) It is gauge invariant, b) it
can be systematically applied to improve (to all orders) results obtained at
any given order in perturbation theory, c) it does indeed absorb in the dressed
parameters the bulk of tadpole contributions.
  Two different applications are presented: The additive renormalization of
fermion masses, and the multiplicative renormalization Z_V (Z_A) of the vector
(axial) current. In many cases where non-perturbative estimates of
renormalization functions are also available for comparison, the agreement with
improved perturbative results is consistently better as compared to results

very large and the applications are not limited to the mechanics of continua.
In the present paper, we show how it can be also applied to the description of
the mechanics of freely falling particles and rigid bodies.
  The mass, the linear and angular momenta are structured as a single object
called torsor. Excluding all metric notions, we define the torsors as
skew-symmetric bilinear mappings operating on the linear space of the affine
functions. Torsors are a particular family of affine tensors.
  On this ground, we define an intrinsic differential operator called the
affine covariant derivative. Next, we claim that the torsor characterizing the
behavior of a freely falling particle is affine covariant derivative free, that
allows recovering both laws of linear and angular momentum. Finally, it is
shown how the motion of rigid bodies can be describe within this frame.

developments in understanding its renormalization structure, which was a major

with the usual way of definition of integrals of differential forms, fields are
defined through integrals over the whole manifold, which are given an
atlas-independent meaning with the help of the partition of unity. Using such
partition of unity test functions turns out to be the key to the fulfilment of
the Poincar\'e commutator algebra as well as to provide a direct Lorentz
invariant scheme to the Epstein-Glaser extension procedure of singular
distributions. These test functions also simplify the analysis of QFT behaviour
both in the UV and IR domains, leaving only a finite renormalization at a point
related to the arbitrary scale present in the test functions. Some well known

  errors","Found.Phys.37:572,2007","10.1007/s10701-007-9123-y",,"quant-ph",,"  This paper describes how the entire universe might be considered an
eigenstate determined by classical limiting conditions within it. This
description is in the context of an approach in which the path of each
relativistic particle in spacetime represents a fine-grained history for that
particle, and a path integral represents a coarse-grained history as a
superposition of paths meeting some criteria. Since spacetime paths are
parametrized by an invariant parameter, not time, histories based on such paths
do not evolve in time but are rather histories of all spacetime. Measurements
can then be represented by orthogonal states that correlate with specific
points in such coarse-grained histories, causing them to decohere, allowing a
consistent probability interpretation. This conception is applied here to the
analysis of the two slit experiment, scattering and, ultimately, the universe
as a whole. The decoherence of cosmological states of the universe then
provides the eigenstates from which our ""real"" universe can be selected by the
measurements carried out within it.

geometry applications for statistical model construction are analyzed. In
accordance with Bohr's complementarity principle, mutually-complementary
coordinate and momentum representations are presented. It was demonstrated that
the characteristic function of coordinate distribution may be considered as a
convolution of the psi-function in momentum representation and vice versa. The
naturalness of coordinate and momentum operators introduction is demonstrated.
A probabilistic interpretation of Hilbert space geometry is given.
Cauchy-Bunyakowsky (Cauchy-Schwartz), Cramer-Rao and uncertainty inequalities
are considered in the same framework. The principal postulates of quantum
informatics as a natural science are presented. It is demonstrated that quantum
informatics serves as a theoretic basis for both probability theory and quantum

transitions between two stable states.

$C_{.0}$ class contractive semigroups for the description of the time evolution
of resonances. For a given scattering problem the formalism allows for the
association of a definite Hilbert space state with a scattering resonance. This
state defines a decomposition of matrix elements of the evolution into a term
evolving according to a semigroup law and a background term. We discuss the
case of multiple resonances and give a bound on the size of the background
term. As an example we treat a simple problem of scattering from a square
barrier potential on the half-line.

  Foundations of Quantum Information, edited by A. Buchleitner and C. Viviescas",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Classical surfaces in phase space correspond to quantum states in Hilbert
space. Subsystems specify factor spaces of the Hilbert space. An entangled
state corresponds semiclassically to a surface that cannot be decomposed into a
product of lower dimensional surfaces. Such a classical factorization never
exists for ergodic eigenstates of a chaotic Hamiltonian. The space of quantum
operators corresponds to a double phase space. The various representations of
the density operator then result from alternative choices of allowed coordinate
planes. In the case of the Wigner function and its Fourier transform, the chord
function, or the quantum characteristic function, this is a phase space on its
own. The reduced Wigner function, representing the partial trace of a density
operator over a subsystem is the projection of the original Wigner function;
the reduced chord function is obtained as a section. The purity of the reduced
density operator, the square of its trace, is a measure of entanglement,
obtained by integrating either the square of the reduced Wigner function, or
the square-modulus of the reduced chord function. Bell inequalities for general
parity measurements can be violated even for classical looking states with
positive Wigner functions that have evolved classically from product states.
These include the original EPR state. Entanglement with an unknown environment
results in decoherence. An example is that of the centre of mass of a large
number of independent particles, entangled with internal variables. In this
case, the Central Limit Theorem for Wigner functions leads to some aspects of
Markovian evolution for the reduced system.

perpetual attempt to recognize that the different aspects of nature are really
different aspects of the same thing. It is therefore interesting to combine
some, if not all, of Feynman's papers into one. The first of his three papers
is on the ``rest of the universe'' contained in his 1972 book on statistical
mechanics. The second idea is Feynman's parton picture which he presented in
1969 at the Stony Brook conference on high-energy physics. The third idea is
contained in the 1971 paper he published with his students, where they show
that the hadronic spectra on Regge trajectories are manifestations of
harmonic-oscillator degeneracies. In this report, we formulate these three
ideas using the mathematics of two coupled oscillators. It is shown that the
idea of entanglement is contained in his rest of the universe, and can be
extended to a space-time entanglement. It is shown also that his parton model
and the static quark model can be combined into one Lorentz-covariant entity.
Furthermore, Einstein's special relativity, based on the Lorentz group, can
also be formulated within the mathematical framework of two coupled
oscillators.
