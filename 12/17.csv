is modified in a way that leads to the observed accelerated expansion. The
question then arises whether the two scenarios can be distinguished. Here we

granulation pattern in the solar photosphere by means of 3-dimensional
radiative hydrodynamics simulations. We used the MURaM code to obtain a
realistic model of the near-surface layers of the convection zone and the
photosphere. The pattern of horizontal temperature fluctuations at the base of
the photosphere consists of relatively hot granular cells bounded by the cooler
intergranular downflow network. With increasing height in the photosphere, the
amplitude of the temperature fluctuations diminishes. At a height of z=130-140
km in the photosphere, the pattern of horizontal temperature fluctuations
reverses so that granular regions become relatively cool compared to the
intergranular network. Detailed analysis of the trajectories of fluid elements
through the photosphere reveal that the motion of the fluid is non-adiabatic,
owing to strong radiative cooling when approaching the surface of optical depth
unity followed by reheating by the radiation field from below. The temperature
structure of the photosphere results from the competition between expansion of
rising fluid elements and radiative heating. The former acts to lower the
temperature of the fluid whereas the latter acts to increase it towards the
radiative equilibrium temperature with a net entropy gain. After the fluid
overturns and descends towards the convection zone, radiative energy loss again
decreases the entropy of the fluid. Radiative heating and cooling of fluid
elements that penetrate into the photosphere and overturn do not occur in equal
amounts. The imbalance in the cumulative heating and cooling of these fluid
elements is responsible for the reversal of temperature fluctuations with
respect to height in the photosphere.

  We compare our new Period-Luminosity relations with those adopted by several
recent investigations, including the Freedman and Sandage H_0 projects.
Adopting our Period-Luminosity relationship would tend to increase the Sandage

PLR with those derived from LMC Cepheids, we find the slopes for K and W_{VI}
identical in the two galaxies within their respective errors. Our data lead to
a W_{VI} distance modulus for the Large Magellanic Cloud, m-M = 18.50\pm0.03,
uncorrected for any metallicity effects. Applying recently derived metalllcity
corrections yields a corrected LMC distance modulus of (m-M)_0=18.40\pm0.05.
Comparing our Period-Luminosity relationship to solar-metallicity Cepheids in

analysis that periodic bipolar outbursts from a central AGN can induce harmonic
oscillatory motions on both sides of the gas core.
  (Results) Using realistic AGN properties, we find that the motions of the gas
core, driven by such feedback processes, can flatten the dark matter and/or
stellar profiles after 4-5 Gyr. These results are consistent with recent
observational studies that suggest that most giant elliptical galaxies have
cores or are ""missing light"" in their inner part. Since stars behave as a

profiles of the complex energy landscape of biomolecules. In order to obtain
reliable estimates of the energy landscape characteristics it is necessary to
combine the experimental measurements with sound theoretical models and
simulations. Here, we show how by using temperature as a variable in mechanical
unfolding of biomolecules in laser optical tweezer or AFM experiments the
roughness of the energy landscape can be measured without making any
assumptions about the underlying reaction oordinate. The efficacy of the
formalism is illustrated by reviewing experimental results that have directly
measured roughness in a protein-protein complex. The roughness model can also
be used to interpret experiments on forced-unfolding of proteins in which
temperature is varied. Estimates of other aspects of the energy landscape such
as free energy barriers or the transition state (TS) locations could depend on
the precise model used to analyze the experimental data. We illustrate the
inherent difficulties in obtaining the transition state location from loading
rate or force-dependent unfolding rates. Because the transition state moves as
the force or the loading rate is varied it is in general difficult to invert
the experimental data unless the curvature at the top of the one dimensional
free energy profile is large, i.e the barrier is sharp. The independence of the
TS location on force holds good only for brittle or hard biomolecules whereas
the TS location changes considerably if the molecule is soft or plastic. We
also comment on the usefulness of extension of the molecule as a surrogate
reaction coordinate especially in the context of force-quench refolding of
proteins and RNA.

limited by the volume-integrated feature of neutron and magnetization

($\mu$SR) measurements which have a unique sensitivity to volume fractions of
magnetically ordered and paramagnetic regions, and studied QPTs from itinerant
heli/ferro magnet to paramagnet in MnSi (single-crystal; varying pressure) and
(Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_{x}$)RuO$_{3}$ (ceramic specimens; varying $x$). Our results
provide the first clear evidence that both cases are associated with
spontaneous phase separation and suppression of dynamic critical behavior,
revealed a slow but dynamic character of the ``partial order'' diffuse spin
correlations in MnSi above the critical pressure, and, combined with other
known results in heavy-fermion and cuprate systems, suggest a possibility that
a majority of QPTs involve first-order transitions and/or phase separation.

access) signature optimization and MIMO (multi-input-multi-output) beamforming
vector selection. In CDMA signature optimization, for a particular user, the
receiver selects a signature vector from a codebook to best avoid interference
from other users, and then feeds the corresponding index back to the specified
user. For MIMO beamforming vector selection, the receiver chooses a beamforming
vector from a given codebook to maximize throughput, and feeds back the
corresponding index to the transmitter. These two problems are dual: both can
be modeled as selecting a unit norm vector from a finite size codebook to
""match"" a randomly generated Gaussian matrix. In signature optimization, the
least match is required while the maximum match is preferred for beamforming
selection.
  Assuming that the feedback link is rate limited, our main result is an exact
asymptotic performance formulae where the length of the signature/beamforming
vector, the dimensions of interference/channel matrix, and the feedback rate
approach infinity with constant ratios. The proof rests on a large deviation
principle over a random matrix ensemble. Further, we show that random codebooks
generated from the isotropic distritution are asymptotically optimal not only
on average, but also with probability one.

the traditional notion of sensitive dependence, measurable sensitivity carries
up to measure-theoretic isomorphism, thus ignoring the behavior of the function
on null sets and eliminating dependence on the choice of metric.

a flux limitation for high cell densities.
  This is a first order quasilinear equation, its flux depends on space and
time via the solution to an elliptic PDE in which the right hand side is the
solution to the hyperbolic equation. This model lacks strong compactness or
contraction properties. Our purpose is to prove the existence of an entropy
solution obtained, as usual, in passing to the limit in a sequence of solutions
to the parabolic approximation.
  The method consists in the derivation of a kinetic formulation for the weak
limit. The specific structure of the limiting kinetic equation allows for a
`rigidity theorem' which identifies some property of the solution (which might
be non-unique) to this kinetic equation. This is enough to deduce a posteriori
the strong convergence of a subsequence.

distinguish between domains in which the classical dynamics is regular or
chaotic. For separable surfaces, we compute the limiting distribution, and show
that it is supported by an interval, which is independent of the properties of
the surface. In systems which are chaotic, or in random-waves, the
area-to-perimeter distribution has substantially different features which we
study numerically. We compare the features of the distribution for chaotic wave
functions with the predictions of the percolation model to find agreement, but
only for nodal domains which are big with respect to the wavelength scale. This
work is also closely related to, and provides a new point of view on
isoperimetric inequalities.
