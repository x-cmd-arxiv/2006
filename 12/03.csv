design sensitivities, and upgrades and space missions planned, it is likely
that in the next five to ten years gravitational radiation will be detected
directly from a variety of classes of objects. The most confidently expected of
these classes is compact binaries, involving neutron stars or black holes.
Detection of their coalescence, or their long-term orbits, has the potential to
inform us about the evolutionary history of compact binaries and possibly even
star formation over the past several billion years. We review what is currently
known about compact binaries as sources of gravitational radiation, as well as
the current uncertainties and what we expect to learn from future detections of
gravitational waves from these systems.

the massive core NGC 6334 I(N), a region known to be undergoing massive star
formation. At 1.3 cm we detect three sources, of which two had been previously
detected at centimeter or millimeter wavelengths. At 7 mm we detect four
sources. We suggest that three of these sources are subcomponents of the
millimeter source SMA 1, that at these wavelengths is the dominant source in
the region. The fourth 7 mm source appears to be associated with the relatively
isolated source SMA 6. In all four 7 mm sources, the continuum emission is
arising from structures of dimensions in the order of 1000 AU for which we
estimate masses of order a few solar masses. We interpret these 7 mm sources as
massive circumstellar disks that, however, surround stars or compact small
stellar groups that at present have masses comparable to those of the disks but
that may be accreting on their way to become massive stars.

for detection incompleteness, the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of each
galaxy is consistent with a powerlaw with negative logarithmic differential
slope, beta~2.0. However, beta strongly correlates with incompleteness,
indicating the XLF flattens at low-Lx. The composite XLF is well-fitted by a
powerlaw with a break at 2.21(+0.65,-0.56)E38 erg/s and beta=1.40(+0.10,-0.13)
and 2.84(+0.39,-0.30) below and above it, respectively. The break is close to
the Eddington limit for a 1.4Msun neutron-star, but the XLF shape rules out its
representing the division between neutron-star and black-hole systems. Although
the XLFs are similar, we find evidence of some variation between galaxies. The
high-Lx XLF slope does not correlate with age, but may correlate with
[alpha/Fe]. Considering only LMXBs with Lx>1E37 erg/s, matching the LMXBs with
globular clusters (GCs) identified in HST observations of 19 of the galaxies,
we find the probability a GC hosts an LMXB is proportional to LGC^alpha
ZFe^gamma} where alpha=1.01+/-0.19 and gamma=0.33+/-0.11. Correcting for GC
luminosity and colour effects, and detection incompleteness, we find no
evidence that the fraction of LMXBs with Lx>1e37 erg/s in GCs (40%), or the
fraction of GCs hosting LMXBs (~6.5%) varies between galaxies. The spatial
distribution of LMXBs resembles that of GCs, and the specific frequency of
LMXBs is proportional to the GC specific luminosity, consistent with the
hypothesis that all LMXBs form in GCs. If the LMXB lifetime is tau and the duty
cycle is Fd, our results imply ~1.5 (tau/1E8 yr)^-1 /Fd LMXBs are formed per
Gyr per GC and we place an upper limit of 1 active LMXB in the field per

  Methods: We used recently published CFHT r' and i' data for variable stars in
M33 to extract the light curve of the optical counterpart of X-7. We combined
these data with DIRECT B and V measurements in order to search for an
independent optical modulation with the X-ray periodicity. The periodic
modulation is modelled with the ellipsoidal effect. We used UBVRr'i' magnitudes
of the system to constrain the temperature and radius of the optical component.
  Results: The optical data revealed a periodicity of 3.4530 +- 0.0014 days,
which is consistent with the known X-ray period. Double modulation, which we
attributed to ellipsoidal modulation, is clearly seen in four different optical
bands. The absolute magnitude in six optical bands is most consistent with a
stellar counterpart with 33000 < T_{eff} < 47000 K and 15 < R < 20 R_{\sun}. We
modelled the optical periodic modulation and derived the masses of the two
components as a function of the orbital inclination and the radius of the
stellar component. The resulting mass range for the compact object is 1.3 < M <
23 M_{\sun}.
  Conclusions: The system is probably a black hole HMXB, similar to Cyg X-1,
LMC X-1 and LMC X-3.

motion among many different ordered states through chaotic transition in
dynamical systems. Unlike the expectation of the prevalence of chaotic
itinerancy in high-dimensional systems, we identify chaotic itinerant behavior
from a relatively simple ecological system, which consists only of two coupled
consumer-resource pairs. The system exhibits chaotic bursting activity, in
which the explosion and the shrinkage of the population alternate indefinitely,
while the explosion of one pair co-occurs with the shrinkage of the other pair.
We analyze successfully the bursting activity in the framework of chaotic
itinerancy, and find that large duration times of bursts tend to cluster in
time, allowing the effective burst prognosis. We also investigate the control
schemes on the bursting activity, and demonstrate that invoking the competitive
rise of the consumer in one pair can even elongate the burst of the other pair
rather than shorten it.

The relation is tight and can be applied in various quantum-cryptographic
settings.
  Protocols for quantum 1-out-of-2 Oblivious Transfer and quantum Bit
Commitment are presented and the uncertainty relation is used to prove the
security of these protocols in the bounded quantum-storage model according to
new strong security definitions.
  As another application, we consider the realistic setting of Quantum Key
Distribution (QKD) against quantum-memory-bounded eavesdroppers. The
uncertainty relation allows to prove the security of QKD protocols in this
setting while tolerating considerably higher error rates compared to the
standard model with unbounded adversaries. For instance, for the six-state
protocol with one-way communication, a bit-flip error rate of up to 17% can be
tolerated (compared to 13% in the standard model).
  Our uncertainty relation also yields a lower bound on the min-entropy key
uncertainty against known-plaintext attacks when quantum ciphers are composed.
Previously, the key uncertainty of these ciphers was only known with respect to
Shannon entropy.

which each legitimate conferee can read out securely the secret message
announced by another one, but a vicious eavesdropper can get nothing about it.
The first one is based on the same key shared efficiently and securely by all
the parties with Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, and each conferee
sends his secret message to the others with one-time pad crypto-system. The
other one is based on quantum encryption with a quantum key, a sequence of GHZ
states shared among all the conferees and used repeatedly after confirming
their security. Both these schemes are optimal as their intrinsic efficiency
for qubits approaches the maximal value.

efficient when one of the parties of secret sharing is remote to the others who
are in adjacent, especially the parties are more than three. We describe the
process of this protocol and discuss its security when the quantum information
carrying is polarized single photons running circularly. It will be shown that
entanglement is not necessary for quantum secret sharing. Moreover, the
theoretic efficiency is improved to approach 100% as almost all the instances
can be used for generating the private key, and each photon can carry one bit
of information without quantum storage. It is straightforwardly to utilize this
topological structure to complete quantum secret sharing with multi-level
two-particle entanglement in high capacity securely.
