quasars. As the data and models improve, there are systematic effects that need
to be explored. Quasar continuum and broad-line regions may respond differently
to microlensing due to their different sizes; to understand this effect, we
study microlensing of finite sources by a mass function of stars. We find that
microlensing is insensitive to the slope of the mass function but does depend
on the mass range. For negative parity images, diluting the stellar population
with dark matter increases the magnification dispersion for small sources and
decreases it for large sources. This implies that the quasar continuum and
broad-line regions may experience very different microlensing in
negative-parity lensed images. We confirm earlier conclusions that the surface
brightness profile and geometry of the source have little effect on
microlensing. Finally, we consider non-circular sources. We show that
elliptical sources that are aligned with the direction of shear have larger
magnification dispersions than sources with perpendicular alignment, an effect
that becomes more prominent as the ellipticity increases. Elongated sources can
lead to more rapid variability than circular sources, which raises the prospect
of using microlensing to probe source shape.

most complete multiband coverage of an XRR burst afterglow to date. Results.
The optical and X-ray light curve is characterised by an early flattening and
an intense bump peaking around 6 days after the burst onset. We explain the
former by an off-axis viewed jet, in agreement with the predictions made for
XRR by some models, and the latter with an energy injection equivalent in
intensity to the initial shock. The analysis of the spectral flux distribution
reveals an extinction compatible with a low chemical enrichment surrounding the
burst. Together with the detection of an underlying starburst host galaxy we
can strengthen the link between XRR and classical long-duration bursts.

onboard the Hubble Space Telescope and from the ground with the Telescopio
Nazionale Galileo, we find that luminosity profiles are very well described by
a single Sersic law in 52% of the cases and for the remaining objects (48%) it
is necessary to include an exponential profile, which could indicate the
presence of a disk. The average bulge to disk luminosity ratio for the galaxies
is (b/d) ~ 1.1. The analysis of the photometric parameters of the sub samples
indicates that FR Is and FR IIs show rather similar bulges in terms of
effective surface magnitude, effective radius, and Sersic index. On the other
hand, disks in FR Is and FR IIs hosts show, on average, different properties.
Central surface magnitudes are dimmer and scale lengths are greater by a factor
of 2 in FR Is when compared to FR IIs. We also estimate the black hole mass
associated with each galaxy using two different methods that claim tight
correlations between the black hole mass (M_BH) with the infrared bulge
luminosity (L_bulge) and with the Sersic index (n). Our data indicate that
masses obtained through these two methods show a high dispersion and M_BH
obtained through L_bulge are systematically higher (by a factor of ~3) than
those obtained using n. This result may reflect the fact that for our sample
galaxies we do not find any correlation between L_bulge and n.

calibration between (b-y)_0 and [Fe/H] at a given temperature shows that the
traditional color-metallicity relations underestimate the color of the turnoff
stars at high metallicity. With the revised relation, the metallicity from hk
and the reddening for NGC 6791 become [Fe/H] = +0.45 +/- 0.04 and E(b-y) =
0.113 +/- 0.012 or E(B-V) = 0.155 +/- 0.016. Using the same technique,
reanalysis of the photometry for NGC 6253 produces [Fe/H] = +0.58 +/-0.04 and
E(b-y) = 0.120 +/- 0.018 or E(B-V) = 0.160 +/- 0.025. The errors quoted include
both the internal and external errors. For NGC 6791, the metallicity from m_1
is a factor of two below that from hk, a result that may be coupled to the
consistently low metal abundance from DDO photometry of the cluster and the
C-deficiency found from high dispersion spectroscopy. E(B-V) is the same value
predicted from Galactic reddening maps. With E(B-V) = 0.15 and [Fe/H] = +0.45,
the available isochrones predict an age of 7.0 +/- 1.0 Gyr and an apparent
modulus of (m-M) = 13.60 +/- 0.15, with the dominant source of the uncertainty
arising from inconsistencies among the isochrones. The reanalysis of NGC 6253
with the revised lower reddening confirms that on both the hk and m_1
metallicity scales, NGC 6253, while less than half the age of NGC 6791, remains
at least as metal-rich as NGC 6791, if not richer.

demonstrates that in the numerical simulations properties of acoustic waves

downdrafts, and demonstrate that the spatial pattern of these perturbations

obtained from the real Sun, displaying characteristic hyperbolic structures. We
then test the time-distance measurements and inversions by calculating acoustic
travel times from a sequence of vertical velocities at the photosphere of the
simulated data, and inferring a mean 3D flow fields by performing inversion
based on the ray approximation. The inverted horizontal flow fields agree very
well with the simulated data in subsurface areas up to 3 Mm deep, but differ in

significant constraints on fundamental cosmological parameters. We consider
three statistical quantities that can be constructed from a cluster peculiar
velocity catalog: the probability density function, the mean pairwise streaming
velocity, and the pairwise velocity dispersion. These quantities are applied to
an envisioned data set which measures line-of-sight cluster velocities with
normal errors of 100 km/s for all clusters with masses larger than $10^{14}$

matrix analysis of this survey shows that the normalization of the matter power
spectrum and the dark energy equation of state can be constrained to better
than 10 percent, and the Hubble constant and the primordial power spectrum
index can be constrained to a few percent, independent of any other
cosmological observations. We also find that the current constraint on the

correlations with the local structures within a range of few hundreds Mpc
should be present. We provide detailed predictions of the signal based on the
PSCz map of the local universe. We also use mock N-body catalogues complemented
with the halo model of structures to study some statistical features of the
expected signatures. The results are largely independent from cosmological
details, and depend mostly on the index of correlation (or bias) of the sources
with respect to the large scale distribution of galaxies. For instance, the
predicted signal in the case of a quadratic correlation (as it may happen for a
dark matter annihilation contribution to the diffuse gamma flux) differs
substantially from a linear correlation case, providing a complementary tool to
unveil the nature of the sources of the diffuse gamma ray emission. The chances
of the present and future space and ground based observatories to measure these

However, observations between 50 and 300 GeV are rare, and the high-energy peak

Assuming a differential photon flux dN/dE proportional to E^-a, we measure a

hours after the GRB. Focusing on GRBs 061121, 060614, and 060124, but
generalizing to the full ($>$50 Msec XRT exposure) Swift sample up to and
including GRB061210, we show that the early emission in $>$90% of early
afterglows has a characteristic $\nu F_{\nu}$ spectral energy $E_{\rm peak}$
which likely evolves from the $\gamma$-rays through the soft X-ray band on
timescales of $10^2-10^4$s after the GRB. The observed spectra are strongly
curved when plotted with logarithmic axes and have often been incorrectly
fitted in other studies with a time-varying soft X-ray absorption. The spectral
evolution inferred from fitting instead models used to fit GRBs demonstrates a
common evolution--a powerlaw hardness intensity correlation and hard to soft
evolution--for GRBs and the early X-ray afterglows and X-ray flares. Combined
with studies of short timescale variability, our findings indicate a central
engine active for longer than previously suspected. The GRB spectra are
observed to become very soft at late times due to an intrinsic spectral
evolution and due to the surprising faintness of some afterglows. We discuss
models for the early X-ray emission.

(sensitivity) and Gemini-South/T-ReCS (spatial resolution) to study the mid-IR
properties of local (d < 75Mpc) LIRGs. The T-ReCS 8-10micron imaging
observations of LIRGs have allowed us to spatially resolve the nuclear emission
(star formation and/or AGN) and that of HII regions in the central 3-7kpc
regions of LIRGs. From the comparison of the 8micron/Pa-alpha ratios of the
integrated vs. resolved HII regions of LIRGs, we infer the existence of an
8micron diffuse component, not directly related to the ionizing stars, that can
be as luminous as that from the resolved HII regions. We conclude that although
the mid-IR integrated luminosity of galaxies undergoing dusty, intense star
formation is a good indicator of the star formation rate (SFR), the empirical
calibrations should be based on the integrated emission of nearby galaxies, not
that of HII regions alone. To this end we provide a calibration of the SFR in
terms of the integrated 24micron luminosity that can be used for distant dusty
galaxies.

in some quasars, the polarization is seen only in the continuum and is not
shared by emission lines. In this case, the polarized flux is considered to
show the intrinsic spectrum interior to the BLR, removing off the emissions
from the BLR and torus. We have used this polarization to reveal the
Balmer-edge feature and near-IR spectral shape of the central engine, both of

subjected to single-fluid or two-fluid approximations. In the case of weakly
ionized plasmas however, this can be inappropriate due to distinct responses
from the multiple constituent species to both collisional and non-collisional
forces. As a result, in dense molecular clouds and proto-stellar accretion
discs for instance, the conductivity of the plasma may be highly anisotropic
leading to phenomena such as Hall and ambipolar diffusion strongly influencing
the dynamics.
  Diffusive processes are known to restrict the stability of conventional
numerical schemes which are not implicit in nature. Furthermore, recent work
establishes that a large Hall term can impose an additional severe stability
limit on standard explicit schemes. Following a previous paper which presented
the one-dimensional case, we describe a fully three-dimensional method which
relaxes the normal restrictions on explicit schemes for multifluid processes.
This is achieved by applying the little known Super TimeStepping technique to
the symmetric (ambipolar) component of the evolution operator for the magnetic
field in the local plasma rest-frame, and the new Hall Diffusion Scheme to the
skew-symmetric (Hall) component.

from Chandra constrains contributions from the two companions of T Tau N. The
X-ray grating spectrum is rich in emission lines, but shows an unusual mixture
of features from very hot (~30 MK) and very cool (1-3 MK) plasma, both emitted
by similar amounts of emission measure. The cool plasma confirms the picture of
a soft excess in the form of an enhanced OVII/OVIII Lya flux ratio, similar to
that previously reported for other accreting TTS. Diagnostics from lines formed
by this plasma indicate low electron densities (<~ 1E10 cm-3). The Ne/Fe
abundance ratio is consistent with a trend in pre-main sequence stars in which
this ratio depends on spectral type, but not on accretion. On the basis of line
density diagnostics, we conclude that the density of the cool ``soft-excess''
plasma is orders of magnitude below that predicted for an accretion shock,
assuming previously determined accretion rates of (3-6)E-8 M_sun/y. We argue
that loading of magnetic field lines with infalling material suppresses the
heating process in a part of the corona. We thus suggest that the X-ray
production of T Tau is influenced by the accretion process although the X-rays
may not form in the bulk of the accretion footpoints.

mysterious, not only eluding experimental observation, but also generating a
great deal of controversy among theorists. Recent discovery of what is
interpreted as a non-classical moment of inertia at low temperature in solid
He-4 has elicited much excitement as a possible first observation of a
supersolid phase. In the two years following the discovery, however, more
puzzles than answers have been provided to the fundamental issue of whether the
supersolid phase exists, in helium or any other naturally occurring condensed
matter system. Presently, there is no established theoretical framework to
understand the body of experimental data on He-4. Different microscopic
mechanisms that have been suggested to underlie superfluidity in a perfect
quantum crystal do not seem viable for \he4, for which a wealth of experimental
and theoretical evidence points to an insulating crystalline ground state. This
perspective addresses some of the outstanding problems with the interpretation
of recent experimental observations of the apparent superfluid response in He-4
(seen now by several groups) and discusses various scenarios alternative to the
homogeneous supersolid phase, such as superfluidity induced by extended defects
of the crystalline structure which include grain boundaries, dislocations,
anisotropic stresses, etc. Can a metastable superfluid ""glassy"" phase exist,
and can it be relevant to some of the experimental observations ? One of the
most interesting and unsolved fundamental questions is what interatomic
potentials, given the freedom to design one, can support an ideal supersolid
phase in continuous space, and can they be found in Nature.

T)$, where $G$ is the growth rate and $\Delta T$ is the super-cooling. The
other is observed in low molar mass solutions (as well as for small molecules)
and is diffusion controlled with $G \sim \Delta T$, for small $\Delta T$. Our
model unifies these two regimes in a single formalism. The model accounts for
the accumulation of polymer chains near the growth front and invokes an
entropic barrier theory to recover both limits of nucleation and diffusion
control. The basic theory applies to both melts and solutions, and we
numerically calculate the growth details of a single crystal in a dilute

considerations, in addition to the traditional energetic arguments, can capture
general trends of a vast range of phenomenology. Unifying ideas on

$^4$He atoms is a self-generated Mott insulator, that is, the $^4$He atoms

we are able to interpret the textbook defect-driven supersolids as excitations

disorder induces a closing of the Mott gap through the generation of mid-gap
localized states at the chemical potential. Depending on the magnitude of the
disorder, we find that the destruction of the Mott state takes place for
$d+z>4$ either through a Bose glass phase (strong disorder) or through a direct
transition to a superfluid (weak disorder). For $d+z<4$, disorder is always
relevant. The critical value of the disorder that separates these two regimes
is shown to be a function of the boson filling, interaction and the momentum
cut off. We apply our work to the experimentally observed enhancement $^3$He

for the typical (median) value, which is nonzero, because the distribution of
the helicity modulus among different disorder realizations is very asymmetric.

(most probable value). A finite-size scaling analysis of the location parameter
yields a critical temperature and critical exponents in agreement with previous

molecules with different values of B for bonds in the main chain and in the
branches have also been investigated. The possible presence of crystallization
has been characterized by calculating the collective light scattering function
of the different samples after annealing at a convenient temperature below the
onset of crystallization. It is concluded that crystallization is inherited
more efficiently in the systems with branched chains and also for higher values
of B. The branched molecules with the highest B values in the main chain bonds
exhibit two distinct transitions in the heating curves which may be associated
with two glass transitions. This behavior has been detected experimentally for
chains with relatively long flexible branches.

irreversible gels the dynamical susceptibility is instead an increasing

to the mean cluster size. On the basis of molecular dynamics simulations, we
here show that in colloidal gelation where clusters are not permanent, at very
low temperature and volume fractions, i.e. when the lifetime of the bonds is
much larger than the structural relaxation time, the non-linear susceptibility
has a behavior similar to the one of the irreversible gel, followed, at higher
volume fractions, by a crossover towards the behavior of glass forming liquids.

nonlinear blind source separation (BSS) seeks to find a ""source"" time series,
comprised of statistically independent combinations of the measured components.
In this paper, we seek a source time series with local velocity cross
correlations that vanish everywhere in stimulus state space. However, in an
earlier paper the local velocity correlation matrix was shown to constitute a
metric on state space. Therefore, nonlinear BSS maps onto a problem of
differential geometry: given the metric observed in the measurement coordinate
system, find another coordinate system in which the metric is diagonal
everywhere. We show how to determine if the observed data are separable in this
way, and, if they are, we show how to construct the required transformation to
the source coordinate system, which is essentially unique except for an unknown
rotation that can be found by applying the methods of linear BSS. Thus, the
proposed technique solves nonlinear BSS in many situations or, at least,
reduces it to linear BSS, without the use of probabilistic, parametric, or
iterative procedures. This paper also describes a generalization of this
methodology that performs nonlinear independent subspace separation. In every
case, the resulting decomposition of the observed data is an intrinsic property
of the stimulus' evolution in the sense that it does not depend on the way the
observer chooses to view it (e.g., the choice of the observing machine's
sensors). In other words, the decomposition is a property of the evolution of
the ""real"" stimulus that is ""out there"" broadcasting energy to the observer.
The technique is illustrated with analytic and numerical examples.

maximum entropy principle, for several cases where only limited information
about the propagation environment is available. First, analytical models are
derived for the cases where certain parameters (channel energy, average energy,
spatial correlation matrix) are known deterministically. Frequently, these
parameters are unknown (typically because the received energy or the spatial
correlation varies with the user position), but still known to represent
meaningful system characteristics. In these cases, analytical channel models
are derived by assigning entropy-maximizing distributions to these parameters,
and marginalizing them out. For the MIMO case with spatial correlation, we show
that the distribution of the covariance matrices is conveniently handled
through its eigenvalues. The entropy-maximizing distribution of the covariance
matrix is shown to be a Wishart distribution. Furthermore, the corresponding
probability density function of the channel matrix is shown to be described
analytically by a function of the channel Frobenius norm. This technique can
provide channel models incorporating the effect of shadow fading and spatial
correlation between antennas without the need to assume explicit values for
these parameters. The results are compared in terms of mutual information to
the classical i.i.d. Gaussian model.

fixing the gauge and solving the linearized gravitational field equations to
eliminate the metric perturbation variable in terms of the matter variables. In
a wide class of cases--which include f(R) gravity, the Einstein-aether theory
of Jacobson and Mattingly, and Bekenstein's TeVeS theory--the remaining
perturbation equations for the matter fields are second order in time. We show
how the symplectic current arising from the original Lagrangian gives rise to a
symmetric bilinear form on the variables of the reduced theory. If this
bilinear form is positive definite, it provides an inner product that puts the
equations of motion of the reduced theory into a self-adjoint form. A
variational principle can then be written down immediately, from which
stability can be tested readily. We illustrate our method in the case of
Einstein's equation with perfect fluid matter, thereby re-deriving, in a
systematic manner, Chandrasekhar's variational principle for radial
oscillations of spherically symmetric stars. In a subsequent paper, we will

excluded from propagating into one otherwise universal extra dimension. This
exclusion of the Higgs from propagating into an otherwise universal extra
dimension violates tree-level Kaluza-Klein number conservation in the Yukawa
interactions. As a consequence, there is inter-mode mixing between fermions.
For example, zero-mode fermions mix with their associated Kaluza-Klein
excitations. This is in contrast to the original universal extra dimensions
scenario, in which conservation of Kaluza-Klein number prohibits such
inter-mode mixing. Inter-mode mixing is especially significant for the top
quark, since its mass (171.4 +/- 2.1 GeV) is approximately one-half the current
Tevatron mass bound (~350-400 GeV) for Kaluza-Klein excitations of quarks
propagating into universal extra dimensions. We compute the effects that mixing
among the zero-modes and lowest-lying Kaluza-Klein excitations has on the
lightest third-generation charge 2/3 quark mass eigenvalue in the non-universal
Higgs model with one otherwise universal extra dimension. Another consequence
of the inter-mode mixing is that the Kaluza-Klein excitations of the fermions
can decay to a zero-mode Higgs and a corresponding zero-mode fermion. As a
result, the pair production of Kaluza-Klein excitations of the top quark would
lead to two zero-mode Higgs bosons plus a zero-mode top quark/anti-quark pair.
We compute the cross section that the non-universal Higgs model contributes to
Higgs production at the Large Hadron Collider. The effect is quite large: For
example, the Kaluza-Klein contribution to Higgs production is comparable to or
larger than the Standard Model contribution, depending on the Higgs mass, for
compactification scales up to about 600 GeV.

lead to new phenomena signalling the unification of gravity with the other
fundamental interactions. Various recent theoretical frameworks indicate a
possible window for non-Newtonian forces with gravitational coupling strength
in the micrometre range. The major expected background in the same range is
attributable to the Casimir force or variants of it if dielectric materials,
rather than conducting ones, are considered. Here we review the measurements of
the Casimir force performed so far in the micrometre range and how they
determine constraints on non-Newtonian gravitation, also discussing the
dominant sources of false signals. We also propose a geometry-independent
parameterization of all data in terms of the measurement of the constant c. Any
Casimir force measurement should lead, once all corrections are taken into
account, to a determination of the constant c which, in order to assess the
accuracy of the measurement, can be compared with its more precise value known
through microscopic measurements. Although the last decade of experiments has
resulted in solid demonstrations of the Casimir force, the situation is not
conclusive with respect to being able to discover new physics. Future
experiments and novel phenomenological analysis will be necessary to discover
non-Newtonian forces or to push the window for their possible existence into
regions of the parameter space which theoretically appear unnatural.

candidates from a particle physics point of view. After their number density
has frozen out in the early universe, determining their relic density today,
WIMPs are still kept very close to thermal equilibrium by scattering events
with standard model particles. The complete decoupling from the thermal bath
happens as late as around 1-10 MeV, thereby setting an important cosmological
scale that can directly be translated into a small-scale cutoff of the spectrum
of matter density fluctuations. We present here a full analytic treatment of
the kinetic decoupling process from first principles. This allows an exact
determination of the decoupling scale, for an arbitrary WIMP candidate and any
scattering amplitude. As an application, we consider the situation of the
lightest supersymmetric particle as well as the lightest Kaluza-Klein particle
that arises in theories with universal extra dimensions; furthermore, we show
that our formalism can also easily be applied to, e.g., the evolution of the
non-relativistic electrons into the recombination regime. Finally, we comment

prospects for the indirect detection of dark matter.

with its respective solution. Some in medium properties of the model (mainly
masses) are investigated within reasonable prescriptions. In particular the
behavior of the {\it in medium} pion and sigma masses and a particular way of
calculating {\it in medium} coupling to baryons is investigated. A symmetry
radius for finite baryonic densities is proposed and calculated in different
ways in terms of the other variables of the model and these different ways of

pattern of the chiral symmetry breaking drastically changes compared to the
standard one. It becomes SU(N_f) -> SO(N_f). While for N_f=2 the chiral
Lagrangian describing the 'pion"" dynamics is well-known, this is not the case
at N_f>2. We outline a general strategy for deriving chiral Lagrangians for the
coset spaces M_k=SU(k)/SO(k), and study in detail the case of N_f=k=3. We
obtain two- and four-derivatives terms in the chiral Lagrangian on the coset
space M_3 = SU(3)/SO(3), as well as the Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten term, in
terms of an explicit parameterization of the quotient manifold. Then we discuss
stable topological solitons supported by this Lagrangian. Aspects of relevant
topological considerations scattered in the literature are reviewed. The same
analysis applies to SO(N) gauge theories with N_f Weyl flavors in the vector

We show it can be split into three terms, two of which are canceled by bulk
fermions and Green-Schwarz four forms respectively. The remaining anomaly
carries an integer coefficient and hence can be canceled by localized fermions
in suitable representations. We present various examples in the context of

$M$ be a compact manifold with negative sectional curvature and suppose that
along every geodesic in $M$ there is a parallel vector field making curvature
$-a^2$ with the geodesic direction. We prove that $M$ has constant curvature
equal to $-a^2$ if $M$ is odd dimensional, or if $M$ is even dimensional and
has sectional curvature pinched as follows: $-\Lambda^2 < K < -\lambda^2$ where
$\lambda/\Lambda > .93$. When $a$ is extremal, i.e. $-a^2$ is the curvature
minimum or maximum for the manifold, this result is analogous to rank rigidity
results in various other curvature settings where higher rank implies that the
space is locally symmetric. In particular, this result is the first positive
result for lower rank (i.e. when $-a^2$ is minimal), and in the upper rank case
gives a shorter proof of the hyperbolic rank rigidity theorem of
Hamenst\""{a}dt, subject to the pinching condition in even dimension. We also
present a rigidity result using only an assumption on maximal Lyapunov
exponents in direct analogy with work done by Connell. Our proof of the main
theorem uses the ergodic theory of the frame flow developed by Brin and others
- in particular the transitivity group associated to this flow.

$, and a H\""older potential $ A $. In ergodic optimization, one is interested
in properties of $A$-maximizing probabilities. Assuming ergodicity, it is
already known that the projection of the support of such probabilities is
contained in the set of non-wandering points with respect to $ A $, denoted by
$ \Omega(A) $. A separating sub-action is a sub-action such that the
sub-cohomological equation becomes an identity just on $ \Omega(A) $. For a
fixed H\""older potential $ A $, we prove not only that there exists H\""older
separating sub-actions but in fact that they define a residual subset of the
H\""older sub-actions.
  We use the existence of such separating sub-actions in an application for the
case one has more than one maximizing probability. Suppose we have a finite
number of distinct $A$-maximizing probabilities with ergodic property: $ \hat
\mu_j $, $ j \in \{1, 2, ..., l\} $. Considering a calibrated sub-action $ u $,
under certain conditions, we will show that it can be written in the form $$ u
(\mathbf x)= u (\mathbf x^i) + h_A(\mathbf x^i, \mathbf x), $$ for all $
\mathbf x \in \Sigma $, where $ \mathbf x^i $ is a special point (in the
projection of the support of a certain $ \hat \mu_i $) and $ h_A $ is the

are structurally stable and exhibit multiple equilibria and limit cycles, as
well as more complex, fractal solution sets, such as Devil's staircases and
``fractal sunbursts``. All known solutions of dissipative BDEs have stationary

The existing product suite is intended to provide turbulence information to
aircraft flying in the vicinity of the jet stream. Turbulence is also a
frequently occurring phenomenon in the boundary layer and may pose a threat to
low-flying aircraft and aircraft during the take-off and landing phases of
flight. Therefore, a numerical model-derived boundary layer turbulence product
is under development. The boundary layer turbulence index (TIBL) product is
designed to assess the potential for turbulence in the lower troposphere,
generated using National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Rapid
Update Cycle (RUC)-2 model data. The index algorithm approximates boundary
layer turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) by parameterizing vertical wind shear,
responsible for mechanical production, and kinematic heat flux, responsible for
buoyant production. The TIBL product is expected to be most effective during
the afternoon hours in a regime characterized by a quasi-steady state
convective mixed layer. Preliminary case studies and validation have revealed a
strong correlation between the presence of TKE maxima and peak wind gust

claims that temperature inaccuracies make the key exchange scheme based on

claim is irrelevant for the security of the idealized/mathematical communicator
because it violates basic assumptions. Furthermore, in general practical
applications, as it has been pointed out in the very first paper, the use of
thermal noise is disadvantageous therefore the issue of temperature and its
accuracy is unimportant even for the security of common practical realizations.
It is important to emphasize that any deviation from the idealized scheme can
lead to a finite level of security. Thus, if the above-mentioned author had
stressed the inaccuracy of the resistor values; his claim would have been
practically valid. However the impact of such systematic errors can be kept
under control. Here we cite our relevant analysis (Phys. Lett. A 359, (2006)
741-744) of 1% voltage inaccuracy along the line due to wire resistance
effects, which can be considered as a general result for inaccuracies of this
order. The necessity to build a statistics to extract information during the
properly chosen clock time leads to extremely poor eavesdropper statistics and
this situation provides a good practical raw bit security that can be orders of
magnitude beyond the raw bit security of idealized quantum communicators.

achieved. It is also shown that, for a given value of $N$, a signal comprised
of an attenuated separable state of $N$ photons will actually produce a better
phase estimate than will a signal comprised of an equally attenuated $N00N$
state, unless the transmittance of the medium is very high. This is a
consequence of the need to utilize measurement operators appropriate to the
different signal states. The result is that, for most practical applications in
realistic scenarios with attenuation, the resolution of $N00N$ state-based
phase estimation not only does not achieve the Heisenberg Limit, but is
actually worse than the Standard Quantum Limit. It is demonstrated that this
performance deficit becomes more pronounced as the number, $N$, of photons in
