accretion powered X-ray binary systems derived from the first principles of the
diffusion theory. Timing properties of X-ray emission are considered to be a
result of diffusive propagation of the driving perturbations in a bounded
medium. We prove that the integrated power P_x of the resulting PDS is only a
small fraction of the integrated power P_dr of the driving oscillations, which
is distributed over the disk. The resulting PDS continuum is a sum of two
components, a low frequency (LF) component which presumably originates in an
extended accretion disk and a high frequency (HF) component which originates in
the innermost part of the source (Compton cloud or corona). The LF PDS
component has a power-law shape with index of 1.0-1.5 at higher frequencies
(``red'' noise) and a flat spectrum below a characteristic (break) frequency
(``white'' noise). This white-red noise (WRN) continuum spectrum holds
information about the physical parameters of the bounded extended medium,
diffusion time scale and the dependence law of viscosity vs radius. We apply
our model of the PDS to a sample of RXTE and EXOSAT timing data from Cyg X-1
and Cyg X-2 which describes adequately the spectral transitions in these
sources.

azimuthally averaged radial magnetic field at the solar surface is used, which
contains a source term describing the emergence of new flux based on
observational sunspot data. We consider the magnetic flux diffusing over the
equator as a predictor, since this quantity is directly related to the global
dipole field from which a Babcock-Leighton dynamo generates the toroidal field
for the next activity cycle. If the source is represented schematically by a
narrow activity belt drifting with constant speed over a fixed range of
latitudes between activity minima, our predictor shows considerable predictive
skill with correlation coefficients up to 0.95 for past cycles. However, the
predictive skill is completely lost when the actually observed emergence
latitudes are used. This result originates from the fact that the precursor
amplitude is determined by the sunspot activity a few years before solar
minimum. Since stronger cycles tend to rise faster to their maximum activity
(known as the Waldmeier effect), the temporal overlapping of cycles leads to a
shift of the minimum epochs that depends on the strength of the following
cycle. This information is picked up by precursor methods and also by our flux
transport model with a schematic source. Therefore, their predictive skill does
not require a memory, i.e., a physical connection between the surface
manifestations of subsequent activity cycles.

detectors of Megaton scale. An analytical study of the spectrum of the diffuse
flux shows that, above realistic detection thresholds of 10 MeV or higher, the
spectrum essentially reflects the exponential-times-polynomial structure of the
original neutrino spectrum at the emission point. There is only a weak (tens of
per cent) dependence on the power \beta describing the growth of the supernova
rate with the redshift. Different original neutrino spectra correspond to large
differences in the observed spectrum of events at a water Cerenkov detector:
for typical supernova rates, the ratio of the numbers of events in the first
and second energy bins (of 5 MeV width) varies in the interval 1.5 - 4.3 for
pure water (energy threshold 18 MeV) and in the range 1 - 2.5 for water with
Gadolinium (10 MeV threshold). In the first case discrimination would be
difficult due to the large errors associated with background. With Gadolinium,
instead, the reduction of the total error down to 10-20 % level would allow
spectral sensitivity, with a dramatic improvement of precision with respect to
the SN1987A data. Even in this latter case, for typical neutrino luminosity the
dependence on \beta is below sensitivity, so that it can be safely neglected in
data analysis.

Spitzer data as well as other measurements from the literature with synchrotron
and dust components. The IRS data provide powerful constraints on the fits. At
15 microns, quasars are typically four times brighter than radio galaxies with
the same isotropic radio power. Based on our fits, half of this difference can
be attributed to the presence of non-thermal emission in the quasars but not
the radio galaxies. The other half is consistent with dust absorption in the
radio galaxies but not the quasars. Fitted optical depths are anti-correlated
with core dominance, from which we infer an equatorial distribution of dust
around the central engine. The median optical depth at 9.7 microns for objects
with core-dominance factor R > 10^-2 is approximately 0.4; for objects with R <
10^-2, it is 1.1. We have thus addressed a long-standing question in the
unification of FR II quasars and galaxies: quasars are more luminous in the
mid-infrared than galaxies because of a combination of Doppler-boosted
synchrotron emission in quasars and extinction in galaxies, both

concerning atmospheric opacity, dense inner core masses, and possible internal
power sources. We incorporate the effects of stellar irradiation and customize
such effects for each EGP and star. Looking collectively at the family as a
whole, we find that there are in fact two radius anomalies to be explained. Not
only are the radii of a subset of the known transiting EGPs larger than
expected from previous theory, but many of the other objects are smaller than
the default theory would allow. We suggest that the larger EGPs can be
explained by invoking enhanced atmospheric opacities that naturally retain
internal heat. This explanation might obviate the necessity for an extra
internal power source. We explain the smaller radii by the presence in perhaps
all the known transiting EGPs of dense cores, such as have been inferred for
Saturn and Jupiter. Importantly, we derive a rough correlation between the
masses of our ""best-fit"" cores and the stellar metallicity that seems to
buttress the core-accretion model of their formation. Though many caveats and
uncertainties remain, the resulting comprehensive theory that incorporates
enhanced-opacity atmospheres and dense cores is in reasonable accord with all

simple coarse-graining procedure. We consider both the case that such
coarse-grainings are performed (i) on the initial conditions, and (ii) at a
finite time with a specific additional prescription. In numerical simulations
we observe that, to a first approximation, these coarse-grainings represent
well the evolution of the two-point correlation properties over a significant
range of scales. We note, in particular, that the form of the two-point
correlation function in the original system, when it is evolving in the
asymptotic ``self-similar'' regime, may be reproduced well in a daughter
coarse-grained system in which the dynamics are still dominated by two-body
(nearest neighbor) interactions. Using analytical results on the early time
evolution of these systems, however, we show that small observed differences
between the evolved system and its coarse-grainings at the initial time will in
fact diverge as the ratio of the coarse-graining scale to the original
inter-particle distance increases. The second coarse-graining studied,
performed at a finite time in a specified manner, circumvents this problem. It
also makes more physically transparent why gravitational dynamics from these
initial conditions tends toward a ``self-similar'' evolution. We finally
discuss the precise definition of a limit in which a continuum (specifically
Vlasov-like) description of the observed linear and non-linear evolution should
be applicable.

  Forbes","The roles of apex dipoles and field penetration in the physics of
  charged, field emitting, single-walled carbon nanotubes","11 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  A 1 $\mu$m long, field emitting, (5,5) single-walled, carbon nanotube (SWCNT)
closed with a fullerene cap, and a similar open nanotube with hydrogen-atom
termination, have been simulated using the MNDO (Modified Neglect of Diatomic
Overlap) quantum-mechanical method. Both contain about 80 000 atoms. It is
found that field penetration and band-bending, and various forms of chemically
and electrically induced apex dipole, play roles. Field penetration may help to
explain electroluminescence associated with field emitting carbon nanotubes.
Charge-density oscillations, induced by the hydrogen adsorption, are also
found. Many of the effects can be related to known effects that occur with
metallic or semiconductor field emitters; this helps both to explain the
effects and to unify our knowledge about field electron emitters. However, it
is currently unclear how best to treat correlation-and-exchange effects when
defining the CNT emission barrier. A new form of definition for the field
enhancement factor (FEF) is used. Predicted FEF values for these SWCNTs are
significantly less than values predicted by simple classical formulae. The FEF
for the closed SWCNT decreases with applied field; the FEF for the H-terminated
open SWCNT is less than the FEF for the closed SWCNT, but increases with
applied field. Physical explanations for this behavior are proposed. Curved
Fowler-Nordheim plots are predicted. Overall, the predicted field emission
performance of the H-terminated open SWCNT is slightly better than that of the
closed SWCNT, essentially because a C-H dipole is formed that reduces the
height of the tunnelling barrier. In general, the physics of a charged SWCNT
seems more complex than hitherto realised.

a state partition which is a bisimulation on some Kripke structure is well
known. It is also well known in model checking that bisimulation is equivalent

Drawing on these observations, we analyze the basic steps of the PT algorithm
from an abstract interpretation perspective, which allows us to reason on
strong preservation in the context of generic inductively defined (temporal)

turns out that PT is a straight instance of GPT on the domain of state

how a well-known efficient algorithm for computing stuttering equivalence can

design a new efficient algorithm for computing simulation equivalence that is
competitive with the best available algorithms. Finally, we show how GPT allows

data. Biological databases typically consist of a mixture of raw data,
metadata, sequences, annotations, and related data obtained from various
sources. Current database technology lacks several functionalities that are
needed by biological databases. In this paper, we introduce bdbms, an
extensible prototype database management system for supporting biological data.
bdbms extends the functionalities of current DBMSs to include: (1) Annotation
and provenance management including storage, indexing, manipulation, and
querying of annotation and provenance as first class objects in bdbms, (2)
Local dependency tracking to track the dependencies and derivations among data
items, (3) Update authorization to support data curation via content-based
authorization, in contrast to identity-based authorization, and (4) New access
methods and their supporting operators that support pattern matching on various
types of compressed biological data types. This paper presents the design of
bdbms along with the techniques proposed to support these functionalities
including an extension to SQL. We also outline some open issues in building
bdbms.

it look anything like today's database systems?"" In this paper, we introduce
Impliance, a next-generation information management system consisting of
hardware and software components integrated to form an easy-to-administer
appliance that can store, retrieve, and analyze all types of structured,
semi-structured, and unstructured information. We first summarize the trends
that will shape information management for the foreseeable future. Those trends
imply three major requirements for Impliance: (1) to be able to store, manage,
and uniformly query all data, not just structured records; (2) to be able to
scale out as the volume of this data grows; and (3) to be simple and robust in
operation. We then describe four key ideas that are uniquely combined in
Impliance to address these requirements, namely the ideas of: (a) integrating
software and off-the-shelf hardware into a generic information appliance; (b)
automatically discovering, organizing, and managing all data - unstructured as
well as structured - in a uniform way; (c) achieving scale-out by exploiting
simple, massive parallel processing, and (d) virtualizing compute and storage
resources to unify, simplify, and streamline the management of Impliance.
Impliance is an ambitious, long-term effort to define simpler, more robust, and
more scalable information systems for tomorrow's enterprises.

  We find that, even with observers as far out as $R=80 M$--which is larger
than what is commonly used in state-of-the-art simulations--the assumption in
the standard method that the background is close to having Schwarzschild-like
coordinates increases the error in the extracted waveforms considerably. Even
for our coarsest resolutions, our new method decreases the error by between one
and two orders of magnitudes. Furthermore, we explicitly see that the errors in
the extracted waveforms obtained by the standard method do not converge to zero
with increasing resolution. [abridged]
  In a general scenario, for example a collision of compact objects, there is
no precise definition of gravitational radiation at a finite distance, and
gravitational wave extraction methods at such distances are thus inherently
approximate. The results of this paper bring up the possibility that different
choices in the wave extraction procedure at a fixed and finite distance may
result in relative differences in the waveforms which are actually larger than
the numerical errors in the solution.

graphs of the muon-neutrino survival probability $P(\nu_{\mu}\to \nu_{\mu})$

2\theta_{23}-\sin 2\theta_{13}$ plane for baseline lengths $L=1000, 5000, \

$P(\nu_{\mu}\to \nu_{\mu})$ is more sensitive to $\sin 2\theta_{13}$ at
energies around its local maximum while it is more sensitive to $\cos
2\theta_{23}$ at energies around its local minimum. On the other hand, the
appearance probability $P(\nu_e\to \nu_{\mu})$ is sensitive to
$\sin2\theta_{13}$ and $\cos2\theta_{23}$ only near its local maximum. We
observe that the $\theta_{23}$ degeneracy in $P(\nu_{\mu}\to \nu_{\mu})$ is
absent at energies around the local maximum of this probability, provided
$\theta_{13}$ is sufficiently large. The $\theta_{23}$ degeneracy is also
absent in general near the local maximum of $P(\nu_e\to \nu_{\mu})$. Using

  Wokshop, October 2006, Valencia",,,"IFIC 061220","hep-ph",,"  The goal for future neutrino facilities is the determination of the
$[U_{e3}]$ mixing and CP violation in neutrino oscillations. This will require
precision experiments with a very intense neutrino source. With this objective
the creation of neutrino beams from the radioactive decay of boosted ions by
the SPS of CERN from either beta or electron capture transitions has been
propossed. We discuss the capabilities of such facilities as a function of the
energy of the boost and the baseline for the detector. We conclude that the SPS
upgrade to 1000 GeV is crucial to have a better sensitivity to CP violation if
it is accompanied by a longer baseline. We compare the physics potential for
two different configurations. In the case of beta beams, with the same boost
for both $\beta^+$ (neutrinos) and $\beta^-$ (antineutrinos), the two setups
are: I) $\gamma=120$, L=130 Km (Frejus); II) $\gamma=330$, L=650 Km (Canfranc).
In the case of monochromatic EC beams we exploit the energy dependence of
neutrino oscillations to separate out the two parameters $U(e3)$ and the CP
phase $\delta$. Setup I runs at $\gamma=90$ and $\gamma=195$ (maximum
achievable at present SPS) to Frejus, whereas Setup II runs at $\gamma=195$ and
$\gamma=440$ (maximum achievable at upgraded SPS) to Canfranc. The main
conclusion is that, whereas the gain in the determination of $U(e3)$ is rather
modest, setup II provides much better sensitivity to CP violation.

Using the notion of traffic intensity, we propose a variant taking into account
congestion. This leads to an optimization problem posed on a set of probability
measures on a suitable paths space. We establish existence of minimizers and
give a characterization. As an application, we obtain existence and variational
characterization of equilibria of Wardrop type in a continuous space setting.

Condensation is a finite size effect which occurs after the standard inverse

vortex dipole. We show that the time growth of the dipole is self-similar, and
it contains most of the injected energy, thus resulting in an energy spectrum

component is subtracted, however, the remaining fluctuations have a spectrum

the coupling are explored numerically and analytically. The neurons are coupled
in a line, with the middle neuron sending a somewhat stronger projection to the
outer neurons than the feedback it receives, to model for instance the relay of
a signal from primary to higher cortical areas. For a given coupling
architecture, the delays introduce correlations in the time series at the
time-scale of the delay. It was found that the middle neuron leads the outer
ones by the delay time, while the outer neurons are synchronized with zero lag
times. Synchronization is found to be highly dependent on the synaptic time
constant, with faster synapses increasing both the degree of synchronization
and the firing rate. Analysis shows that presynaptic input during the
interspike interval stabilizes the synchronous state, even for arbitrarily weak
coupling, and independent of the initial phase. The finding may be of
significance to synchronization of large groups of cells in the cortex that are
spatially distanced from each other.

charged particles at gradients that are orders of magnitude greater than in
current accelerators has been well documented. We develop a phenomenological
framework for Laser WakeField Acceleration (LWFA) in the 3D nonlinear regime,
in which the plasma electrons are expelled by the radiation pressure of a short
pulse laser, leading to nearly complete blowout. Our theory provides a recipe
for designing a LWFA for given laser and plasma parameters and estimates the
number and the energy of the accelerated electrons whether self-injected or
externally injected. These formulas apply for self-guided as well as externally
guided pulses (e.g. by plasma channels). We demonstrate our results by
presenting a sample Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulation of a 30f sec, 200T W
laser interacting with a 0.75cm long plasma with density 1.5*10^18 cm^-3 to
produce an ultra-short (10f s) mono-energetic bunch of self-injected electrons
at 1.5 GeV with 0.3nC of charge. For future higher-energy accelerator
applications we propose a parameter space, that is distinct from that described
by Gordienko and Pukhov [Physics of Plasmas 12, 043109 (2005)] in that it
involves lower densities and wider spot sizes while keeping the intensity
relatively constant. We find that this helps increase the output electron beam
energy while keeping the efficiency high.

both for incident plus reflected fields and for refracted fields. External
refraction is found to result in compression of the fluctuations of the random

molecular simulations at larger length and time scales (De Fabritiis {\it et.
al}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 134501 (2006)). However, accurate computational
models of the hydrodynamics of nanoscale molecular assemblies are lacking, at
least in part because of the stochastic character of the underlying fluctuating
hydrodynamic equations. Here we derive a finite volume discretization of the
compressible isothermal fluctuating hydrodynamic equations over a regular grid
in the Eulerian reference system. We apply it to fluids such as argon at
arbitrary densities and water under ambient conditions. To that end, molecular
dynamics simulations are used to derive the required fluid properties. The
equilibrium state of the model is shown to be thermodynamically consistent and
correctly reproduces linear hydrodynamics including relaxation of sound and
shear modes. We also consider non-equilibrium states involving diffusion and
convection in cavities with no-slip boundary conditions.

A 463, 1271 (2007)","10.1098/rspa.2007.1822",,"quant-ph",,"  The geometric phase can act as a signature for critical regions of
interacting spin chains in the limit where the corresponding circuit in
parameter space is shrunk to a point and the number of spins is extended to
infinity; for finite circuit radii or finite spin chain lengths, the geometric
phase is always trivial (a multiple of 2pi). In this work, by contrast, two
related signatures of criticality are proposed which obey finite-size scaling
and which circumvent the need for assuming any unphysical limits. They are
based on the notion of the Bargmann invariant whose phase may be regarded as a
discretized version of Berry's phase. As circuits are considered which are
composed of a discrete, finite set of vertices in parameter space, they are
able to pass directly through a critical point, rather than having to
circumnavigate it. The proposed mechanism is shown to provide a diagnostic tool
for criticality in the case of a given non-solvable one-dimensional spin chain
with nearest-neighbour interactions in the presence of an external magnetic
field.

arbitrarily large number of photons all within the current experimental state
of the art technology. We also offer an alternative scheme that uses an
atom-cavity dispersive interaction to obtain sufficiently high
Kerr-nonlinearity necessary for arbitrary NOON generation.

ps-pulsed spontaneous non-degenerate parametric downconversion. We have
separately detected the signal and idler distributions of photons collected in
twin coherence areas and found that the variance of the photon-count difference
goes below the shot-noise limit by 3.25 dB. The number of temporal modes
contained in the twin-beam, as well as the size of the twin coherence areas,
depends on the pump intensity. Our scheme is based on spontaneous
downconversion and thus does not suffer from limitations due to the finite gain
of the parametric process. Twin-beams are also used to demonstrate the
conditional preparation of a nonclassical (sub-Poissonian) state.
