detected a giant flare in SGR 1806-20 on December 27, 2004. The flare is
similar in appearance to the two known flares in SGR 0526-66 and SGR 1900+14
while exceeding them significantly in intensity. The enormous X-ray and
gamma-ray flux in the narrow initial pulse of the flare leads to almost
instantaneous deep saturation of the gamma-ray detectors, ruling out the
possibility of directly measuring the intensity, time profile, and energy
spectrum of the initial pulse. In this situation, the detection of an
attenuated signal of Compton back-scattering of the initial pulse emission by
the Moon with the Helicon gamma-ray spectrometer onboard the Coronas-F
satellite was an extremely favorable circumstance. Analysis of this signal has
yielded the most reliable temporal, energy, and spectral characteristics of the
pulse. The temporal and spectral characteristics of the pulsating flare tail
have been determined from Konus-Wind data. Its soft spectra have been found to
contain also a hard power-law component extending to 10 MeV. A weak afterglow
of SGR 1806-20 decaying over several hours is traceable up to 1 MeV. We also
consider the overall picture of activity of SGR 1806-20 in the emission of
recurrent bursts before and after the giant flare.

useful to learn about the astrophysics of the sources as well as the

explained by a large population of hidden sources for which matter-induced

shape of galaxy-sized cold dark matter (CDM) halos. Unlike most previous work
on the subject - which dealt with shapes as measured by the inertia tensor - we
focus here on the shape of the gravitational potential, a quantity more
directly relevant to comparison with observational probes. A further advantage
is that the potential is less sensitive to the effects of substructure and, as
a consequence, the isopotential surfaces are typically smooth and well
approximated by concentric ellipsoids. Our main result is that the asphericity
of the potential increases rapidly towards the center of the halo. The radial
trend is more pronounced than expected from constant flattening in the mass
distribution, and reflects a strong tendency for dark matter halos to become
increasingly aspherical inwards. Near the center the halo potential is
approximately prolate ((c/a)_0=0.72 +/- 0.04, (b/a)_0=0.78 +/- 0.08), but it
becomes increasingly spherical in the outer regions. The principal axes of the
isopotential surfaces remain well aligned, and in most halos the angular
momentum tends to be parallel to the minor axis and perpendicular to the major
axis. This suggests that galactic disks may form in a plane where the potential
is elliptical and where its ellipticity varies rapidly with radius. This can
result in significant deviations from circular motion in systems such as low
surface brightness galaxies (LSBs), even for relatively minor deviations from
circular symmetry. Simulated long-slit rotation curves can appear similar to
those of LSBs often cited as evidence for constant density ""cores"". This
suggests that taking into account the 3D shape of the dark mass distribution
might help to reconcile such evidence with the cuspy mass profile of CDM halos.

the orbital eccentricities and inclinations were damped to their current values

which shows that the change in the spin direction of a planet relative to an

the change in the obliquity (which is measured from the orbit normal) is due to
the change in the orbital inclination. Since the inclinations are damped by
planetesimal interactions on timescales much shorter than the timescales on
which the spins precess due to the torques from the Sun, especially for Uranus
and Neptune, the obliquities should return to small values if they are small

Our findings indicate that bright galaxies in the past traced higher density

masses, is the closest known MBH, at a distance of only 8 kpc. The proximity of
this MBH makes it possible to observe gravitational waves from stars with
periapse in the observational frequency window of the Laser Interferometer
Space Antenna (LISA). This is possible even if the orbit of the star is very
eccentric, so that the orbital frequency is many orders of magnitude below the
LISA frequency window, as suggested by Rubbo et al. (2006). Here we give an
analytical estimate of the detection rate of such gravitational wave bursts.
The burst rate is critically sensitive to the inner cut-off of the stellar
density profile. Our model accounts for mass-segregation and for the physics
determining the inner radius of the cusp, such as stellar collisions, energy
dissipation by gravitational wave emission, and consequences of the finite
number of stars. We find that stellar black holes have a burst rate of the
order of 1 per year, while the rate is of order 0.1 per year for main sequence
stars and white dwarfs. These analytical estimates are supported by a series of
Monte Carlo samplings of the expected distribution of stars around the Galactic
MBH, which yield the full probability distribution for the rates. We estimate
that no burst will be observable from the Virgo cluster.

We use data from the XMM-Newton Extended Survey of the Taurus Molecular Cloud

perform correlation and regression analysis between X-ray parameters and
stellar properties. We confirm the existence of a X-ray luminosity (Lx) vs.
mass (M) relation, Lx ~ M^(1.69 +/- 0.11), but this relation is a consequence
of X-ray saturation and a mass vs. bolometric luminosity (L*) relation for the
TTS with an average age of 2.4 Myr. X-ray saturation indicates Lx = const L*,
although the constant is different for the two subsamples: const = 10^(-3.73
+/- 0.05) for CTTS and const = 10^(-3.39 +/- 0.06) for WTTS. Given a similar L*
distribution of both samples, the X-ray luminosity function also reflects a
real X-ray deficiency in CTTS, by a factor of ~ 2 compared to WTTS. The average
electron temperatures Tav are correlated with Lx in WTTS but not in CTTS; CTTS
sources are on average hotter than WTTS sources. The most fundamental
properties are the two saturation laws, indicating suppressed Lx for CTTS. We
speculate that some of the accreting material in CTTS is cooling active regions
to temperatures that may not significantly emit in the X-ray band, and if they
do, high-resolution spectroscopy may be required to identify lines formed in
such plasma, while CCD cameras do not detect these components. The similarity
of the Lx vs. Tav dependencies in WTTS and main-sequence stars as well as their
similar X-ray saturation laws suggests similar physical processes for the hot
plasma, i.e., heating and radiation of a magnetic corona.

Catalogue with the ROSAT PSPC All-Sky Survey five galaxies have been detected a
factor of up to 88 brighter in XMM-Newton with respect to ROSAT PSPC upper
limits and presenting a soft X-ray colour. X-ray luminosities of these sources
derived from slew observations have been found in the range 10^41-10^44 erg
s^-1, fully consistent with the tidal disruption model. This model predicts
that during the peak of the outburst, flares reach X-ray luminosities up to
10^45 erg s^-1, which is close to the Eddington luminosity of the black hole,
and afterwards a decay of the flux on a time scale of months to years is

two-dimensional scalar model with competing interactions for ultrathin magnetic
films. We find a phase transition from a high temperature disordered phase to a
low temperature phase with both positional and orientational orders. Both kinds
of order emerge at the same temperature, probably due to the isotropy of the
model Hamiltonian. In the low temperature phase orientational correlations show
long range order while positional correlations show only quasi-long-range order
in a wide temperature range. The orientational correlation length and the
associated susceptibility seem to diverge with power laws at the transition.
While at zero temperature the system exhibits stripe long range order, as
temperature grows we observe the proliferation of different kinds of
topological defects that ultimately drive the system to the disordered phase.
The magnetic structures observed are similar to experimental results on
ultrathin ferromagnetic films.

to a common oscillator in the case where the oscillator energy is small
relative to the two-level transition energies. Since the two sets of two-level
systems are coupled indirectly through the oscillator, excitation transfer from
one set of two-level systems to the other is possible. In addition, the
excitation energy from the two-level systems may be exchanged with the
oscillator coherently, even though the oscillator energy may be orders of
magnitude smaller than the two-level system transition energy. In the lossless
case, we demonstrate these effects numerically, and also use an approximate
diagonalization to show that these effects are expected from the model
Hamiltonian.
  We augment the model to include loss effects, and show that loss enhances the
excitation transfer effect by breaking the severe cancelation between different
paths that occurs in the lossless case. We describe a simple approximate model
wavefunction appropriate when the loss increases rapidly with energy. Within
this model approximation, we present numerical and analytical results for
excitation transfer and energy transfer rates, showing that they are greatly
increased.

production in electrochemical experiments in heavy water. We examine the
question of whether the rates associated with this kind of model are
sufficiently large to be relevant to the experimental claims. We find that
consistency is possible given recent experimental results showing strong
screening effects in low energy deuteron-deuteron fusion experiments in metals.

proved to work very well in practice. Current BDD-based techniques can only
handle interactive configuration with small finite domains. In this paper we
extend the approach to handle string variables constrained by regular
expressions. The user is allowed to change the strings by adding letters at the
end of the string. We show how to make a data structure that can perform fast
valid domain computations given some assignment on the set of string variables.
  We first show how to do this by using one large DFA. Since this approach is
too space consuming to be of practical use, we construct a data structure that
simulates the large DFA and in most practical cases are much more space
efficient. As an example a configuration problem on $n$ string variables with
only one solution in which each string variable is assigned to a value of
length of $k$ the former structure will use $\Omega(k^n)$ space whereas the
latter only need $O(kn)$. We also show how this framework easily can be
combined with the recent BDD techniques to allow both boolean, integer and

and the Lagrangian for a spacetime comprised of an interior and an exterior
regions, with a thin shell as a boundary in between, one finds the Hamiltonian
using an ADM description. For spherically symmetric spacetimes, one reduces the
relevant constraints. The dynamic and constraint equations are obtained. The
vacuum solutions yield a division of the theory into two branches, d-2k-1>0
(which includes general relativity, Born-Infeld type theories) and d-2k-1=0
(which includes Chern-Simons type theories), where k gives the highest power of
the curvature in the Lagrangian. An additional parameter, chi, gives the
character of the vacuum solutions. For chi=1 the solutions have a black hole
character. For chi=-1 the solutions have a totally naked singularity character.
The integration through the thin shell takes care of the smooth junction. The
subsequent analysis is divided into two cases: static charged thin shell
configurations, and gravitationally collapsing charged dust shells. Physical
implications are drawn: if such a large extra dimension scenario is correct,
one can extract enough information from the outcome of those collapses as to
know, not only the actual dimension of spacetime, but also which particular
Lovelock gravity, is the correct one.

systems in General Relativity. By utilizing adapted conformal coordinates, the
vacuum region exterior to the gravitational sources is divided up into two
subdomains within which the spectral expansion of the field quantities is
carried out. If a component of the binary is a neutron star, a further
subdomain covering the star's interior is added. As such, the method can be
used to construct arbitrary initial data corresponding to binary black holes,
binary neutron stars or mixed binaries. In particular, it is possible to
describe a black hole component by the puncture ansatz as well as through an
excision technique. First examples are given for binary black hole excision
data that fulfill the requirements of the quasi-stationary framework, which
combines the Conformal Thin Sandwich formulation of the constraint equations
with the Isolated Horizon conditions for black holes in quasi-equilibrium.
These numerical solutions were obtained to extremely high accuracy with
moderate computational effort. Moreover, the method proves to be applicable
even when tending toward limiting cases such as large mass ratios of the binary
components.

baseline over a broad range of lengths (between 6000 km and 9000 km), centered
on the ``magic baseline'' ($\sim$ 7500 km) where correlations with the leptonic
CP phase are suppressed by matter effects. Since the magic baseline depends
only on the density, we study the impact of matter density profile effects and
density uncertainties over this range, and the impact of detector locations off
the optimal baseline. We find that the optimal constant density describing the
physics over this entire baseline range is about 5% higher than the average
matter density. This implies that the magic baseline is significantly shorter
than previously inferred. However, while a single detector optimization
requires fine-tuning of the (very long) baseline length, its combination with a
near detector at a shorter baseline is much less sensitive to the far detector
location and to uncertainties in the matter density. In addition, we point out
different applications of this baseline which go beyond its excellent
correlation and degeneracy resolution potential. We demonstrate that such a
long baseline assists in the improvement of the $\theta_{13}$ precision and in
the resolution of the octant degeneracy. Moreover, we show that the neutrino
data from such a baseline could be used to extract the matter density along the
profile up to 0.24% at $1 \sigma$ for large $\sin^2 2 \theta_{13}$, providing a
useful discriminator between different geophysical models.

Since a chronology is provided by any Lorentzian metric in relativistic

choice of a preferred metric to which one may refer to is not satisfying. It
would indeed be in great conflict with the spirit of general covariance.
Moreover, a theory which appear to be non causal with respect to (hereafter,
w.r.t) this metric, may well be causal w.r.t another metric. In a theory
involving fields that propagate at different speeds (e.g. due to some
spontaneous breaking of Lorentz invariance), spacetime is endowed with such a
finite set of non-conformally related metrics. In that case one must look for a
new notion of causality, such that 1. no particular metric is favored and 2.

causality is unique and defined w.r.t the metric drawing the wider cone in the
tangent space of a given point of the manifold. Moreover, which metric defines
the wider cone may depend on the location on spacetime. In that sense,
superluminal fields are generically causal, provided that some other basic

defect for Hecke algebras of spaces of modular forms of prime weight p at
maximal ideals of residue characteristic p such that the attached mod p Galois
representation is unramified at p and the Frobenius at p acts by scalars. The
results lead us to the ask the question whether the Gorenstein defect and the
multplicity of the attached Galois representation are always equal to 2. We
review the literature on the failure of the Gorenstein property and
multiplicity one, discuss in some detail a very important practical improvement
of the modular symbols algorithm over finite fields and include precise
statements on the relationship between the Gorenstein defect and the
multiplicity of Galois representations.

families of L-function with unitary symmetry. We here extend the formalism to
families with orthogonal & symplectic symmetry. Specifically, we establish
formulae for real quadratic Dirichlet L-functions and for the L-functions
associated with primitive Hecke eigenforms of weight 2 in terms of partial
Euler and Hadamard products. We then prove asymptotic formulae for some moments
of these partial products and make general conjectures based on results for the
moments of characteristic polynomials of random matrices.

core material that contains embedded magnetic nanoparticles and therapeutic
agents such as photodynamic sensitizers. For in vivo therapy, the particles are
injected into the vascular system upstream from malignant tissue, and captured
at the tumor using an applied magnetic field. The applied field couples to the
magnetic nanoparticles inside the carrier particle and produces a force that
attracts the particle to the tumor. In noninvasive therapy the applied field is
produced by a permanent magnet positioned outside the body. In this paper a
mathematical model is developed for predicting noninvasive magnetic targeting
of therapeutic carrier particles in the microvasculature. The model takes into
account the dominant magnetic and fluidic forces on the particles and leads to
an analytical expression for predicting their trajectory. An analytical
expression is also derived for predicting the volume fraction of embedded
magnetic nanoparticles required to ensure capture of the carrier particle at
the tumor. The model enables rapid parametric analysis of magnetic targeting as
a function of key variables including the size of the carrier particle, the

this question has been settled modulo some details in \cite{Kacewicz05}. A
speed-up over deterministic computing shown in \cite{Kacewicz05} is related to
the increased regularity of the solution with respect to that of the right-hand
side function. For a scalar equation of order k (which can be transformed into
a special system of the first order), the regularity of the solution is
increased by k orders of magnitude. This leads to improved complexity bounds
depending on k for linear information in the deterministic setting, see
\cite{Szczesny05}. This may suggest that in the randomized and quantum settings
a speed-up can also be achieved depending on k.
  We show in this paper that a speed-up dependent on k is not possible in the
randomized and quantum settings. We establish lower complexity bounds, showing
that the randomized and quantum complexities remain at the some level as for
systems of the first order, no matter how large k is. Thus, the algorithms from

the same way as are the two imaginary units of a complex field, and there is a
priori no basis on which to prefer one over the other in any individual case.
This is potentially problematic in that the choice of conjugacy class of a
representation determines the sign of energy and other quantities defined as
generators of continuous symmetries of the system in question, so that it would
appear that principles like conservation of energy for a compound system may
hold or fail depending on relative choices of conjugacy class of
representations of its subsystems. We show that for any finite set of quantum
systems there are exactly two ways of choosing conjugacy classes of
representations consistent with the usual tensor-product construction for
representing the compound system composed of these. Each is obtained from the
other by reversing the conjugacy of all the representations at once. The
relation of unitary equivalence for representations of a single system is
therefore uniquely extendible to representations of all systems that can

"quant-ph/0612099","Akira Kitagawa","Akira kitagawa, Masahiro Takeoka, Masahide Sasaki, and Anthony Chefles","Entanglement quantification with Fisher information","4 pages, 4 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We show that the Fisher information associated with entanglement-assisted
coding has a monotonic relationship with the logarithmic negativity, an
important entanglement measure, for certain classes of continuous variable (CV)
quantum states of practical significance. These are the two-mode squeezed
states and the non-Gaussian states obtained from them by photon subtraction.
This monotonic correspondence can be expressed analytically in the case of pure
states. Numerical analysis shows that this relationship holds to a very good
approximation even in the mixed state case of the photon-subtracted squeezed
states. The Fisher information is evaluated by the CV Bell measurement in the
limit of weak signal modulation. Our results suggest that the logarithmic
negativity of certain sets of non-Gaussian mixed states can be experimentally
accessed without homodyne tomography, leading to significant simplification of
the experimental procedure.

et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 110503 (2005)], where it was shown that all states
generated in a sequential manner can be classified efficiently in terms of
matrix-product states. In particular, we consider two scenarios: photonic
multi-qubit states sequentially generated at the cavity output of a
single-photon source and atomic multi-qubit states generated by their
sequential interaction with the same cavity mode.

superluminal behavior of evanescent electromagnetic waves, there are many
disputes about the physical meaning and validity of such superluminal
phenomenon, which is due to the fact that the traditional investigations are
based on the theory of tunneling time, and concerned with the problem of what
the group velocity of evanescent waves means. In this paper, by studying the
quantum probability amplitude for photons to propagate over a spacelike
interval along an undersized waveguide, we present theoretical evidence for
such superluminality.

informationally complete POVMs in the qubit case. A particular (incomplete)
Kochen-Specker colouring, suggested by Appleby in dimension three, is
generalized to arbitrary dimension. We investigate its effectivity as a
function of dimension, using two different measures of this. In particular, we
will derive a limit for the fraction of the sphere that can be satisfactorily
coloured using the generalized Appleby construction as the number of dimensions
approaches infinity. The second, and physically more relevant measure of
effectivity, is to look at the fraction of possible ON-bases properly coloured.
Using this measure, we will derive a 'lower bound for the upper bound' in three
and four real dimensions.
