consideration is not limited by small anisotropies and by the condition that
particle velocities are higher than characteristic flow velocity differences.
For high velocities and small anisotropies the standard cosmic ray transport
equation is recovered. We apply the equations derived for investigation of
injection and acceleration of particles by collisionless shocks.

of antiferromagnetic exchange interactions, besides the ferromagnetic

Ce2Fe17 are anomalous. Instead of ferromagnetic, it is antiferromagnetic, and
instead of one ordering temperature, it shows two, at the Neel temperature TN ~
208 K and at TT ~ 124 K. Ce2Fe17, doped by 0.5% Ta, also shows two ordering
temperatures, one to an antiferromagnetic phase, at TN ~ 214 K, and one to a
ferromagnetic phase, at T0 ~ 75 K. In order to clarify this behavior,
single-crystalline samples were prepared by solution growth, and characterized
by electron microscopy, single crystal x-ray diffraction, temperature-dependent

resistivity and magnetization. From these measurements, magnetic H-T phase
diagrams were determined for both Ta-doped Ce2Fe17 and undoped Ce2Fe17. These

magnetic phase diagrams of systems with competing antiferro- and

ferromagnetic semiconductors are investigated by using the Kondo lattice model,
which describes an interband exchange coupling between itinerant conduction
electrons and localized magnetic moments. In our calculations, the electronic
problem and the local magnetic problem are solved separately. For the
electronic part an interpolating self-energy approach together with a coherent
potential approximation (CPA) treatment of a dynamical alloy analogy is used to
calculate temperature-dependent quasiparticle densities of states and the
electronic self-energy of the diluted local-moment system. For constructing the
magnetic phase diagram we use a modified RKKY theory by mapping the interband
exchange to an effective Heisenberg model. The exchange integrals appear as
functionals of the diluted electronic self-energy being therefore temperature-
and carrier-concentration-dependent and covering RKKY as well as double
exchange behavior. The disorder of the localized moments in the effective
Heisenberg model is solved by a generalized locator CPA approach. The main
results are: 1) extremely low carrier concentrations are sufficient to induce
ferromagnetism; 2) the Curie temperature exhibits a strikingly non-monotonic
behavior as a function of carrier concentration with a distinct maximum; 3)
$T_C$ curves break down at critical $n/x$ due to antiferromagnetic correlations
and 4) the dilution always lowers $T_C$ but broadens the ferromagnetic region
with respect to carrier concentration.

Here we describe some necessary and sufficient conditions on the $\rho_j$'s for
this to be true. Our primary examples are $X=\mathbb{R}^d$, $X=\matbb{Z}^d$,
and $X$ an arbitrary finite set. In particular, we extend a result by
Ambartzumian and Sukiasian showing realizability at sufficiently small
densities $\rho_1(\mathbf{r})$. Typically if any realizing process exists there
will be many (even an uncountable number); in this case we prove, when $X$ is a
finite set, the existence of a realizing Gibbs measure with $k$ body potentials
which maximizes the entropy among all realizing measures. We also investigate
in detail a simple example in which a uniform density $\rho$ and translation
invariant $\rho_2$ are specified on $\mathbb{Z}$; there is a gap between our
best upper bound on possible values of $\rho$ and the largest $\rho$ for which
realizability can be established.

accelerated relativistic point-charge are explicitly calculated. The current
density includes, apart from the well-established three-dimensional
delta-function which is sufficient for its global conservation, additional
delta-contributions depending on the second and third proper-time derivatives
of the position, which are necessary for its local conservation as required by
the internal consistency of classical electrodynamics which implies that local
charge-conservation is an {identity}. Similarly, the field strength includes an
additional delta-contribution which is necessary for obtaining this result. The
Lienard-Wiechert field and charge-current density must therefore be interpreted
as nonlinear generalized functions, i.e., not just as distributions, even
though only linear operations are necessary to verify charge-current
conservation. The four-potential from which this field and the conserved
charge-current density derive is found to be unique in the sense that it is the
only one reducing to an invariant scalar function in the instantaneous rest
frame of the point-charge that leads to a point-like locally-conserved

excitation of cold atoms from a magneto-optical trap. Using two-photon
microwave spectroscopy of the 49s_{1/2}-50s_{1/2} transition, the field
strength of a 28.5 GHz dressing field was calibrated. When this dressing field
was set at specific field strengths, the two-atom dipole-dipole process
43d_{5/2} + 43d_{5/2} -> 45p_{3/2} + 41f was dramatically enhanced, due to
induced degeneracy of the initial and final states. A series of observed
resonant field strengths correspond to different magnetic sublevel
possibilities for the initial and final states. These agree well with
calculated resonance fields based on a perturbative ac Stark shift formula.
This method for enhancing interactions is complementary to dc
electric-field-induced resonant energy transfer, but has more flexibility due
to the possibility of varying the applied frequency.

successfully realized, other disciplines (e.g. humanities and social sciences)
dwell on the traditional path, even though many scientists belonging to these
communities approve the open access principle. In this paper we try to explain
these different publication patterns by using a game theoretical approach.
Based on the assumption, that the main goal of scientists is the maximization
of their reputation, we model different possible game settings, namely a zero
sum game, the prisoners' dilemma case and a version of the stag hunt game, that
show the dilemma of scientists belonging to ''non-open access communities''.
  From an individual perspective, they have no incentive to deviate from the
Nash Equilibrium of traditional publishing. By extending the model using the
quantum game theory approach it can be shown, that if the strength of
entanglement exceeds a certain value, the scientists will overcome the dilemma
and terminate to publish only traditionally in all three settings.

Reich listed and described all models in the simplest case of 0/1 penetrance
values. However, they left open the problem of finding a classification of
two-locus models with continuous penetrance values. We provide a complete
classification of biallelic two-locus models. In addition to solving the
classification problem for dichotomous trait disease models, our results apply
to any instance where real numbers are assigned to genotypes, and provide a
complete framework for studying epistasis in QTL data. Our approach is
geometric and we show that there are 387 distinct types of two-locus models,
which can be reduced to 69 when symmetry between loci and alleles is accounted
for. The model types are defined by 86 circuits, which are linear combinations
of genotype values, each of which measures a fundamental unit of interaction.
The circuits provide information on epistasis beyond that contained in the
additive x add, add x dom, and dom x dom interaction terms. We discuss the
connection between our classification and standard epistatic models and
demonstrate its utility by analyzing a previously published dataset.

attain the equilibrium if the coupling constant is small enough. We show that
in the case of the large coupling constant the distribution function
$\rho_{S}(q,p,t)\to 0$ pointwise as $t\to\infty$. This implies that if there is
convergence to equilibrium, then the limit measure has no finite momenta.

space tends to zero. This is also true for domains in the coordinate space and
