solar mass star are presented. This simulation did not launch an explosion
until over 600ms after collapse, allowing an ideal opportunity to study the
evolution and structure of the convection below the accretion shock to late
times. This late-time convection allows us to study several of the recent
claims in the literature about the role of convection: is it dominated by an
l=1 mode driven by vortical-acoustic (or other) instability, does it produce
strong neutron star kicks, and, finally, is it the key to a new explosion
mechanism? The convective region buffets the neutron star, imparting a 150-200
km/s kick. Because the l=1 mode does not dominate the convection, the neutron
star does not achieve large (>450 km/s) velocities. Finally, the neutron star
in this simulation moves, but does not develop strong oscillations, the energy
source for a recently proposed supernova engine. We discuss the implications
these results have on supernovae, hypernovae (and gamma-ray bursts), and
stellar-massed black holes.

(with spatial curvature k=0) cannot be observationally distinguished from a
kinematics of galaxies moving in a flat and non-expanding space is erroneous.
We suggest that the error may have its source in a non relativistic intuition
that imagines the Universe not as a spacetime but separates space from time and
pictures the cosmological expansion as space evolving in time. The physical
reality, however, is fundamentally different -- the expanding Universe is
necessarily a curved spacetime. We show here that the fact that the spacetime
is curved implies that the interpretation of the observed cosmological redshift
as being due to the expansion of the cosmological 3D--space is observationally
verifiable. Thus it is impossible to mimic the true cosmological redshift by a
Doppler effect caused by motion of galaxies in a non-expanding 3D-space, flat
or curved. We summarize our points in simple spacetime diagrams that illustrate
a gedanken experiment distinguishing between expansion of space and pure
kinematics. We also provide all relevant mathematics. None of the previously
published discussions of the issue, including a recent popular Scientific
American article, offered a similarly clear way out of the confusion.

known to be variable in radio, millimeter, near-IR and X-rays. Recent
multi-wavelength observing campaigns show a simultaneous X-ray and near-IR
flare, as well as sub-millimeter and near-IR flares from Sgr A*. The flare
activity is thought to be arising from the innermost region of Sgr A*. We have
recently argued that the duration of flares in near-IR and submillimeter
wavelengths implies that the burst of emission expands and cools on a dynamical
time scale before the flares leave Sgr A*. The detection of radio flares with a
time delay in the range of 20 and 40 minutes between 7 and 12mm peak emission
implies adiabatic expansion of a uniform, spherical hot blob due to flare
activity. We suspect that this simple outflow picture shows some of the
characteristics that are known to take place in microquasars, thus we may learn
much from comparative study of Sgr A* and its environment vs. microquasars.

find positive gradients within the bar region in the metal indices in four of

For all the galaxies we find a positive gradient in the Balmer indices. There

the star to be enriched in C ([C/Fe]_1D ~ +1.4) and O ([O/Fe]_1D ~ +1.8). With
the exception of these species, HE 1300+0157 exhibits an elemental abundance
pattern similar to that found in many other very and extremely metal-poor
stars. The Li abundance is lower than the Spite-plateau value, in agreement
with expectation for its evolutionary status. Of particular interest, no
neutron-capture elements are detected in HE 1300+0157. This type of abundance
pattern has been found by recent studies in several other metal-poor giants. We
suggest that HE 1300+0157 is an unevolved example of this group of stars, which
exhibit high C abundances together with low (or absent) abundances of
neutron-capture elements. Several potential enrichment scenarios are presented.
The low neutron-capture elements, including Sr, Ba, and Pb, suggests that the
carbon excess observed in HE 1300+0157 is not due to mass transfer across a
binary system. Such a scenario is applied to carbon-rich objects with excesses
of s-process elements. The normal observed Li abundance supports this
interpretation. Most likely, the high levels of C and O were produced prior to
the birth of this star. It remains unclear whether a single hypernova is
responsible for its overall chemical pattern, or whether one requires a
superposition of yields from a massive Population III object and a normal Type
II SN. These scenarios provide important information on the C production in the
early Universe, and on the formation of C-rich stars in the early Galaxy.

down to the 10^4K atomic cooling limit, and it is sufficiently flexible to make
a number of robust conclusions, despite the extremely uncertain properties of
the first stars. Galactic metal-free stars are formed over a large redshift
range, which peaks at z~10, but continues down to z~5, contributing stars at
wide range of Galactocentric radii. Stars containing only metals generated by
primordial stars are similarly widespread. Neither changing the efficiency of
metal dispersal by two orders of magnitude, nor drastically changing the
approximations in our semi-analytical model can affect these result. Thus, if
they have sufficiently long lifetimes, a significant number of stars formed in
initially primordial star clusters should be found in the nearby Galactic halo
regardless of the specifics of metal-free star formation. Observations of metal
abundances in Galactic halo stars should be taken as directly constraining the
properties of primordial stars, and the lack of metal-free halo stars today

identification of multiply imaged systems. The resultant mass model enables us
to reliably predict the redshifts of additional multiply imaged systems for

to four phases of power-law decay. In chronological order they are: the burst
tail, the ""hump"", the standard decay, and the post jet-break decay.
  The large-angle emission produced during the burst, but arriving at observer
later, is consistent with the GRB tail decay for less than half of bursts. The
forward-shock synchrotron emission from a very narrow jet (half-angle less than
1 deg) is consistent with the decay of 75 percent of GRB tails. The
forward-shock inverse-Compton emission from a narrow jet that does not expand
sideways also accommodates the decay of 80 percent of GRB tails.
  The X-ray light-curve hump can be attributed to an increasing kinetic energy
per solid angle of the forward-shock region visible to the observer. This
increase could be due to the emergence of the emission from an outflow seen
from a location outside its opening. However, the correlations among the hump
timing, flux, and decay index expected in this model are not confirmed by
observations. Thus, the increase in the forward-shock kinetic energy is more
likely caused by some incoming ejecta arriving at the shock during the
afterglow phase.
  The jet interpretation for the burst tails and the energy injection scenario
for the hump lead to a double-jet outflow structure consisting of a narrow GRB
jet which precedes a wider afterglow outflow of lower kinetic energy per solid
angle but higher total energy. (X-ray light-curves are shown for GRB 050416A,

spectra of ten Class I and flat spectrum stars forming within the Taurus dark
cloud complex. Nine sources have H$_2$ {\it v}=0-1 S(1) emission, and some show
multiple H$_2$ emission features in their K-band spectra. Photospheric
absorptions characteristic to low mass stars are detected in five of the
targets, and these stars were fit with models to determine spectral type,
infrared accretion excess veiling (r$_K$ and r$_{L'}$) and dust temperatures,
estimates of visual extinction and characteristics of the 3$\mu$m water-ice
absorption. On average, the models found high extinction values, infrared
accretion excess emission with blackbody temperatures in the 900-1050K range,
and 3$\mu$m absorption profiles best fit by water frozen onto cold grains
rather than thermally processed ice. Five techniques were used to estimate the
extinction toward the stellar photospheres; most gave vastly different results.
Analysis of emission line ratios suggests that the effect of infrared scattered
light toward some protostars should not be neglected. For stars that exhibited
Br$\gamma$ in emission, accretion luminosities were estimated using relations
between L$_{acc}$ and Br$\gamma$ luminosity. The young stars in this sample
were preferentially chosen as variables, but they do not have the accretion
dominated luminosities necessary to put them in their main stage of
mass-building. The characteristics of the 2-4$\mu$m spectra are placed in the
context of existing multi-wavelength data, and five of the stars are more
consistent with reddened Class IIs or stars in transition between Class I and
II, rather than protostars embedded within massive remnant envelopes.

travelling in an external magnetic field, like photon-LPB oscillations,

can be discovered by high-precision observations of certain binary neutron-star

oscillations can give rise to a characteristic attenuation pattern of the light
beam emitted by one of the pulsars when it goes through the magnetosphere of
the companion. Depending on the actual values of the LPB mass and its
two-photon coupling constant, the effect can be seen in the $\gamma$-ray band

beams in this background, assuming that the locations of the source and the
observer are random. We derive the optical equations for the evolution of the
beam area and shear. Through their integration we determine the configurations
that can lead to an increase of the luminosity distance relative to the
homogeneous cosmology. We find that this can be achieved if the Universe is
composed of spherical void-like regions, with matter concentrated near their
surface. For inhomogeneities consistent with the observed large scale
structure, the relative increase of the luminosity distance is of the order of
a few percent at redshifts near 1, and falls short of explaining the
substantial increase required by the supernova data. On the other hand, the
effect we describe is important for the correct determination of the energy
content of the Universe from observations.

controversial issue and some theoretical progress is required in order to
determine whether or not this scenario provides a plausible explanation for the
origin of angular momentum transport in non-magnetized accretion disks.
Motivated by the recent discoveries of exact nonlinear steady self-sustaining
solutions in linearly stable non-rotating shear flows, we attempt to compute
similar solutions in Rayleigh-stable rotating plane Couette flows and to
identify transition mechanisms in such flows by combining nonlinear
continuation methods and asymptotic theory. We obtain exact nonlinear solutions
for Rayleigh-stable cyclonic regimes but show that it is not possible to
compute solutions for Rayleigh-stable anticyclonic regimes, including Keplerian
flow, using similar techniques. We also present asymptotic descriptions of
these various problems at large Reynolds numbers that provide some insight into
the differences between the non-rotating and Rayleigh-stable anticyclonic
regimes and derive some necessary conditions for mechanisms analogous to the
non-rotating self-sustaining process to be present in flows on the Rayleigh
line. Our results demonstrate that subcritical transition mechanisms cannot be
identified in wall-bounded Rayleigh-stable anticyclonic shear flows by
transposing directly the phenomenology of subcritical transition in cyclonic
and non-rotating wall-bounded shear flows. Asymptotic developments, however,
leave open the possibility that nonlinear self-sustaining solutions may exist
in unbounded or periodic flows on the Rayleigh line. These could serve as a
starting point to discover solutions in Rayleigh-stable flows, but the
nonlinear stability of Keplerian accretion disks remains to be determined.

The basic model adopts cosmic ray origin from supernova remnants, the particles
then diffusing through the Galaxy with our usual `anomalous diffusion'. The
variants involve the clustering of SN, a frequency distribution for supernova
explosion energies, and 'normal', rather than 'anomalous' diffusion.
  It is found that for supernovae of unique energy, and our usual anomalous
diffusion, clustering is necessary, particularly in the Inner Galaxy. An
alternative, and preferred, situation is to adopt the model with a frequency
distribution of supernova energies. The results for the Outer Galaxy are such
that no clustering is required.
  If their explosion energies are distributed then supernovae can be the origin

transformations from low-T ordered or immiscible states are almost always
driven by configurational disorder (i.e. random occupation of lattice sites by
multiple species), in FePO$_4$--LiFePO$_4$ the formation of a solid solution is
almost entirely driven by electronic, rather than ionic configurational
entropy. We argue that such an electronic entropic mechanism may be relevant to
most other mixed-valence systems.

partially self-avoiding deterministic walk. The walker, with memory $\mu$,
leaves from the leftmost point and moves, at each discrete time step, to the
nearest point, which has not been visited in the preceding $\mu$ steps. We have
obtained analytically the probability $P_N(\mu) = (1 - 2^{-\mu})^{N - \mu - 1}$
that all $N$ points are visited in this open system, with $N \gg \mu \gg 1$.
The expression for $P_N(\mu)$ evaluated in the mentioned limit is valid even
for small $N$ and leads to a transition region centered at $\mu_1 = \ln N/\ln
2$ and with width $\epsilon = e/\ln2$. For $\mu < \mu_1 - \epsilon/2$, the
walker gets trapped in cycles and does not fully explore the system. For $\mu >
\mu_1 + \epsilon/2$ the walker explores the whole system. In both cases the
walker presents diffusive behavior. Nevertheless, in the intermediate regime
$\mu \sim \mu_1 \pm \epsilon/2$, the walker presents anoumalous diffusion
behavior. Since the intermediate region increases as $\ln N$ and its width is
constant, a sharp transition is obtained for one-dimensional large systems. The
walker does not need to have full memory of its trajectory to explore the whole
system, it suffices to have memory of order $\mu_1$.

deviation of power density from noise in a time-frequency spectrogram of the

We obtain the leading-N_f contribution to the NLO BFKL kernel in transverse

the cases can correctly reproduce all the current neutrino oscillation data

for the species concentration and nutrient are selected, the long term species
concentration and substrate levels closely approximate a prescribed oscillatory
behavior. This is significant because it reproduces the realistic ecological
situation where the species and substrate concentrations oscillate. We show
that the stability is maintained when the model is augmented by additional
species that are being driven to extinction. We also give an input-to-state
stability result for the chemostat tracking equations for cases where there are
small perturbations acting on the dilution rate and initial concentration. This
means that the long term species concentration and substrate behavior enjoys a
highly desirable robustness property, since it continues to approximate the

spherically symmetric, Schwarzschild, black hole. Because null geodesics on the
photon sphere orbit the black hole, extra effort must be made to show that the
high angular momentum components of a solution decay sufficiently fast,
particularly for low regularity initial data. Previous results are rapid decay
for regular ($H^3$) initial data \cite{BSterbenz} and slower decay for rough
($H^{1+\epsilon}$) initial data \cite{BlueSoffer3}. Here, we combine those
methods to show boundedness of the conformal charge. From this, we conclude
that there are bounds for global in time, space-time norms, in particular
  \int_I |\tilde\phi|^4 d^4vol < C for $H^{1+\epsilon}$ initial data with
additional decay towards infinite and the bifurcation sphere. Here $\tilde\phi$
refers to a solution of the wave equation. $I$ denotes the exterior region of
the Schwarzschild solution, which can be expressed in coordinates as $r>2M$,
$t\in\Reals, \omega\in S^2$, and $d^4\text{vol}$ is the natural 4-dimensional
volume induced by the Schwarzschild pseudo-metric. We also demonstrate that the
photon sphere has the same influence on the wave equation as a closed geodesic
has on the wave equation on a Riemannian manifold. We demonstrate this
similarity by extending our techniques to the wave equation on a class of
Riemannian manifolds. Under further assumptions, the space-time estimates are
sufficient to prove global bounds for small data, nonlinear wave equations on a
class of Riemannian manifolds with closed geodesics. We must use global,
space-time integral estimates since $L^\infty$ estimates cannot hold at this
level of regularity.

summation. The main idea of the statistical convergence of a sequence l is that
the majority of elements from l converge and we do not care what is going on
with other elements. We show (Section 2) that being mathematically formalized
the concept of statistical convergence is directly connected to convergence of
such statistical characteristics as the mean and standard deviation. At the
same time, it known that sequences that come from real life sources, such as
measurement and computation, do not allow, in a general case, to test whether
they converge or statistically converge in the strict mathematical sense. To
overcome limitations induced by vagueness and uncertainty of real life data,
neoclassical analysis has been developed. It extends the scope and results of
the classical mathematical analysis by applying fuzzy logic to conventional
mathematical objects, such as functions, sequences, and series. The goal of
this work is the further development of neoclassical analysis. This allows us
to reflect and model vagueness and uncertainty of our knowledge, which results
from imprecision of measurement and inaccuracy of computation. In the context
on the theory of fuzzy limits, we develop the structure of statistical fuzzy
convergence and study its properties.

engineering interest: a chemical reactor, a non-holonomic car, and an inertial

i.e, symmetry-preserving observers. We consider an observer to consist in a
copy of the system equation and a correction term, and we give a constructive
method (based on the Cartan moving-frame method) to find all the
symmetry-preserving correction terms. They rely on an invariant frame (a
classical notion) and on an invariant output-error, a less standard notion
precisely defined here. For each example, the convergence analysis relies also
on symmetries consideration with a key use of invariant state-errors. For the
non-holonomic car and the inertial navigation system, the invariant
state-errors are shown to obey an autonomous differential equation independent
of the system trajectory. This allows us to prove convergence, with almost
global stability for the non-holonomic car and with semi-global stability for
the inertial navigation system. Simulations including noise and bias show the
practical interest of such invariant asymptotic observers for the inertial
navigation system.

need separate studies not only for odd nuclei but also for $^{16}$C and

lattice-gas model which describes traffic of unconventional (single-headed)

parameter $c$, to account for an interesting mechano-chemical process which has
not been considered in any earlier model. We have been able to extract all the
parameters of the model, except $c$, from experimentally measured quantities.
In contrast to earlier models of intra-cellular molecular motor traffic, our
model assigns distinct ``chemical'' (or, conformational) states to each kinesin
to account for the hydrolysis of ATP, the chemical fuel of the motor. Our model
makes experimentally testable theoretical predictions. We determine the phase
diagram of the model in planes spanned by experimentally controllable
parameters, namely, the concentrations of kinesins and ATP. Furthermore, the
phase-separated regime is studied in some detail using analytical methods and
simulations to determine e.g. the position of shocks. Comparison of our
theoretical predictions with experimental results is expected to elucidate the
nature of the mechano-chemical process captured by the parameter $c$.

cycles in duration, high energies beyond the Joule level and peak powers
exceeding several terawatt (TW). When such pulses propagate through
optically-transparent media, they first self-focus in space and grow in
intensity, until they generate a tenuous plasma by photo-ionization. For free
electron densities and beam intensities below their breakdown limits, these
pulses evolve as self-guided objects, resulting from successive equilibria
between the Kerr focusing process, the chromatic dispersion of the medium, and
the defocusing action of the electron plasma. Discovered one decade ago, this
self-channeling mechanism reveals a new physics, widely extending the frontiers
of nonlinear optics. Implications include long-distance propagation of TW beams
in the atmosphere, supercontinuum emission, pulse shortening as well as
high-order harmonic generation. This review presents the landmarks of the
10-odd-year progress in this field. Particular emphasis is laid to the
theoretical modeling of the propagation equations, whose physical ingredients
are discussed from numerical simulations. Differences between femtosecond
pulses propagating in gaseous or condensed materials are underlined. Attention
is also paid to the multifilamentation instability of broad, powerful beams,
breaking up the energy distribution into small-scale cells along the optical
path. The robustness of the resulting filaments in adverse weathers, their
large conical emission exploited for multipollutant remote sensing, nonlinear
spectroscopy, and the possibility to guide electric discharges in air are
finally addressed on the basis of experimental results.

parameters of heart rate turbulence, turbulence onset (TO) and turbulence slope
(TS).
  Objective: To devise a new method for detecting circadian rhythm in noisy
data, and apply it to selected Holter recordings from two post-myocardial
infarction databases, Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST, n=684) and
Innovative Stratification of Arrhythmic Risk (ISAR, n=327).
  Methods: For each patient, TS and TO were calculated for each hour with >4
VPCs. An autocorrelation function Corr(Delta t) = <TS(t) TS(t+Delta t)> was
then calculated, and averaged over all patients. Positive Corr(Delta t)
indicates that TS at a given hour and Delta t hours later are similar. TO was
treated likewise. Simulations and mathematical analysis showed that circadian
rhythm required Corr(Delta t) to have a U-shape consisting of positive values
near Delta t=0 and 23, and negative values for intermediate Delta t.
Significant deviation of Corr(Delta t) from the correlator function of pure
noise was evaluated as a chi-squared value.
  Results: Circadian patterns were not apparent in hourly averages of TS and TO
plotted against clock time, which had large error bars. Their correlator
functions, however, produced chi-squared values of ~10 in CAST (both p<0.0001)
and ~3 in ISAR (both p<0.0001), indicating presence of circadian rhythmicity.
  Conclusion: Correlator functions may be a powerful tool for detecting
presence of circadian rhythms in noisy data, even with recordings limited to 24
hours.

projection valued. The motivation for such a scheme comes from the well-known
fact that due to the noise in a quantum measurement, the resulting outcome
distribution is given by a POM and cannot, in general, be described in terms of
a traditional observable, a selfadjoint operator. Accordingly, we notice that
the noiseless measurements are the ones which are determined by a selfadjoint
operator. The POM $E^f$ in our quantization is defined through its moment
operators, which are required to be of the form $\Gamma(f^k)$, $k\in \N$, with
$\Gamma$ a fixed map from classical variables to Hilbert space operators. In

Including output coupling of ground-state atoms and replenishing of hot atoms
into the cavity volume leads to a coherent, quantum correlated atom-photon pair
source very analogous to twin light beam generation in a nondegenerate optical
parametric oscillator.

  by second-named author",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Recent elegant work on the structure of Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
(PQFT) has revealed an astonishing interplay between analysis(Riemann Zeta
functions), topology (Knot theory), combinatorial graph theory (Feynman
Diagrams) and algebra (Hopf structure). The difficulty inherent in the
complexities of a fully-fledged field theory such as PQFT means that the
essential beauty of the relationships between these areas can be somewhat
obscured. Our intention is to display some, although not all, of these
structures in the context of a simple zero-dimensional field theory; i.e. a
quantum theory of non-commuting operators which do not depend on spacetime. The
combinatorial properties of these boson creation and annihilation operators,
which is our chosen example, may be described by graphs, analogous to the
Feynman diagrams of PQFT, which we show possess a Hopf algebra structure. Our
approach is based on the partition function for a boson gas. In a subsequent
note in these Proceedings we sketch the relationship between the Hopf algebra
of our simple model and that of the PQFT algebra.
