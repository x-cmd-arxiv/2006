of the X-ray sources, while for the remaining ~10% of the sources we were not
able to provide a unique optical association due to the faintness of the
possible optical counterparts (I_AB>25) or to the presence of multiple optical
sources within the XMM-Newton error circles. We also cross-correlated the
candidate optical counterparts with the Subaru multicolor and ACS catalogs and
with the Magellan/IMACS, zCOSMOS and literature spectroscopic data; the
spectroscopic sample comprises 248 objects (~40% of the full sample). Our
analysis reveals that for ~80% of the counterparts there is a very good
agreement between the spectroscopic classification, the morphological
parameters as derived from ACS data, and the optical to near infrared colors.
About 20% of the sources show an apparent mismatch between the morphological
and spectroscopic classifications. All the ``extended'' BL AGN lie at redshift
<1.5, while the redshift distribution of the full BL AGN population peaks at
z~1.5. Our analysis also suggests that the Type 2/Type 1 ratio decreases
towards high luminosities, in qualitative agreement with the results from X-ray
spectral analysis and the most recent modeling of the X-ray luminosity function

interesting properties. The most important one is that the presence of strong
Paschen-Back perturbations due to the hyperfine structure produces an intensity
line profile whose shape changes according to the absolute value of the
magnetic field strength. A line ratio technique is developed from the intrinsic
variations of the line profile. This line ratio technique is applied to
spectropolarimetric observations of the quiet solar photosphere in order to
explore the probability distribution function of the magnetic field strength.
Particular attention is given to the quietest area of the observed field of
view, which was encircled by an enhanced network region. A detailed theoretical
investigation shows that the inferred distribution yields information on the
average magnetic field strength and the spatial scale at which the magnetic
field is organized. A first estimation gives ~250 G for the mean field strength

generally thought to be supernova remnants (SNRs). We consider an alternative
hypothesis that most are wind driven bubbles (WDBs) associated with very young
super star clusters (SSCs). In this scenario, the synchrotron emitting
particles are produced at the site of the shock transition between the cluster
wind and the hot bubble gas. The particles radiate in the strong magnetic field
produced in the expanding shell of shocked ambient interstellar gas. One of the
motivations for this hypothesis is the lack of observed time variability in
most of the sources, implying ages greater than expected for SNRs, but
comfortably within the range for WDBs. In addition, as SNRs, these sources are
not effective in driving the starburst mass outflow associated with the nuclear
region of M82, thus requiring a separate mechanism for coupling SN energy to
this outflow. The WDB hypothesis is found to be feasible for underlying
clusters in the mass range ~2x10^(4+/-1)Msun, and ambient gas densities in the
range ~3x10^(3+/-1)cm^-3. The ages of the bubbles are between several x10^3 and
several x10^4 years. Since the SNR picture cannont be ruled out, we provide
suggestions for specific observational tests which could confirm or rule out
the WDB hypothesis. Finally, we discuss the WDB hypothesis in the context of
broader phenomena in M82, such as the rate of star formation and starburst
outflows, and the possible interpretation of supershells in M82 as the products
of multiple supernovae in young SSCs.

radial fields under the effects of surface differential rotation, meridional
flow, and turbulent diffusion due to convective flow patterns. We calculate the
flux evolution and the lifetimes of BMRs and unipolar starspots, varying the
emergence latitude, surface shear rate, and tilt angle. For BMRs comparable to
the largest observed on the Sun, we find that varying the surface flows and the
tilt angle modifies the lifetimes over a range of one month. For very large
BMRs (area ~10% of the stellar surface) the assumption of a tilt angle
increasing with latitude leads to a significant increase of lifetime, as
compared to the case without tilt. Such regions can evolve to polar spots that
live more than a year. Adopting the observed weak latitudinal shear and the
radius of the active subgiant component of HR 1099, we find longer BMR
lifetimes as compared to the more strongly sheared AB Dor case. Random
emergence of six additional tilted bipoles in an activity belt at 60 degrees
latitude enhanced the lifetimes of polar caps up to 7 years. We have also
compared the evolution and lifetime of monolithic starspots with those of
conglomerates of smaller spots of similar total area. We find similar decay

correlation function, xi(r), with a correlation length of r_0=7.45+-0.35 Mpc
and a power-law slope of gamma=1.72+-0.06 in the 0.4<r<50 Mpc range. But it is
in the LRG angular correlation function that the strongest evidence for
non-power-law features is found where a slope of gamma=-2.17+-0.07 is seen at

distortions in the 2-D redshift-space correlation function, xi(sigma,pi). We
fit for the LRG velocity dispersion, w_z, Omega_m and beta, where
beta=Omega_m^0.6/b and b is the linear bias parameter. We find values of
w_z=330kms^-1, Omega_m= 0.10+0.35-0.10 and beta=0.40+-0.05. These high redshift
results, which incorporate the Alcock-Paczynski effect and the effects of
dynamical infall, start to break the degeneracy between Omega_m and beta found
in low-redshift galaxy surveys. This degeneracy is further broken by
introducing an additional external constraint, the value of beta(z=0.1)=0.45
from 2dFGRS, and then considering the evolution of clustering from z~0 to
z_LRG~0.55. With these combined methods we find Omega_m(z=0)=0.30+-0.15 and
beta(z=0.55)=0.45+-0.05. Assuming these values, we find a value for
b(z=0.55)=1.66+-0.35. We show that this is consistent with a simple ``high

z~1.4 QSOs and measure the correlation function. The clustering signal in
z-space, projected along the sky direction, is similar to that previously
obtained from 2QZ alone. By fitting the z-space correlation function and
lifting the degeneracy between beta and Omega_m_0 by using linear theory
predictions, we obtain beta(z=1.4) = 0.60+-0.12 and Omega_m_0=0.25+-0.08,
implying a value for the QSO bias, b(z=1.4)=1.5+-0.2. We further find that QSO
clustering does not depend strongly on luminosity at fixed redshift. This
result is inconsistent with the expectation of simple `high peaks' biasing
models where more luminous, rare QSOs are assumed to inhabit higher mass
haloes. The data are more consistent with models which predict that QSOs of
different luminosities reside in haloes of similar mass. We find that halo mass
does not evolve strongly with redshift nor depend on QSO luminosity. We finally
investigate how black hole mass correlates with luminosity and redshift and
ascertain the relation between Eddington efficiency and black hole mass. Our
results suggest that QSOs of different luminosities may contain black holes of
similar mass.

photoproduction cross section due to the dissociation of the studied organic

uncertainties typically larger by a factor of ~3. We attribute the
discrepancies to flawed parameter estimation techniques in the original
analysis and demonstrate that the original da/a values were strongly biased
towards zero. Were those flaws not present, the input data and spectra should
have given a weighted mean of da/a=(-0.44+/-0.16) x 10^{-5}. Although this new
value does reflect the input spectra and fits (unchanged from the original work
-- only our analysis is different), we do not claim that it supports previous
Keck/HIRES evidence for a varying alpha: there remains significant scatter in
the individual da/a values which may stem from the overly simplistic profile
fits in the original work. Allowing for such additional, unknown random errors
by increasing the uncertainties on da/a to match the scatter provides a more
conservative weighted mean, da/a=(-0.64+/-0.36) x 10^{-5}. We highlight similar
problems in other current UVES constraints on varying alpha and argue that

supernova (SN) 2006gy is probably the brightest SN ever observed. We report on
multi-wavelength observations of this SN and its environment. Our spectroscopy
shows an H alpha emission line as well as absorption features which may be
identified as SiII lines at low expansion velocity. The high peak luminosity,
the slow rise to maximum, and the narrow H alpha line are similar to those
observed in hybrid type-Ia/IIn (also called IIa) SNe. The host galaxy, NGC
1260, is dominated by an old stellar population with solar metallicity.
However, our high resolution adaptive optics images reveal a dust lane in this
galaxy, and there appears to be an HII region in the vicinity of the SN. The
extra-ordinarily large peak luminosity, ~3x10^44 erg/s, demands a dense
circum-stellar medium, regardless of the mass of the progenitor star. The
inferred mass loss rate of the progenitor is ~0.1 solar mass per year over a
period of ~10 yr prior to explosion. Such an high mass-loss rate may be the
result of a binary star common envelope ejection. The total radiated energy in
the first two months is about 1.1x10^51 erg, which is only a factor of two less
than that available from a super-Chandrasekhar Ia explosion. Therefore, given
the presence of a star forming region in the vicinity of the SN and the high
energy requirements, a plausible scenario is that SN 2006gy is related to the
death of a massive star (e.g., pair production SN).

as a tool to measure the relative temperature of the star independent of
spectroscopy. Measuring the pulsation periods of a ZZ Ceti star is a simple,
model-independent, and straight forward process as opposed to a spectroscopic
determination of its temperature.
  Internal uncertainties in determining the spectroscopic temperature of a ZZ
Ceti star are at least 200K, 15% of the 1350K width of the instability strip.
The uncertainties in determining the mean period arise mostly from amplitude
modulation in the pulsation spectrum and are smaller than 100s for 91% of the
ZZ Ceti stars, <8% of the 1300s width of the instability strip. In principle
this implies that for 90% of the ZZ Ceti stars, the average uncertainty in
determining the location of a ZZ Ceti star within the instability strip
decreases by a factor of two in utilizing the mean period of the ZZ Ceti star
as a temperature indicator rather than conventional spectroscopy. Presently we

photometric survey. The algorithm works without any prior knowledge of the
effects, as long as they appear in many stars of the sample. This paper
presents the basic principles of Sys-Rem and discusses a parameterization used
to determine the number of effects removed. We assess the performance of
Sys-Rem on simulated transits injected into WHAT survey data. This test is
proposed as a general scheme to assess the effectiveness of detrending
algorithms. Application of Sys-Rem to the OGLE dataset demonstrates the power
of the algorithm. We offer a coded implementation of Sys-Rem to the community.

  Redshift of the lensing galaxy in seven gravitationally lensed quasars","7 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20066939",,"astro-ph",,"  Aims: The knowledge of the redshift of a lensing galaxy that produces
multiple images of a background quasar is essential to any subsequent modeling,
whether related to the determination of the Hubble constant H_0 or to the mass
profile of the lensing galaxy. We present the results of our ongoing
spectroscopic observations of gravitationally lensed quasars in order to
measure the redshift of their lensing galaxies. We report on the determination
of the lens redshift in seven gravitationally lensed systems.
  Methods: Our deep VLT/FORS1 spectra are spatially deconvolved in order to
separate the spectrum of the lensing galaxies from the glare of the much
brighter quasar images. Our observing strategy involves observations in
Multi-Object-Spectroscopy (MOS) mode which allows the simultaneous observation
of the target and of several crucial PSF and flux calibration stars. The
advantage of this method over traditional long-slit observations is that it
allows a much more reliable extraction and flux calibration of the spectra.
  Results: We obtain the first reliable spectra of the lensing galaxies in six
lensed quasars: FBQ 0951+2635 (z=0.260), BRI 0952-0115 (z=0.632), HE 2149-2745
(z=0.603), Q 0142-100 (z=0.491), SDSS J0246-0825 (z=0.723), and SDSS J0806+2006
(z=0.573). The last 3 redshifts also correspond to the MgII doublet seen in
absorption in the quasar spectra at the lens redshift. Our spectroscopic
redshifts of HE 2149-2745 and FBQ 0951+2635 are higher than previously
reported, which means that H_0 estimates from these two systems must be revised
to higher values. Finally, we reanalyse our spectra of Q 1355-2257 and find
MgII in absorption at z=0.702, confirming our previous redshift estimate. The
spectra of all lenses are typical of early-type galaxies.

ground have shown that there is only mild evolution in the relationship between
radial size and stellar mass for galactic disks from z~1 to the present day.
Using a sample of nearby disk-dominated galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS), and high redshift data from the GEMS (Galaxy Evolution from
Morphology and SEDs) survey, we investigate whether this result is consistent
with theoretical expectations within the hierarchical paradigm of structure
formation. The relationship between virial radius and mass for dark matter
halos in the LCDM model evolves by about a factor of two over this interval.
However, N-body simulations have shown that halos of a given mass have less
centrally concentrated mass profiles at high redshift. When we compute the
expected disk size-stellar mass distribution, accounting for this evolution in
the internal structure of dark matter halos and the adiabatic contraction of
the dark matter by the self-gravity of the collapsing baryons, we find that the
predicted evolution in the mean size at fixed stellar mass since z~1 is about
15-20 percent, in good agreement with the observational constraints from GEMS.
At redshift z~2, the model predicts that disks at fixed stellar mass were on
average only 60% as large as they are today. Similarly, we predict that the
rotation velocity at a given stellar mass (essentially the zero-point of the
Tully-Fisher relation) is only about 10 percent larger at z~1 (20 percent at
z~2) than at the present day.

toroidal grating monochromator (TGM) beamline of the Brazilian Synchrotron
Light Laboratory (LNLS). Mass spectra were obtained using the photoelectron
photoion coincidence (PEPICO) method. Kinetic energy distribution and
abundances for each ionic fragment have been obtained from the analysis of the
corresponding peak shapes in the mass spectra. Absolute photoionization and
photodissociation cross sections were also determined. We have found, among the
channels leading to ionization, about 11-16% of CH$_3$OH survive the soft

may be associated with the high column density observed in star-forming

bond rupture (with strong charge retention preferentially on the methyl

be an alternative route to molecular hydrogenation or a trigger for secondary

INTEGRAL on May 15, 2006, during a bright flare. The source shows sporadic
recurrent short bright flares, reaching a peak luminosity of 10^36 erg s^-1
within less than one hour. The companion star is HD 74194, an Ob5Ib(f)
supergiant star located at 3 kpc in the Vela region. We report the light curves
and broad-band spectra (0.1-200 keV) of all the three flares of IGR J08408-4503
detected up to now based on INTEGRAL and Swift data. The flare spectra are well
described by a power-law model with a high energy cut-off at ~15 keV. The
absorption column density during the flares was found to be ~10^21 cm^-2,
indicating a very low matter density around the compact object. Using the
supergiant donor star parameters, the wind accretion conditions imply an
orbital period of the order of one year, a spin period of the order of hours
and a magnetic field of the order of 10^13 G.

fragments observed after the fall of a mercury drop on the floor. The size
distribution follows a power-law for large enough fragments. We address the
question of a possible crossover to a second, different power-law for small
enough fragments. Two series of experiments were performed. The first uses a
traditional film photographic camera, and the picture is later treated on a
computer in order to count the fragments and classify them according to their
sizes. The second uses a modern digital camera. The first approach has the
advantage of a better resolution for small fragment sizes. The second, although
with a poorer size resolution, is more reliable concerning the counting of all
fragments up to its resolution limit. Both together clearly indicate the real
existence of the quoted crossover.
  The model treats the system microscopically during the tiny time interval
when the initial drop collides with the floor. The drop is modelled by a
connected cluster of Ising spins pointing up (mercury) surrounded by Ising
spins pointing down (air). The Ising coupling which tends to keep the spins
segregated represents the surface tension. Initially the cluster carries an
extra energy equally shared among all its spins, corresponding to the coherent
kinetic energy due to the fall. Each spin which touches the floor loses its
extra energy transformed into a thermal, incoherent energy represented by a
temperature used then to follow the dynamics through Monte Carlo simulations.
Whenever a small piece becomes disconnected from the big cluster, it is
considered a fragment, and counted. The results also indicate the existence of
the quoted crossover in the fragment-size distribution.

times but decays to zero too slowly and gives a poor description of the
correlation function at intermediate times. The BCA is exact at zero time, but
it predicts a correlation function that diverges at long times. The STA gives a
reasonable description of the SLCC but does not predict the correct temperature
dependence of the negative dip in the function that is associated with caging
at low temperatures. None of the other binary collision approximations is a
systematic improvement upon the STA. The extracted memory functions have a
rapidly decaying short time part, much like the STA, and a much smaller, more

substrate autocatalytic processes can induce either enantiomeric excess (ee)
amplification or chiral symmetry breaking. Former terminology means that the
final ee value is larger than the initial value but depends on this, whereas
the latter means the selection of a unique value of the final ee, independent
of the initial value. The ee amplification takes place in an irreversible
reaction such that all the substrate molecules are converted to chiral products
and the reaction comes to a halt. The chiral symmetry breaking is possible when
recycling processes are incorporated. Reactions become reversible and the
system relaxes slowly to a unique final state. The difference between the two
behaviors is apparent in the flow diagram in the phase space of chiral molecule
concentrations. The ee amplification takes place when the flow terminates on a
line of fixed points (or a fixed line), whereas symmetry breaking corresponds
to the dissolution of the fixed line accompanied by the appearance of fixed
points. Relevance of the Soai reaction to the homochirality in life is also

as well as to the homochirality in life are studied analytically and
numerically by the use of the master equation and random walk model. For
systems with a recycling process, a unique final probability distribution is
obtained by means of detailed balance conditions. With a nonlinear
autocatalysis the distribution has a double-peak structure, indicating the
chiral symmetry breaking. This problem is further analyzed by examining
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the master equation. In the case without
recycling process, final probability distributions depend on the initial
conditions. In the nonlinear autocatalytic case, time-evolution starting from a
complete achiral state leads to a final distribution which differs from that
deduced from the nonzero recycling result. This is due to the absence of the
detailed balance, and a directed random walk model is shown to give the correct
final profile. When the nonlinear autocatalysis is sufficiently strong and the
initial state is achiral, the final probability distribution has a double-peak
structure, related to the enantiomeric excess amplification. It is argued that
with autocatalyses and a very small but nonzero spontaneous production, a
single mother scenario could be a main mechanism to produce the homochirality.

that both Ce2S3 modifications are insulators with optical gaps of 0.8 eV

direct electronic excitations at k=Gamma from localized and occupied Ce
4f-orbitals into empty Ce 5d-states. The f-states are situated between the

yield an effective local magnetic moment of 2.6 $mu_B$ per cerium cation, which

finite as the noise tends to zero, or it may diverge. In the former case the

for various sizes of the attacker coalition. Lower bounds are obtained by
considering typical coalitions, which represents a new idea in the area of
fingerprinting and enables us to improve the previously known lower bounds for
coalitions of size two and three. For upper bounds, the fingerprinting problem
is modelled as a communications problem. It is shown that the maximum code rate
is bounded above by the capacity of a certain class of channels, which are
similar to the multiple-access channel. Converse coding theorems proved in the
paper provide new upper bounds on fingerprinting capacity.
  It is proved that capacity for fingerprinting against coalitions of size two

$0.083 \leq C_{3,2} \leq 0.199$ respectively. For coalitions of an arbitrary

gossiping time, but also to minimise the energy consumption, which is measured
in terms of the total number of messages (or transmissions) sent. We assume
that the nodes of the network do not know the network, and that they can only
send with a fixed power, meaning they can not adjust the areas sizes that their
messages cover. We believe that under these circumstances the number of
transmissions is a very good measure for the overall energy consumption.
  For random networks, we present a broadcasting algorithm where every node
transmits at most once. We show that our algorithm broadcasts in $O(\log n)$
steps, w.h.p, where $n$ is the number of nodes. We then present a $O(d \log n)$
($d$ is the expected degree) gossiping algorithm using $O(\log n)$ messages per

broadcasting algorithm with optimal broadcasting time $O(D \log (n/D) + \log^2

per node. We also show a tradeoff result between the broadcasting time and the
number of transmissions: we construct a network such that any oblivious
algorithmusing a time-invariant distribution requires $\Omega(\log^2 n / \log

demonstrates the tightness of our upper bound. We also show that no oblivious

field theory we are trying to understand why the standard perturbation theory
for General Relativity, which starts with linearized gravity does not see
gravitational collapse. We start with investigating classical equations of
motion. For zero Immirzi parameter the ambiguity of the standard perturbative
expansion is reproduced. This ambiguity is related to the appearance of the
linearized diffeomorphism symmetry, which becomes unlinked from the original
diffeomorphism symmetry. Introducing Immirzi parameter makes it possible to
restore the link between these two symmetries and thus removes the ambiguity,
but at the cost of making classical perturbation theory rather intractable.
Then we argue that the two main sources of complexity of perturbation theory,
infinite number of degrees of freedom and non-trivial curvature of the phase
space of General Relativity could be disentangled when studying {\it quantum}
amplitudes. As an illustration we consider zero order approximation in quantum
perturbation theory. We identify relevant observables, and sketch their
quantization. We find some indications that this zero order approximation might
be described by Doubly Special Relativity.

standard maximal mixing scenario of the MSSM we find a viable signal for large
tan(beta) and intermediate H^+/- masses (~m_t) when using optimistic cuts

tan(beta) (>~50). We have also investigated a special class of MSSM scenarios
with large mass-splittings among the heavy Higgs bosons where the cross-section
can be resonantly enhanced by factors up to one hundred, with a strong
dependence on the CP-violating phases. Even so we find that the signal after
cuts remains small except for small masses (~< m_t) with optimistic cuts.
Finally, in all the scenarios we have investigated we have only found small

cutoffs imposed on the transverse and longitudinal components of particle
momenta corresponds to restricting the integration volume by a non-rotationally
invariant domain. The result depends not only on the size of this domain (i.e.,
on the cutoff values), but also on its orientation determined by the position
of the light-front plane. Explicitly covariant formulation of light front
dynamics allows us to parameterize the latter dependence in a very transparent
form. If we decompose the regularized amplitude in terms of independent
invariant amplitudes, extra (non-physical) terms should appear, with spin
structures which explicitly depend on the orientation of the light front plane.
The number of form factors, i.e., the coefficients of this decomposition,
therefore also increases. The spin-1/2 fermion self-energy is determined by
three scalar functions, instead of the two standard ones, while for the elastic
electromagnetic vertex the number of form factors increases from two to five.
In the present paper we calculate perturbatively all these form factors in the
Yukawa model. Then we compare the results obtained in the two following ways:
(i) by using the light front dynamics graph technique rules directly; (ii) by
integrating the corresponding Feynman amplitudes in terms of the light front
variables. For each of these methods, we use two types of regularization: the
transverse and longitudinal cutoffs, and the Pauli-Villars regularization. In
the latter case, the dependence of amplitudes on the light front plane
orientation vanishes completely provided enough Pauli-Villars subtractions are
made.

solution, which is related to the notion of ensemble average for flows in
statistical equilibrium. We provide a lower bound estimate for the mean skin
friction coefficient and improve on a previous upper bound estimate for the
same quantity; both estimates in terms of the Reynolds number. We also present
lower and upper bound estimates for the mean rate of energy dissipation, the
mean longitudinal velocity (in the direction of the pressure gradient), and the
mean kinetic energy. In particular, we obtain an upper bound related to the
energy dissipation law, namely that the mean rate of energy dissipation is
essentially bounded by a non-dimensional universal constant times the cube of
the mean longitudinal velocity over a characteristic macro-scale length.
Finally, we investigate the scale-by-scale energy injection due to the pressure
gradient, proving an upper bound estimate for the decrease of this energy
injection as the scale length decreases.

characterize the ratios between the width of the ""bulk"" part of the spectrum

the concept of golden spectral graphs (GSG), which are graphs for which both
spectral ratios are identical to the golden ratio. Then, we prove several
analytic results to finding the smallest GSG as well as to build families of
GSGs. We also prove some non-existence results for certain classes of graphs.
We explore by computer several classes of graphs and found some almost GSGs.
Two networks representing real-world systems were also found to have spectral
ratios very close to the golden ratio. We have shown in this work that GSG
display good expansion properties, many of them are Ramanujan graphs and also
are expected to have very good synchronizability. In closing golden spectral

  $g:\{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ with $\|f-g\|_2^2 \le \epsilon$ which depends only
on $e^{O(I_f/\epsilon)}$ variables where $I_f$ is the sum of the influences of
the variables of $f$. Dinur and Friedgut later showed that this statement also
holds if we replace the discrete domain $\{0,1\}^n$ with the continuous domain
$[0,1]^n$, under the extra assumption that $f$ is increasing. They conjectured
that the condition of monotonicity is unnecessary and can be removed.
  We show that certain constant-depth decision trees provide counter-examples
to Dinur-Friedgut conjecture. This suggests a reformulation of the conjecture
in which the function $g:[0,1]^n \to \{0,1\}$ instead of depending on a small
number of variables has a decision tree of small depth. In fact we prove this
reformulation by showing that the depth of the decision tree of $g$ can be
bounded by $e^{O(I_f/\epsilon^2)}$.
  Furthermore we consider a second notion of the influence of a variable, and
study the functions that have bounded total influence in this sense. We use a
theorem of Bourgain to show that these functions have certain properties. We
also study the relation between the two different notions of influence.

The algebras are constructed as sub-algebras of the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra (and

study such properties as nuclearity, simplicity and Morita equivalence with
algebras related to solenoids.
  The second part deals with the Schur complement transformations of elements
of self-similar algebras. We study properties of such transformations and apply
them to the spectral problem for Markov type elements in self-similar
$C^*-$algebras. This is related to the spectral problem of the discrete Laplace
operator on groups and graphs. Application of the Schur complement method in
many situations reduces the spectral problem to study of invariant sets (very
often of the type of a ``strange attractor'') of a multidimensional rational
transformation. A number of illustrating examples is provided. Finally we
observe a relation between the Schur complement transformations and
Bartholdi-Kaimanovich-Virag transformations of random walks on self-similar

than linear filtering for removing noise in the presence of edges."" Using a
straightforward large-$n$ decision-theory framework, this folk-theorem is seen
to be false in general. We show that median filtering and linear filtering have
similar asymptotic worst-case mean-squared error (MSE) when the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) is of order 1, which corresponds to the case of constant per-pixel
noise level in a digital signal. To see dramatic benefits of median smoothing
in an asymptotic setting, the per-pixel noise level should tend to zero (i.e.,
SNR should grow very large). We show that a two-stage median filtering using
two very different window widths can dramatically outperform traditional linear
and median filtering in settings where the underlying object has edges. In this
two-stage procedure, the first pass, at a fine scale, aims at increasing the
SNR. The second pass, at a coarser scale, correctly exploits the nonlinearity
of the median. Image processing methods based on nonlinear partial differential
equations (PDEs) are often said to improve on linear filtering in the presence
of edges. Such methods seem difficult to analyze rigorously in a
decision-theoretic framework. A popular example is mean curvature motion (MCM),
which is formally a kind of iterated median filtering. Our results on iterated
median filtering suggest that some PDE-based methods are candidates to
rigorously outperform linear filtering in an asymptotic framework.

an advanced inverse modelling scheme. All data used in the study correspond to
the period of June-August 2003. The main distinctive feature of our inversion
scheme is that, in contrast to more common inverse modelling approaches, the
magnitudes of uncertainties in the input data are not explicitly predefined but
rather estimated consistently with the a posteriori emissions as a result of
the inversion. While the tropospheric NO2 columns are used for fitting the
spatial distribution of the emission parameters of the model, the ozone
observations are only used to estimate the averaged levels of uncertainties in
a priori emissions. We use our method in order to estimate and to reduce
uncertainties in the gridded (with the resolution of 1 degree) NOx emission
data for Europe, Middle East and Northern Africa. It is found that the a priori
emission estimates used in the standard version of CHIMERE are probably biased
in several regions. On average, the uncertainties in total NOx emissions are
estimated to be about 1.7 in terms of the geometric standard deviation in
Europe and about 2.1 outside of Europe. The corrected emission estimates
provide better agreement of the modelled results with observations for both NO2
columns and near surface concentrations of ozone.

important in MEMS technology and has been under intense study for last few
years. The actuation and the sensitivity are both dependent in a major way on
the electrostatic configuration of the comb structure. As a result, accurate
estimation of the electrostatic configuration of comb drives is crucial in both
design and interpretation phases. The nearly exact Boundary Element Method
(neBEM) solver has been developed recently and used successfully to solve
difficult problems related to electrostatics. This solver uses exact analytic
expression for computing the influence of singularity distributions instead of
adopting the conventional and convenient approximation of nodal concentration
of charges. Due to the exact foundation expressions, the solver has been found
to be exceptionally accurate in the complete physical domain, including the
near field. In this work, we explore the possibility of using the neBEM solver
to solve 3D electrostatic problems related to comb drives. In particular, we
investigate the relationship between the accuracy achieved and the
computational expenses incurred for a realistic comb drive geometry. In the
process, we estimate the charge density distribution, potential distribution
and the capacitance of the comb structure. The study has led us to the
conclusion that the neBEM solver can yield very accurate estimates of all the

phase transition occurs, such that below a critical mutation rate an

metastability in quasispecies theory, via an analytic field theoretic mapping.

genetic variation maps into phenotypic (structural) variation. Evolutionary
innovation in RNA structures is facilitated by neutral networks, large
connected sets of RNA sequences that fold into the same structure. Our work
extends and deepens previous studies on neutral networks. First, we show that
even the 1-mutant neighborhood of a given sequence (genotype) G0 with structure
(phenotype) P contains many structural variants that are not close to P. This
holds for biological and generic RNA sequences alike. Second, we analyze the
relation between new structures in the 1-neighborhoods of genotypes Gk that are
only a moderate Hamming distance k away from G0, and the structure of G0
itself, both for biological and for generic RNA structures. Third, we analyze
the relation between mutational robustness of a sequence and the distances of
structural variants near this sequence. Our findings underscore the role of
neutral networks in evolutionary innovation, and the role that high robustness
can play in diminishing the potential for such innovation.

were the first to prove that 3-local Hamiltonian is complete for the complexity
class QMA, the quantum analogue of NP.
  Quantum k-SAT, a restricted version of the local Hamiltonian problem using
only projector terms, was introduced by Bravyi as an analogue of the classical
k-SAT problem. Bravyi proved that quantum 4-SAT is complete for the class QMA
with one-sided error (QMA_1) and that quantum 2-SAT is in P. We give an
encoding of a quantum circuit into a quantum 4-SAT Hamiltonian using only
3-local terms. As an intermediate step to this 3-local construction, we show
that quantum 3-SAT for particles with dimensions 3x2x2 (a qutrit and two

expressions for the quantum channel representing the back-action. Then, we
analyze the dynamics incurred by the reference when it is used to sequentially
measure particles drawn from a fixed ensemble. We prove that the reference
thermalizes with the measured particles and find that generically, the thermal
state is reached in time which scales linearly with the size of the reference.
This contrasts a recent conclusion of Bartlett et al. that this takes a
quadratic amount of time when the particles are completely unpolarized. We now
understand their result in terms of a simple physical principle based on
symmetries and conservation laws. Finally, we initiate the study of the
non-equilibrium dynamics of the reference. Here we find that a reference in a
coherent state will essentially remain in one when measuring polarized
particles, while rotating itself to ultimately align with the polarization of
the particles.
