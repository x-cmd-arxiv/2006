  Lyman-alpha forest absorption","10 pages, 11 figures, submitted to MNRAS",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13240.x",,"astro-ph",,"  Using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations we measure the mean transmitted
flux in the Lyman alpha forest for quasar sightlines that pass near a
foreground quasar. We find that the trend of absorption with pixel-quasar
separation distance can be fitted using a simple power law form including the
usual correlation function parameters r_{0} and \gamma so that (<F(r)> = \sum
exp(-tau_eff*(1+(r/r_{0})^(-\gamma)))). From the simulations we find the
relation between r_{0} and quasar mass and formulate this as a way to estimate
quasar host dark matter halo masses, quantifying uncertainties due to
cosmological and IGM parameters, and redshift errors. With this method, we
examine data for ~3000 quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data
Release 3, assuming that the effect of ionizing radiation from quasars (the
so-called transverse proximity effect) is unimportant (no evidence for it is
seen in the data.) We find that the best fit host halo mass for SDSS quasars
with mean redshift z=3 and absolute G band magnitude -27.5 is log10(M/M_sun) =
12.48^{+0.53}_{-0.89}. We also use the Lyman-Break Galaxy (LBG) and Lyman alpha
forest data of Adelberger et al in a similar fashion to constrain the halo mass
of LBGs to be log10(M/M_sun) = 11.13^{+0.39}_{-0.55}, a factor of ~20 lower
than the bright quasars. In addition, we study the redshift distortions of the
Lyman alpha forest around quasars, using the simulations. We use the quadrupole
to monopole ratio of the quasar-Lyman alpha forest correlation function as a
measure of the squashing effect. We find that this does not have a measurable
dependence on halo mass, but may be useful for constraining cosmic geometry.

differential equations forms a wide field with strong ties to physics and
applied problems. This paper is meant as a stepping stone for an exploration of
this long-established theme, through the tinted glasses of a (Hopf and
Rota-Baxter) algebraic point of view. By reviewing, reformulating and
strengthening known results, we give evidence for the claim that the use of
Hopf algebra allows for a refined analysis of differential equations. We
revisit the renowned Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff-Dynkin formula by the modern
approach involving Lie idempotents. Approximate solutions to differential
equations involve, on the one hand, series of iterated integrals solving the
corresponding integral equations; on the other hand, exponential solutions.
Equating those solutions yields identities among products of iterated Riemann
integrals. Now, the Riemann integral satisfies the integration-by-parts rule
with the Leibniz rule for derivations as its partner; and skewderivations
generalize derivations. Thus we seek an algebraic theory of integration, with
the Rota-Baxter relation replacing the classical rule. The methods to deal with
noncommutativity are especially highlighted. We find new identities, allowing
for an extensive embedding of Dyson-Chen series of time- or path-ordered
products (of generalized integration operators); of the corresponding Magnus
expansion; and of their relations, into the unified algebraic setting of
Rota-Baxter maps and their inverse skewderivations. This picture clarifies the
approximate solutions to generalized integral equations corresponding to
non-autonomous linear (skew)differential equations.

subanalytic context.
  As an application, we prove rationality and uniformity results for zeta

the wavelets could not able to distinguish the correlations from trends. As the
DB wavelets based detrending will not be able to quantify the correlations
masked by trends, its multifractal extension can not always yield a correct
estimate of the multifractal spectrum of the given data.

The equilibria depends on the solution of a third-order ordinary differential

functions is associated to the magnetic field configuration, while the other is
specified by an equation of state. The case of a Harris sheet type magnetic

that electroporation (membrane defect formation under external electric fields)
starts to occur within the range of transmembrane voltages that cells may
routinely experience, curiously, just above the range of transmembrane voltages
involved in neural signal transmission. Understanding the underlying principles
of electric fields-lipid membrane interactions seems to carry a great
biological importance.
  An argument is presented toward understanding the theoretical aspects of
electroporation by using the DLVO theory, which has not been recognized
previously in the context of electroporation. Further, the dispersion
interactions (with its quantum nature), of the double layer counterions and
membrane lipid molecules over the Stern layer are emphasized. The sign of these
forces is such that they compress the membrane. A parallel is drawn to the
theory of thin films. The argument is that the external electric field breaks
the symmetry of the disjoining pressures on both sides of a lipid membrane,
resulting in a protrusion of only few lipid molecules. That compromises the
membrane stability on a nanoscale and makes it traversable to ions. The
presented estimate based on these arguments is consistent to electroporation
experiments and existing numerical simulations.

significant improvement may be obtained when two or more Geiger counters are

seven dynamic equations for seven dependent variables: density, velocity and
labeling (Lagrangian coordinates, considered as dependent variables). Solution
of the Cauchy problem for the Euler subsystem is unique. Solution of the Cauchy
problem for the complete hydrodynamic system, containing seven equations, is
unique only for irrotational flows. For vortical flows solution of the Cauchy

cannot be taken into account properly in the framework of hydrodynamics. There
are some arguments in favour of connection between interfusion and turbulence.

Chinese stock listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange are investigated using the
limit-order book data. Three different definitions of spread are considered
based on the time right before transactions, the time whenever the highest
buying price or the lowest selling price changes, and a fixed time interval.
The results are qualitatively similar no matter linear prices or logarithmic
prices are used. The average spread exhibits evident intraday patterns
consisting of a big L-shape in morning transactions and a small L-shape in the
afternoon. The distributions of the spread with different definitions decay as
power laws. The tail exponents of spreads at transaction level are well within
the interval $(2,3)$ and that of average spreads are well in line with the
inverse cubic law for different time intervals. Based on the detrended
fluctuation analysis, we found the evidence of long memory in the bid-ask
spread time series for all three definitions, even after the removal of the
intraday pattern. Using the classical box-counting approach for multifractal
analysis, we show that the time series of bid-ask spread does not possess
multifractal nature.

fluctuate. Much emphasis has been placed on the components of this noise that
are due to randomness in transcription and translation; here we analyze the
role of noise associated with the inputs to transcriptional regulation, the
random arrival and binding of transcription factors to their target sites along
the genome. This noise sets a fundamental physical limit to the reliability of
genetic control, and has clear signatures, but we show that these are easily
obscured by experimental limitations and even by conventional methods for
plotting the variance vs. mean expression level. We argue that simple, global
models of noise dominated by transcription and translation are inconsistent
with the embedding of gene expression in a network of regulatory interactions.
Analysis of recent experiments on transcriptional control in the early
Drosophila embryo shows that these results are quantitatively consistent with
the predicted signatures of input noise, and we discuss the experiments needed
to test the importance of input noise more generally.

"quant-ph/0701004","Michael Nielsen","Mark R. Dowling and Michael A. Nielsen","The geometry of quantum computation","23 pages",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Determining the quantum circuit complexity of a unitary operation is closely
related to the problem of finding minimal length paths in a particular curved
geometry [Nielsen et al, Science 311, 1133-1135 (2006)]. This paper
investigates many of the basic geometric objects associated to this space,
including the Levi-Civita connection, the geodesic equation, the curvature, and
the Jacobi equation. We show that the optimal Hamiltonian evolution for
synthesis of a desired unitary necessarily obeys a simple universal geodesic
equation. As a consequence, once the initial value of the Hamiltonian is set,
subsequent changes to the Hamiltonian are completely determined by the geodesic
equation. We develop many analytic solutions to the geodesic equation, and a
set of invariants that completely determine the geodesics. We investigate the
problem of finding minimal geodesics through a desired unitary, U, and develop
a procedure which allows us to deform the (known) geodesics of a simple and
well understood metric to the geodesics of the metric of interest in quantum
computation. This deformation procedure is illustrated using some three-qubit
numerical examples. We study the computational complexity of evaluating
distances on Riemmanian manifolds, and show that no efficient classical
algorithm for this problem exists, subject to the assumption that good
pseudorandom generators exist. Finally, we develop a canonical extension
procedure for unitary operations which allows ancilla qubits to be incorporated
into the geometric approach to quantum computing.
