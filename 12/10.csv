  using Astronomical Sources","6 pages, 5 figures (accepted by Astronomy & Astrophysics)",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20065603",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a technique for the accurate estimation of large-scale errors in
an antenna surface using astronomical sources and detectors. The technique
requires several out-of-focus images of a compact source and the
signal-to-noise ratio needs to be good but not unreasonably high. For a given
pattern of surface errors, the expected form of such images can be calculated
directly. We show that it is possible to solve the inverse problem of finding
the surface errors from the images in a stable manner using standard numerical
techniques. To do this we describe the surface error as a linear combination of
a suitable set of basis functions (we use Zernike polynomials). We present
simulations illustrating the technique and in particular we investigate the
effects of receiver noise and pointing errors. Measurements of the 15-m James
Clerk Maxwell telescope made using this technique are presented as an example.
The key result is that good measurements of errors on large spatial scales can
be obtained if the input images have a signal-to-noise ratio of order 100 or
more. The important advantage of this technique over transmitter-based
holography is that it allows measurements at arbitrary elevation angles, so
allowing one to characterise the large scale deformations in an antenna as a
function of elevation.

interaction between the supernova ejecta and surrounding dense circumstellar
material cast off by the star in pre-explosion mass-loss episodes. Studying
this interaction can yield clues to the nature of Type IIn progenitors and
their mass loss history. In particular, polarization spectra of Type IIn's show
complex line polarization and position angle features that arise from a
combination of geometrical and optical effects. I have constructed a Monte
Carlo code that simulates the transfer of the H alpha line through
circumstellar shells with various geometrical configurations and optical
characteristics. The superposition of broad and narrow line components produced
in different regions of the circumstellar environment and modified by electron
and line scattering, hydrogen absorption, thermal emission, and geometrical and
viewing angle effects gives rise to a variety of polarized line shapes in the
model spectra. Comparison of these results with recent high-quality
spectropolarimetric observations of Type IIn supernovae suggests that a model
""shock"" region between the supernova photosphere and the circumstellar shell is
necessary to produce the narrow polarized emission features at the rest
wavelength of H alpha seen in some IIn's. Further model results point toward
other features in the polarized line profile that can be used to constrain the
characteristics of the circumstellar material in these intriguing objects. The
code's usefulness will be extended by the treatment of Doppler effects due to
expansion of the circumstellar scattering region, such as those that
characterize the polarized H alpha profiles of the Type IIn SN 1997eg.

in {\em Swift} XRT light curves, which is regarded as the tail emission of the

tails of GRBs 060218 and 060614, we present a systematic time-resolved spectral
analysis for the {\em Swift} GRB tails detected between 2005 February and 2007
January. We select a sample of 44 tails that are bright enough to perform
time-resolved spectral analyses. Among them 11 tails are smooth and without
superimposing significant flares, and their spectra have no significant
temporal evolution. We suggest that these tails are dominated by the curvature
effect of the prompt gamma-rays due to delay of propagation of photons from
large angles with respect to the line of sight . More interestingly, 33 tails
show clear hard-to-soft spectral evolution, with 16 of them being smooth tails
directly following the prompt GRBs,while the others being superimposed with
large flares. We focus on the 16 clean, smooth tails and consider three toy
models to interpret the spectral evolution. The curvature effect of a
structured jet and a model invoking superposition of the curvature effect tail
and a putative underlying soft emission component cannot explain all the data.
The third model, which invokes an evolving exponential spectrum, seems to
reproduce both the lightcurve and the spectral evolution of all the bursts,
including GRBs 060218 and 060614. More detailed physical models are called for
to understand the apparent evolution effect.

around 25 minutes and from the resulting beam maps (which have peak signal to

maps of the wavefront errors with accuracy around a hundredth of a wavelength.
  Using such measurements over a wide range of elevations, we have calculated a
model for the wavefront-errors due to the uncompensated gravitational
deformation of the telescope. This model produces a significant improvement at
low elevations, where these errors are expected to be the largest; after
applying the model, the aperture efficiency is largely independent of
elevation. We have also demonstrated that the technique can be used to measure
and largely correct for thermal deformations of the antenna, which often exceed
the uncompensated gravitational deformations during daytime observing.

large-scale and the technique used here is particularly suitable for measuring

functional theory. The exchange-correlation functional used in this calculation
is taken under local density approximation (LDA). The comparison of
experimental spectra with the calculated ones indicates that single-particle
transitions under LDA are sufficient to generate all the observed XANES
including those which have earlier been attributed to many-body shake-up
transitions and core-hole potentials. The present study reveals that all the
experimentally observed features are mainly due to distribution in TM 4p DOS
influenced by hybridization with other orbitals. Specifically, for LaMnO3, the
feature earlier attributed to shake-up process is seen to arise from
hybridization of Mn 4p with La 6p and O 2p orbitals; in La2CuO4 the features
attributed to core hole potential correspond to hybridization of Cu 4p with La

fermion-pair production at a 0.5-1 TeV electron-positron linear collider with
both beams longitudinally polarized. For the four-fermion contact interaction,
we assume a general linear combination of the individual models with definite
chiralities, and arbitrary coupling constants. Accordingly, the estimated
identification reach on the ADD scenario can be considered as
`model-independent'. We emphasize the substantial role of beams polarization in
enhancing the identification sensitivity.

invariant mass spectra to clarify in-medium changes of vector meson properties.
However, a dimuon is characterized by two scales -- invariant mass $M$ and
transverse momentum $p_T$. Like transverse momentum spectra of hadrons, $p_T$
spectra of dileptons arise from an interplay between emission temperature and
collective transverse flow, whereas the invariant mass is insensitive to flow.
Having two control parameters of which only one is sensitive to flow allows at
given $M$ to characterize the emission region in terms of average temperature
and flow. Thus, one is able to study what phases of the fireball evolution
radiate into a given mass window. We demonstrate this technique using the
dimuon transverse momentum spectra measured by the NA60 collaboration and
present strong arguments that a thermalized evolution phase with $T > 170$ MeV
leaves an imprint in the spectra.

particular, it can employ a conversion procedure that turns an original
non-Lagrangian field theory in $d$ dimensions into an equivalent Lagrangian
topological field theory in $d+1$ dimensions. The method involves, besides the
classical equations of motion, one more geometric ingredient called the
Lagrange anchor. Different Lagrange anchors result in different quantizations
of one and the same classical theory. Given the classical equations of motion
and Lagrange anchor as input data, a new procedure, called the augmentation, is
proposed to quantize non-Lagrangian dynamics. Within the augmentation
procedure, the originally non-Lagrangian theory is absorbed by a wider
Lagrangian theory on the same space-time manifold. The augmented theory is not
generally equivalent to the original one as it has more physical degrees of
freedom than the original theory. However, the extra degrees of freedom are
factorized out in a certain regular way both at classical and quantum levels.
The general techniques are exemplified by quantizing two non-Lagrangian models

systems of identical fermions with arbitrary potential of pair interaction is
developed. It is based on the well-known result that the essential dynamic part
of the Hamiltonian for the system of identical particles is the Reduced
Hamiltonian operator describing relative movement of two particles inside the
system. The eigenfunctions of this operator take into account all correlations
caused by interaction. These eigenfunctions are basic for the construction of
the components (i.e. the functions with a lower degree of antisymmetry) of the
system wave functions. The main problem of this approach appears to be
antisymmetrization of the components. The developed universal algorithm for
antisymmetrization gives a possibility to perform this operation in a simple
way and keep numerical approximations under control.

exchanges. The exchange occurs only between agents that are linked, a
constraint that turns out to dominate the results. The exchange process
continues until a Pareto equilibrium is achieved. Only 40%-90% of the agents
achieved relief on small world graphs with mean degree between 2 and 40. Even
fewer agents achieved relief on scale-free like graphs with a truncated power

one of many suns (the fixed stars) scattered throughout space. Detecting
parallax would be solid evidence for the Earth's motion, but failure to detect
parallax could be explained by the stars lying at great distances. Recent work
pertaining to Galileo's observations of double stars illustrates Galileo's
skill as an observer. It also indicates that, given the knowledge of optics of
the time, Galileo could expect his measurements to be accurate enough that they
would have revealed stellar parallax had it existed. Thus parallax was not a
""win-win situation"" after all. It could be solid evidence against the Earth's
motion, evidence which fortunately did not dissuade Galileo from the Copernican
view.

photocounting processes in cavities. First, we work out a microscopic model
that describes the field-detector interaction and deduce a general expression
for the Quantum Jump Superoperator (QJS), that shapes the detector's
post-action on the field upon a detection. We show that in particular cases our
model recovers the QJSs previously proposed ad hoc in the literature and point
out that by adjusting the detector parameters one can engineer QJSs. Then we
set up schemes for experimental verification of the model. By taking into
account the ubiquitous non-idealities, we show that by measuring the lower
photocounts moments and the mean waiting time one can check which QJS better
describes the photocounting phenomenon.
