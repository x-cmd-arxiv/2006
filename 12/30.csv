state of matter in CS interiors come from temperature-age data for young,
nearby objects. The CS cooling theory shall agree not only with these data, but
also with the mass distribution inferred via population synthesis models as

a phase transition to stiff, color superconducting QM which fulfills all above

  Aims: To provide a-priori planetary initial mass functions for confrontation
with the CoRoT-planet discoveries in the entire range of sensitivity of the
CoRoT instrument, i.e. for all giant planets and down to terrestrial planet
masses.
  Methods: We construct a comprehensive set of static complete-equilibrium
core-envelope protoplanets with detailed equations of state and opacity and
radiative transfer by convection and radiation. Protoplanets are calculated for
host-star masses of 0.8 to 2 solar masses and orbital periods of 1 to 16 days.
We subsequently check the stability of the planetary population by a series of
methods.
  Results: We find the static planetary populations to be stable and thus a
plausible ensemble to predict the planetary IMF for orbital periods in the
specified range.
  Conclusions: We predict bimodal planetary initial mass functions with shapes
depending on orbital period. The two main maxima are around a Jupiter mass and
about 50 earth masses. We predict an abundant population of Hot Neptunes and a
large population of planets that fill the solar-system gap of planetary masses

that one might be able to model hadrons as ""strong gravity"" black holes, if one
uses an appropriate rescaling of units or a revised gravitational coupling
factor. The inner consistency of this hypothesis is tested by retrodicting a
close approximation to the mass of the proton from an equation that relates the
angular momentum and mass of a Kerr black hole. More accurate mass and radius
values for the proton are then retrodicted using the geometrodynamics form of
the full Kerr-Newman solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations. The radius of
an alpha particle is calculated as an additional retrodictive test. In a third
retrodictive test of the ""strong gravity"" hypothesis, the subatomic particle
mass spectrum in the 100 MeV to 7,000 MeV range is retrodicted to a first
approximation using the Kerr solution of General Relativity. The particle
masses appear to form a restricted set of quantized values of the Kerr
solution: n^1/2 M, where values of n are a set of discrete integers and M is
the revised Planck mass. The accuracy of the 27 retrodicted masses averages
98.4%. Finally, the new atomic scale gravitational coupling constant suggests a
radical revision of the assumptions governing the Planck scale, and leads to a
natural explanation for the fine structure constant.

that less than ~5 per cent of local massive black hole mass density was
accreted during radiatively inefficient accretion phases, which is obviously
only an upper limit, because Compton-thick AGNs have not been considered. If
the same number of the Compton-thick AGNs with log N_H=24-25 as those with log

Static polaron correlations develop within a narrow temperature regime as the

correlation length that is only weakly temperature dependent. The static nature
of these short-range polaron correlations indicates the presence of a
glass-like state, similar to the observations for the bilayer manganite in the
metallic-ferromagnetic doping region. In addition to this elastic component,
inelastic scattering measurements reveal dynamic correlations with a comparable

thermodynamic identity TdS = dE + PdV. We study this approach further and
generalize the results to two more generic cases within the context of general

evolving horizons. In both the cases, the near horizon structure of Einstein
equations can be expressed as a thermodynamic identity under the virtual
displacement of the horizon. This result demonstrates the fact that the
thermodynamic interpretation of gravitational dynamics is not restricted to

indicates a deeper connection between gravity and thermodynamics.

information for a corresponding family of observers (time-like curves). Since
lack of information can be related to entropy, this suggests the possibility of
assigning an entropy to the null surfaces of a spacetime. We motivate and
introduce such an entropy functional for any vector field in terms of a
fourth-rank divergence free tensor P_{ab}^{cd} with the symmetries of the
curvature tensor. Extremising this entropy for all the null surfaces then leads
to equations for the background metric of the spacetime. When P_{ab}^{cd} is
constructed from the metric alone, these equations are identical to Einstein's
equations with an undetermined cosmological constant (which arises as an
integration constant). More generally, if P_{ab}^{cd} is allowed to depend on
both metric and curvature in a polynomial form, one recovers the
Lanczos-Lovelock gravity. In all these cases: (a) We only need to extremise the
entropy associated with the null surfaces; the metric is not a dynamical
variable in this approach. (b) The extremal value of the entropy agrees with
standard results, when evaluated on-shell for a solution admitting a horizon.
The role of full quantum theory of gravity will be to provide the specific form
of P_{ab}^{cd} which should be used in the entropy functional. With such an
interpretation, it seems reasonable to interpret the Lanczos-Lovelock type
terms as quantum corrections to classical gravity.

constrain the cosmological evolution of the Universe in a phase prior to
primordial nucleosyntesis, namely around the time of cold dark matter (CDM)

scenario, where the Hubble expansion rate is enhanced with respect to the
standard case, the CDM decoupling is anticipated and the relic abundance of a
given dark matter (DM) candidate enhanced. This implies that the present amount
of CDM in the Universe may be explained by a Weakly Interacting Massive
Particle (WIMP) which possesses annihilation cross section (much) larger than
in standard cosmology. This enhanced annihilation implies larger fluxes of
indirect detection signals of CDM. We show that the HESS measurements can set
bounds for WIMPs heavier than a few hundreds of GeV, depending on the actual DM
halo profile. These results are complementary to those obtained in a previous
analysis based on cosmic antiprotons. For a Moore DM profile, $\gamma$--ray
data limit the maximal Hubble rate enhancement to be below a factor of 100.
Moreover, a WIMP heavier than 1 TeV is not compatible with a cosmological
scenario with enhanced expansion rate prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN).

BESIII can measure the coupling among U-boson and electron-positron $g_{eR}$

out exactly, which yields insight into what happens in less tractable

a circular cylindrical delta-function background. This situation is quite
similar to that of a spherical delta-function background. The local energy
density in these cases diverges as the surface of the background is approached,
but these divergences are integrable. The total energy is finite in strong
coupling, but in weak coupling a divergence occurs in third order. This
universal feature is shown to reflect a divergence in the energy associated
with the surface, the integrated local energy density within the shell itself,
which surface energy should be removable by a process of renormalization.

Theory in a magnetic field. Here we address the low-temperature regime, and
develop quantitative approach based on the idea (originally due to McCoy and
Wu) of particles being the ""mesons"", consisting predominantly of two quarks
confined by a long-range force. Systematic implementation of this idea leads to
a version of the Bethe-Salpeter equation, which yields infinite sequence of
meson masses. The Bethe-Salpeter spectrum becomes exact in the limit when the
magnetic field is small, and we develop the corresponding weak-coupling
expansions of the meson masses. The Bethe-Salpeter equation ignores the
contributions from the multi-quark components of the meson's states, but we
discuss how it can be improved by treating these components perturbatively, and
in particular by incorporating the radiative corrections to the quark mass and
the coupling parameter (the ""string tension""). The approach fails to properly
treat the mesons above the stability threshold, where they are expected to
become resonance states, but it is shown to yield very good approximation for
the masses of all stable particles, at all real values of the IFT parameters in
the low-temperature regime. We briefly discuss how the Bethe-Salpeter
approximation can be used to address the case of complex parameters, which was
the main motivation of this work.

modeling which nowadays appears in many areas and is key to various scientific
discoveries. For problems of large scale or dimensionality $p$, estimation
accuracy and computational cost are two top concerns. In a recent paper, Candes
and Tao (2007) propose the Dantzig selector using $L_1$ regularization and show
that it achieves the ideal risk up to a logarithmic factor $\log p$. Their
innovative procedure and remarkable result are challenged when the
dimensionality is ultra high as the factor $\log p$ can be large and their
uniform uncertainty principle can fail.
  Motivated by these concerns, we introduce the concept of sure screening and
propose a sure screening method based on a correlation learning, called the
Sure Independence Screening (SIS), to reduce dimensionality from high to a
moderate scale that is below sample size. In a fairly general asymptotic
framework, the correlation learning is shown to have the sure screening
property for even exponentially growing dimensionality. As a methodological
extension, an iterative SIS (ISIS) is also proposed to enhance its finite
sample performance. With dimension reduced accurately from high to below sample
size, variable selection can be improved on both speed and accuracy, and can
then be accomplished by a well-developed method such as the SCAD, Dantzig
selector, Lasso, or adaptive Lasso. The connections of these penalized
least-squares methods are also elucidated.

curve singularities in arbitrary characteristic. We study equisingular
deformations of the parametrization and of the equation and show that the base
space of its semiuniveral deformation is smooth in both cases. Our approach
through deformations of the parametrization is elementary and we show that
equisingular deformations of the parametrization form a linear subfunctor of
all deformations of the parametrization. This gives additional information,
even in characteristic zero, the case which was treated by J. Wahl. The methods
and proofs extend easily to good characteristic, that is, when the
characteristic does not divide the multiplicity of any branch of the
singularity.
  In bad characteristic, however, new phenomena occur and we are naturally led
to consider weakly trivial respectively weakly equisingular deformations, that
is, those which become trivial respectively equisingular after a finite and
dominant base change. The semiuniversal base space for weakly equisingular
deformations is, in general, not smooth but becomes smooth after a finite and
purely inseparable base extension. For the proof of this fact we introduce some
constructions which may have further applications in the theory of
singularities in positive characteristic.

statistical problems, it is not uncommon to apply hypothesis tests in a highly
simultaneous way. The number, $\nu$ say, of tests used can be much larger than
the sample sizes, $n$, to which the tests are applied, yet we wish to calibrate
the tests so that the overall level of the simultaneous test is accurate. Often
the sampling distribution is quite different for each test, so there may not be
an opportunity for combining data across samples. In this setting, how large
can $\nu$ be, as a function of $n$, before level accuracy becomes poor? In the
present paper we answer this question in cases where the statistic under test
is of Student's $t$ type. We show that if either Normal or Student's $t$
distribution is used for calibration then the level of the simultaneous test is
accurate provided $\log\nu$ increases at a strictly slower rate than $n^{1/3}$
as $n$ diverges. On the other hand, if bootstrap methods are used for
calibration then we may choose $\log\nu$ almost as large as $n\half$ and still
achieve asymptotic level accuracy.
  The implications of these results are explored both theoretically and
numerically.

experimentally accessible parameters (none adjustable). Careful experimental
tests of the MDSA theory, undertaken at two laboratories, with very different
setups, are described. A detailed description is given of the procedures
employed to measure laser beam waist, local beam power at the transparent
microspheres trapped by the tweezers, microsphere radius and the trap
transverse stiffness, as a function of radius and height in the (inverted
microscope) sample chamber. We find generally very good agreement with MDSA
theory predictions, for a wide size range, from the Rayleigh domain to large
radii, including the values most often employed in practice, and at different
chamber heights, both with objective overfilling and underfilling. The results
asymptotically approach geometrical optics in the mean over size intervals, as
they should, and this already happens for size parameters not much larger than
unity. MDSA predictions for the trapping threshold, position of stiffness peak,
stiffness variation with height, multiple equilibrium points and `hopping'
effects among them are verified. Remaining discrepancies are ascribed to focus
degradation, possibly arising from objective aberrations in the infrared, not

for the power radiated by a point charge and the Abraham-Lorentz equation and
find that for well-behaved external forces acting for finite times, the charge
does not radiate in time intervals where there is preacceleration. That is, for
these forces preradiation does not exist even though the charge is
preaccelerated. The radiative energy is emitted only in time intervals when the
external force acts on the charge.

discrete, identical pulses termed action potentials or spikes. There is
persistent controversy about the extent to which the precise timing of these
spikes is relevant to the function of the brain. We revisit this issue, using
the motion-sensitive neurons of the fly visual system as a test case. New
experimental methods allow us to deliver more nearly natural visual stimuli,
comparable to those which flies encounter in free, acrobatic flight, and new
mathematical methods allow us to draw more reliable conclusions about the
information content of neural responses even when the set of possible responses
is very large. We find that significant amounts of visual information are
represented by details of the spike train at millisecond and sub-millisecond
precision, even though the sensory input has a correlation time of ~60ms;
different patterns of spike timing represent distinct motion trajectories, and
the absolute timing of spikes points to particular features of these
trajectories with high precision. Under these naturalistic conditions, the
system continues to transmit more information at higher photon flux, even
though individual photoreceptors are counting more than one million photons per
second, and removes redundancy in the stimulus to generate a more efficient
neural code.

class of gene regulatory factors that negatively regulate expression of
approximately one-third of the genes in animal genomes at post-transcriptional
level. However, it is still unclear why some genes are regulated by miRNAs but
others are not, i.e. what principles govern miRNA regulation in animal genomes.
In this study, we systematically analyzed the relationship between
transcription factors (TFs) and miRNAs in gene regulation. We found that the
genes with more TF-binding sites have a higher probability of being targeted by
miRNAs and have more miRNA-binding sites on average. This observation reveals
that the genes with higher cis-regulation complexity are more coordinately
regulated by TFs at the transcriptional level and by miRNAs at the
post-transcriptional level. This is a potentially novel discovery of mechanism
for coordinated regulation of gene expression. Gene ontology analysis further
demonstrated that such coordinated regulation is more popular in the
developmental genes.

that the then-new theory should not be considered final because they believed
it incapable of describing physical reality. The epic battle between Einstein
and Bohr intensified following the latter's response later the same year. Three
decades elapsed before John S. Bell gave a devastating proof that the EPR
argument was fatally flawed. The modest purpose of our paper is to give a
critical analysis of the original EPR paper and point out its logical
shortcomings in a way that could have been done 70 years ago, with no need to
wait for Bell's theorem. We also present an overview of Bohr's response in the
