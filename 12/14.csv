3608, are studied by means of integral-field spectroscopy. The kinematically
distinct areas in the centers of these galaxies, with radii of 6"" and 5""
respectively, are found also to be chemically distinct. These stellar
structures are characterized by enhanced magnesium-line strength in the
integrated spectra. However, we have not found any mean stellar age differences
between the decoupled cores and their outskirts. Analysis of the
two-dimensional line-of-sight velocity fields reveals systematic turns of the
kinematical major axes near the nuclei of both galaxies; in NGC 3608 the
ionized gas rotates in the orthogonal plane with respect to the stellar
component rotation. By taking into account some morphological features, we
conclude that both NGC 3607 and NGC 3608 have large triaxial stellar spheroids.
We argue that the magnesium-enhanced cores are not circumnuclear disks; instead
they resemble rather compact triaxial structures which may be a cause of
formation of polar disks around them - a gaseous one in NGC 3608 and a
stellar-gaseous one in NGC 3607. In the latter galaxy the star formation is
perhaps still proceeding over the polar disk.

luminosity ranges (L(0.5-8.0keV) = 10^(42.5-43.5) erg/s) show a mix of
different source types, with the absorbed objects in the majority. At the faint
flux limit of the CDF-N, a substantial fraction of the sources are identified
as star-forming galaxies. The AGN in the sample can be divided into four
classes based on their rest frame SEDs: luminous, unabsorbed QSOs; objects with
reddened optical spectra and X-ray absorption; X-ray absorbed AGN with no signs
of reddening in the optical spectra; and optically reddened sources with X-ray
spectra indicative of obscuration. We argue that the AGN of higher luminosity
tend to have a lower X-ray absorbing column density, but the ratio of X-ray
absorbed to unabsorbed AGN remains constant with redshift. We find that the
relations between UV and X-ray luminosities derived by Strateva et al. (2005)
and Steffen et al.(2006) only hold for bright sources, and break down when
faint objects in the sample are included.This is only partly owing to the fact
that the majority of the faint sources are absorbed; several faint sources must
also have intrinsically lower X-ray luminosity. A fit to the NIR-optical-UV
broadband SEDs of the AGN allows us to constrain the absorption parameters
independently from the X-ray analyses. We show that the N_H values derived by
the X-ray and optical methods are not correlated.This may be because the X-ray
absorption and optical attenuation do not originate at the same location,
and/or the dust properties responsible for the optical attenuation in AGNs are
very different from the locally known dust properties. (abridged)

the black hole and the structure of the accretion disk in the region of the
last stable orbit. We investigate these dependencies using two different
physical models for the jet power: the classical Blandford-Znajek (BZ) model
and a hybrid model developed by Meier. In the BZ case, the jets are powered by
magnetic fields directly threading the spinning black hole while in the hybrid
model, the jet energy is extracted from both the accretion disk as well as the
black hole via magnetic fields anchored to the accretion flow inside and
outside the hole's ergosphere. The hybrid model takes advantage of the
strengths of both the Blandford-Payne and BZ mechanisms, while avoiding the
more controversial features of the latter. We develop these models more fully
to account for general relativistic effects and to focus on advection-dominated
accretion flows (ADAF) for which the jet power is expected to be a significant
fraction of the accreted rest mass energy.
  We apply the models to elliptical galaxies, in order to see if these models
can explain the observed correlation between the Bondi accretion rates and the
total jet powers. For typical values of the disk viscosity parameter
alpha~0.04-0.3 and mass accretion rates consistent with ADAF model
expectations, we find that the observed correlation requires j>0.9; i.e., it
implies that the black holes are rapidly spinning. Our results suggest that the
central black holes in the cores of clusters of galaxies must be rapidly
rotating in order to drive jets powerful enough to heat the intracluster medium
and quench cooling flows.

PIN provides sub-keV energy resolution while the CZT reveals ~1.7 keV energy
resolution throughout the energy range. The high sensitivity and sub-keV energy
resolution of the Si PIN detector allows measuring the intensity, peak energy,
and the equivalent width of the Fe-line complex at approximately 6.7 keV as a
function of time in all ten M-class flares studied in this investigation. The
peak energy (Ep) of the Fe-line feature varies between 6.4 and 6.7 keV with
increasing in temperature from 9 to 58 MK. We found that the equivalent width
(w) of the Fe-line feature increases exponentially with temperature up to 30 MK

the temperature range of 30 - 45 MK. We compare our measurements of w with
calculations made earlier by various investigators and propose that these
measurements may improve theoretical models. We interpret the variation of both
Ep and w with temperature as due to the changes in the ionization and
recombination conditions in the plasma during the flare interval and as a
consequence the contribution from different ionic emission lines also varies.

function of distance along three supercluster filaments, each joining pairs of
rich clusters, in the Pisces-Cetus supercluster, which is part of the 2dFGRS.
We find that even though there is a steady decline in the rate of star
formation, as well as in the fraction of star forming galaxies, as one
approaches the core of a cluster at an extremity of such a filament, there is
an increased activity of star formation in a narrow distance range between
3-4/h_70 Mpc, which is 1.5-2 times the virial radius of the clusters involved.
This peak in star formation is seen to be entirely due to the dwarf galaxies
(-20<M_B<-17.5). The position of the peak does not seem to depend on the
velocity dispersion of the nearest cluster, undermining the importance of the
gravitational effect of the clusters involved. We find that this enhancement in
star formation occurs at the same place for galaxies which belong to groups
within these filaments, while group members elsewhere in the 2dFGRS do not show
this effect. We conclude that the most likely mechanism for this enhanced star
formation is galaxy-galaxy harassment, in the crowded infall region of rich
clusters at the extremities of filaments, which induces a burst of star
formation in galaxies, before they have been stripped of their gas in the
denser cores of clusters. The effects of strangulation in the cores of
clusters, as well as excess star formation in the infall regions along the
filaments, are more pronounced in dwarfs since they more vulnerable to the
effects of strangulation and harassment than giant galaxies.

surface brightness since z=1. Based on the detection limits of GOODS this can
not be explained by incompleteness in low surface-brightness galaxies. Number
density arguments rule out a pure radius evolution. It can be explained by a
radius dependent decline in B-band luminosity with time. Assuming a linear
shift in M_B with z, we use a maximum likelihood method to quantify the
evolution. Under these assumptions, large (R_{1/2} > 5 kpc), and intermediate
sized (3 < R_{1/2} < 5 kpc) galaxies, have experienced Delta M_B =1.53
(-0.10,+0.13) and 1.65 (-0.18, +0.08) magnitudes of dimming since z=1. A simple
exponential decline in star formation with an e-folding time of 3 Gyr can
result in this amount of dimming. Meanwhile, small galaxies, or some subset
thereof, have experienced more evolution, 2.55 (+/- 0.38) magnitudes. This
factor of ten decline in luminosity can be explained by sub-samples of
starbursting dwarf systems that fade rapidly, coupled with a decline in burst
strength or frequency. Samples of bursting, luminous, blue, compact galaxies at
intermediate redshifts have been identified by various previous studies. If
there has been some growth in galaxy size with time, these measurements are

shape of the acoustic spectrum. So the height of the top boundary can be used
for controlling a damping rate without distortion of the acoustic spectrum. The
developed simulations provide an important tool for testing local
helioseismology.

nearby low-mass dense cores from the infrared to the millimeter. We present
maps of 52 cores at 350 microns and three cores at 450 microns, two of which
were observed at both wavelengths. Of these 52 cores, 41 were detected by
SHARC-II: 32 contained one submillimeter source while 9 contained multiple
sources. For each submillimeter source detected, we report various source
properties including source position, fluxes in various apertures, size, aspect
ratio, and position angle. For the 12 cores that were not detected we present
upper limits. The sources detected by SHARC-II have, on average, smaller sizes
at the 2sigma contours than those derived from longer-wavelength bolometer
observations. We conclude that this is not caused by a failure to integrate
long enough to detect the full extent of the core; instead it arises primarily
from the fact that the observations presented in this survey are insensitive to
smoothly varying extended emission. We find that SHARC-II observations of
low-mass cores are much better suited to distinguishing between starless and
protostellar cores than observations at longer wavelengths. Very Low Luminosity
Objects, a new class of objects being discovered by the Spitzer Space Telescope
in cores previously classified as starless, look very similar at 350 microns to
other cores with more luminous protostars.

galaxy (M31) by comparing its multicolor photometry with theoretical stellar
population synthesis models. This is both a check on the age of this globular
cluster, as well a check on our methodology. Main-sequence photometry has been
the most direct method for determining the age of a star cluster. S312 was
observed as part of the Beijing-Arizona-Taiwan-Connecticut (BATC) Multicolor
Sky Survey from 1995 February to 2003 December. The photometry of BATC images
for S312 was taken with 9 intermediate-band filters covering 5000-10000\AA.
Combined with photometry in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) of {\sl GALEX},
broad-band $UBVR$ and infrared $JHK_s$ of 2MASS, we obtained the accurate
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of S312 from 2267-20000\AA. A quantitative
comparison to simple stellar population models yields an age of
$9.5_{-0.99}^{+1.15}$ Gyr, which is in very good agreement with the previous
determination by main-sequence photometry. S312 has a mass of
$9.8\pm{1.85}\times 10^5 \rm M_\odot$, and is a medium-mass globular cluster in
M31. By analysis of errors of ages determined based on the SED fitting method
of this paper, secure age constraints are derived with errors of $< 3$ Gyr for
ages younger than 9 Gyr. In fact, the theoretical SEDs are not sensitive to the
variation of age for ages greater than $\sim 10$ Gyr. Therefore, for globular
clusters as old as the majority of the Galactic GCs, our method do not
distinguish them accurately. We emphasize that our results show that even with
multiband photometry spanning NUV to $K_s$, our age constraints from SED
fitting are distressingly uncertain, which has implications for age derivations
in extragalactic globular cluster systems.

or density profile. Our procedure makes {\bf no} {\it a priori} selection on
galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED, for example the Red Sequence),
enabling an unbiased investigation of environmental effects on galaxy
evolution. The COSMOS photometric redshift catalog yields a sample of
$1.5\times10^5$ galaxies with redshift accuracy, $\Delta z_{FWHM}/(1+z) \leq
0.1$ at z $< 1.1$ down to I$_{AB} \leq 25$ mag. Using this sample of galaxies,

epsilon = exp(-E/kT), where E is the related energy barrier. In the partially
reversible model, dissociation is limited to islands of size larger than a
critical value i, while in the completely reversible model there is no
restriction to that process (infinite i). Extending previous simulation results
for the completely reversible case, we observe that a peaked island size
distribution in the intermediate time regime, in which the mean island size is
increasing, crosses over to the theoretically predicted exponentially
decreasing distribution at long times. It contrasts with the partially
reversible model, in which peaked distributions are obtained until the long
time frozen state, which is attained with a crossover time $\tau \sim
\frac{i^3}{\epsilon}$. The mean island size at saturation varies as
$S_{sat}\approx 2i+C\epsilon$ (C constant), while the completely reversible

is studied by using the Bethe Ansatz technique. From the properties of the
algebra generated by the local jump operators, we explicitly construct the
hierarchy of operators (called generalized hamiltonians) that commute with the
Markov operator. The transfer matrix, which is the generating function of these
operators, is shown to represent a discrete Markov process with long-range
jumps. We give a general combinatorial formula for the connected hamiltonians
obtained by taking the logarithm of the transfer matrix. This formula is proved
using a symbolic calculation program for the first ten connected operators.

unique in that unconventional hybrid devices can be realized with unprecedented
control, including real-time tunable tunnel resistances. A grid of Au discs, 30
nm in diameter and 30 nm thick, is prepared on a SiO2 surface by conventional
e-beam writing. Subsequently, 30 nm thick ferromagnetic Ni source, drain and
side-gate electrodes are formed in similar process steps. The width and length
of the source and drain electrodes were different to exhibit different coercive
switching fields. Tunnel barriers of NiO are realized by sequential Ar and O2
plasma treatment. Using an atomic force microscope with specially designed
software, a single non-magnetic Au nanodisc is positioned into the 25 nm gap
between the source and drain electrodes. The resistance of the device is
monitored in real-time while the Au disc is manipulated step-by-step with
Angstrom-level precision. Transport measurements in magnetic field at 1.7 K
reveal no clear spin accumulation in the device, which can be attributed to
fast spin relaxation in the Au disc. From numerical simulations using the
rate-equation approach of orthodox Coulomb blockade theory, we can put an upper
bound of a few ns on the spin-relaxation time for electrons in the Au disc. To
confirm the magnetic switching characteristics and spin injection efficiency of
the Ni electrodes, we fabricated a test structure consisting of a Ni/NiO/Ni
magnetic tunnel junction with asymmetric dimensions of the electrodes similar
to those of the SETs. Magnetoresistance measurements on the test device
exhibited clear signs of magnetic reversal and a maximum TMR of 10%, from which
we deduced a spin-polarization of about 22% in the Ni electrodes.

The created antineutrinos (neutrinos) should be violently ejected outside the
horizon of a black hole composed from matter (antimatter). Our rudimentary
calculations suggest that both, the supermassive black hole in the centre of
our Galaxy and in the centre of the Andromeda Galaxy may produce a flux of
antineutrinos measurable with the new generation of one cubic kilometre
neutrino telescopes. In addition, we suggest two signatures of antigravity in
the case of microscopic black holes which may be eventually produced at CERN:
the decay products should exhibit a strong matter-antimatter asymmetry and the
Hawking radiation should not be the main mechanism for decay.

form of the first law of thermodynamics both at event horizon of static
spherically symmetric black holes and apparent horizon of
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe, which indicates intrinsic
thermodynamic properties of spacetime horizon. In the present paper we deal
with the so-called $f(R)$ gravity, whose action is a function of the curvature
scalar $R$. In the setup of static spherically symmetric black hole spacetime,
we find that at the event horizon, the field equations of $f(R)$ gravity can be
written into a form $dE = TdS - PdV + Td\bar{S}$, where $T$ is the Hawking
temperature and $S=Af'(R)/4G$ is the horizon entropy of the black hole, $E$ is
the horizon energy of the black hole, $P$ is the radial pressure of matter, $V$
is the volume of black hole horizon, and $d\bar S$ can be interpreted as the
entropy production term due to nonequilibrium thermodynamics of spacetime. In
the setup of FRW universe, the field equations can also be cast to a similar
form, $dE=TdS +WdV +Td\bar S$, at the apparent horizon, where $W=(\rho-P)/2$,
$E$ is the energy of perfect fluid with energy density $\rho$ and pressure $P$
inside the apparent horizon. Compared to the case of Einstein's general
relativity, an additional term $d\bar S$ also appears here. The appearance of
the additional term is consistent with the argument recently given by Eling
{\it et al.} (gr-qc/0602001) that the horizon thermodynamics is non-equilibrium
one for the $f(R)$ gravity.

a new search method based on frequency annealing which leads to a more rapid

examine the posterior distribution exploration using a 7-D MCMC algorithm. We
demonstrate that this method is effective in dealing with the high correlations
between parameters, has a higher acceptance rate than previously proposed
methods and produces posterior distribution functions that are close to the
prediction from the Fisher Information matrix. Finally, after carrying out
searches where there is only one binary in the data stream, we examine the case
where two black hole binaries are present in the same data stream. We
demonstrate that our search algorithm can accurately recover both binaries, and
more importantly showing that we can safely extract the MBHB sources without

for the possibility that the plasma may be moving with some collective flow
velocity as is the case in heavy ion collisions. We obtain the N=4 SYM values
of the jet quenching parameter $\hat q$, which describes the energy loss of a
hard parton in QCD, and of the velocity-dependence of the quark-antiquark
screening length for a moving dipole as a function of the angle between its
velocity and its orientation. We show that if the quark-gluon plasma is flowing

gamma_f(1-v_f cos theta), and show that this result applies in QCD as in N=4

well under way at the Tevatron. As the integrated luminosity collected
increases into the multiple inverse femptobarn range, these searches are
becoming very interesting indeed. Meanwhile, the construction of the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) and its associated experiments at CERN are nearing
completion. In this TeV4LHC workshop, it was realized that any experience at
the Tevatron with respect to backgrounds, experimental techniques and
theoretical calculations that can be verified at the Tevatron which have
relevance for future measurements at the LHC were important. Studies and
contributions to these efforts were made in three broad categories: theoretical
calculations of Higgs production and decay mechanisms; theoretical calculations
and discussions pertaining to non-standard model Higgs bosons; and experimental
reviews, analyses and developments at both the Tevatron and the upcoming LHC
experiments. All of these contributions represent real progress towards the
elucidation of the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking.

differ moderately from previous computations in the literature, and lead to an
absolute upper bound on the mixing angles of the dark matter sterile neutrino.

that the Dodelson-Widrow scenario, which proposes sterile neutrinos generated
by active-sterile neutrino transitions to be the sole source of dark matter, is
only possible for sterile neutrino masses lighter than 3.5 keV (6 keV if all
hadronic uncertainties are pushed in one direction and the most stringent X-ray
bounds are relaxed by a factor of two). This upper bound may conflict with a
lower bound from structure formation, but a definitive conclusion necessitates
numerical simulations with the non-equilibrium momentum distribution function

bound on the sterile neutrino mass can be established.

type IIB flux backgrounds based on warped products of the deformed conifold and

arguments based on kappa-symmetry and the equations of motion that identify the

Furthermore, we investigate its coupling to the pseudoscalar and scalar modes
associated with the phase and magnitude, respectively, of the baryon
expectation value. We find that these massless modes perturb the
Dirac-Born-Infeld and Chern-Simons terms of the D5-brane action in a way
consistent with our identification of the baryonic condensates. We match the
scaling dimension of the baryon operators computed from the D5-brane action

evaluate an expression that describes the variation of the baryon expectation

includes all the possible gaugings of all N=2 Maxwell-Einstein supergravity
theories whose scalar manifolds are symmetric spaces. In general, the scalar
potential gets contributions from R-symmetry gauging, tensor couplings and
hyper-couplings. We show that the coupling of a hypermultiplet into a theory
whose potential has a non-zero value at its critical point, and gauging a
compact subgroup of the hyperscalar isometry group will only rescale the value
of the potential at the critical point by a positive factor, and therefore will
not change the nature of an existing critical point. However this is not the
case for non-compact SO(1,1) gaugings. An SO(1,1) gauging of the hyper isometry
will generally lead to deSitter vacua, which is analogous to the ground states
found by simultaneously gauging SO(1,1) symmetry of the real scalar manifold
with U(1)_R in earlier literature. SO(m,1) gaugings with m>1, which give
contributions to the scalar potential only in the Magical Jordan family
theories, on the other hand, do not lead to deSitter vacua. Anti-deSitter vacua
are generically obtained when the U(1)_R symmetry is gauged. We also show that

interconnected nonlinear dynamic systems. Standard approaches often require
that the invariant sets be uniformly attracting. e.g. stable in the Lyapunov
sense. This, however, is neither a necessary requirement, nor is it always
useful. Systems may, for instance, be inherently unstable (e.g. intermittent,
itinerant, meta-stable) or the problem statement may include requirements that
cannot be satisfied with stable solutions. This is often the case in general
optimization problems and in nonlinear parameter identification or adaptation.
Conventional techniques for these cases rely either on detailed knowledge of
the system's vector-fields or require boundeness of its states. The presently
proposed method relies only on estimates of the input-output maps and
steady-state characteristics. The method requires the possibility of
representing the system as an interconnection of a stable, contracting, and an
unstable, exploratory part. We illustrate with examples how the method can be
applied to problems of analyzing the asymptotic behavior of locally unstable
systems as well as to problems of parameter identification and adaptation in
the presence of nonlinear parametrizations. The relation of our results to
conventional small-gain theorems is discussed.

point of the paper is to view \SNL as a (nearest) Euclidean Distance Matrix,
\EDM, completion problem and to show the advantages for using this latter, well
studied model. We first show that the current popular \SDP relaxation is
equivalent to known relaxations in the literature for \EDM completions. The
existence of anchors in the problem is {\em not} special. The set of anchors
simply corresponds to a given fixed clique for the graph of the \EDM problem.
We next propose a method of projection when a large clique or a dense subgraph
is identified in the underlying graph. This projection reduces the size, and
improves the stability, of the relaxation. In addition, viewing the problem as
an \EDM completion problem yields better low rank approximations for the low
dimensional realizations. And, the projection/reduction procedure can be
repeated for other given cliques of sensors or for sets of sensors, where many
distances are known. Thus, further size reduction can be obtained.
Optimality/duality conditions and a primal-dual interior-exterior path
following algorithm are derived for the \SDP relaxations We discuss the
relative stability and strength of two formulations and the corresponding
algorithms that are used. In particular, we show that the quadratic formulation

form, that is used in the literature and that arises from applying a Schur

non-intersecting Brownian motions on the real line, when the number of
particles becomes large.
  Consider 2k non-intersecting Brownian motions, all starting at the origin,
such that the k left paths end up at -a and the k right paths end up at +a at
time t=1. The Karlin-McGregor formula enables one to express the transition
probability in terms of a matrix model, consisting of Gaussian Hermitian random
matrices in a chain with external source. It is shown that the log of the
probability for this model satisfies a fourth order PDE with a quartic
non-linearity, obtained by means of the 3-component KP hierarchy and Virasoro
constraints.
  When the number of particles grows very large, the particles will be
concentrated on two intervals near t=0 and on one interval near t=1. The
Pearcey process is the infinite-dimensional diffusion, near the critical
transition from two to one interval. An appropriate scaling limit of the PDE
for the finite model leads to a non-linear PDE for the multi-time transition
probabilities of the Pearcey process.
  We conjecture that each of the Markov clouds (like the Pearcey process)
arising near phase transitions is related to some integrable system. Moreover,
there is an intimate connection between the integrable system and the
associated Riemann-Hilbert problem.

consistent way. The phonons give rise to a fragmentation of the single-particle
strength and to a compression of the single-particle spectrum. Both effects are
crucial for a quantitative understanding of nuclear structure properties. We
demonstrate the effects on the electric dipole states in $^{208}$Pb (which
possesses 50% more neutrons then protons) where we calculated the low-lying
non-collective spectrum as well as the high-lying collective resonances. Below
8 MeV, where one expects the so called isovector pygmy resonances, we also find
a strong admixture of isoscalar strength that comes from the coupling to the
high-lying isoscalar electric dipole resonance, which we obtain at about 22
MeV. The transition density of this resonance is very similar to the breathing
mode, which we also calculated. We shall show that the extended theory is the
correct approach for self-consistent calculations, where one starts with
effective Lagrangians and effective Hamiltonians, respectively, if one wishes
to describe simultaneously collective and non-collective properties of the
nuclear spectrum. In all cases for which experimental data exist the agreement

the role of distribution which, in some sense, ""connects"" the total 4-momenta
of the annihilating and outgoing particles. The difference between the c.m.s.
velocities attributed to annihilating and outgoing particles is a particular
consequence of this replacement and results in the appearance of a new factor
in the formula for the lepton pair production rate. We obtained that the

obtain a growth of the rate for the invariant masses below two masses of the

quartic with critical n-values for phases 90 and 180 degrees: phase 90 refers
to circular H polarization (chiral behavior); phase 180 to linear H
polarization and inversion on the Coulomb field axis. These signatures probe H
polarization with 2 natural, mutually exclusive hydrogen quantum states +1 and

angles or phases, hidden in de Broglie's standing wave equation, which derives
from Compton's early experiments with sinusoidal wavelength shifts. Positive
pressures in the matter well (H) become negative in the antimatter well

Submitted to Neural Computation",,,,"q-bio.NC physics.bio-ph physics.data-an",,"  White noise methods are a powerful tool for characterizing the computation
performed by neural systems. These methods allow one to identify the feature or
features that a neural system extracts from a complex input, and to determine
how these features are combined to drive the system's spiking response. These
methods have also been applied to characterize the input/output relations of
single neurons driven by synaptic inputs, simulated by direct current
injection. To interpret the results of white noise analysis of single neurons,
we would like to understand how the obtained feature space of a single neuron
maps onto the biophysical properties of the membrane, in particular the
dynamics of ion channels. Here, through analysis of a simple dynamical model
neuron, we draw explicit connections between the output of a white noise
analysis and the underlying dynamical system. We find that under certain
assumptions, the form of the relevant features is well defined by the
parameters of the dynamical system. Further, we show that under some
conditions, the feature space is spanned by the spike-triggered average and its
successive order time derivatives.

from those of cycle completion in enzyme kinetics. The reason is that a step is
only one of several transitions in the mechanochemical cycle. As a result,
theoretical results for cycle completion in enzyme kinetics do not apply to
stepping data. To allow correct parameter estimation, and to guide data
analysis and experiment design, a theoretical treatment is needed that takes
this observation into account. In this paper, we model the distribution of
dwell times and number of forward and backward steps using first passage
processes, based on the assumption that forward and backward steps correspond
to different directions of the same transition. We extend recent results for
systems with a single cycle and consider the full dwell time distributions as
well as models with multiple pathways, detectable substeps, and detachments.
Our main results are a symmetry relation for the dwell time distributions in
reversible motors, and a relation between certain relative step frequencies and
the free energy per cycle. We demonstrate our results by analyzing recent
stepping data for a bacterial flagellar motor, and discuss the implications for
the efficiency and reversibility of the force-generating subunits. Key words:
motor proteins; single molecule kinetics; enzyme kinetics; flagellar motor;
Markov process; non-equilibrium fluctuations.

numerical integration (in eight dimensions) on a computer. The measurement data
consist in absolute frequencies of the outcomes of N identical von Neumann
projective measurements performed on N identically prepared three-level
systems. Various small values of N as well as the large-N limit are considered.
Two kinds of prior knowledge are used: one represented by a plausibility
distribution constant in respect of the convex structure of the set of
statistical operators; the other represented by a Gaussian-like distribution
centred on a pure statistical operator, and thus reflecting a situation in
which one has useful prior knowledge about the likely preparation of the
system.
  In a companion paper the case of measurement data consisting in average
values, and an additional prior studied by Slater, are considered.

transform known as the Clebsch-Gordan transform over the Heisenberg group. This
gives a new representation theoretic explanation for the pretty-good
measurement derived algorithm for efficiently solving the Heisenberg hidden
subgroup problem and provides evidence that Clebsch-Gordan transforms over
finite groups are a new primitive in quantum algorithm design.

power spectrum is inversely proportional to, but is odd in frequency. It comes
from the connected part of the correlation function, and is related to the
temperature and external field corrections to the photon and charge carrier
propagators. In application to the case of a biased conducting sample, this
term gives rise to a contribution to the voltage power spectrum which is
proportional to the absolute system temperature, the charge carrier mobility,
the bias voltage squared, and a factor describing dependence of the noise
intensity on the sample geometry. It is verified that the derived expression is
in agreement with the experimental data on 1/f-noise measurements in metal

a quantum open subsystem are initially prepared in two types of states: the
product states and the Bell states. The bath, which consists of $N$ (in the

be treated effectively as two spin qubits embedded in a single mode cavity. The
time-evolution of the purity, z-component summation and the concurrence of the
central spins can be determined by a Laguerre polynomial scheme. It is found
that (i) at a low temperature, the uncoupled subsystem in a product state can
be entangled due to the interaction with bath, which is tested by the
Peres-Horodecki separability; however, at a high temperature, the bath produces
a stronger destroy effect on the purity and entanglement of the subsystem; (ii)
when the coupling strength between the two central spins is large, they are
protected strongly against the bath; (iii) when the interaction between the
subsystem and the bath is strong, the collapse of the two spin qubits from
