detectable Ly-alpha emission lines, we infer that the fraction of Ly-alpha
emitting LBGs with Ly-alpha equivalent widths greater than 20 Angstroms among
z~6 LBGs is ~30%, similar to that found at z~3. Every Ly-alpha emitting object
in our sample is compact with r <= 0.14"". Furthermore, all the Ly-alpha
emitting objects in our sample are more compact than average relative to the
observed size-magnitude relation of a large i-dropout sample (332 candidate z~6
objects). We can reject the hypothesis that the Ly-alpha emitting population is
a subset of the rest of the z~6 LBG population at >97% confidence. We speculate
the small sizes of Ly-alpha emitting LBGs are due to these objects being less
massive than other LBGs at z~6.

for O VI-rich gas. ROSAT observations of emission at 1/4 keV in the same

depending on the foreground extinction. Simulated supernova remnants evolving
in low density gas have similar O VI to X-ray ratios when the remnant plasma is
approaching collisional ioinizational equilibrium and the physical structures
are approaching dynamical ``middle age''. Alternatively, the plasma can be
described by a temperature power-law. Assuming that the material is
approximately isobaric and the length scales according to T^(beta) d(ln T), we
find beta = 1.5+/-0.6 and an upper temperature cutoff of 10^{6.6(+0.3,-0.2)} K.

knowledge of its high-resolution spectrum beyond the CVI line at 33.7 Angstroms
and suggest a new framework for the interpretation of the X-ray spectra of
single hot stars. All the lines are broad and asymmetric with similar velocity
profiles. X-rays probably originate in the wind's terminal velocity regime in
collisionless shocks controlled by magnetic fields rather than in cooling
shocks in the acceleration zone. During post-shock relaxation, exchange of
energy between ions and electrons is so slow that electron heating does not
take place before hot gas is quenched by the majority cool gas. The observed
plasma is not in equilibrium and the electron bremsstrahlung continuum is weak.
Charge exchange, ionization and excitation are likely to be produced by
protons. Fully thermalized post-shock velocities ensure high cross-sections and
account for the observed line widths, with some allowance probably necessary
for non-thermal particle acceleration. In general, the form of X-ray spectra in
both single and binary stars is likely to be determined principally by the
amount of post-shock electron heating: magnetically confined X-ray plasma in
binary systems can evolve further towards the higher electron temperatures of
equilibrium while in single stars this does not take place. The long mean-free
path for Coulomb energy exchange between fast-moving ions may also inhibit the
development of line-driven instabilities.

large-angle emission released during (the second pulse of) the burst. If the
optical and gamma-ray emissions of GRB 990123 have, indeed, the same origin
then their properties require that (i) the optical counterpart was synchrotron
emission and the gamma-rays arose from inverse-Compton scatterings
(""synchrotron self-Compton model""), (ii) the peak-energy of the

field behind the shock must have decayed on a length-scale of <1% of the
thickness of the shocked gas, which corresponds to 10^6-10^7 plasma
skin-depths. Consistency of the optical counterpart decay rate and its spectral
slope (or that of the burst, if they represent different spectral components)

velocity dispersion. A primary black hole of 4 million solar masses is placed
at the centre of the disc, while a secondary black hole is set initially on an
eccentric co-rotating orbit in the disc plane. Its mass is in a 1 to 1, 1 to 4,
and 1 to 10 ratio, relative to the primary. With this choice, we mimic the
dynamics of black hole pairs released in the nuclear region at the end of a
gas-rich galaxy merger. It is found that, under the action of dynamical
friction, the two black holes form a close binary in ~10 Myrs. The inspiral
process is insensitive to the mass fraction in stars and gas present in the
disc and is accompanied by the circularization of the orbit. We detail the
gaseous mass profile bound to each black hole that can lead to the formation of
two small Keplerian discs, weighing ~2 % of the black hole mass, and of size
~0.01 pc. The mass of the tightly (loosely) bound particles increases

Double AGN activity is expected to occur on an estimated timescale of ~10 Myrs,

lightcurve. The neon-22 abundance also changes the burning rate and hence the
laminar flame speed. We tabulate the flame speedup for different initial carbon
and neon-22 abundances and for a range of densities. This increase in the
laminar flame speed--about 30% for a neon-22 mass fraction of 6%--affects the
deflagration just after ignition near the center of the white dwarf, where the
laminar speed of the flame dominates over the buoyant rise, and in regions of
lower density ~ 10^7 g/cm3 where a transition to distributed burning is
conjectured to occur. The increase in flame speed will decrease the density of
any transition to distributed burning.

the equipotential surfaces may facilitate non-conservative mass transfer in
non-synchronous, eccentric binary star and planetary systems, especially if the
component stars or planets are rotating super-synchronously at the periastron
of their relative orbit. We also calculate the volume-equivalent radius of the
Roche lobe as a function of the four parameters mentioned above. Contrary to
common practice, we find that replacing the radius of a circular orbit in the
fitting formula of Eggleton (1983) with the instantaneous distance between the
components of eccentric binary or planetary systems does not always lead to a
good approximation to the volume-equivalent radius of the Roche-lobe. We
therefore provide generalized analytic fitting formulae for the
volume-equivalent Roche lobe radius appropriate for non-synchronous, eccentric
binary star and planetary systems. These formulae are accurate to better than
1% throughout the relevant 2-dimensional parameter space that covers a dynamic
range of 16 and 6 orders of magnitude in the two dimensions.

fluxes at high energies. Here, we perform such an analysis for the case of
antiprotons. We consider both standard sources as the collision of other cosmic
rays with interstellar matter, as well as exotic contributions from dark matter
annihilations in the galactic halo. Up to energies well above 100 GeV, we find
that the background flux in antiprotons is almost uniquely determined by the
existing low-energy data on various cosmic ray species; for even higher
energies, however, the uncertainties in the parameters of the underlying
propagation model eventually become significant. We also show that if the dark
matter is composed of particles with masses at the TeV scale, which is
naturally expected in extra-dimensional models as well as in certain parameter
regions of supersymmetric models, the annihilation flux can become comparable
to - or even dominate - the antiproton background at the high energies

black holes (SMBHs). The hierarchical merging of galaxies should therefore lead
to the formation of SMBH binaries. Merging of old massive galaxies with little
gas promotes the formation of low-density nuclei where SMBH binaries are
expected to survive over long times. If the binary lifetime exceeds the typical
time between mergers, then triple black hole (BH) systems may form. We study
the statistics of close triple-SMBH encounters in galactic nuclei by computing
a series of 3-body orbits with physically-motivated initial conditions
appropriate for giant elliptical galaxies. Our simulations include a smooth
background potential consisting of a stellar bulge plus a dark matter halo,
drag forces due to gravitational radiation and dynamical friction on the stars
and dark matter, and a simple model of the time evolution of the inner density
profile under heating and mass ejection by the SMBHs. We find that the binary
pair coalesces as a result of repeated close encounters in ~85% of our runs,
and in ~15% of cases a new eccentric binary forms from the third SMBH and
binary remnant and coalesces during the run time. In about 40% of the runs the
lightest BH is left wandering through the galactic halo or escapes the galaxy
altogether, but escape of all three SMBHs is exceedingly rare. The triple
systems typically scour out cores with mass deficits ~1-2 times their total
mass, which can help to account for the large cores observed in some massive
elliptical galaxies, such as M87. The high coalescence rate, prevalence of very
high-eccentricity orbits, and gravitational radiation ``spikes'' during close
encounters in our runs, may provide interesting signals for the future Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).

of SMGs. One of the matched SMGs is at z ~ 0.5 and has S_70/S_850 and S_70/S_24
ratios consistent with a cool galaxy. The second SMG (z = 1.2) has
infrared-submm colors which indicate it is more actively forming stars. We
examine the average 70 micron properties of the SMGs by performing a stacking

fit Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) to the far-infrared data points of the

that the average low-z SMG has a cooler dust temperature than local
ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) of similar luminosity and an SED which
is best fit by scaled up versions of normal spiral galaxies. The average low-z

The surface density profile of radio-loud AGNs is much more concentrated than
that of all galaxies, and can be described by the NFW profile with
concentration ~ 25. (2) A comparison of the RLFs in the clusters and in the
field shows that the cluster AGN number density is about 5,700 times higher,
corresponding to a factor of 6.8 higher probability of a galaxy being radio
active in the cluster than in the field. We suggest that about 40-50% of
radio-loud AGNs in clusters may reside in low mass galaxies (M_K>-23). (3) The
RAFs of cluster galaxies of different stellar mass are estimated. About 5% of
galaxies more luminous than the characteristic luminosity (M_K<M_*~-24) host
radio-loud AGNs. The RAF for BCGs is >30%, and depends on the cluster mass.
Compare to the field population, cluster galaxies have 5-10 times higher RAF.
Combining the AGN RLF and spatial distribution within clusters, we estimate
that they may inject an energy of ~0.13 keV per particle to the intracluster
medium near the cluster center. We also investigate the degree of contamination
by cluster radio sources on the yields of SZE cluster surveys, and estimate
that as many as 10% of clusters detected at 150 GHz may host AGNs whose flux is
comparable to the cluster SZE signal. (abridged)

to determine the type of a star tidally disrupted by a massive black hole. We
investigate these three events, focusing on the differences for the tidal
disruption of a giant star and a main sequence, resulted from their different
relation between the mass and the radius. We argue that their X-ray flare
properties could be modeled by the partial stripping of the outer layers of a
solar type star. The tidal disruption of a giant star is excluded completely.

combine this with age estimates and find 12 halo and 37 thick disk members

controversial debate. KPD 1930+2752 is one of the best SN Ia progenitor
candidates known today. The object is a double degenerate system consisting of
a subluminous B star and a massive white dwarf. Maxted et al. 2000 conclude
that the system mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar mass. This conclusion, however,
rests on the assumption that the sdB mass is 0.5 Mo. However, recent binary
population synthesis calculations suggest that the mass of an sdB star may
range from 0.3 Mo to more than 0.7 Mo. It is therefore important to measure the
mass of the sdB star simultaneously with that of the white dwarf. Since the
rotation of the sdB star is tidally locked to the orbit the inclination of the
system can be constrained. An analysis of the ellipsoidal variations in the
light curve allows to tighten the constraints derived from spectroscopy. We
derive the mass-radius relation for the sdB star from a quantitative spectral
analysis. The projected rotational velocity is determined for the first time
from high-resolution spectra. In addition a reanalysis of the published light
curve is performed. The atmospheric and orbital parameters are measured with
unprecedented accuracy. In particular the projected rotational velocity
vrotsini = 92.3 +/- 1.5 km/s is determined. The mass of the sdB is limited
between 0.45 Mo and 0.52 Mo. The total mass of the system ranges from 1.36 Mo
to 1.48 Mo and hence is likely to exceed the Chandrasekhar mass. So KPD
1930+2752 qualifies as an excellent double degenerate supernova Ia progenitor
candidate.

with multi-object spectroscopy, those spectrographs can behave as machines used
to derive physical parameters of galaxies during their formation process. Up to
now, there is only one available spectrograph with multiple integral field
units, e.g. FLAMES/GIRAFFE on the VLT. However, current ground based
instruments suffer from a degradation of their spatial resolution due to
atmospheric turbulence. In this article we describe the performance of FALCON,
an original concept of a new generation multi-object integral field
spectrograph with adaptive optics for the ESO Very Large Telescope. The goal of
FALCON is to combine high angular resolution (0.25 arcsec) and high spectral
resolution (R > 5000) in J and H bands over a wide field of view (10x10
arcmin2) in the VLT Nasmyth focal plane. However, instead of correcting the
whole field, FALCON will use multi-object adaptive optics (MOAO) to perform
locally on each scientific target the adaptive optics correction. This requires
then to use atmospheric tomography in order to use suitable natural guide stars
for wavefront sensing. We will show that merging MOAO and atmospheric
tomography allows us to determine the internal kinematics of distant galaxies
up to z=2 with a sky coverage of 50%, even for objects observed near the
galactic pole. The application of such a concept to Extremely Large Telescopes
seems therefore to be a very promising way to study galaxy evolution from z = 1

been affected by mass transfer in a binary system, at a range of metallicities.
As noted by other authors, the effect of such mass transfer is frequently more
than just rejuvenation. We find that, whilst stars with convective cores which
have accreted only H-rich matter rejuvenate as expected, those stars which have
accreted He-rich matter (for example at the end stages of conservative mass
transfer) evolve in a way that is qualitatively similar to rejuvenated stars of
much higher metallicity. Thus the effects of non-conservative evolution depend
strongly on whether He-rich matter is amongst the portion accreted or ejected.
This may lead to a significant divergence in binary evolution paths with only a
small difference in initial assumptions. We compare our models to observed
systems and find approximate formulae for the effect of mass accretion on the
effective age and metallicity of the resulting star.

(SN) 2005cs obtained by Swift's Ultraviolet-Optical and X-Ray Telescopes.
Observations started within two days of discovery and continued regularly for
three weeks. During this time the V-band magnitude remained essentially
constant, while the UV was initially bright but steadily faded until below the
brightness of an underlying UV-bright HII region. This UV decay is similar to
SNe II observed by the International Ultraviolet Explorer. UV grism spectra
show the P-Cygni absorption of MgII 2798A, indicating a photospheric origin of
the UV flux. Based on non-LTE model atmosphere calculations with the CMFGEN
code, we associate the rapid evolution of the UV flux with the cooling of the
ejecta, the peak of the spectral energy distribution (SED) shifting from ~700A
on June 30th to ~1200A on July 5th. Furthermore, the corresponding
recombination of the ejecta, e.g., the transition from FeIII to FeII, induces
considerable strengthening of metal line-blanketing at and above the
photosphere, blocking more effectively this fading UV flux. SN2005cs was not
detected in X-rays, and the upper limit to the X-ray luminosity yields a limit
to the mass loss rate of the progenitor of about 10^-5 solar masses per year.
Overall, Swift presents a unique opportunity to capture the early and fast
evolution of Type II SNe in the UV, providing additional constraints on the
reddening, the SED shortward of 4000A, and the ionization state and temperature
of the photon-decoupling regions.

The
systems addressed contain two (or more) almost parallel membranes that are
connected by harmonic tethers or by a continuous, harmonic confining potential.
Additionally, such a compound system can be attached to a supporting substrate.
We compare quasi-analytical results for tethers with analytical results for
corresponding continuous models and investigate under what circumstances the
discrete nature of the tethers actually influences the fluctuations. A
tethered, supported membrane pair with similar bending rigidities and stiff
tethers can possess a nonmonotonic fluctuation spectrum with a maximum. A
nonmonotonic spectrum with a maximum and a minimum can occur for an either free
or supported membrane pair of rather different bending rigidities and for stiff
tethers. Typical membrane displacements are calculated for supported membrane
pairs with discrete or continuous interacting potentials. Thereby an estimate
of how close the constituent two membranes and the substrate typically approach
each other is given. For a supported membrane pair with discrete or continuous
interactions, the typical displacements of each membrane are altered with
respect to a single supported membrane, where those of the membrane near the
substrate are diminished and those of the membrane further away are enhanced.

n-simplex fractal families. For GM, MSG and n-simplex lattices with odd values
of n, number of open HWs $Z_N$, for the lattice with $N\gg 1$ sites, varies as
$\omega^N N^\gamma$. We explicitly calculate exponent $\gamma$ for several
members of GM and MSG families, as well as for n-simplices with n=3,5, and 7.
For n-simplex fractals with even n we find different scaling form: $Z_N\sim
\omega^N \mu^{N^{1/d_f}}$, where $d_f$ is fractal dimension of the lattice,
which also differs from the formula expected for homogeneous lattices. We
discuss possible implications of our results on studies of real compact
polymers.

delta of the dot levels we find pi phase lapses between two transmission peaks
in an overwhelming part of the parameter space of the level-lead couplings. For
large delta the appearance or not of a phase lapse between resonances depends
on the relative sign of the level-lead couplings in analogy to the U=0 case. We
show that this generic scenario is the same for spin-polarized and
spin-degenerate dots. We emphasize that in contrast to dots with more levels,
for a two-level dot with small delta and generic dot-lead couplings (that is up
to cases with special symmetry) the ""universal"" phase lapse behavior is already
established at U=0. The most important effect of the Coulomb interaction is to
increase the separation of the transmission resonances. The relation of the
appearance of phase lapses to the inversion of the population of the dot levels

model by Edmonds et al (2000, 2003) in which the jobs go through a sequence of
different phases. Each phase consists of a certain quantity of work and a
speed-up function that models how it takes advantage of the number of
processors it receives. We consider the non-clairvoyant online setting where a
collection of jobs arrives at time 0. We consider the metrics setflowtime
introduced by Robert et al (2007). The goal is to minimize the sum of the
completion time of the sets, where a set is completed when all of its jobs are
done. If the input consists of a single set of jobs, this is simply the
makespan of the jobs; and if the input consists of a collection of singleton
sets, it is simply the flowtime of the jobs. We show that the non-clairvoyant

The resulting framework is then used to address a major challenge of quantum
cosmology: resolving the big-bang singularity while retaining agreement with
general relativity at large scales. It is shown that the framework fulfills
this task. In particular, for states which are semi-classical at some late
time, the big-bang is replaced by a quantum bounce and a recollapse occurs at
the value of the scale factor predicted by classical general relativity. Thus,
the `difficulties' pointed out by Green and Unruh in the k=1 case do not arise
in a more systematic treatment. As in k=0 models, quantum dynamics is
deterministic across the deep Planck regime. However, because it also retains
the classical recollapse, in contrast to the k=0 case one is now led to a
cyclic model. Finally, we clarify some issues raised by Laguna's recent work

grand unified theory with minimal scalar content and an extra adjoint
representation of fermions. We find strong correlation between the upper bound
on the mass of both the bosonic and fermionic SU(2) triplets and the cutoff.
The upper bound on the mass of fermionic triplet responsible for Type III
seesaw mechanism is 10^{2.1} GeV for the Planck scale cutoff. In that case both
the idea of grand unification and nature of seesaw mechanism could be tested at
future collider experiments through the production of those particles.
Moreover, the prediction for the proton decay lifetime is at most an order of
magnitude away from the present experimental limits. If the cutoff is lowered
these predictions change significantly. In the most general scenario, if one
does (not) neglect a freedom in the quark and lepton mixing angles, the upper

functional for immersed surfaces in ${\R}^m$. This new formulation of Willmore
equation appears to be of divergence form, moreover, the non-linearities are
made of jacobians. Additionally to that, if $\bH$ denotes the mean curvature
vector of the surface, this new form writes ${\mathcal L}\bH=0$ where
${\mathcal L}$ is a well defined locally invertible self-adjoint operator.
These 3 facts have numerous consequences in the analysis of Willmore surfaces.
One first consequence is that the long standing open problem to give a meaning
to the Willmore Euler-Lagrange equation for immersions having only $L^2$
bounded second fundamental form is now solved. We then establish the regularity
of weak $W^{2,p}-$Willmore surfaces for any $p$ for which the Gauss map is
continuous : $p>2$. This is based on the proof of an $\epsilon-$regularity
result for weak Willmore surfaces. We establish then a weak compactness result
for Willmore surfaces of energy less than $8\pi-\delta$ for every $\delta>0$.
This theorem is based on a point removability result we prove for Wilmore
surfaces in ${\R}^m$. This result extends to arbitrary codimension a result
that E.Kuwert and R.Schaetzle established for surfaces in ${\R}^3$. Finally, we
deduce from this point removability result the strong compactness, modulo the
M\""obius group action, of Willmore tori below the energy level $8\pi-\delta$ in
dimensions 3 and 4. The dimension 3 case was already solved in a previous work.

depending from the correlations of the bound nucleons. Two particle
correlations are responsible for the scattering of model particles either to

The three and higher order particle correlations do not play a role in the
latter calculation especially if the correlations induced by the scattering
operator are of sufficient short range. They modify however, via the long tail
of the nuclear potential, the Slater determinant of the A particles by
generating excited Slater's determinants. In this work the influence of the

based on magnification of the mass (mainly the mantle) mechanical resonance, in
addition to or instead of previously hypothesized causes. Here the use of raw
(gapped and unaltered) data is regarded as the criterion for a physical result
validity, so data were not altered in any way. Then analogously to the
atmospheric tidal forcing of global high frequency free oscillation, I propose
that the Moon synodically recurring pull could likewise drive the long-periodic
(12 to 120 minutes) oscillation of the Earth. To demonstrate this, I show that
the daily magnitudes of mass (gravity) oscillation, as a relative measure of
the non-stationary Earth kinetic energy, get synodically periodic while
correlating up to 0.97 with seismic energies on the day of shallow and 3 days
before deep earthquakes. The forced oscillator equations for the mantle usual
viscosity and the Earth springtide and grave mode periods successfully model an
identical 3 days phase. Finally, whereas reports on gravest earthquakes (of
around M9.5) put the maximum coseismic displacement at around 10 m, the same
equations predict the maximum displacement as 9.8 m, too. Hence, the same
mechanism that causes bridges to collapse under the soldiers step marching
could be making the lithosphere fail under the springtide induced magnification
of mantle resonance resulting in strong earthquakes of unspecified type. If
this assertion is correct, then many if not most large earthquakes could be
spatially and temporally predictable.

  sensory representations. PLoS Biol 4(12): e387","10.1371/journal.pbio.0040387",,"q-bio.NC",,"  The sensory-triggered activity of a neuron is typically characterized in
terms of a tuning curve, which describes the neuron's average response as a
function of a parameter that characterizes a physical stimulus. What determines
the shapes of tuning curves in a neuronal population? Previous theoretical
studies and related experiments suggest that many response characteristics of
sensory neurons are optimal for encoding stimulus-related information. This
notion, however, does not explain the two general types of tuning profiles that
are commonly observed: unimodal and monotonic. Here, I quantify the efficacy of
a set of tuning curves according to the possible downstream motor responses
that can be constructed from them. Curves that are optimal in this sense may
have monotonic or non-monotonic profiles, where the proportion of monotonic
curves and the optimal tuning curve width depend on the general properties of
the target downstream functions. This dependence explains intriguing features
of visual cells that are sensitive to binocular disparity and of neurons tuned
to echo delay in bats. The numerical results suggest that optimal sensory
tuning curves are shaped not only by stimulus statistics and signal-to-noise
properties, but also according to their impact on downstream neural circuits
and, ultimately, on behavior.

density results in the more aggressive clonal populations switching earlier
from proliferation-dominated to a more migratory phenotype. Moreover, analyzing
the dynamic molecular profile that triggers the phenotypic switch between
proliferation and migration, our in silico oncogenomics data display spatial

that biological information can rapidly evolve on demand from environment,

way the quantum system traveled and interference visibility are complementary.
In all which-way experiments, however, an intervention takes place in the
interference process in order to determine which way the quantum system took.
This intervention can imply the tagging of a which-way marker to a quantum
system or, for instance, blocking off one of the paths in a Mach-Zehnder
interferometer so that one indirectly knows that the quantum system took the
other (open) path. It is, however, this intervention that destroys the
interference. In this paper a novel two-slit which-way interference experiment
will be discussed and proposed for implementation that provides maximum
which-way information without intervening in the interference process so that
simultaneously maximum interference visibility remains preserved. This, in
fact, implies an uncoupling of which-way information from interference and
consequently also entails violating the duality relation P^2+V^2<1. Basically,
the purpose of the proposed experiment and of this paper is to scrutinize this
duality relation. The experiment makes use of a super-focused laser beam that
is launched into only one of the two slits of the two-slit interference
experiment.
