NGC2298 using deep HST/ACS observations in the F606W and F814W bands covering
an area of 3.4' x 3.4' around the cluster centre or about twice the cluster's
half-mass radius. The colour-magnitude diagram that we derive in this way
reveals a narrow and well defined MS extending down to the 10 sigma detection
limit at m_606~26.5, m_814~25, corresponding to stars of ~0.2 Msolar. The
luminosity function (LF) obtained with these data, once corrected for the
limited effects of photometric incompleteness, reveals a remarkable deficiency
of low-mass stars as well as a radial gradient, in that the LF becomes
progressively steeper with radius. Using the mass-luminosity relation
appropriate for the metallicity of NGC2298, we derive the cluster's global mass
function (GMF) by using a multi-mass Michie-King model. Over the range 0.8 -
0.2 Msolar, the number of stars per unit mass decreases following a power-law
distribution of the type dN/dm \propto m^(0.5), where, for comparison, typical
halo clusters have dN/dm \propto m^(-1.5). If the IMF of NGC2298 was similar to
that of other metal poor halo clusters, like e.g. NGC6397, the present GMF that
we obtain implies that this object must have lost of order 85% of its original
mass, at a rate much higher than that suggested by current models based on the
available cluster orbit. The latter may, therefore, need revision.

  The CO and SO emission reveals at least three molecular outflows originating
from the center of the dust core. The outflows are well collimated, with
terminal velocities up to 50 \kms-1 from the cloud velocity. Outflow A
coincides with the SiO jet identified previously by Hunter et al. (1999). Since
jet-like outflows and disk-mediated accretion process are physically connected,
the well collimated outflows indicate that even in this cluster environment,
accretion is responsible for the formation of individual stars in the cluster.

Twenty two systems total have excess emission, including four systems that show

dust produced by collisions in planetesimal belts. The incidence of debris
disks around main sequence A3-F8 binaries is marginally higher than that for
single old AFGK stars. Whatever combination of nature (birth conditions of
binary systems) and nurture (interactions between the two stars) drives the
evolution of debris disks in binary systems, it is clear that planetesimal
formation is not inhibited to any great degree. We model these dust disks
through fitting the spectral energy distributions and derive typical dust
temperatures in the range 100--200 K and typical fractional luminosities around
10^-5, with both parameters similar to other Spitzer-discovered debris disks.
Our calculated dust temperatures suggest that about half the excesses we
observe are derived from circumbinary planetesimal belts and around one third
of the excesses clearly suggest circumstellar material. Three systems with
excesses have dust in dynamically unstable regions, and we discuss possible
scenarios for the origin of this short-lived dust.

using one or two components both of which have exactly the same functional form
comprised of an early falling exponential phase followed by a power law decay.
The 1st component contains the prompt gamma-ray emission and the initial X-ray
decay. The 2nd component appears later, has a much longer duration and is
present for ~80% of GRBs. It most likely arises from the external shock which
eventually develops into the X-ray afterglow. In the remaining ~20% of GRBs the
initial X-ray decay of the 1st component fades more slowly than the 2nd and
dominates at late times to form an afterglow but it is not clear what the
origin of this emission is.
  The temporal decay parameters and gamma/X-ray spectral indices derived for
107 GRBs are compared to the expectations of the standard fireball model
including a search for possible ""jet breaks"". For ~50% of GRBs the observed
afterglow is in accord with the model but for the rest the temporal and
spectral indices do not conform to the expected closure relations and are
suggestive of continued, late, energy injection. We identify a few possible jet
breaks but there are many examples where such breaks are predicted but are
absent.
  The time, T_a, at which the exponential phase of the 2nd component changes to
a final powerlaw decay afterglow is correlated with the peak of the gamma-ray

gravitational radiation for ground-based detectors such as LIGO or VIRGO. Even
if formed with lower efficiency than double neutron star binaries, they could
dominate the predicted detection rates, since black holes are more massive than
neutron stars and therefore could be detected at greater distances. Here we
discuss an evolutionary process that can very significantly limit the formation
of close double black hole binaries: the vast majority of their potential
progenitors undergo a common envelope (CE) phase while the donor, one of the
massive binary components, is evolving through the Hertzsprung gap. Our latest
theoretical understanding of the CE process suggests that this will probably
lead to a merger, inhibiting double black hole formation. Barring uncertainties
in the physics of CE evolution, we use population synthesis calculations, and
find that the corresponding reduction in the merger rate of double black holes
formed in galactic fields is so great (by ~500) that their contribution to
inspiral detection rates for ground-based detectors could become relatively
small (1 in 10) compared to double neutron star binaries. A similar process
also reduces the merger rates for double neutron stars, by factor of ~5,
eliminating most of the previously predicted ultracompact NS-NS systems. Our
predicted detection rates for Advanced LIGO are now much lower for double black
holes (~2/yr), but are still quite high for double neutron stars (~20/yr). If
double black holes were found to be dominant in the detected inspiral signals,
this could indicate that they mainly originate from dense star clusters (not
included here) or that our theoretical understanding of the CE phase requires
significant revision.

radiation progresses inside the ionized gas. This has observational
implications in the emitted/absorbed spectra, ionization states, and
variability. However impossible to know what solution the plasma will adopt
when attaining the multi-solutions regime, we expect the emitted/absorbed

based on fits of image models to the visibility data, for the difference
between the NIR sizes of these two luminosity groups. When plotted against the
``scaled'' baseline, the visibility creates the following data clusters: low-L
Herbig Ae/Be stars, T Tauri stars, and high-L Herbig Be stars. The T Tau
cluster is similar to the low-L Herbig Ae/Be cluster, which has ~7 times
smaller ``scaled'' baselines than the high-L Herbig Be cluster. We model the
shape and size of clusters with different image models and find that low-L
Herbig stars are the best explained by the uniform brightness ring and the halo
model, T Tauri stars with the halo model, and high-L Herbig stars with the
accretion disk model. However, the plausibility of each model is not well
established. Therefore, we try to build a descriptive model of the
circumstellar environment consistent with various observed properties of YSOs.
We argue that low-L YSOs have optically thick disks with the optically thin
inner dust sublimation cavity and an optically thin dusty outflow above the
inner disk regions. High-L YSOs have optically thick accretion disks with high
accretion rates enabling gas to dominate the NIR emission over dust. Although

physical parameters like black hole mass, we have matched quasars from the
QUEST1 Variability Survey with broad-lined objects from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey. The matched sample contains approximately 100 quasars, and the Sloan
spectra are used to estimate black hole masses and bolometric luminosities.
Variability amplitudes are measured from the QUEST1 light curves. We find that
black hole mass correlates with several measures of the variability amplitude
at the 99% significance level or better. The correlation does not appear to be
caused by obvious selection effects inherent to flux-limited quasar samples,
host galaxy contamination or other well-known correlations between quasar
variability and luminosity/redshift. We evaluate variability as a function of
rest-frame time lag using structure functions, and find further support for the
variability--black hole mass correlation. The correlation is strongest for time
lags of the order a few months up to the QUEST1 maximum temporal resolution of
approximately 2 years, and may provide important clues for understanding the
long-standing problem of the origin of quasar optical variability. We discuss
whether our result is a manifestation of a relation between characteristic
variability timescale and black hole mass, where the variability timescale is
typical for accretion disk thermal timescales, but find little support for
this. Our favoured explanation is that more massive black holes have larger
variability amplitudes, and we highlight the need for larger samples with more
complete temporal sampling to test the robustness of this result.

source that may explain the anomalously large radius of some transiting ``hot
Jupiters''. To maintain a non-zero and large obliquity, it was argued that the
planets can be locked in a Cassini state, i.e. a resonance between spin and
orbital precessions. We compute the tidal heating within ``inflated'' close-in
giant planets with a non-zero eccentricity or obliquity. We further inspect
whether the spin of a ``hot Jupiter'' could have been trapped and maintained in
a Cassini state during its early despinning and migration. We estimate the
capture probability in a spin-orbit resonance between $\sim$ 0.5 AU (a distance
where tidal effects become significant) and 0.05 AU for a wide range of secular
orbital frequencies and amplitudes of gravitational perturbations. Numerical
simulations of the spin evolution are performed to explore the influence of
tidal despinning and migration processes on the resonance stability. We find
that tidal heating within a non-synchronous giant planet is about twice larger
than previous estimates based on the hypothesis of synchronization. Chances of
capture in a spin-orbit resonance are very good around 0.5 AU but they decrease
dramatically with the semi-major axis. Furthermore, even if captured, both
tidal despinning and migration processes cause the tidal torque to become large
enough that the obliquity ultimately leaves the resonance and switches to near
$0^{\circ}$. Locking a ``hot Jupiter'' in an isolated spin-orbit resonance is
unlikely at 0.05 AU but could be possible at larger distances. Another
mechanism is then required to maintain a large obliquity and create internal
heating through obliquity tides

""Supercritical Pile"" GRB model; the fundamental feature of this model is a
detailed process for the conversion of the energy stored in relativistic
protons in the GRB Relativistic Blast Waves (RBW) into relativistic electrons
and then into radiation. The conversion is effected through the $p \gamma \to p
e^+e^-$ reaction, whose kinematic threshold is imprinted on the GRB spectra to
provide a peak of their emitted luminosity at energy \Ep $\sim 1$ MeV in the
lab frame. We extend this model to include, in addition to the (quasi--)thermal
relativistic post-shock protons an accelerated component of power law form.
This component guarantees the production of $e^+e^- -$pairs even after the RBW
has slowed down to the point that its (quasi--)thermal protons cannot fulfill
the threshold of the above reaction. We suggest that this last condition marks
the transition from the prompt to the afterglow GRB phase. We also discuss
conditions under which this transition is accompanied by a significant drop in
the flux and could thus account for several puzzling, recent observations.
Finally, we indicate that the same mechanism applied to the late stages of the
GRB evolution leads to a decrease in \Ep $\propto \Gamma^2(t)\propto t^{-3/4}$,
a feature amenable to future observational tests.

superconducting charge qubits are capacitively coupled to a single high-Q

by driving the resonator with microwave fields. Advantages of this architecture
are that it allows for multi-qubit gates between non-nearest qubits and for the
realization of gates in parallel, opening the possibility of fault-tolerant
quantum computation with superconduting circuits. In this paper, we focus on
one and two-qubit gates that do not require moving away from the

the qubit dephasing time and does not require modification of the original

do not use this constraint. Five types of two-qubit gates are discussed, these

spatial resolutions (74 ms and 0.94 mm \times 0.94 mm, respectively), giving
new insights into the underlying mechanisms. The millet and poppy mixture
composition is calibrated based on the signal intensity and is quantified
throughout segregation. As for radial segregation, millet and poppy mixture
core formation is observed in cylinders of 75% and 82% filling level. The size
of the core is calculated and the avalanche layer thickness is therefore
determined. 2D MRI movies showing real-time radial segregation suggests that
initial radial segregation is due to the stopping and percolation of poppy
seeds. Axial segregation is characterized by the formation, traveling and
merging of poppy-rich bands. In all cases studied, the formation of poppy-rich
bands is observed, after which individual bands start to travel at \sim 3 \mu m
s^{-1} until they are within \sim 3 cm of a stationary band. Adjacent bands
then merge into a single, enlarged poppy band as millet seeds move out of the
merging region. In both radial and axial segregation, core diffusion is shown

function which maps each frame to a continuous function. The comparison of
these functions induces an equivalence and partial order that allows for a
meaningful comparison of frames indexed by the same set. We define the
ultrafilter measure function, an explicit frame measure function that we show
is contained both algebraically and topologically inside all frame measure
functions. We explore additional properties of frame measure functions, showing
that they are additive on a large class of supersets-- those that come from so
called non-expansive frames. We apply our results to the Gabor setting,
computing the frame measure function of Gabor frames and establishing a new

averages of the values of $F$ on independent and identically distributed

introduced, and its performance is studied. When the mean $E(U(X))$ of a
different function $U$ is known, the estimates are ""screened,"" in that we only
consider those which correspond to times when the empirical average of the
$\{U(X_i)\}$ is sufficiently close to its known mean. As long as $U$ dominates
$F$ appropriately, the screened estimates admit exponential error bounds, even
when $F(X)$ is heavy-tailed. The main results are several nonasymptotic,
explicit exponential bounds for the screened estimates. A geometric
interpretation, in the spirit of Sanov's theorem, is given for the fact that
the screened estimates always admit exponential error bounds, even if the
standard estimates do not. And when they do, the screened estimates' error
probability has a significantly better exponent. This implies that screening
can be interpreted as a variance reduction technique. Our main mathematical
tools come from large deviations techniques. The results are illustrated by a
detailed simulation example.

number $A$, the valence proton number $N_p$, and the valence neutron number
$N_n$ can describe the essential trends of excitation energies $E_x$ of the
first $2^+$ and $3^-$ states in even-even nuclei throughout the periodic table.
The formula reads as $E_x = \alpha A^{-\beta} + \exp (- \lambda N_p) + \exp (-
\lambda N_n)$. The parameter $\beta$ in the first term is determined by the
mass number $A$ dependence of the bottom contour line of the excitation energy
systematics. The other two parameters $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ are fitted by
minimizing the $\chi^2$ value between the measured and calculated excitation
energies. Our results suggest that the single large-$j$ shell simulation can be
applied to the excitation energies of the first $2^+$ and $3^-$ states in
even-even nuclei.

We introduce a new index that satisfies two main properties. First, it can be
applied to both binary or weighted graphs. Second, once suitably standardized,
it distributes as a standard normal over all possible adjacency/weights
matrices. To test the index in practice, we present an application that employs
a set of well-known empirically-observed social and economic networks.

background, enabling the study of quark and antiquark polarization in the
proton. The muon trigger upgrade will add momentum and timing information to
the present muon Level-1 trigger, which only makes use of tracking in the
PHENIX muon identifier (MuID) panels. Signals from three new resistive plate

available theoretical results on the antiprotonic helium HFS shows that the
accuracy of the value of the dipole magnetic moment of the antiproton

by measuring the splitting of appropriately selected components of the HFS of
any of the known metastable states. The feasibility of the proposed measurement
by means of an analog of the triple resonance method is also discussed.

band of low spatial frequencies (``critical band''). Here, we examined the
recognition performance of an artificial face recognition system as a function
of the size of the input images. Recognition performance was quantified with
three discriminability measures: Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis, non
Parametric Discriminant Analysis, and mutual information. All of the three
measures revealed a maximum at the same image sizes. Since spatial frequency
content is a function of image size, our data consistently predict the range of
psychophysical found frequencies. Our results therefore support the notion that
the critical band of spatial frequencies for face recognition in humans and
machines follows from inherent properties of face images.

different boundary conditions can lead to remarkably different physical
behaviour. Our seemingly innocent setting is a one dimensional potential well
that is divided into two halves by a thin separating wall. The two half wells
are populated by the same type and number of particles and are kept at the same
temperature. The only difference is in the boundary condition imposed at the
two sides of the separating wall, which is the Dirichlet condition from the
left and the Neumann condition from the right. The resulting different energy
spectra cause a difference in the quantum statistically emerging pressure on
the two sides. The net force acting on the separating wall proves to be nonzero
at any temperature and, after a weak decrease in the low temperature domain, to
increase and diverge with a square-root-of-temperature asymptotics for high
temperatures. These observations hold for both bosonic and fermionic type
particles, but with quantitative differences. We work out several analytic
approximations to explain these differences and the various aspects of the
found unexpectedly complex picture.

us with an almost perfect source of classical randomness, and more generally,
suffice for classical cryptographic tasks, such as encryption. Indeed, it is
well known that classical computers are insufficient for either one of these
tasks when all they have access to is a realistic imperfect source of
randomness. On the other hand, quantum physics is inherently probabilistic
which suggests that perhaps quantum computers can provide a reasonable way to
overcome the above mentioned impossibility results. However, we show that this
is not the case in a realistic setting where observations (measurements) are
subject to noise.
