Cluster NGC 6752, one oxygen rich and sodium poor, the other presumably oxygen
poor and sodium rich. Be abundances in these stars are used to put on firmer
grounds the hypothesis of Be as cosmochronometer and to investigate the
formation of Globular Clusters. Method:We present near UV spectra with
resolution R$\sim 45000$ obtained with the UVES spectrograph on the 8.2m VLT
Kueyen telescope, analysed with spectrum synthesis based on plane parallel LTE
model atmospheres. Results:Be is detected in the O rich star with
log(Be/H)=-12.04 $\pm$0.15, while Be is not detected in the other star for
which we obtain the upper limit log(Be/H)$<$-12.2. A large difference in
nitrogen abundance (1.6 dex) is found between the two stars. Conclusions:The Be
measurement is compatible with what found in field stars with the same [Fe/H]
and [O/H]. The 'Be age' of the cluster is found to be 13.3 Gyrs, in excellent
agreement with the results from main sequence fitting and stellar evolution.
The presence of Be confirms the results previously obtained for the cluster NGC
6397 and supports the hypothesis that Be can be used as a clock for the early
formation of the Galaxy. Since only an upper limit is found for the star with
low oxygen abundance, we cannot decide between competing scenarios of Globular
Cluster formation, but we can exclude that 'polluted' stars are substantially
younger than 'unpolluted' ones. We stress that the Be test might be the only
measurement capable of distinguishing between these scenarios.

progenitor star exploded inside a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) rich in He.
An exceptionally blue apparent continuum persists from our first spectrum
obtained 15 days after discovery through our last spectrum ~1 month later.
Based on the presence of isolated Fe II emission lines, we interpret the blue
""continuum"" as blended, perhaps fluorescent, Fe emission. One or two of the
reddest He I line profiles in our spectra are double peaked, suggesting that
the CSM has an aspherical geometry. The He I lines that are superposed on the
blue continuum show P-Cygni profiles, while the redder He I lines do not,
implying that the blue continuum also originates from an asymmetric mass
distribution. The He-rich CSM, aspherical geometry, and line velocities
indicate that the progenitor star was a WNE Wolf-Rayet (WR) star. A recent (2
years before the SN), coincident, luminous outburst similar to those seen in
luminous blue variables (LBVs) is the leading candidate for the dense CSM. Such
an eruption associated with a WR star has not been seen before, indicating that
the progenitor star may have recently transitioned from the LBV phase. We also
present unpublished spectral and photometric data on SN 2002ao which, along
with SN 1999cq, is very similar to SN 2006jc. We propose that these three

$\sigma(M_\star) = 0.1-0.2 M_\odot$ to the total mass uncertainty. The

the region of the disk. Such outflows have been seen both in starburst
galaxies, actively star forming galaxies and galaxies with an AGN. In the
latter galaxies it is unknown whether the large-scale outflows are driven by
star formation activity or purely by the active nucleus. The aim of our
investigation is to study the frequency of extended minor-axis outflows in
edge-on Seyfert galaxies to investigate the role of the AGN, the circumnuclear
environment and star formation activity within the disk regions, and their
importance for IGM enrichment on large scales. Narrowband imaging in two
different ionizational stages (H-alpha and [OIII]) was performed to attempt a
discrimination between processes associated with the active nucleus and those
connected to star forming activity within the disk. The H-alpha morphology of
the Seyfert galaxies is usually complex, but only in three out of 14 galaxies
did we find evidence for minor axis disk outflows. At the sensitivity of our
observations [OIII] emission is generally detected only in the nuclear region.
Overall, our results show that extraplanar emission of similar brightness and
extent as in the previously known cases of NGC3079 and NGC4388 is not common in
Seyfert galaxies of otherwise similar properties. Comparison with our previous
results shows that for nearby edge-on spiral galaxies star formation may be a
more powerful mechanism for producing DIG than AGN activity. While in general
AGN activity undoubtedly plays some role in driving minor-axis outflows, this
probably requires higher AGN luminosities than are encountered in our small
distance-limited sample.

minimally from numerical dissipation and allows for an easy implementation of

show the development of MHD turbulnce in a simulation of an accretion disk.

replaced by the 3-year measurements (hereafter WMAP1 and WMAP3). Remarkably,
the picture has changed relatively little with the arrival of WMAP3, though
some aspects have been brought into much sharper focus. One notable example of
this is the index of primordial scalar fluctuations, n_s. Prior to WMAP3,
Sanchez et al. (2006) found that the scale invariant value of n_s = 1 was
excluded at the 95% level. With WMAP3, this becomes a 3sigma result, with
implications for models of inflation. We find some disagreement between the

between the clustering of different types of galaxies and the linear

present analytic formulae for optically-thin one-temperature accretion flows
including the advection-dominated regime, using the ``semi-iterative'' method
described in paper 1. Our analytic formulae have two real solutions. The first
solution corresponds to the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF), and the
second solution corresponds to the radiation-dominated accretion flow described
by Shapiro, Lightman, & Eardley (the so-called SLE model). Both solutions are
given by a cubic equation for the advection parameter $f$, which is the ratio
of the advection cooling rate $Q_{\rm adv}$ to the viscous heating rate
  $Q_{\rm vis}$, i.e., $f=Q_{\rm adv}/Q_{\rm vis}$. Most previous studies
assume that $f$ is constant ($f \sim 1$ for the ADAF). However, it is clear
that $f$ should be a function of the physical parameters of the
radiative-cooling dominated regime. We found that the ratio $f$ can be written
as a function of the radius, mass accretion rate, and viscous parameter
$\alpha$. Using this formula, we can estimate the transition radius from the
inner optically-thin ADAF to the outer optically-thick standard disk, which can
be measured using observations of the quiescent state in black hole X-ray
binaries.

Theoretical studies show that the high abundances of both C2H2 and HCN exclude
a X-ray dominated region (XDR) associated with the toroid surrounding an AGN as
the origin of this dense warm molecular gas. Galactic massive protostars in the

the broad optical permitted emission lines have been detected in addition to
the extended jet emission. Here we report on deep (40ksec x4) observations of
the bright BLRG 3C~120 using Suzaku. The observations were spaced a week apart,
and sample a range of continuum fluxes. An excellent broadband spectrum was
obtained over two decades of frequency (0.6 to 50 keV) within each 40 ksec
exposure. We clearly resolved the iron K emission line complex, finding that it
consists of a narrow K_a core (sigma ~ 110 eV or an EW of 60 eV), a 6.9 keV
line, and an underlying broad iron line. Our confirmation of the broad line
contrasts with the XMM-Newton observation in 2003, where the broad line was not
required. The most natural interpretation of the broad line is iron K line
emission from a face-on accretion disk which is truncated at ~10 r_g. Above 10
keV, a relatively weak Compton hump was detected (reflection fraction of R ~
0.6), superposed on the primary X-ray continuum of Gamma ~ 1.75. Thanks to the
good photon statistics and low background of the Suzaku data, we clearly
confirm the spectral evolution of 3C120, whereby the variability amplitude
decreases with increasing energy. More strikingly, we discovered that the
variability is caused by a steep power-law component of Gamma ~2.7, possibly
related to the non-thermal jet emission. We discuss our findings in the context
of similarities and differences between radio-loud/quiet objects.

The dynamo equations are reduced using the `no-$z$' approximation to a
nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations in time; we demonstrate
that the model reproduces accurately earlier results, including those where
nonlinear behaviour is driven by a magnetic helicity flux. We discuss the
implications and interplay of two types of magnetic helicity flux, one produced
by advection (e.g., due to the galactic fountain or wind) and the other,
arising from anisotropy of turbulence as suggested by Vishniac & Cho(2001). We
argue that the latter is significant if the galactic differential rotation is
strong enough: in our model, for $\Rw\la-10$ in terms of the corresponding
turbulent magnetic Reynolds number. We confirm that the intensity of gas
outflow from the galactic disc optimal for the dynamo action is close to that
expected for normal spiral galaxies. The steady-state strength of the
large-scale magnetic field supported by the helicity advection is still weaker
than that corresponding to equipartition with the turbulent energy. However,
the Vishniac-Cho helicity flux can boost magnetic field further to achieve
energy equipartition with turbulence. For stronger outflows that may occur in
starburst galaxies, the Vishniac-Cho flux can be essential for the dynamo
action. However, this mechanism requires a large-scale magnetic field of at
least $\simeq1\mkG$ to be launched, so that it has to be preceded by a
conventional dynamo assisted by the advection of magnetic helicity by the
fountain or wind.

contrast, very few planets are found in mature open and globular clusters such
as the Hyades and 47 Tuc. We explore here the possibility that this dichotomy
is due to the post-formation disruption of planetary systems associated with
the stellar encounters in long-lived clusters. One supporting piece of evidence
for this scenario is the discovery of freely floating low-mass objects in star
forming regions. We use two independent numerical approaches, a hybrid Monte
Carlo and a direct $N$-body method, to simulate the impact of the encounters.
We show that the results of numerical simulations are in reasonable agreement
with analytical determinations in the adiabatic and impulsive limits. They
indicate that distant stellar encounters generally do not significantly modify
the compact and nearly circular orbits. However, moderately close stellar
encounters, which are likely to occur in dense clusters, can excite planets'
orbital eccentricity and induce dynamical instability in systems which are
closely packed with multiple planets. We compute effective cross sections for
the dissolution of planetary systems and show that, for all initial
eccentricities, dissolution occurs on time scales which are longer than the
dispersion of small stellar associations, but shorter than the age of typical
open and globular clusters. Although it is much more difficult to disrupt
short-period planets, close encounters can excite modest eccentricity among
them, such that subsequent tidal dissipation leads to orbital decay, tidal
inflation, and even disruption of the close-in planets.

transitions are fully in-plane polarized along [1\bar 10] and [110],
respectively, while valence transitions are weakly polarized because the hole P
states do not show any in-plane preferential orientation. (ii) In alloyed
In_{0.6}Ga_{0.4}As/GaAs dots the [110] and [1\bar 10] polarization of the
corresponding 1S-1P conduction intraband transitions is weakened since the two
1P states are mixed by alloy fluctuations. The polarization of valence
intraband transitions is insensitive to changes in alloy fluctuations. (iii)
For light polarized along [001], we find a strong valence-to-valence transition
that involves a weakly confined hole state with predominant light-hole
character. (iv) When charging the dots with a few electrons, the conduction
intraband transitions display spectroscopic shifts of ~1-2 meV. These shifts
are a result of correlation effects (captured by configuration-interaction) and
not well described within the Hartree-Fock approximation. (v) When charging the
dots with holes, valence intraband spectra are more complex than the conduction
intraband spectra as hole states are strongly affected by spin-orbit coupling,
and configuration mixing is more pronounced. Spectroscopic shifts can no longer
be identified unambiguously. These predictions could be tested in single-dot

the strong effects of antiferromagnetism. The magnitude of this gap in ECCO is
larger than that in SCCO, implying that the effects of antiferromagnetism in
ECCO are stronger than that in SCCO. Also, we quantitatively confirmed the
effects of antiferromagnetism by the band dispersions to tight-binding
calculation.

perform a direct time evolution simulations of the time-dependent Schroedinger

  710, 2007, Asilomar, California, USA",,,,"cs.DB",,"  This paper introduces the CondorJ2 cluster management system. Traditionally,
cluster management systems such as Condor employ a process-oriented approach
with little or no use of modern database system technology. In contrast,
CondorJ2 employs a data-centric, 3-tier web-application architecture for all
system functions (e.g., job submission, monitoring and scheduling; node
configuration, monitoring and management, etc.) except for job execution.
Employing a data-oriented approach allows the core challenge (i.e., managing
and coordinating a large set of distributed computing resources) to be
transformed from a relatively low-level systems problem into a more abstract,
higher-level data management problem. Preliminary results suggest that
CondorJ2's use of standard 3-tier software represents a significant step
forward to the design and implementation of large clusters (1,000 to 10,000
nodes).

clustering and its unreported effects for differently-sized feature matrices.
Speaker data is represented as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC)
vectors, and features are compared using the KL2 metric to form clusters of
speech segments for each speaker. We make two observations with respect to
clustering based on KL2: 1.) The accuracy of clustering is strongly dependent
on the absolute lengths of the speech segments and their extracted feature
vectors. 2.) The accuracy of the similarity measure strongly degrades with the
length of the shorter of the two speech segments. These effects of length can
be attributed to the measure of covariance used in KL2. We demonstrate an
empirical correction of this sample-size effect that increases clustering
accuracy. We draw parallels to two Vector Quantization-based (VQ) similarity
measures, one which exhibits an equivalent effect of sample size, and the
second being less influenced by it.

NonDeterministic Stochastic Activity Network (NDSAN). An NDSAN consists
basically of a set of activities along with precedence relations involving
these activities, which determine their order of execution. Activity durations
are stochastic, given by continuous, nonnegative random variables. The
nondeterministic behavior of an NDSAN is based on two additional possibilities:
(i) by associating choice probabilities with groups of activities, some
branches of execution may not be taken; (ii) by allowing iterated executions of
groups of activities according to predetermined probabilities, the number of
times an activity must be executed is not determined a priori. These properties
lead to a rich variety of activity networks, capable of modeling many real
situations in process engineering, project design, and troubleshooting. We
describe a recursive simulation algorithm for NDSANs, whose repeated execution
produces a close approximation to the probability distribution of the
completion time of the entire network. We also report on real-world case

densities f are written in terms of the Ricci scalar R are cosmologically
viable. We show that the cosmological behavior of f(R) models can be understood
by a geometrical approach consisting in studying the m(r) curve on the (r, m)
plane, where m=Rf_{,RR}/f_{,R} and r=-Rf_{,R}/f with f_{,R}=df/dR. This allows
us to classify the f(R) models into four general classes, depending on the
existence of a standard matter epoch and on the final accelerated stage. The
existence of a viable matter dominated epoch prior to a late-time acceleration
requires that the variable m satisfies the conditions m(r) approx+0 and
dm/dr>-1 at r approx-1. For the existence of a viable late-time acceleration we
require instead either (i) m=-r-1, (sqrt{3}-1)/2<m<1 and dm/dr<-1 or (ii) 0<m<1
at r=-2. These conditions identify two regions in the (r, m) space, one for the
matter era and the other for the acceleration. Only models with a m(r) curve
that connects these regions and satisfy the requirements above lead to an
acceptable cosmology. The models of the type f(R)=alpha R^{-n} and f=R+alpha
R^{-n} do not satisfy these conditions for any n>0 and n<-1 and are thus
cosmologically unacceptable. Similar conclusions can be reached for many other
examples discussed in the text. In most cases the standard matter era is
replaced by a cosmic expansion with scale factor a propto t^{1/2}. We also find
that f(R) models can have a strongly phantom attractor but in this case there
is no acceptable matter era.

a quenched gauge background, generated using a one-loop improved Symanzik

sum rule for an arbitrarily-separated multi-string configuration with a
Gaussian type tachyon potential. At the site of each thin BPS D(F)-string, the
pressure takes a finite value. We find that there exists a maximum deficit
angle $\pi$ in the conical geometry induced by thin BPS D- and DF-strings.

LMI continuously depends on a parameter and is feasible for any value of that

The result holds true for LMIs that arise in S-procedure and Yakubovich lemma.
It is shown that the LMI which is polynomially dependent on a vector of
parameters can be reduced to a parameter-independent LMI of a higher dimension.
The result is based on the recent generalization of Yakubovich lemma proposed
by Iwasaki and Hara and another generalization formulated in this paper. The
problem of positivity verification for a non-SOS polynomial of two variables is
considered as an example. To illustrate control applications, a method of

<= 2). We factor this bijective correspondence through a map onto the closed
morphisms in a universal braided category freely generated by a Hopf algebra
object H. In this way we obtain a complete algebraic description of
4-dimensional 2-handlebodies. This result is then used to obtain an analogous
description of the boundaries of such handlebodies, i.e. 3-dimensional
manifolds, which resolves for closed manifolds the problem posed by Kerler in

Since then SVMs have been successfully applied to real-world data analysis

SVMs operate within the framework of regularization theory by minimizing an
empirical risk in a well-posed and consistent way. A clear advantage of the
support vector approach is that sparse solutions to classification and
regression problems are usually obtained: only a few samples are involved in
the determination of the classification or regression functions. This fact
facilitates the application of SVMs to problems that involve a large amount of
data, such as text processing and bioinformatics tasks. This paper is intended
as an introduction to SVMs and their applications, emphasizing their key
features. In addition, some algorithmic extensions and illustrative real-world
applications of SVMs are shown.

When effects of the inertia of the particles are significant, an initially

effect by calculating the Lyapunov exponents for dense particles suspended in
such a random three-dimensional flow, concentrating on the limit where the
viscous damping rate is small compared to the inverse correlation time of the
random flow (that is, the regime of large Stokes number). In this limit
Lyapunov exponents are obtained as a power series in a parameter which is a
dimensionless measure of the inertia. We report results for the first seven
orders. The perturbation series is divergent, but we obtain accurate results
from a Pade-Borel summation. We deduce that particles can cluster onto a
fractal set and show that its dimension is in satisfactory agreement with
previously reported in simulations of turbulent Navier-Stokes flows. We also
investigate the rate of formation of caustics in the particle flow.

investigated in the modified quark-meson coupling model. It is shown that K$^-$
condensation is suppressed because of the quark deconfinement when
$B^{1/4}<$202.2MeV, where $B$ is the bag constant for unpaired quark matter.
With the equation of state (EOS) solved self-consistently, we discuss the
properties of compact stars. We find that the EOS of pure hadron matter with
condensed K$^-$ phase should be ruled out by the redshift for star EXO0748-676,
while EOS containing unpaired quark matter phase with $B^{1/4}$ being about
180MeV could be consistent with this observation and the best measured mass of
star PSR 1913+16. We then probe into the change of the phase structures in
possible compact stars with deconfinment phase as the central densities
increase. But if the recent inferred massive star among Terzan 5 with
M$>$1.68M$_{\odot}$ is confirmed, all the present EOSes with condensed phase
and deconfined phase would be ruled out and therefore these exotic phases are
unlikely to appear within neutron stars.

dielectric permittivity that can be altered by applying a bias voltage.
Ferroelectric materials offer significant benefits for linear collider
applications, in particular, for switching and control elements where a very
short response time of <10 nsec is required. The measurement results presented
here show that the new BST(M) ceramic exhibits a high tunability factor: a bias
field of 40-50 kV/cm reduces the permittivity by a factor of 1.3-1.5. The
recently developed technology of gold biasing contact deposition on large
diameter (110 cm) thin wall ferroelectric rings allowed ~few nsec switching
times in witness sample experiments. The ferroelectric rings can be used at
high pulsed power (tens of megawatts) for X-band components as well as at high
average power in the range of a few kilowatts for the L-band phase-shifter,

re-examined. Neither argument is found to be satisfactory as it stands,
although an improved version of one of the arguments can in fact be given. This
improved version turns out to be still not completely unproblematic, but it is
argued that it contains only a single actual loophole, which is identical to a
loophole that remains in experimental proofs of nonlocality of Bell-type. It is
concluded that - within the context of the standard quantum kinematical
framework and in agreement with what has been concluded by earlier authors - a
nonlinear dynamics of density operators is inconsistent with relativistic
causality. However, it is also stressed that this conclusion in itself has
little implication for the nature of dynamics at the Hilbert space level - in
particular, it does not force dynamics to be linear at this level - nor does it
continue to be valid in contexts that go beyond the standard quantum
kinematical framework. Despite their seeming triviality, these last two points
have not always been appreciated in the literature. Finally, it is also pointed
out that the argument for complete positivity, as given in conjunction with one
of the two recent arguments for linear dynamics, in fact only establishes a
condition that is weaker than complete positivity.
