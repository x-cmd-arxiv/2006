samples of relaxed elliptical-like-objects (ELOs) identified, at z=0, in a set
of self-consistent hydrodynamical simulations operating in the context of a
concordance cosmological model. Our analysis shows that they are embedded in
extended, massive dark matter haloes, and they also have an extended corona of
hot diffuse gas. Dark matter haloes have experienced adiabatic contraction
along their assembly process. The relative ELO dark- to bright-mass content and
space distributions show broken homology, and they are consistent with
observational results on the dark matter fraction at the central regions, as
well as on the gradients of the mass-to-light ratio profiles for boxy
ellipticals, as a function of their stellar masses. These results indicate that
massive ellipticals miss stars at their central regions, as compared with less
massive ones. Our simulations indicate that these missing baryons could be
found beyond the virial radii as a hot, diffuse plasma. The projected stellar
mass profiles of our ELOs can be well fit by the S\'ersic (1968) formula.
Parameters of these fits reproduce observational correlations of the shape
parameter with size, luminosity and velocity dispersion. The total mass density
profiles show a power-law behaviour over a large r/r_{vir} interval, consistent
with data on massive lens ellipticals at shorter radii. The velocity dispersion
profiles show kinematical segregation, with no systematic mass dependence and a
positive anisotropy, roughly independent of the radial distance outside the
central regions. The consistency with observations strongly suggests that they
could also describe important intrinsic characteristics of real ellipticals, as
well as some of their properties recently inferred from observational data.

provides a possibility to discriminate dark matter annihilation from the

  conference, Sintra, Portugal, Oct 2006",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In this paper, I have attempted to highlight key results from deep
extragalactic surveys at mid-infrared wavelengths. I discuss advances in our
understanding of dust enshrouded star-formation and AGN activity at 0<z<3 from
IRAS, ISO and Spitzer. The data seem to indicate that about 70% of the
co-moving star-formation rate density at 0.5<z<3 is obscured by dust and that
AGN, including obscured sources, account for <20% of the co-moving bolometric
luminosity density. There is tentative evidence that the mode of star-formation
changes as a function of redshift; star-formation at z~2 is preferentially in
massive, ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) while z~1 sources are
luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) which are about 1 mag fainter than ULIRGs in
the near-infrared. This evolution of the star-formation mode, is similar to the
evolution of the redshift distribution of X-ray sources as a function of X-ray
luminosity and would suggest an extension of the downsizing hypothesis to
include both AGN and star-forming galaxies. Measuring dust-enshrouded
star-formation at z>3 will become possible only with future facilities like
ALMA. Currently, the presence of dust can only be assessed in a small fraction
of the youngest starbursts at z>5 by looking for redshifted large equivalent
width H_alpha emission in broadband filters like the IRAC 4.5 micron passband.
H_alpha to UV ratios in these objects are a tracer of dust extinction and
measuring this ratio in GOODS galaxies indicate dust in ~20% of star-forming
galaxies at z>5. Finally, implications for reionization based on the measured
stellar mass density and star-formation rates of galaxies at these redshifts
are discussed.

absence of dust features over the 5-40 micron range make it unlikely that
thermal dust emission dominates the mid-infrared luminosity. We also detect the
presence of molecular hydrogen in emission which is asymmetrically redshifted
by ~500-1000 km/s from the systemic velocity of the galaxy. Since the
forbidden, low ionization lines in this galaxy are at the systemic velocity, we
suggest that the molecular hydrogen emission arises from a rotating molecular

improved the convergence of generic path integrals for transition amplitudes.
This was achieved by analytically constructing a hierarchy of $N$-fold
discretized effective actions $S^{(p)}_N$ labeled by a whole number $p$ and
starting at $p=1$ from the naively discretized action in the mid-point
prescription. The derivation guaranteed that the level $p$ effective actions
lead to discretized transition amplitudes differing from the continuum limit by
a term of order $1/N^p$. Here we extend the applicability of the above method
to the calculation of energy expectation values. This is done by constructing
analytical expressions for energy estimators of a general theory for each level
$p$. As a result of this energy expectation values converge to the continuum as
$1/N^p$. Finally, we perform a series of Monte Carlo simulations of several
models, show explicitly the derived increase in convergence, and the ensuing
speedup in numerical calculation of energy expectation values of many orders of
magnitude.

We will concentrate on infinitely long states whose first and last eigenvalues
localize at the edge of the droplet. Each constituent string-bit has a complex

real. For given Q and P, the minimum energy of the chain of string-bits is
realized when the Q+1 eigenvalues are equally spaced on one and the same line
segment joining the two outmost eigenvalues localized on the edge with angular
difference P. Such configuration of bound string-bits precisely reproduces the

a pair of straight and circular strings. The existence of such non-linear
superposition of two strings becomes possible due to self-interaction terms in
the Yang-Mills action which suppress contribution of the circular string near

essential features of certain objects of Probability theory, notably Gaussian
processes and limit theorems, may be better understood if they are considered
in settings that do not impose structures extraneous to the problems at hand.
For instance, in the case of sample continuity and boundedness of Gaussian
processes, the essential feature is the metric or pseudometric structure
induced on the index set by the covariance structure of the process, regardless
of what the index set may be. This point of view ultimately led to the
Fernique-Talagrand majorizing measure characterization of sample boundedness
and continuity of Gaussian processes, thus solving an important problem posed
by Kolmogorov. Similarly, separable Banach spaces provided a minimal setting
for the law of large numbers, the central limit theorem and the law of the
iterated logarithm, and this led to the elucidation of the minimal (necessary
and/or sufficient) geometric properties of the space under which different
forms of these theorems hold. However, in light of renewed interest in
Empirical processes, a subject that has considerably influenced modern
Statistics, one had to deal with a non-separable Banach space, namely
$\mathcal{L}_{\infty}$. With separability discarded, the techniques developed
for Gaussian processes and for limit theorems and inequalities in separable
Banach spaces, together with combinatorial techniques, led to powerful
inequalities and limit theorems for sums of independent bounded processes over
general index sets, or, in other words, for general empirical processes.

by imposing a probability space. A PICG is given by: (1) class B of initial
graphs, the basis of PICG, (2) class R of generating rules, each with
distinguished left element to which the rule is applied to obtain the right
element, (3) probability distribution specifying how the initial graph is
chosen from class B, (4) probability distribution specifying how the rules from

the left elements for every rule in class R are chosen. We point out that many
of the existing models of growing networks can be cast as PICGs. We present how

particularly important in more complex settings, that is, observational studies
or randomized experiments with complications such as noncompliance. The topic
of this lecture, the issue of estimating the causal effect of a treatment on a
primary outcome that is ``censored'' by death, is another such complication.
For example, suppose that we wish to estimate the effect of a new drug on
Quality of Life (QOL) in a randomized experiment, where some of the patients
die before the time designated for their QOL to be assessed. Another example
with the same structure occurs with the evaluation of an educational program
designed to increase final test scores, which are not defined for those who
drop out of school before taking the test. A further application is to studies
of the effect of job-training programs on wages, where wages are only defined
for those who are employed. The analysis of examples like these is greatly
clarified using potential outcomes to define causal effects, followed by
principal stratification on the intermediated outcomes (e.g., survival).

$\lambda$, the underlying rate of the Poisson process, is a parameter to be

  $\Delta_n \to 0$, $n\Delta_n = T \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$. We show that
previously proposed moment type estimators are consistent and asymptotically
normal but not efficient. We study further an approximated moment type
estimator which is still not efficient but comes in explicit form. For this
estimator the additional assumption $n\Delta_n^3 \to 0$ is required in order to
obtain asymptotic normality. Finally, we propose a new estimator which is
consistent, asymptotically normal and asymptotically efficient under no

only when the gradient field points from large to small clusters. A remarkable
finding is that, if the gradient field is sufficiently strong,
synchronizability of the network is mainly determined by the properties of the
subnetworks in the two largest clusters. These results are verified by
numerical eigenvalue analysis and by direct simulation of synchronization
dynamics on coupled-oscillator networks.

two walls. They attract and annihilate if $2z(0)$ is smaller than $2z_u$. Two
N\'eel walls with $h$ lying between $\sqrt{\gamma^2 + 1/9}$ and a threshold

of like chiralities repel -- except near the critical driving strength, where
the difference between the like-handed and oppositely-handed walls becomes
negligible. In this limit, similarly-handed walls at large separations repel
while those placed at shorter distances may start moving in the same direction

same mathematics, and for zero entropy states it reduces to standard unitary
QM. The nonlinear dynamical group of QT is construed so that the second law
emerges as a theorem of existence and uniqueness of a stable equilibrium state
for each set of mean values of the energy and the number of constituents. It
implements two fundamental ansatzs. The first is that in addition to the
standard QM states described by idempotent density operators (zero entropy), a
strictly isolated system admits also states that must be described by
non-idempotent density operators (nonzero entropy). The second is that for such
additional states the law of causal evolution is determined by the simultaneous
action of a Schroedinger-von Neumann-type Hamiltonian generator and a nonlinear
dissipative generator which conserves the mean values of the energy and the
number of constituents, and (in forward time) drives any density operator, no
matter how far from TE, in the 'direction' of steepest entropy ascent (maximal
entropy increase). The equation of motion can be solved not only in forward
time, to describe relaxation towards TE, but also backwards in time, to
reconstruct the 'ancestral' or primordial lowest entropy state or limit cycle
