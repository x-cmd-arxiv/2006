made in the treatment of neutrino transport and weak interactions. This
progress has led to a new generation of sophisticated Newtonian and
relativistic hydrodynamics simulations in spherical symmetry. Based on these,
it is now clear that the prompt bounce-shock mechanism is not the driver of
supernova explosions, and that the delayed neutrino-heating mechanism can
produce explosions without the aid of multi-dimensional processes only if the
progenitor star has an ONeMg core inside a very dilute He-core, i.e., has a
mass in the 8--10 solar mass range. Hydrodynamic instabilities of various kinds
have indeed been recognized to occur in the supernova core and to be of
potential importance for the explosion. Neutrino-driven explosions, however,
have been seen in two-dimensional simulations with sophisticated neutrino
transport so far only when the star has a small iron core and low density in
the surrounding shells as being found in stars near 10--11 solar masses. The
explosion mechanism of more massive progenitors is still a puzzle. It might
involve effects of three-dimensional hydrodynamics or might point to the

absolute spreads about the sequences with age. Finally the empirical isochrones
allow us to place the groups in order of age, independently of theory. The

The direct Urca (DU) problem consists in a narrowing of the NS population at

broadening of the population beyond the range of the typical mass window of 1.1

superposed to a general trend, a big jump by about 0.2 in phase is visible,
starting at day 14 after the beginning of the outburst. An analysis of the

the fundamental and the first harmonic separately, we find that the phase
delays of the first harmonic are more regular, with no sign of the jump
observed in the fundamental. The fitting of the phase delays of the first
harmonic with a model which takes into account the observed exponential decay
of the X-ray flux (and therefore of the mass accretion rate onto the neutron
star) gives important information on the torque acting on the neutron star
during the outburst. We find that the source shows spin-up in the first part of
the outburst, while a spin-down dominates at the end. From these results we
derive an estimate of the neutron star magnetic field strength.

is based on an iterative process which simultaneously allows to determine the
Point Spread Function (PSF) and to perform a deconvolution of images containing
several point sources plus extended structures. As such, it is well adapted to
the processing of gravitational lens images, especially in the case of multiply
imaged quasars. Two sets of data have been analysed : the first one, which has
been obtained through the F160W filter in 1997, basically corresponds to a
continuum image, while the second one, obtained through the narrower F180M
filter in 2003, is centered around the forbidden [OIII] emission lines at the
source redshift, thus probing the narrow-line region of the quasar. The
deconvolution gives astrometric and photometric measurements in both filters
and reveals the primary lensing galaxy as well as a partial Einstein ring. The
high accuracy of the results is particularly important in order to model the
lensing system and to reconstruct the source undergoing the strong lensing. The
reliability of the method is checked on a synthetic image similar to H1413+117.

This process is self-limiting in the sense that, when the black hole mass has
grown to a significant fraction of the core mass, simple angular momentum
conserving orbits are restored and accretion reverts to the slow viscous mode.
The mechanism depends upon the pre-existence of constant density cores in

function that is robust against the effects of redshift space distortions and
large scale structures. The estimator is a weighted integral of the redshift
space or angular correlation function and is a convolution of the real space
correlation function with a localized filter. This allows a direct comparison
with theory, without modeling redshift space distortions and the large scale
correlation function. This has a number of advantages over the more traditional
w_p estimator, including (i) an insensitivity to large scale structures and the
details of the truncation of the line of sight integral, (ii) a compact kernel
in xi(r), and (iii) being unbinned. We discuss how this estimator would be used
in practice, applying it to a sample of mock galaxies selected from the
Millennium simulation.

December. The absorption column densities, $N_{\rm H, fit}$, are determined
from powerlaw fits to the X-ray spectra with the absorption column density left
as a free parameter. We find that higher excess absorption column densities
with $\Delta N_{\rm H} > 2\times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ are only present in bursts
with redshifts z$<$2. Low absorption column densities with $\Delta N_{\rm H} <
1\times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ appear preferentially in high-redshift bursts. Our
interpretation is that this relation between redshift and excess column density
is an observational effect resulting from the shift of the source rest-frame
energy range below 1 keV out of the XRT observable energy range for high
redshift bursts. We found a clear anti-correlation between $\Delta N_{\rm H}$
and z that can be used to estimate the range of the maximum redshift of an
afterglow. A critical application of our finding is that rapid X-ray
observations can be used to optimize the instrumentation used for ground-based
optical/NIR follow-up observations. Ground-based spectroscopic redshift
measurements of as many bursts as possible are crucial for GRB science.

galaxies. They therefore represent a key phase in galaxy evolution which can be
missed in optical surveys. Determining their contribution to the global star
formation rate requires dissecting their IR emission into contributions from
starbursts (SB) and active galactic nuclei (AGN). There are several examples of
AGN systems which masquerade as SBs in either the IR or X-ray, and SBs can
often look like AGN in some wavebands. A combination of SB and AGN emission is
not unreasonable, given models of merger-driven evolution. To assess in detail
what powers the intense IR luminosity of sub-mm galaxies it is important to
obtain a complete multi-wavelength picture. Mid-IR spectroscopy is a
particularly good probe of where the intense IR luminosity is coming from. We
present the first results from a program to obtain Spitzer IRS spectroscopy of
a sample of high redshift galaxies in the GOODS-N field, a large fraction of

optical, IR and radio data. We piece together the sub-mm data with the Spitzer
photometry and IRS spectra to provide a well sampled IR spectral energy
distribution (SED) of sub-mm galaxies and determine the contribution to the
bolometric luminosity from the AGN and SB components.

unusually strong Ly-alpha emission, compared with the general population of

Ly-alpha/HeII values consistent with or above standard photoionization model
predictions.
  We show that the most successful explanation is the presence of a young
stellar population which provides the extra supply of ionizing photons required
to explain the Ly-alpha excess in at least the most extreme LAEs (probably in
all of them).
  The measurement of unusually high Ly-alpha ratios in the extended gas of some
high redshift radio galaxies suggests that star formation activity occurs in
spatial scales of tens of kpc.
  We argue that, although the fraction of LAEs may be incompletely determined,
both at 2<z<3 and at z>3, the much larger fraction of LAEs found at z>3 is a
genuine redshift evolution and not due to selection effects. Therefore, our
results suggest that the radio galaxy phenomenon is more often associated with
a massive starburst at z>3 than at z<3.

are correlated with sigma while [Fe/H] and Log(age) are not. In addition, both
abundance ratios [CN/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] increase with sigma. Furthermore, the
[CN/H]-sigma and [CN/Fe]-sigma slopes are steeper for galaxies in very rich
clusters than those in the less dense Virgo and Coma clusters. On the other
hand, [Mg/H]-sigma and [Mg/Fe]-sigma slopes keep constant as functions of the
environment. Our results are compatible with a scenario in which the stellar
populations of massive elliptical galaxies, independently of their environment
and mass, had formation timescales shorter than ~1 Gyr. This result implies
that massive elliptical galaxies have evolved passively since, at least, as
long ago as z~2. For a given galaxy mass the duration of star formation is
shorter in those galaxies belonging to more dense environments; whereas the
mass-metallicity relation appears to be also a function of the cluster
properties: the denser the environment is, the steeper are the correlations.
Finally, we show that the abundance ratios [CN/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] are the key
""chemical clocks"" to infer the star formation history timescales in
ellipticals. In particular, [Mg/Fe] provides an upper limit for those formation
timescales, while [CN/Fe] apperars to be the most suitable parameter to resolve

redshift we confirm the existence of a steep colour-density relation, with the
fraction of the reddest(/bluest) galaxies of the same luminosity
increasing(/decreasing) as a function of density, this trend progressively
disappears in the highest redshift bins investigated.Our results suggest the
existence of an epoch (more remote for brighter galaxies) characterized by the
absence of the colour-density relation on the R=5 h^(-1)Mpc scales

the R=5 h^(-1)Mpc scales, appear to be a transient, cumulative product of
genetic and environmental factors that have been operating over at least a

bservational and theoretical interest in these phenomena. As a consequence a
large analysis effort started within the community to characterize the
phenomenon and at the same time a variety of theoretical speculations have been
proposed to explain it. In this presentation we discuss part of the results we
obtained analyzing a first statistical sample of GRBs observed with Swift. The
first goal of this research is very simple: derive those observational
properties that could distinguish between internal and external shock and
between an ever active central engine and delayed shocks (refreshing) related
to a very small initial Lorentz bulk factor. We discuss first the method of
analysis and the morphology evidencing the similarities such flares have with
the prompt emission pulses. We conclude that GRB flares are due to internal
shocks and leave still open the question of whether or not the central engine
is active for a time of the order of 105 seconds after the prompt emission.

ultraluminous galaxies since I(HNC)>I(HCN) is usually taken as a signature of
cold (10 - 20 K) dark clouds. Since the molecular gas of the studied galaxies
is warm (T_k > 40 K) we present two alternative explanations to the
overluminous HNC: a) HNC excitation is affected by pumping of the rotational
levels through the mid-infrared continuum and b) XDRs (X-ray Dominated Regions)
influence the abundances of HNC. HNC may become pumped at 21.5 micron
brightness temperatures of 50 K, suggesting that HNC-pumping could be common in
warm, ultraluminous galaxies with compact IR-nuclei.On the other hand, all
three galaxies are either suspected of having buried AGN - or the presence of
AGN is clear (Mrk231) - indicating that X-rays may affect the ISM chemistry. We
conclude that both the pumping and XDR alternatives imply molecular cloud
ensembles distinctly different from those of typical starforming regions in the
Galaxy, or the ISM of less extreme starburst galaxies. The HNC molecule shows
the potential of becoming an additional important tracer of extreme nuclear
environments.

and the detailed knowledge of the spectrum of masses of such cores is clearly a
key for the understanding of the origin of the IMF. To date, observations have
presented somewhat contradictory evidence relating to this issue. Aims: In this
paper we propose to derive the mass function of a complete sample of dense
molecular cores in a single cloud employing a robust method that uses uses
extinction of background starlight to measure core masses and enables the
reliable extension of such measurements to lower masses than previously
possible. Methods: We use a map of near-infrared extinction in the nearby Pipe
dark cloud to identify the population of dense cores in the cloud and measure
their masses. Results: We identify 159 dense cores and construct the mass
function for this population. We present the first robust evidence for a
departure from a single power-law form in the mass function of a population of
cores and find that this mass function is surprisingly similar in shape to the
stellar IMF but scaled to a higher mass by a factor of about 3. This suggests
that the distribution of stellar birth masses (IMF) is the direct product of
the dense core mass function and a uniform star formation efficiency of
30%+/-10%, and that the stellar IMF may already be fixed during or before the
earliest stages of core evolution. These results are consistent with previous
dust continuum studies which suggested that the IMF directly originates from
the core mass function. The typical density of ~10^4/cm^3 measured for the
dense cores in this cloud suggests that the mass scale that characterizes the
dense core mass function may be the result of a simple process of thermal
(Jeans) fragmentation.

temperatures (T~Tc~!D~100 K, where Tc is superconducting critical temperature
and !D is the Debye temperature) induce phonon-phonon scattering in ordered

suggest the boson that couples Cooper pairs in Bi2SrCa2Cu2O8 is incoherent ion
vibration caused by disorder, which is observed from ~100 K down to 4 K.
Phonons are not well-defined in BSSCO and its coherence length is comparable to
the dimension of its unit cell (~1 nm), as for other oxides. Sr2CuO3+d (Tc=95
K) has a crystal structure that enables experimental demonstration that
disorder of apical oxygen atoms has a strong affect on Tc. Disorder in sold
oxides on an atomic scale and the temperature dependence of phonons at high
temperatures (T~!D) probably must be taken into account to understand HTS.
There are several reasons to believe that LMH will be a high temperature
superconductor and no known reason why LMH cannot be one.

mangetoresistance becomes linear in field. We associate this with a transition
of the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Berezinskii (KTB) type. At our measurement
frequencies the superfluid stiffness at T_KTB is found to be larger than the
universal value. Although this may be understood with a vortex dielectric
constant of epsilon_v ~ 1.9 within the usual KTB theory, this is a relatively
large value and indicates that such a system may be out of the domain of
applicability of the low-fugacity (low vortex density) KTB treatment. This
opens up the possibility that at least some of the discrepancy from a
non-universal magnitude is intrinsic. Our finite frequency measurements allow
us access to a number of other phenomena concerning the charge dynamics in

absence of interactions between electrons, this corresponds to filling up the

modes above the transition. On the other hand, strongly interacting
one-dimensional electrons form a Wigner crystal, and the transition corresponds
to it splitting into two chains (zigzag crystal). The two chains are locked, so
their relative motion is gapped, and only one gapless mode remains. We study
the evolution of the system as the interaction strength changes, and show that
only one gapless mode exists near the transition at any interaction strength.

predicting natural geophysical hazards or in designing industrial processes.
However, the constitutive equations for dry granular flows, which govern how
the material moves under shear, are still a matter of debate. One difficulty is
that grains can behave like a solid (in a sand pile), a liquid (when poured
from a silo) or a gas (when strongly agitated). For the two extreme regimes,
constitutive equations have been proposed based on kinetic theory for
collisional rapid flows, and soil mechanics for slow plastic flows. However,
the intermediate dense regime, where the granular material flows like a liquid,
still lacks a unified view and has motivated many studies over the past decade.
The main characteristics of granular liquids are: a yield criterion (a critical
shear stress below which flow is not possible) and a complex dependence on
shear rate when flowing. In this sense, granular matter shares similarities
with classical visco-plastic fluids such as Bingham fluids. Here we propose a
new constitutive relation for dense granular flows, inspired by this analogy
and recent numerical and experimental work. We then test our three-dimensional
(3D) model through experiments on granular flows on a pile between rough
sidewalls, in which a complex 3D flow pattern develops. We show that, without
any fitting parameter, the model gives quantitative predictions for the flow
shape and velocity profiles. Our results support the idea that a simple
visco-plastic approach can quantitatively capture granular flow properties, and
could serve as a basic tool for modelling more complex flows in geophysical or
industrial applications.

density of measured variables expressed by experimental data via a kernel
estimator. As an objective kernel the scattering function determined by

definition of experimental information and redundancy of experimentation in
terms of information entropy. The redundancy increases with the number of
experiments, while the experimental information converges to a value that
describes the complexity of the data. The difference between the redundancy and
the experimental information is proposed as the model cost function. From its
minimum, a proper number of data in the model is estimated. As an optimal,
nonparametric estimator of the relation between measured variables the
conditional average extracted from the kernel estimator is proposed. The
modeling is demonstrated on noisy chaotic data.

for the influence of loops in the graphical model. The method is applicable to
arbitrary factor graphs, provided that the size of the Markov blankets is not
too large. It is an alternative implementation of an idea introduced recently
by Montanari and Rizzo (2005). In its simplest form, which amounts to the
assumption that no loops are present, the method reduces to the minimal Cluster
Variation Method approximation (which uses maximal factors as outer clusters).
On the other hand, using estimates of the effect of loops (obtained by some
approximate inference algorithm) and applying the Loop Correcting (LC) method
usually gives significantly better results than applying the approximate
inference algorithm directly without loop corrections. Indeed, we often observe
that the loop corrected error is approximately the square of the error of the
approximate inference method used to estimate the effect of loops. We compare
different variants of the Loop Correcting method with other approximate
inference methods on a variety of graphical models, including ""real world""
networks, and conclude that the LC approach generally obtains the most accurate
results.

holes are especially interesting sources of gravitational waves for LISA. We
investigate whether the emitted waveforms can be used to strongly constrain the
geometry of the central massive object, and in essence check that it
corresponds to a Kerr black hole (BH). For a Kerr BH, all multipole moments of
the spacetime have a simple, unique relation to $M$ and $S$, the BH's mass and
spin; in particular, the spacetime's mass quadrupole moment is given by $Q=-
S^2/M$. Here we treat $Q$ as an additional parameter, independent of $M$ and
$S$, and ask how well observation can constrain its difference from the Kerr
value. This was already estimated by Ryan, but for simplified (circular,
equatorial) orbits, and neglecting signal modulations due to the motion of the
LISA satellites. Here we consider generic orbits and include these modulations.
We use a family of approximate (post-Newtonian) waveforms, which represent the
full parameter space of Inspiral sources, and exhibit the main qualitative
features of true, general relativistic waveforms. We extend this parameter
space to include (in an approximate manner) an arbitrary value of $Q$, and
construct the Fisher information matrix for the extended parameter space. By
inverting the Fisher matrix we estimate how accurately $Q$ could be extracted
from LISA observations. For 1 year of coherent data from the inspiral of a $10
M_{\odot}$ BH into rotating BHs of masses $10^{5.5} M_{\odot}$, $10^6
M_{\odot}$, or $10^{6.5} M_{\odot}$, we find $\Delta (Q/M^3) \sim 10^{-4}$,
$10^{-3}$, or $10^{-2}$, respectively (assuming total signal-to-noise ratio of
100, typical of the brightest detectable EMRIs). These results depend only
weakly on the eccentricity of the orbit or the BH's spin.

violation is absent in the $\mu$-$\tau$ symmetric limit, leptonic CP violation
is sensitive to the $\mu$-$\tau$ symmetry breaking, whose effect can be
evaluated by perturbation. It is found that the Dirac phase ($\delta$) arises
from the $\mu$-$\tau$ symmetry breaking part of ${\rm\bf M}_{e\mu,e\tau}$ and
an additional phase ($\rho$) is associated with the $\mu$-$\tau$ symmetric part
of ${\rm\bf M}_{e\mu,e\tau}$, where ${\rm\bf M}_{ij}$ stands for an $ij$ matrix
element ($i,j$=$e,\mu,\tau$). The phase $\rho$ is redundant and can be removed
but leaves its effect in the Dirac CP violation characterized by $\sin (\delta

parameters including that of $\delta$ and $\rho$, which turns out to be free
from the effects of the redundant phases. As a result, it is generally shown
that the maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing necessarily accompanies either
$\sin\theta_{13}=0$ or $\cos(\delta+\rho)=0$, the latter of which indicates
maximal CP violation, where $\theta_{13}$ is the $\nu_e$-$\nu_\tau$ mixing

to determine the neutrino mixing angles and the CP phase delta. We conduct a
systematic analysis of the neutrino mixing probabilities and of various flux

from pion, neutron and muon-damped sources. Explicit formulae in case of mu-tau
symmetry and its special case tri-bimaximal mixing are obtained, and the
leading corrections due to non-zero theta_{13} and non-maximal theta_{23} are
given. The first order correction is universal as it appears in basically all
ratios. We study in detail its dependence on theta_{13}, theta_{23} and the CP
phase, finding that the dependence on theta_{23} is strongest. The flavor
compositions for the considered neutrino sources are evaluated in terms of this
correction. A measurement of a flux ratio is a clean measurement of the
universal correction (and therefore of theta_{13}, theta_{23} and delta) if the
zeroth order ratio does not depend on theta_{12}. This favors pion sources over
the other cases, which in turn are good candidates to probe theta_{12}. The
only situations in which the universal correction does not appear are certain
ratios in case of a neutron and muon-damped source, which depend mainly on
theta_{12} and receive only quadratic corrections from the other parameters. We
further show that there are only two independent neutrino oscillation
probabilities, give the allowed ranges of the considered flux ratios and of all

inflate and has no gravitational effects on a 4D observer, since its 4D tension

given at the 6th Peyresq meeting ``Integrable systems and quantum field
theory''. In this lecture, we make an overview of some of the mathematical
results which motivated the development of what is called noncommutative
geometry. The first of these results is the theorem by Gelfand and Neumark
about commutative $C^\ast$-algebras; then come some aspects of the
$K$-theories, first for topological spaces, then for $C^\ast$-algebras and
finally the purely algebraic version. Cyclic homology is introduced, keeping in
mind its relation to differential structures. The last result is the
construction of the Chern character, which shows how these developments are
related to each other.

  http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00118044",,,,"math-ph hep-th math.MP",,"  Very high energy physics needs a coherent description of the four fundamental
forces. Non-commutative geometry is a promising mathematical framework which
already allowed to unify the general relativity and the standard model, at the
classical level, thanks to the spectral action principle. Quantum field
theories on non-commutative spaces is a first step towards the quantification
of such a model. These theories can't be obtained simply by writing usual field
theory on non-commutative spaces. Such attempts exhibit indeed a new type of
divergencies, called ultraviolet/infrared mixing, which prevents
renormalisability. H. Grosse and R. Wulkenhaar showed, with an example, that a
modification of the propagator may restore renormalisability. This thesis aims
at studying the generalization of such a method. We studied two different
models which allowed to specify certain aspects of non-commutative field
theory. In x space, the major technical difficulty is due to oscillations in
the interaction part. We generalized the results of T. Filk in order to exploit
such oscillations at best. We were then able to distinguish between two
mixings, renormalizable or not. We also bring the notion of orientability to
light : the orientable non-commutative Gross-Neveu model is renormalizable
without any modification of its propagator. The adaptation of multi-scale
analysis to the matrix basis emphasized the importance of dual graphs and
represents a first step towards a formulation of field theory independent of
the underlying space.

thus gave rise to parafree groups. A group G is termed parafree of rank n if it
is residually nilpotent and shares the lower central sequence with a free group
of rank n. The deviation of a finitely generated (fg) parafree group G is the
difference between the minimum possible number of generators of G and the rank
of G.
  Let G be a fg group, then Hom(G,SL(2, C)) inherits the structure of an

goes to infinity) is related to the problem of Hele-Shaw flows on curved
surfaces, considered by Entov and the first author in 1990-s. In the case when
the potential function is the sum of a rotationally invariant function and the
real part of a polynomial of the complex coordinate, we use this relation and
the conformal mapping method developed by Entov and the first author to find
the shape of the support domain explicitly (up to finitely many undetermined

case when the rotationally invariant function is $\beta |z|^2$, this is done by
Wiegmann-Zabrodin and Elbau-Felder. We apply our results to the generalized
normal matrix model, which deals with random block matrices that give rise to
*-representations of the deformed preprojective algebra of the affine quiver of

called nearly conservative case) is investigated. The changes in the
bifurcation structure of the parameter plane while decreasing the dissipation
are revealed. It is shown that when the dissipation is very weak the system
demonstrates an ""intermediate"" type of dynamics combining the peculiarities of
conservative and dissipative dynamics. The correspondence between the
trajectories in the phase space in conservative case and the transformations of
the set of initial conditions in the nearly conservative case is revealed. The
dramatic increase of number of coexisting low-period attractors and the
extraordinary growth of the transient time while the dissipation decreases have
been revealed. The method of plotting a bifurcation trees for the set of
initial conditions has been used to classify existing attractors by it's
structure. Also it was shown that most of coexisting attractors are destroyed
by rather small external noise, and the transient time in noisy driven systems
increases still more. The new method of two-parameter analysis of conservative

from a ``microscopic'' view point: How many adherents belong to one religion?
Does the number of adherents increase or not, and how? No need to say that if

imagined to describe such non-equilibrium processes.

system. A linear time trend is imposed on the parameter $T_E$, descriptive of
the forced equator-to-pole temperature gradient and responsible for setting the
average baroclinicity in the model. The focus lies on establishing a
theoretically sound framework for the detection and assessment of trend at
extreme values of the generated time series. This problem is dealt with by
fitting time-dependent Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) models to sequences of
yearly maxima of the total energy. A family of GEV models is used in which the
location $\mu$ and scale parameters $\sigma$ depend quadratically and linearly
on time, respectively, while the shape parameter $\xi$ is kept constant. From
this family, a model is selected by using diagnostic graphical tools, such as
probability and quantile plots, and by means of the likelihood ratio test. The
inferred location and scale parameters are found to depend in a rather smooth
way on time and, therefore, on $T_E$. In particular, power-law dependences of
$\mu$ and $\sigma$ on $T_E$ are obtained, in analogy with the results of a
previous work where the same baroclinic model was run with fixed values of
$T_E$ spanning the same range as in this case. It is emphasized under which
conditions the adopted approach is valid.

  review in a journal",,,,"q-bio.NC q-bio.QM",,"  In this paper phase of a signal has been viewed from a different angle.
According to this view a signal can have countably infinitely many phases, one
associated with each Fourier component. In other words each frequency has a
phase associated with it. It has been shown that if two signals are phase
synchronous then the difference between phases at a given component changes
very slowly across the subsequent components. This leads to an FFT based phase
synchronization measuring algorithm between any two signals. The algorithm does
not take any more time than the FFT itself. Mathematical motivations as well as
some results of implementation of the algorithm on artificially generated
signals and real EEG signals have been presented.

that of the population density, particularly with respect to Allee effects. We
examine the model analytically and by Monte Carlo simulations and find that,
while the size of the habitat is important, there exists a critical population
density below which extinction is assured. This has large consequences with
respect to conservation, especially in the design of habitats and for
populations whose density has become small. In particular, we find that the
probability of survival for small populations can be increased by a reduction
in the size of the habitat and show that there exists an optimal size
reduction.

We find an upper bound on the squeezing parameter for the state to exhibit

single-photon subtracted squeezed states. We present results for two different
models of decoherence, viz. amplitude decay model and the phase diffusion
model. In each case we give analytical results for the time evolution of the

show through the study of their phase-space properties how these states decay

multiphoton two-mode states of radiation in the presence of losses. The
protocol are based on photon number correlations and realized upon choosing a
shared set of thresholds to convert the outcome of a joint photon number
measurement into a symbol from a discrete alphabet. In particular, we focus on
channels build using feasible photon-number entangled states (PNES) as two-mode
coherently-correlated (TMC) or twin-beam (TWB) states and compare their
performances with that of channels built using feasible classically correlated
(separable) states. We found that PNES provide larger channel capacity in the
presence of loss, and that TWB-based channels may transmit a larger amount of
information than TMC-based ones at fixed energy and overall loss. Optimized bit
discrimination thresholds, as well as the corresponding maximized mutual
information, are explicitly evaluated as a function of the beam intensity and
the loss parameter. The propagation of TMC and TWB in lossy channels is
analyzed and the joint photon number distribution is evaluated, showing that
the beam statistics, either sub-Poissonian for TMC or super-Poissonian for TWB,
is not altered by losses. Although entanglement is not strictly needed to
establish the channels, which are based on photon-number correlations owned
also by separable mixed states, purity of the support state is relevant to
increase security. The joint requirement of correlation and purity individuates
PNES as a suitable choice to build effective channels. The effects of losses on
channel security are briefly discussed.

sudden jumps between its states. The detection of this essential quantum
feature requires a quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement repeated many times
during the system evolution. Quantum jumps of trapped massive particles
(electrons, ions or molecules) have been observed, which is not the case of the
jumps of light quanta. Usual photodetectors absorb light and are thus unable to
detect the same photon twice. They must be replaced by a transparent counter
'seeing' photons without destroying them3. Moreover, the light has to be stored
over a duration much longer than the QND detection time. We have fulfilled
these challenging conditions and observed photon number quantum jumps.
Microwave photons are stored in a superconducting cavity for times in the
second range. They are repeatedly probed by a stream of non-absorbing atoms. An
atom interferometer measures the atomic dipole phase shift induced by the
non-resonant cavity field, so that the final atom state reveals directly the
presence of a single photon in the cavity. Sequences of hundreds of atoms
highly correlated in the same state, are interrupted by sudden
state-switchings. These telegraphic signals record, for the first time, the
birth, life and death of individual photons. Applying a similar QND procedure
to mesoscopic fields with tens of photons opens new perspectives for the
exploration of the quantum to classical boundary.

of angle and action variables phi in R mod 2 pi and I > 0. But the symplectic
transformation (\phi,I) to (q,p) is singular for (q,p) = (0,0). Globally
{(q,p)} has the structure of the plane R^2, but {(phi,I)} that of the punctured
plane R^2 -(0,0). This implies qualitative differences for the QM of the two
phase spaces: The quantizing group for the plane R^2 consists of the (centrally
extended) translations generated by {q,p,1}, but the corresponding group for
{(phi,I)} is SO(1,2) = Sp(2,R)/Z_2, (Sp(2,R): symplectic group of the plane),
with Lie algebra basis {h_0 = I, h_1 = I cos phi, h_2 = - I sin phi}. In the QM
for the (phi,I)-model the three h_j correspond to self-adjoint generators K_j,
j=0,1,2, of irreducible unitary representations (positive discrete series) for
SO(1,2) or one of its infinitely many covering groups, the Bargmann index k > 0
of which determines the ground state energy E (k, n=0) = hbar omega k of the
(phi,I)-Hamiltonian H(K). For an m-fold covering the lowest possible value is
k=1/m, which can be made arbitrarily small! The operators Q and P, now
expressed as functions of the K_j, keep their usual properties, but the richer
structure of the K_j quantum model of the HO is ``erased'' when passing to the
simpler Q,P model! The (phi,I)-variant of the HO implies many experimental
tests: Mulliken-type experiments for isotopic diatomic molecules, experiments
with harmonic traps for atoms, ions and BE-condensates, with the (Landau)
levels of charged particles in magnetic fields, with the propagation of light
in vacuum, passing through electric or magnetic fields. Finally it leads to a
new theoretical estimate for the quantum vacuum energy of fields and its
relation to the cosmological constant.
