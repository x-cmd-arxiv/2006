an accelerated inflation of the Universe (open Universe) as well as the
observed matter density showed to be less than the critical one, suggesting
that a large fraction of the energy density of the Universe is in the form of
dark energy with negative pressure (to supply repulsive forces). We present
here an alternative mechanism on the basis of the photon energy loss in the
inter-galactic gravitational field, and it is close to the Shapiro effect. It
is argue that the redshift observed in distant galaxies is a cumulativeprocess,
a dominant redshift due to the Doppler effect plus a redshift due to photon
energy loss in the intergalactic gravitational field. We show that the last
mechanism when interpreted as Doppler effect, supplies a non lineal
relationship among the speed of recession of the galaxies and their distances.
The effect is very tiny, even so, it increases with the distance and can be the
key to explain the anomalous redshift observed in distant supernovae without
the accelerated inflation hypothesis

scattered about the ideal relation, in a similar manner to the pattern seen in
the optical for normal galaxies at redshifts z < ~1. The instance-based

pseudo-blind-tested on the remaining unseen data. The variance between the

provides a good proxy for those photometric time series and can be used to test
the performance of different spot modelling approaches. We test discrete spot
models as well as maximum entropy and Tikhonov regularized spot models by
comparing the reconstructed total sunspot area variation and longitudinal

model performance versus the timescale of variation. The maximum entropy
regularized spot models show the best agreement with solar observations

systematic errors during the minimum and the maximum activity phases. The
longitudinal distributions derived from the models compare well with the

imaging shows that most of the UCDs have shallow or steep cusps in their cores;
only one UCD has a flat ``King'' core. None of the UCDs show tidal cutoffs down
to our limiting surface brightness. Spectroscopic analysis shows that Virgo
UCDs are older than 8 Gyr and have metallicities in the range
[Z/H]=-1.35...+0.35 dex. Five Virgo UCDs have super-solar alpha/Fe abundance
ratios typical of old stellar populations found in globular clusters and
elliptical galaxies. Virgo UCDs have structural and dynamical properties
similar to Fornax UCDs. The Virgo and Fornax UCDs all have masses ~2-9x10^7
Msun and mass-to-light ratios ~3-5 Msun/Lsun,v. The dynamical M/L values for
Virgo UCDs are consistent with SSP model predictions: Virgo UCDs do not require
dark matter to explain their mass-to-light ratios. We conclude that the
internal properties of Virgo UCDs are consistent with them being the
high-mass/high-luminosity extreme of known globular cluster populations. We
refrain from any firm conclusions on Fornax UCD origins until accurate age,
metallicity and alpha-abundance estimates are obtained for them. Some of our
results, notably the fundamental plane projections are consistent with the
formation of UCDs by the simple removal of the halo from the nuclei of
nucleated dwarf galaxies. However the ages, metallicities and abundances for
Virgo UCDs are not consistent with this simple stripping model. It might be
consistent with more sophisticated models of the stripping process that include
the effects of gas removal on the chemical evolution of the nuclei.

dwarf galaxies and one dwarf elliptical nucleus in the Fornax cluster from high
resolution spectroscopy. Methods. Velocity dispersions were derived from
selected wavelength regions using a direct-fitting method. To estimate the
masses of the UCDs a new modelling program has been developed that allows a
choice of different representations of the surface brightness profile (i.e.
Nuker, Sersic or King laws) and corrects the observed velocity dispersions for
observational parameters (i.e. seeing, slit size). Results. The observed
velocity dispersions range between 22 and 30 km/s. The resulting masses are
between 1.8 and 9.5x10^7M_sun. These, as well as the central and global
projected velocity dispersions, were derived from the generalized King model
which turned out to give the most stable results. The masses of two UCDs, that
are best fitted by a two-component profile, were derived from a combined
King+Sersic model. The mass-to-light ratios of the Fornax UCDs range between 3
and 5 (M/L_V)_sun. Within 1-2 half-mass radii dark matter is not dominating
UCDs. Conclusions. We show that the mass-to-light ratios of UCDs in Fornax are
consistent with those expected for pure stellar populations. Thus UCDs seem to
be the result of cluster formation processes within galaxies rather than being
compact dark matter dominated substructures themselves. Whether UCDs gained
their mass in super-star cluster complexes of mergers or in nuclear star
cluster formation processes remains an open question. It appears, however,
clear that star clusters more massive than about 5\times10^6M_sun exhibit a
more complex formation history than the less massive `ordinary' globular
clusters.

optical and X-ray properties. Between 1990 and 2000, in response to its optical
continuum decrease, the ``classical'' broad component of Hbeta almost
completely disappeared, with a factor of 10 decrease in the line flux. In the
X-ray band, this object was observed by Ginga in 1988 to have the hardest
quasar photon index, with Gamma=1.1+/-0.1. We present an XMM/EPIC observation
of PG1416-129 performed in July 2004. We analyze the time-averaged pn spectrum
of this quasar, as well as perform time-resolved spectroscopy. We find that
during the present XMM observation, PG1416-129 still has a rather hard photon
index, both in the soft and hard energy ranges, compared to radio-quiet quasars
but compatible with the photon index value found for radio-loud quasars. This
object also shows long-term luminosity variability over 16 years by a factor of
three with a variation of photon index from ~1.2 to ~1.8. In the soft energy
band (0.2-2keV), we found a very weak soft X-ray excess compared to other RQ
quasars. The whole time averaged spectrum is fit very well either by X-ray
ionized reflection from the accretion disk surface, by a warm absorber-emitter
plus power-law, or by a smeared absorption/emission from a relativistic
outflow. While no constant narrow FeK line at 6.4keV is observed, we find the
possible presence of two non-simultaneous transient iron lines: a redshifted
narrow iron line at about 5.5keV (96.4% confidence level according to
multi-trial Monte-Carlo simulations) at the beginning of this observation and
the appearance of a line at 6.3-6.4keV (99.1% c.l.) at the end of the
observation. These variable lines could be generated by discrete hot-spots on
the accretion disk surface.

prompt and the afterglow emission could be observed simultaneously and in their
entirety by the three Swift instruments and by Konus-Wind. Thanks to these
exceptional circumstances, the temporal and spectral properties of the prompt
emission could be studied in the optical, X-ray and gamma-ray ranges (up to 2
MeV). While the X-ray emission (0.2-10 keV) clearly tracks the gamma-ray burst,
the optical component follows a different pattern, likely indicating a
different origin, possibly the onset of external shocks. The prompt GRB
spectrum shows significant spectral evolution, with both the peak energy and
the spectral index varying. As observed in several long GRBs, significant lags
are measured between the hard- and low-energy components, showing that this
behaviour extends over 3 decades in energy. The GRB peaks are also much broader
at soft energies. This is related to the temporal evolution of the spectrum,
and can be accounted for by the softening of the electron spectral index with
time. The burst energy (E_iso~5x10^{53} erg at z=2.297) and average peak energy
(E_p~300 keV) make GRB 060124 consistent with the Amati relation. The X-ray
afterglow is characterized by a decay which presents a break at t_b~10^5s.

Scanlan and Case. We also consider effects of superbridges whose backbone is
formed by several chains connected in series with several breakable junctions
inside. Near the critical concentration for the sol/gel transition,
superbridges becomes infinitely long along the backbone, thereby leading to the
short relaxation time $\tau$ of the network. It is shown that $\tau$ is
proportional to the concentration deviation $\Delta$ near the gelation point.
The plateau modulus $G_{\infty}$ increases as the cube of $\Delta$ near the
gelation point as a result of the mean-field treatment, and hence the
zero-shear viscosity increases as $\eta_0\sim G_{\infty}\tau\sim\Delta^4$. The
dynamic shear moduli are well described in terms of the Maxwell model, and it

two-phase commit protocol is enhanced by replicating the coordinator and by
running a Byzantine agreement algorithm among the coordinator replicas. Our
protocol can tolerate Byzantine faults at the coordinator replicas and a subset
of malicious faults at the participants. A decision certificate, which includes
a set of registration records and a set of votes from participants, is used to
facilitate the coordinator replicas to reach a Byzantine agreement on the
outcome of each transaction. The certificate also limits the ways a faulty
replica can use towards non-atomic termination of transactions, or semantically
incorrect transaction outcomes.

In this scenario, multiple users communicate with an intended receiver in the

perfect secrecy for the transmitters in this multi-access environment. Using
Gaussian codebooks, an achievable secrecy region is determined and the power
allocation that maximizes the achievable sum-rate is found. Numerical results
showing the new rate region are presented. It is shown that the multiple-access
nature of the channel may be utilized to allow users with zero single-user
secrecy capacity to be able to transmit in perfect secrecy. In addition, a new
collaborative scheme is shown that may increase the achievable sum-rate. In
this scheme, a user who would not transmit to maximize the sum rate can help
another user who (i) has positive secrecy capacity to increase its rate, or
(ii) has zero secrecy capacity to achieve a positive secrecy capacity.

closely related to the tetrad frames which cannot be uniquely determined by the

and easily leads to ambiguous results. In this paper, we give a detailed
derivation for the energy-momentum tensor of Weyl and Dirac spinors. From the
results we find that, besides the usual kinetic energy momentum term, there are
three kinds of other additional terms. One is the nonlinear self-interactive
potential, which acts like negative pressure. The other reflects the
interaction of momentum $p^\mu$ with tetrad. The third is the spin-gravity
coupling term which is a higher order infinitesimal in weak field, but may be
important in a neutron star. This term is also closely related with magnetic
field of a celestial body. These results are based on the decomposition of
usual spin connection into geometrical part and dynamical part, which not only
makes calculation simpler, but also highlights their different physical

calculate the first two Gegenbauer coefficients for twist-3 distribution

coefficients of scalar density twist-3 distribution amplitudes for $K^{*}_0$
and $f_0$ mesons are quite close to that for $a_0$, which indicates that the

neglected for the forth Gegenbauer coefficients of scalar twist-3 distribution
amplitudes between $a_0$ and $f_0$. Besides, we also observe that the first two
Gegenbauer coefficients corresponding to the tensor current twist-3
distribution amplitudes for all the $a_0$, $K^{*}_0$ and $f_0$ are very small.

translate into lower bounds on the mass of the heavy fermions. These, however,

Previously suggested sequential or non-sequential algorithms, using a bounded

the expected number of steps is finite, except when the p-value is on the
threshold between rejecting and not rejecting. The algorithm is suitable as
standard for implementing tests that require (re-)sampling. It can also be used
in other situations: to check whether a test is conservative, iteratively to
implement double bootstrap tests, and to determine the sample size required for
a certain power.

that an observer who is located far away from the star and at rest with respect
to the Boyer Lindquist coordinates observes the emergence of a thermal state
when his proper time goes to infinity. We first introduce a model of the
collapse of the star. We suppose that the space-time outside the star is given
by the Kerr-Newman metric. The assumptions on the asymptotic behavior of the
surface of the star are inspired by the asymptotic behavior of certain timelike
geodesics in the Kerr-Newman metric. The Dirac equation is then written using
coordinates and a Newman-Penrose tetrad which are adapted to the collapse. This
coordinate system and tetrad are based on the so called simple null geodesics.
The quantization of Dirac fields in a globally hyperbolic space-time is
described. We formulate and prove a theorem about the Hawking effect in this
setting. The proof of the theorem contains a minimal velocity estimate for
Dirac fields that is slightly stronger than the usual ones and an existence and
uniqueness result for solutions of a characteristic Cauchy problem for Dirac
fields in the Kerr-Newman space-time. In an appendix we construct explicitly a

math.MG/0608536 . A dilatation structure on a metric space is a kind of
enhanced self-similarity. By way of examples this is explained here with the
help of the middle-thirds Cantor set.
  Linear and self-similar dilatation structures are introduced and studied on
ultrametric spaces, especially on the boundary of the dyadic tree (same as the
middle-thirds Cantor set).
  Some other examples of dilatation structures, which share some common
features, are given. Another class of examples, coming from sub-Riemannian
geometry, will make the subject of an article in preparation.
  In the particular case of ultrametric spaces the axioms of dilatation
structures take a simplified form, leading to a description of all possible
weak dilatation structures on the Cantor set.
  As an application we prove that there is more than one linear and
self-similar dilatation structure on the Cantor set, compatible with the
iterated functions system which defines the Cantor set.
  Applications to self-similar groups are reserved for a further paper.

""universal relations"" and studied their connection with tautological relations
in the cohomology ring of moduli spaces of stable curves.
  Building on Y.-P. Lee's work, we give a simple proof of the fact that every
tautological relation gives rise to a universal relation (which was also proved
by Y.-P. Lee modulo certain results announced by C. Teleman).
  In particular, this implies that in any semi-simple Gromov-Witten theory
where arbitrary correlators can be expressed in genus 0 correlators using only
tautological relations, the formal and the geometric Gromov-Witten potentials
coincide.
  As the most important application, we show that our results suffice to deduce
the statement of a 1991 Witten conjecture on r-spin structures from the results
obtained by Givental for the corresponding formal Gromov-Witten potential.
  The conjecture in question states that certain intersection numbers on the
moduli space of r-spin structures can be arranged into a power series that
satisfies the r-KdV (or r-th higher Gelfand-Dikii) hierarchy of partial

violation - the Stardard Model Extension and Noncommutative Field Theory - and
discuss in some detail the example of the modified spectrum of the synchrotron
radiation. Motivated by touching upon such a fundamental issue as Lorentz
symmetry, we ask three questions: What is behind the search for Lorentz
violation? Is String Theory a physical theory? Is there an alternative to
Supersymmetry?

expression by selectively binding to the 3-noncoding region of specific message
RNAs through base-pairing. Given the diversity and abundance of miRNA targets,
miRNAs appear to functionally interact with various components of many cellular
networks. By analyzing the interactions between miRNAs and a human cellular
signaling network, we found that miRNAs predominantly target positive
regulatory motifs, highly connected scaffolds and most downstream network
components such as signaling transcription factors, but less frequently target
negative regulatory motifs, common components of basic cellular machines and
most upstream network components such as ligands. In addition, when an adaptor
has potential to recruit more downstream components, these components are more
frequently targeted by miRNAs. This work uncovers the principles of miRNA
regulation of signal transduction networks and implies a potential function of
miRNAs for facilitating robust transitions of cellular response to
extracellular signals and maintaining cellular homeostasis.

vitro, similar to the early vascular bed of warm blooded embryos. Our
time-lapse recordings show that the network forms by extending sprouts, i.e.,
multicellular linear segments. To explain the emergence of such structures, we
propose a simple model of preferential attraction to stretched cells. Numerical
simulations reveal that the model evolves into a quasi-stationary pattern
containing linear segments, which interconnect above the critical volume
fraction of 0.2. In the quasi-stationary state the generation of new branches
offset the coarsening driven by surface tension. In agreement with empirical
data, the characteristic size of the resulting polygonal pattern is
density-independent within a wide range of volume fractions.

generalization of the EPR paradox for arbitrary pure bipartite entangled states
and arbitrary measurements by one party. Until now, it has never been
rigorously defined, so it has not been known (for example) what mixed states
are steerable (that is, can be used to exhibit steering). We provide an
operational definition, from which we prove (by considering Werner states and
Isotropic states) that steerable states are a strict subset of the entangled
states, and a strict superset of the states that can exhibit Bell-nonlocality.
For arbitrary bipartite Gaussian states we derive a linear matrix inequality
that decides the question of steerability via Gaussian measurements, and we
relate this to the original EPR paradox.

the case of a coherently-illuminated Young's interferometer, in which the

for preparing an arbitrary quantum state with high success probability by
physically transmitting some qubits, and by consuming a maximally entangled
state, together with exhausting some shared random bits. In this paper, we
discover that some states are impossible to be perfectly prepared by Alice and
Bob initially sharing those entangled states that are superposed by the ground
states, as the states to be prepared. In particular, we present a sufficient
and necessary condition for the states being enabled to be exactly prepared
with probability one, in terms of the initial entangled states (maybe
nonmaximally) superposed by the ground states. In contrast, if the initially
shared entanglement is maximal, then the probabilities for preparing these
quantum states are smaller than one. Furthermore, the lower bound on the
probability for preparing some states are derived.

transforms by varying the system scale while holding the configuration. The
oscillations are interpreted as interferences and correspond to various
closed-orbits of the emitted photon going away from and returning to the atom.
This system provides a rare example that the oscillations can be explicitly
derived by following the emitted wave until it returns to the emitting atom. We
demonstrate the summation over a large number of closed-orbits converges to the
rate formula of golden rule.
