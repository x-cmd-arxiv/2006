the largest study to date of local bars and minimizes the effect of cosmic
variance. The sample galaxies have M_g<=-18.5 mag and cover the redshift range
0.01<=z<0.04. We use a color cut in the color-magnitude diagram and the Sersic
index n to identify disk galaxies. We characterize bars and disks using r-band
images and the method of iterative ellipse fits and quantitative criteria
developed in Jogee at al. (2004, ApJL, 615, L105). After excluding highly
inclined (i>60 degrees) systems our results are: (1) the optical (r-band)
fraction of barred galaxies among local disk galaxies is 43%, which confirms
the ubiquity of local bars, in agreement with other optical studies based on
smaller samples (e.g.Eskridge et al. 2000, AJ, 119, 536, Marinova & Jogee 2006,
astro-ph/0608039); (2) the optical bar fraction rises for bluer galaxies,
suggesting a relation between bars and star formation; (3) preliminary analyzes
suggest that the optical bar fraction increases steeply with the galaxy
effective radius; (4) the optical bar fraction at z~0 is ~35% for bright disks
(M_g<=-19.3 mag) and strong (bar ellipticity >0.4), large-scale (bar semi-major
axis >1.5 kpc) bars, which is comparable to the value of 30+/-6% reported
earlier (Jogee et al. 2004) for similar disks and bars at z~0.2-1.0.

the mass-normalized star formation rates (SFRs) of a factor of ~2. Furthermore,
the 24 micron emission in the Arp galaxies is more centrally concentrated than
that in the spirals, suggesting that gas is being concentrated into the inner
regions and fueling central star formation. No significant differences can be
discerned in the shorter wavelength Spitzer colors of the Arp galaxies compared
to the spirals, thus these quantities are less sensitive to star formation
enhancements. No strong trend of Spitzer color with pair separation is visible
in our sample; this may be because our sample was selected to be tidally
disturbed. The tidal features contribute <10% of the total Spitzer fluxes on
average. The SFRs implied for the Arp galaxies by the Spitzer 24 micron

drive a shear flow which behaves as a differentially forced rotating structure

that are consistent with the predictions for the synchronization timescales in
circular orbits. In addition, calibrating our model results to fit Zahn's
relationship between synchronization timescales and orbital separation, we are
able to constrain the value of the kinematical viscosity parameter. For the
4Mo+5Mo binary modeled in this paper, the kinematical viscosity is in the range
0.0015 -- 0.0043 Ro^2/d for orbital periods in the range 2.5 -- 25 d.
Furthermore, the energy dissipation rate due to the shear flow is found to
decrease by ~2 orders of magnitude as synchronization is approached, implying
that binary systems may approach synchronization relatively quickly but that it
takes a much longer timescale to actually attain this condition. Our model can
be used to calculate the energy dissipation rates throughout the orbital cycle
for arbitrary values of eccentricity and stellar rotational velocity. We
suggest that the asymmetric distribution of energy dissipation over the stellar
surface may lead to the appearance of localized regions of enhanced surface

may be due to the quasar experiencing a major merger. The mass of molecular gas
inferred from our observations is M_{H_2}=(3.0 +/- 0.6) x 10^{10} M_sun. This
molecular gas mass is comparable to that in sub-mm-selected galaxies at similar

Large Telescope and Keck telescope to search for forming clusters of galaxies
near powerful radio galaxies at 2.0 < z < 5.2. We obtained narrow- and
broad-band images of nine radio galaxies and their surroundings. The imaging
was used to select candidate Lyman alpha emitting galaxies in ~3x3 Mpc^2 areas
near the radio galaxies. A total of 337 candidate emitters were found with a
rest-frame Lyman alpha equivalent width of EW_0 > 15 A and Sigma = EW_0/Delta
EW_0 > 3. Follow-up spectroscopy confirmed 168 Lyman alpha emitters near eight
radio galaxies. The success rate of our selection procedure is 91%. At least
six of our eight fields are overdense in Lyman alpha emitters by a factor 3-5.
Also, the emitters show significant clustering in velocity space. In the
overdense fields, the width of the velocity distributions of the emitters is a
factor 2-5 smaller than the width of the narrow-band filters. Taken together,
we conclude that we have discovered six forming clusters of galaxies
(protoclusters). We estimate that roughly 75% of powerful (L_2.7GHz > 10^33

sizes of at least 1.75 Mpc. We estimate that the protoclusters have masses in

gradients to periodic data. RM are available for the single-dish observations,

distributions of these regions we conclude that the present 8.0-micron diffuse
calibration of the SST is 36% too high compared with the MSX validated
calibration, perhaps due to scattered light inside the camera. This is an
independent confirmation of the result derived for the diffuse calibration of
IRAC by the Spitzer Science Center (SSC).
  From regression analyses we find that 843-MHz radio fluxes of HII regions and
mid-infrared (MIR) fluxes are linearly related for MSX at 8.3-microns and
Spitzer at 8.0 microns, confirming the earlier MSX result by Cohen & Green. The
median ratio of MIR/843-MHz diffuse continuum fluxes is 600 times smaller in
nonthermal than thermal regions, making it a sharp discriminant. The ratios are
largely independent of morphology up to a size of ~24 arcsec. We provide
homogeneous radio and MIR morphologies for all sources. MIR morphology is not
uniquely related to radio structure. Compact regions may have MIR filaments
and/or diffuse haloes, perhaps infrared counter- parts to weakly ionized radio
haloes found around compact HII regions. We offer two IRAC colour-colour plots

Telescope (BAT) and began observing with its narrow field instruments 161 s
after the burst onset. This gamma-ray burst is the most distant cosmic
explosion ever observed. Because of its high redshift, the X-ray Telescope
(XRT) and BAT simultaneous observations provide 4 orders of magnitude of
spectral coverage (0.2-150 keV; 1.4-1090 keV in the source rest frame) at a
very early source-frame time (22 s). GRB050904 was a long, multi-peaked, bright
GRB with strong variability during its entire evolution. The light curve
observed by the XRT is characterized by the presence of a long flaring activity
lasting up to 1-2 hours after the burst onset in the burst rest frame, with no
evidence of a smooth power-law decay following the prompt emission as seen in
other GRBs. However, the BAT tail extrapolated to the XRT band joins the XRT
early light curve and the overall behavior resembles that of a very long GRB
prompt. The spectral energy distribution softens with time, with the photon
index decreasing from -1.2 during the BAT observation to -1.9 at the end of the
XRT observation. The dips of the late X-ray flares may be consistent with an
underlying X-ray emission arising from the forward shock and with the
properties of the optical afterglow reported by Tagliaferri et al. (2005b). We
interpret the BAT and XRT data as a single continuous observation of the prompt
emission from a very long GRB. The peculiarities observed in GRB050904 could be
due to its origin within one of the first star-forming regions in the Universe;
very low metallicities of the progenitor at these epochs may provide an
explanation.

the amount of reversed dispersion that optimally cancels any actual dispersion

quantum gravity based dispersion in future gamma ray burst data from the Gamma
Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST). Extrapolation of what is know about
bursts at lower energies yields a reasonable prospect that photon dispersion
effects consistent with some quantum gravity formalisms may be detected in
sufficiently bright bursts. Short bursts have no or very small inherent lags,
and are therefore better prospects than long ones, but even they suffer
systematic error due to pulse asymmetry that may yield an irreducible
uncertainty. We note that data at energies higher than about 0.1 TeV may not be
useful for detecting dispersion in GRBs. Of several variants of the proposed
algorithm, one based on Shannon information is consistently somewhat superior
to all of the others we investigated.

located 2-3 disk scale lengths from the galaxy centre (where 1 disk scale
length is equivalent to 0.1 degrees in the V-band) and lie precisely where
there is a warp in the HI profile of M33. Warps and infall are inextricably
linked (Binney, 1992). We present spectroscopy of candidate stars in the outer

that the cores do not trace transient structures, and implies the entire mass
distribution consists of objects that can potentially form stars. We find that
the mass distribution of N2H+ cores resembles the field star IMF, which
suggests that the IMF is locked in at the pre-stellar stage of evolution. We
find that the N2H+ cores associated with stars identified from Spitzer infrared
images have a flat mass distribution. This might be because lower mass cores
lose a larger fraction of their mass when forming a star. Even in this
clustered environment, we find no evidence for ballistic motions of the cores
relative to their lower density surroundings traced by isotopic CO emission,

the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS). We detected twenty-two
sources associated with spectroscopically confirmed cluster members, while ten
more have photometric redshifts compatible with membership. Two of the 32
likely cluster members contain obvious active nuclei while the others are
associated with dusty star formation. The median IR-determined star formation
rate among the remaining galaxies is estimated at 22 M$_\odot$$ $yr$^{-1}$,
significantly higher than in previous estimates from optical data. Most of the
MIR-emitting galaxies also have optical emission lines, but a few do not and
hence have completely hidden bursts of star formation or AGN activity.
  An excess of MIR-emitting galaxies is seen in the cluster in comparison to
the field at the same redshift. The MIR cluster members are more associated
with previously detected infalling late type galaxies rather than triggered by
the ongoing merging of bigger X-ray clumps. Rough estimates also show that ram
pressure may not be capable of stripping the gas away from cluster outskirt
galaxies but it may disturb the gas enough to trigger the star formation
activity. Harassment can also play a role if for example these galaxies belong
to poor galaxy groups. Thus, bursts of star formation occur in the cluster
environment and could also help consume the galaxy gas content in addition to
ram pressure, harassment or galaxy-galaxy strong interactions.

  Imaging Technique","To be published in PASP 118 (Oct. 2006)",,"10.1086/508758",,"astro-ph",,"  Light echoes are interesting because of the wealth of information they offer
about their progenitors and the reflecting dust. Due to their faint surface
brightnesses, difference imaging is necessary to separate most light echoes
from the sky background. However, difference images reveal only the relative
fluxes between two epochs. Obtaining absolute fluxes for individual epochs has
traditionally relied on a single template image that is free of light echoes.
Since such an observation is normally unavailable, a light echo-free template
must be constructed by a complicated and usually subjective process. Here we
present an application of the NN2 method of Barris et al. to extract the
relative fluxes of light echoes across a range of epochs directly from a series
of difference images. This method requires no privileged image and makes
maximal use of the observational data. Statistical methods to estimate the
zero-flux level and thus the absolute flux are also presented. The efficacy of
the technique is demonstrated by an application to the light echoes around SN
1987A. The resulting images reveal new detail and faint light echo structures.
This method can be adapted and applied to other extended variable light
sources, such as stellar outflows and supernova remnants.

some degree change the angular momentum in the circumstellar discs surrounding
initially the majority of stars. However, for most stars the cluster
environment alters the angular momentum only slightly. For example, in
simulations of the Orion Nebula cluster (ONC) encounters reduce the angular
momentum of the discs on average at most by 3-5% and in the higher density
region of the Trapezium %where encounters are more likely, the disc angular
momentum is on average lowered by 15-20% - still a minor loss process. However,
in this paper it is demonstrated that the situation is very different if one
considers high-mass stars (M* > 10 M(solar) only. Assuming an age of 2 Myr for
the ONC, their discs have on average a 50-90% lower angular momentum than
primordially. This enormous loss in angular momentum in the disc should result
in an equivalent increase in accretion, implying that the cluster environment
boosts accretion for high-mass stars, thus %in the cluster center, making them
even more massive.

associated Compton reflection are accounted for, ~75 of the sample show an

well described by relativistic accretion disk models. In most cases the
characteristic emission radius is constrained to be within ~50 R_g, where
strong gravitational effects become important. We find in about 1/3 of the
sample the accretion disk interpretation is strongly favoured over competing
models. In a few objects no broad line is apparent. We find evidence for
emission within 6 R_g in only two cases, both of which exhibit highly complex
absorption. Evidence for black hole spin based on the X-ray spectra therefore
remains tentative.

sulfur, and iron. Silicon is about solar. For phosphorus we find an upper limit
of solar abundance. A surprisingly strong depletion of sulfur (2% solar) is
discovered. Iron is not detected, suggesting an upper limit of 30% solar. This
coincides with the Fe deficiency found in other PG1159 stars. We redetermine
the nitrogen abundance and find it to be lower by one dex compared to previous
analyses. The sulfur depletion is in contradiction with current models of AGB
star intershell nucleosynthesis. The iron deficiency confirms similar results
for other PG1159 stars and is explained by the conversion of iron into heavier
elements by n-capture in the s-processing environment of the precursor AGB
star. However, the extent of the iron depletion is stronger than predicted by
evolutionary models. The relatively low nitrogen abundance compared to other

objects such as gamma ray bursts, and (iv) Cosmic Ray showers and their
exploitation to study the origin of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. In this
conference the foreseen LOFAR work on the epoch of reionisation has been
covered by de Bruyn and on cosmic ray showers by Falcke.
  During this contribution we will first present the LOFAR project with an
emphasis on the challenges faced when carrying out sensitive imaging at low
radio frequencies. Subsequently, we will discuss LOFAR's capabilities to survey
the low-frequency radio sky. Main aims for the planned surveys are studies of
z>6 radio galaxies, diffuse emission associated with distant clusters and
starbursting galaxies at z>2.

The recent high precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background and
the large scale surveys of galaxies can be used to place an upper bound on this
mass. In this paper we perform a thorough analysis of all assumptions that go
into obtaining a credible limit on $\sum m_{\nu}$. In particular we explore the
impact of extending parameter space beyond the current standard cosmological
model, the importance of priors and the uncertainties due to biasing in large
scale structure. We find that the mass constraints are independent of the
choice of parameterization as well as the inclusion of spatial curvature. The
results of including the possibility of dark energy and tensors perturbations
are shown to depend critically on the data sets used. The difference between an
upper bound of 2.2 eV, assuming generic initial conditions, and an upper bound
of 0.63 eV, assuming adiabaticity and a galaxy bias of 1, demonstrate the
dependence of such a constraint on the assumptions in the analysis.

The partition function of the model with dipole--dipole and

terms of double graph expansions. The latter is calculated exactly in case of
trees. The system of two recurrent relations which allows to calculate all
thermodynamic characteristics of the model is obtained. The correspondence
between thermodynamic phases and different types of fixed points of the RR is
established. Using the technique of simple iterations the plots of the zero

of stability of different types of fixed points of the system of recurrent

of the intriguing interplay between geometry and dynamics which is the analog
to the magnetic field of a moving charged body in electromagnetism. The
existence of such a field has been demonstrated based on special relativity
approach and also by special relativity plus the gravitational time dilation
for two different cases, a moving infinite line and a uniformly moving point
mass, respectively. We treat these two approaches when the applied cases are
switched while appropriate key points are employed. Thus, we demonstrate that
the strength of the resulted gravitomagnetic field in the latter approach is
twice the former. Then, we also discuss the full linearized general relativity
and show that it should give the same strength for gravitomagnetic field as the
latter approach. Hence, through an exact analogy with the electrodynamic
equations, we present an argument in order to indicate the best definition
amongst those considered in this issue in the literature. Finally, we
investigate the gravitomagnetic effects and consequences of different
definitions on the geodesic equation including the second order approximation
terms.

the observation that see-saw models of neutrino mass and mixing fall into basis
invariant classes labelled by the Casas-Ibarra $R$-matrix, which we prove to be
invariant not only under basis transformations but also non-unitary
right-handed neutrino transformations $S$. According to the ISS approach, given
any see-saw model in some particular basis one may determine the invariant $R$
matrix and hence the invariant class to which that model belongs. The
formulation of see-saw models in terms of invariant classes puts them on a
firmer theoretical footing, and allows different see-saw models in the same
class to be related more easily, while their relation to the $R$-matrix makes
them more easily identifiable in phenomenological studies. We also present an
ISS mass formula which may be useful in model building. To illustrate the ISS
approach we show that sequential dominance (SD) models form basis invariant
classes in which the $R$-matrix is approximately related to a permutation of
the unit matrix, and quite accurately so in the case of constrained sequential
dominance (CSD) and tri-bimaximal mixing. Using the ISS approach we discuss
examples of models in which the mixing naturally arises (at least in part) from
the charged lepton or right-handed neutrino sectors and show that they are in
the same invariant class as SD models. We also discuss the application of our
results to flavour-dependent leptogenesis where we show that the case of a real
$R$ matrix is approximately realized in SD, and accurately realized in CSD.

directly correlated with the $\mu \to e + \gamma $ decay amplitude. Here we
study this correlation in detail considering $U_{e3}$ as a free parameter
between 0 and $U_{e3}$(CHOOZ). Large radiative corrections to $U_{e3}$ present
in these models, typically of the order ~$\Delta U_{e3} ~\sim ~10^{-3}$
(peculiar to hierarchial neutrinos), can play a major role in enhancing the
Br($\mu \to e +\gamma$), especially when $U_{e3} \ler 10^{-3}$. For large
tan$\beta$, even such small enhancements are sufficient to bring the associated
Br($\mu \to e + \gamma$) into realm of MEG experiment as long as SUSY spectrum
lies within the range probed by LHC. On the other hand, for some (negative)
values of $U_{e3}$, suppressions can occur in the branching ratio, due to
cancellations among different contributions. From a top-down perspective such
low values of $U_{e3}$ at the weak scale might require some partial/full
cancellations between the high scale parameters of the model and the radiative
corrections unless $U_{e3}$ is purely of radiative origin at the high scale. We
further emphasize that in Grand Unified theories there exist additional LFV
effects related to the running above the GUT scale, that are also independent
on the low energy value of $U_{e3}$. These new contributions can become
competitive and even dominant in some regions of the parameter space.

transformation relating the GNS representations of a non-quasifree and a
quasifree state of the free hermitian scalar field. The motivation for such an
analysis and a further result is the fact that a unitary transformation of this
kind arises naturally in scattering theory on non-stationary backgrounds.
Indeed, employing the perturbation theory of the Yang-Feldman equations with a
free CCR field in a quasifree state as an initial condition and making use of
extended Feynman graphs, we are able to calculate the Wightman functions of the
interacting and outgoing fields in a $\phi^p$-theory on arbitrary curved
spacetimes. A further examination then reveals two major features of the
aforementioned theory: firstly, the interacting Wightman functions fulfil the
basic axioms of hermiticity, invariance, spectrality (on stationary
spacetimes), perturbative positivity, and locality. Secondly, the outgoing
field is free and fulfils the CCR, but is in general not in a quasifree state
in the case of a non-stationary spacetime. In order to obtain a sensible
particle picture for the outgoing field and, hence, a description of the
scattering process in terms of particles (in asymptotically flat spacetimes),
it is thus necessary to compute a unitary transformation of the abovementioned
type.

heatbath by means of a pre-limit microscopic representation of its drifted
momentum and energy transfers at collision times. The collision point linear
interpolated path can be approximated by the solution to the ""inscribed""
continuous stochastic differential equation using the same drift function.
Employing results from stochastic mechanics it is then shown that the combined
main particle/heatbath system does not exchange or radiate energy if the
probability distribution for the position of the main particle is derived from
Schroedinger's equation. Furthermore it is shown that the main particle
distance traveled between collisions and the mean inter-collision time must
satisfy a type of Minkowski invariant. Hence if there is a correlation between
the pre- and post-collision velocities of the main particle through a collision
point then the mean distance traveled can be related to the mean inter-particle
collision times via a Lorentz transformation. The last Section shows that this
approach can be applied to all elastic main particle/heatbath particle
collisions either via direct calculation involving modeling the collision
scattering or by altering the properties of the heatbath.

manifolds written by Robert D. Edwards in the 1970's but never published. It
presents the initial solutions of the fabled Double Suspension Conjecture. (The
other two articles are: 'Approximating certain cell-like maps by
homeomorphisms' and 'Topological regular neighborhoods') The manuscripts of
these three articles have circulated privately since their creation. The
organizers of the Workshops in Geometric Topology
(http://www.math.oregonstate.edu/~topology/workshop.htm) with the support of
the National Science Foundation have facilitated the preparation of electronic
versions of these articles to make them publicly available. The second and
third articles are still in preparation. The current article contains four
major theorems:
  I. The double suspension of Mazur's homology 3-sphere is a 5-sphere, II. The
double suspension of any homology n-sphere that bounds a contractible
(n+1)-manifold is an (n+2)-sphere, III. The double suspension of any homology
3-sphere is the cell-like image of a 5-sphere. IV. The triple suspension of any
homology 3-sphere is a 6-sphere.
  Edwards' proof of I. was the first evidence that the suspension process could
transform a non-simply connected manifold into a sphere, thereby answering a
question that had puzzled topologists since the mid-1950's if not earlier.
Results II, III and IV represent significant advances toward resolving the
general double suspension conjecture: the double suspension of every homology
n-sphere is an (n+2)-sphere. [That conjecture was subsequently proved by J. W.
Cannon (Annals of Math. 110 (1979), 83-112).]

problem is motivated by switching measurements on superconducting Josephson
junctions. In this quantum mechanical experiment, the sequences of current
pulses are applied to the Josephson junction sample and a binary response
indicating the presence or the absence of a voltage response is measured. The
binary response can be modeled by a generalized linear model with the
complementary log-log link function. The other models considered are the logit
model and the probit model. For these three models, the approximately optimal
sample size for the next stage as a function of the current Fisher information
and the stage cost is determined. The cost-efficiency of the proposed design is
demonstrated in simulations based on real data from switching measurements. The
results can be directly applied to switching measurements and they may lead to
substantial savings in the time needed for the experiment.

adaptive schemes, which synchronize coupled chaotic systems to a special
trajectory (or an equilibrium point) of the uncoupled node by adding negative
feedbacks adaptively; here, adaptive schemes for the coupling strength are used
to synchronize coupled chaotic systems without knowing the synchronization
trajectory. Moreover, in many applications, the state variables are not
observable; instead, some functions of the states can be observed. How to
synchronize coupled systems with the observed data is of great significance. In
this paper, synchronization of nonlinearly coupled chaotic systems with an
adaptive coupling strength is also discussed. The validity of those schemes are
proved rigorously. Moreover, simulations show that by choosing some proper
parameter $\alpha$, the coupling strength obtained by adaptation could be much
smaller. It means that chaos oscillators can be easily synchronized with a very

pertinent classification, with nice properties for visualization. If the
individuals are described by quantitative variables (ratios, frequencies,
measurements, amounts, etc.), the straightforward application of the original
algorithm leads to build code vectors and to associate to each of them the
class of all the individuals which are more similar to this code-vector than to
the others. But, in case of individuals described by categorical (qualitative)
variables having a finite number of modalities (like in a survey), it is
necessary to define a specific algorithm. In this paper, we present a new

les monodromies locales d'un systeme differentiel limite a partir des matrices

in which coherent light with large average photon number interacts dispersively
with single, far-detuned atoms or semiconductor impurities in optical cavities.
Entanglement is heralded by homodyne detection using a second bright light
pulse for phase reference. The use of bright pulses leads to a high success
probability for the generation of entanglement, at the cost of a lower initial
fidelity. This fidelity may be boosted by entanglement purification techniques,
implemented with the same physical resources. The need for more purification
steps is well compensated for by the increased probability of success when
compared to heralded entanglement schemes using single photons or weak coherent
pulses with realistic detectors. The principle cause of the lower initial
fidelity is fiber loss; however, spontaneous decay and cavity losses during the
dispersive atom/cavity interactions can also impair performance. We show that
these effects may be minimized for emitter-cavity systems in the weak-coupling
regime as long as the resonant Purcell factor is larger than one, the cavity is
over-coupled, and the optical pulses are sufficiently long. We support this
claim with numerical, semiclassical calculations using parameters for three
realistic systems: optically bright donor-bound impurities such as 19-F:ZnSe
with a moderate-Q microcavity, the optically dim 31-P:Si system with a high-Q
microcavity, and trapped ions in large but very high-Q cavities.
