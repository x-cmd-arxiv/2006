recent star formation very close to the Galactic center. Finally, the

Saturn's rings. Wavelet analysis locally separates signal components in
frequency space, causing many structures to become evident that are difficult
to observe with the naked eye. Density waves, generated at resonances with
saturnian satellites orbiting outside (or within) the rings, are particularly
amenable to such analysis. We identify a number of previously unobserved weak
waves, and demonstrate the wavelet transform's ability to isolate multiple
waves superimposed on top of one another. We also present two wave-like
structures that we are unable to conclusively identify.
  In a multi-step semi-automated process, we recover four parameters from
clearly observed weak spiral density waves: the local ring surface density, the
local ring viscosity, the precise resonance location (useful for pointing
images, and potentially for refining saturnian astrometry), and the wave
amplitude (potentially providing new constraints upon the masses of the
perturbing moons). Our derived surface densities have less scatter than
previous measurements that were derived from stronger non-linear waves, and
suggest a gentle linear increase in surface density from the inner to the mid-A
Ring. We show that ring viscosity consistently increases from the Cassini
Division outward to the Encke Gap. Meaningful upper limits on ring thickness
can be placed on the Cassini Division (3.0 m at r~118,800 km, 4.5 m at

morphology, metal mixture, treatment of core convection between observed

determinations. We also study the role played by statistical fluctuations of
the observed colours, caused by the low total mass of typical globulars.
Horizontal Branch morphology is potentially the largest source of uncertainty.
A single-age system harbouring a large fraction of clusters with an HB
morphology systematically bluer than the one accounted for in the theoretical
colour grid, can simulate a bimodal population with an age difference as large
as 8 Gyr. When only the redder clusters are considered, this uncertainty is
almost negligible, unless there is an extreme mass loss along the Red Giant
Branch phase. The metal mixture affects mainly the redder clusters; the effect
of colour fluctuations becomes negligible for the redder clusters, or when the
integrated Mv is brighter than -8.5 mag. The treatment of core convection is
relevant for ages below ~4 Gyr. The retrieved [Fe/H] distributions are overall
only mildly affected. Colour fluctuations and convective core extension have
the largest effect. When 1sigma photometric errors reach 0.10 mag, all biases
found in our analysis are erased, and bimodal age populations with age
differences of up to ~8 Gyr go undetected. The use of both (U-I)-(V-K) and

companion to the 1-10 Myr-old GQ Lup complement existing K-band spectra and
photometry, and improve on the original estimate of its spectral type. We find
that GQ Lup B is somewhat hotter (M6-L0) than reported in the discovery paper
by Neuhauser and collaborators (M9-L4), mainly due to the surface-gravity
sensitivity of the K-band spectral classification indices used by the
discoverers. Spectroscopic features characteristic of low surface gravity
objects, such as lack of alkali absorption and a triangular H-band continuum,
are indeed prominent in our spectrum of GQ Lup B. The peculiar shape of the
H-band continuum and the difference between the two spectral type estimates is
well explained in the context of the diminishing strength of H2 collision
induced absorption with decreasing surface gravity, as recently proposed for
young ultra-cool dwarfs by Kirkpatrick and collaborators. Using our updated
spectroscopic classification of GQ Lup B and a re-evaluation of the age and
heliocentric distance of the primary, we perform a comparative analysis of the
available sub-stellar evolutionary models to estimate the mass of the
companion. We find that the mass of GQ Lup B is 0.010-0.040 Msun. Hence, it is
unlikely to be a wide-orbit counterpart to the known radial-velocity extrasolar

massive galaxy clusters in this redshift interval hosting a radio halo, and to
constrain the expectations of the particle re--acceleration model for the
origin of non--thermal radio emission in galaxy clusters. Methods. We selected
27 REFLEX clusters and here we present Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT)
observations at 610 MHz for 11 of them. The sensitivity (1$\sigma$) in our
images is in the range 35--100~$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ for all clusters. Results.
We found three new radio halos, doubling the number of halos known in the
selected sample. In particular, giant radio halos were found in A 209 and RXCJ
2003.5--2323, and one halo (of smaller size) was found in RXCJ 1314.4--2515.
Candidate extended emission on smaller scale was found around the central
galaxy in A 3444 which deserves further investigation. Furthermore, a radio
relic was found in A 521, and two relics were found in RXCJ 1314.5--2515. The
remaining six clusters observed do not host extended emission of any kind.

strongly influences the morphology of the soft X-ray emission, being spatially
coincident with excess of X-ray absorption. Two 'hot spots', i.e. regions where
emission from higher ionization stages of O and Ne is stronger, are observed in
the soft X-ray image. They can be tracers of variations of the ionization
parameter, even if, at least for one of them, absorption may be the dominant
effect. The positions of the `hot spots' suggest that they are not affected by
the star-formation regions observed with HST, being located far away from them.
Therefore, the starburst does not seem to play an important role in the
photoionization of the soft X-ray emitting gas. The resulting picture is
consistent with modified unification scenarios, where the Compton-thick torus
coexists with a large-scale Compton-thin material associated with the dust lane
and circumnuclear gas is photoionized by the AGN along torus-free lines of
sight.

address this problem, we have modelled the impact of selection effects on

criteria of the Palomar-Green (PG) Survey, we show that selection effects
cannot reconcile the predictions of standard CV evolution theory with the

shorter (20 ks) 2002 observation. Between the two epochs the intrinsic
absorption column density diminished, but there were also subtle changes in the
continuum shape. Considering the blurred ionised reflection model, the
long-term changes can be associated with a varying contribution of the power
law component relative to the total spectrum. Examination of normalised light
curves indicates that the high-energy variations are quite structured and that
there are delays, but only in some parts of the light curve. Interestingly, a
hard X-ray lag first appears during the most-distinct structure in the mean
light curve, a flux dip ~25 ks into the observation. The previously discovered
broad, ionised Fe Ka line shows significant variations over the course of the
2005 observation. The amplitude of the variations is 25-45 per cent and they
are unlikely due to changes in the Fe ka-producing region, but perhaps arise
from orbital motion around the black hole or obscuration in the broad iron
line-emitting region. The 2002 data are re-examined for variability of the Fe
Ka line at that epoch. There is evidence of energy and flux variations that are
associated with a hard X-ray flare that occurred during that observation.

to analyse galaxies with redshift estimates from two random COMBO-17 fields
covering 0.52 square degrees in total, providing a conditional constraint in
the (sigma_8, Omega_m) plane as well as a conditional constraint on the
equation of state of dark energy, parameterised by a constant w= p/rho c^2. The

agreement with a 2D cosmic shear analysis of COMBO-17. The 3D cosmic shear
conditional constraint on w using the two random fields is w=-1.27 +0.64 -0.70.

predictions made in Heavens et al. (2006) and Taylor et al. (2006). When these

embedded in warm neutral gas and about half as long if embedded in hot gas.
Heat flux saturation effects severely reduce the evaporation rate of tiny cold
neutral medium (CNM) clouds into hot gas. For CNM clouds embedded in warm
neutral medium (WNM) the much lower conductivity results in slower evaporation.
This mass loss rate could still be significant, however, if the environment is
relatively quiescent. Partial ionization of the WNM gas would substantially
reduce the conductivity and lengthen the lifetime of the tiny HI clouds. The
ultimate importance of thermal conduction to cloud evolution will depend on the
role of turbulence and the characteristics of the medium in which the clouds
are embedded.

around 50 meV. However at that energy scale, there are multiple candidates
including phonon branches, structure in the spin-fluctuation spectrum, and the
superconducting gap itself, making the unique identification of the excitation
responsible for the kink difficult. Here we show that the low-energy
renormalization at ~50 meV is only a small component of the total
renormalization, the majority of which occurs at an order of magnitude higher
energy (~350 meV). This high energy kink poses a new challenge for the physics
of the cuprates. Its role in superconductivity and relation to the low-energy
kink remains to be determined.

of several terabits per second. However, they suffer from an intrinsic
crosstalk problem when two optical signals cross at the same switch element. To
avoid crosstalk, active connections must be node-disjoint in the switching
network. In this paper, we propose a sequence of decomposition and merge
operations, called conjugate transformation, performed on each switch element
to tackle this problem. The network resulting from this transformation is
called conjugate network. By using the numbering-schemes of networks, we prove
that if the route assignments in the original network are link-disjoint, their
corresponding ones in the conjugate network would be node-disjoint. Thus,
traditional nonblocking switching networks can be transformed into
crosstalk-free optical switches in a routine manner. Furthermore, we show that
crosstalk-free multicast switches can also be obtained from existing
nonblocking multicast switches via the same conjugate transformation.

  CT-RSA 2007""",,,,"cs.CR cs.DM math.CO",,"  MV3 is a new word based stream cipher for encrypting long streams of data. A
direct adaptation of a byte based cipher such as RC4 into a 32- or 64-bit word
version will obviously need vast amounts of memory. This scaling issue
necessitates a look for new components and principles, as well as mathematical
analysis to justify their use. Our approach, like RC4's, is based on rapidly
mixing random walks on directed graphs (that is, walks which reach a random
state quickly, from any starting point). We begin with some well understood
walks, and then introduce nonlinearity in their steps in order to improve
security and show long term statistical correlations are negligible. To
minimize the short term correlations, as well as to deter attacks using
equations involving successive outputs, we provide a method for sequencing the
outputs derived from the walk using three revolving buffers. The cipher is fast
-- it runs at a speed of less than 5 cycles per byte on a Pentium IV processor.
A word based cipher needs to output more bits per step, which exposes more
correlations for attacks. Moreover we seek simplicity of construction and
transparent analysis. To meet these requirements, we use a larger state and
claim security corresponding to only a fraction of it. Our design is for an
adequately secure word-based cipher; our very preliminary estimate puts the
security close to exhaustive search for keys of size < 256 bits.

  Theory",,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT",,"  All communication networks comprise of transmission systems and switching
systems, even though they are usually treated as two separate issues.
Communication channels are generally disturbed by noise from various sources.
In circuit switched networks, reliable communication requires the
error-tolerant transmission of bits over noisy channels. In packet switched
networks, however, not only can bits be corrupted with noise, but resources
along connection paths are also subject to contention. Thus, quality of service
(QoS) is determined by buffer delays and packet losses. The theme of this paper
is to show that transmission noise and packet contention actually have similar
characteristics and can be tamed by comparable means to achieve reliable
communication, and a number of analogies between switching and transmission are
identified. The sampling theorem of bandlimited signals provides the
cornerstone of digital communication and signal processing. Recently, the
Birkhoff-von Neumann decomposition of traffic matrices has been widely applied
to packet switches. With respect to the complexity reduction of packet
switching, we show that the decomposition of a doubly stochastic traffic matrix
plays a similar role to that of the sampling theorem in digital transmission.
We conclude that packet switching systems are governed by mathematical laws
that are similar to those of digital transmission systems as envisioned by
Shannon in his seminal 1948 paper, A Mathematical Theory of Communication.

investigated. It is found that a spacetime singularity forms on the symmetry
axis and that it is necessarily naked, i.e., observable in principle. We
propose a physically reasonable boundary condition at this naked singularity to
construct the solution including its causal future. This boundary condition
enables us to construct the unique continuation of spacetime beyond the naked
singularity and ensures that the dust shell passes through the naked
singularity. When the cylindrical shell leaves its symmetry axis away, the
naked singularity disappears, and regularity is recovered. We construct
numerical solutions with this feature. This result implies that the gravity
produced by a thick cylindrical shell of dust is too weak to bind the shell
even if it engenders the formation of a curvature singularity which is so
strong as to satisfy the limiting focusing condition. For this reason, this
naked singularity is very weak in the extended spacetime; the metric tensor is
$C^{1-}$ even at the naked singularity, and the extended spacetime is complete
for almost all geodesics. This feature is also seen for singular hypersurfaces.
Such an extended spacetime can be regarded as phenomenological in the sense
that it is valid if the relevant microphysics length scale is sufficiently
small compared to the scale of interest.

of the mirror face. The laser-light beam averages over these fluctuations; the
larger the beam and the flatter its light-power distribution, the better the
averaging and the lower the resulting thermal noise. In semi-infinite mirrors,
scaling laws for the influence of beam shape on the four dominant types of

substrate thermoelastic) have been suggested by various researchers and derived
with varying degrees of rigour. Because these scaling laws are important tools

Summing over KK gravitons up to a scale $\lbar$ and testing unitarity at $\sqrt

dimensional analysis' scale, $\Lambda_{NDA}$. We evaluate $\lbar$ as a function
of the curvature ratio $m_0/M_{Planck}$ for the pure gravity theory. We then
demonstrate that unitarity need not be violated at $\lbar$ in the presence of a
heavy Higgs boson. In fact, much larger Higgs masses are consistent with
unitarity than if no KK gravitons are present. Observation of the mass and
width (or cross section) of one or more KK gravitons at the LHC will directly
determine $m_0/M_{Planck}$ and the scale $\hat \Lambda$ specifying the
couplings of matter to the KK gravitons. With this information in hand and a
measurement of the Higgs boson mass, one can determine the precise scale
$\lbar$ below which unitarity will remain valid.

a scenario in which the theta dependence in the string and glueball spectrum

These local martingales resemble the discrete martingales preserved by the
corresponding LERW on the discrete approximation of the domain. For all kinds
of targets, if the domain satisfies certain boundary conditions, we use these
martingales to prove that when the mesh of the discrete approximation is small
enough, the continuous LERW and the corresponding discrete LERW can be coupled
together, such that after suitable reparametrization, with probability close to
1, the two curves are uniformly close to each other.

than the extreme angle, there exists a shock-front emanating from the wedge

two-dimensional steady supersonic Euler flows past a Lipschitz wedge whose
boundary slope function has small total variation, when the total variation of
the incoming flow is sufficiently small. In this case, the Lipschitz wedge
perturbs the flow and the waves reflect after interacting with the strong
shock-front or the wedge boundary. We first obtain the existence of solutions
in $BV$ when the incoming flow has small total variation by the wave front
tracking method and then study the $L^1$ stability of the solutions. In
particular, we incorporate the nonlinear waves generated from the wedge
boundary to develop a Lyapunov functional between two solutions, which is
equivalent to the $L^1$ norm, and prove that the functional decreases in the
flow direction. Then the $L^1$ stability is established, so is the uniqueness
of the solutions by the wave front tracking method. Finally, we show the
uniqueness of solutions in a broader class, i.e. the class of viscosity

  Abstract: Let A be a uniform algebra on the compact space X and $\sigma $ a
probability measure on X. We define the Hardy spaces $H^{p}(\sigma)$ and the
$H^{p}(\sigma)$ interpolating sequences S in the p-spectrum ${\mathcal{M}}_{p}$
of $\sigma $. We prove, under some structural hypotheses on $\sigma $ that
""Carleson type"" conditions on S imply that S is interpolating with a linear
extension operator in $\displaystyle H^{s}(\sigma), s<p$ provided that either
$p=\infty $ or $p\leq 2$.
  This gives new results on interpolating sequences for Hardy spaces of the
ball and the polydisc. In particular in the case of the unit ball of
${\mathbb{C}}^{n}$ we get that if there is a sequence $\{\rho_{a}\}_{a\in S}$
bounded in $H^{\infty}({\mathbb{B}})$ such that $\forall a,b\in S, \rho
_{a}(b)=\delta_{ab}$, then S is $H^{p}({\mathbb{B}})$-interpolating with a
linear extension operator for any $1\leq p<\infty $.

nonlinear two-time-scale stochastic approximation algorithms. Its second aim is
to introduce the averaging principle in the context of two-time-scale
stochastic approximation algorithms. We first define the notion of asymptotic
efficiency in this framework, then introduce the averaged two-time-scale
stochastic approximation algorithm, and finally establish its weak convergence
rate. We show, in particular, that both components of the averaged
two-time-scale stochastic approximation algorithm simultaneously converge at
the optimal rate $\sqrt{n}$.

flows, the simplified model of 3D axisymmetric incompressible fluids (i.e.,
two-dimensional Boussinesq approximation equations) is studied numerically. The
system describes a cap-like hot zone of fluid rising from the bottom, while the
edges of the cap lag behind, forming eye-like vortices. The hot liquid is
driven by the buoyancy and meanwhile attracted by the vortices, which leads to
the singularity-forming mechanism in our simulation. In the previous 2D
Boussinesq simulations, the symmetricial initial data is used. However, it is
observed that the adoption of symmetry leads to coordinate singularity.
Moreover, as demonstrated in this work that the locations of peak values for
the vorticity and the temperature gradient becomes far apart as $t$ approaches
the predicted blow-up time. This suggests that the symmetry assumption may be
unreasonable for searching solution blow-ups. One of the main contributions of
this work is to propose an appropriate asymmetric initial condition, which
avoids coordinate singularity and also makes the blow-up to occur much earlier
than that given by the previously simulations. The shorter simulation time
suppresses the development of the round-off error. On the numerical side, the
pseudo-spectral method with filtering technique is adopted. The resolutions
adopted in this study vary from $1024^2$, $2048^2$, $4096^2$ to $6144^2$. With
our proposed asymmetric initial condition, it is shown that the $4096^2$ and
$6144^2$ runs yield convergent results when $t$ is fairly close to the
predicted blow-up time. Moreover, as expected the locations of peak values for
the vorticity and the temperature gradient are very close to each other as $t$

semi-independent Stern-Gerlach deflection experiments at temperatures between
60 and 307 K. We find that clusters consisting of 13 to 200 cobalt atoms
exhibit behavior that is entirely consistent with superparamagnetism, though
complicated by finite-system fluctuations in cluster temperature. By fitting
the data to the Langevin function, we report magnetic moments per atom for each
cobalt cluster size and compare the results of our two measurements and all
those performed previously. In addition to a gradual decrease in moment per
atom with increasing size, there are oscillations that appear to be caused by
geometrical shell structure. We discuss our observations in light of the two
competing models for Langevin-like magnetization behavior in free clusters,
superparamagnetism and adiabatic magnetization, and conclude that the evidence
strongly supports the superparamagnetic model.

of the electromagnetic wave propagation in the quasi-planar geometry within the
half-space is proposed in this article. There are two types of TI-FFT
algorithm, i.e., the spatial TI-FFT and the spectral TI-FFT. The former works
in the spatial domain and the latter works in the spectral domain. It has been
shown that the optimized computational complexity is the same for both types of
TI-FFT algorithm, which is N_r^{opt} N_o^{opt} O (N log_2 N) for an N = N_x
\times N_y computational grid, where N_r^{opt} is the optimized number of
slicing reference planes and N_o^{opt} is the optimized order of Taylor series.
Detailed analysis shows that N_o^{opt} is closely related to the algorithm's
computational accuracy \gamma_{TI}, which is given as N_o^{opt} ~ -
ln(\gamma_{TI}) and the optimized spatial slicing spacing between two adjacent
spatial reference planes \delta_z^{opt} only depends on the characteristic
wavelength \lambda_c of the electromagnetic wave, which is given as
\delta_z^{opt} ~ 1/17 \lambda_c. The planar TI-FFT algorithm allows a large
sampling spacing required by the sampling theorem. What's more, the algorithm
is free of singularities and it works particularly well for the narrow-band
beam and the quasi-planar geometry.

locate food. On a crayfish scale chemical stimuli received from a distant

produce a variety of flow patterns. Here we study the flow generated by
Procambarus clarkii in response to odour stimulation. We found that while
searching for food the crayfish generates one or two outward jets. These jets
create an inflow which draws odour to the crayfish's anterior chemoreceptors.
We quantified velocity fields in the inflow region using Particle Image
Velocimetry. The results show that the inflow velocity decreases proportionally
to the inverse distance from the animal so that it takes about a minute for an
odour plume to reach the animal's chemoreceptors from a distance of 10 cm. We
compare the inflow generated by live crayfish with that produced by a mimicking
device, a phantom. The phantom consisted of two nozzles and an inlet providing
two jets and a sink so that the overall mass flux was zero. The use of a
phantom enabled us to analyze the inflow at various jet parameters. We showed
that variation of the jets' directions and relative intensities allows changing
the direction of odour attraction. These results provide a rationale for
biomimetic robot design. We discuss sensitivity and efficiency of such a robot.

co-ordinate system S, and are scheduled to move at constant speed, in opposite
directions, toward two targets placed at equal distances from point O. At the
instant they meet, the clocks inside the rockets are set to zero. When they
reach the targets the rockets meet two clocks A and B whose reading is
identical. This question which was tackled in ref [1] is studied here in depth.
Assuming the existence of a preferred aether frame So in which the one-way
speed of light is isotropic, and the anisotropy of this speed in the other
frames, we show that, if the equal reading of the clocks A and B results from
an exact synchronization, the clocks inside the rockets will display different
readings when they reach A and B in contradiction with the relativity
principle. Conversely, if the clocks A and B, which display an equal reading,
have been synchronized by means of the Einstein-Poincare procedure, the inboard
clocks will also display the same reading, a fact which seems in agreement with
the relativity principle. But this synchronization method presupposes the
invariance of the one-way speed of light, in contradiction with the assumptions
made, and, therefore, introduces a measurement error. This demonstrates that if
we assume the existence of an aether frame, the apparent relativity principle
is not a fundamental principle; it depends on an arbitrary synchronization. In
any case, this is an example of an experimental measurement which can be
explained by aether theory without the assumption of the invariance of the
one-way speed of light in all inertial frames.

atom in an optical dipole trap, created by focussing a laser beam using a large

performance of the optical system and show that it is diffraction limited over
a broad spectral range (~ 200 nm) with a large transverse field (+/- 25
microns). The optical tweezer created at the focal point of the lens is able to
trap single atoms of 87Rb and to detect them individually with a large
collection efficiency. We measure the oscillation frequency of the atom in the
dipole trap, and use this value as an independent determination of the waist of
the optical tweezer. Finally, we produce with the same lens two dipole traps
separated by 2.2 microns and show that the imaging system can resolve the two
atoms.

is proportional to the atom number for a superfluid.

  Measurement Process","42 pages and 7 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.74.062302",,"quant-ph",,"  The superconducting charge-phase `Quantronium' qubit is considered in order
to develop a model for the measurement process used in the experiment of Vion
et. al. [Science 296 886 (2002)]. For this model we propose a method for
including the bias current in the read-out process in a fundamentally
irreversible way, which to first order, is approximated by the Josephson
junction tilted-washboard potential phenomenology. The decohering bias current
is introduced in the form of a Lindblad operator and the Wigner function for
the current biased read-out Josephson junction is derived and analyzed. During
the read-out current pulse used in the Quantronium experiment we find that the
coherence of the qubit initially prepared in a symmetric superposition state is
lost at a time of 0.2 nanoseconds after the bias current pulse has been
applied. A timescale which is much shorter than the experimental readout time.
Additionally we look at the effect of Johnson-Nyquist noise with zero mean from
the current source during the qubit manipulation and show that the decoherence
due to the irreversible bias current description is an order of magnitude
smaller than that found through adding noise to the reversible tilted washboard
potential model. Our irreversible bias current model is also applicable to the
persistent current based qubits where the state is measured according to its
flux via a small inductance direct current superconducting quantum interference
device (DC-SQUID).
