show that the first binaries may form a very small group (< 1%) of fast
rotating stars through binary tidal interactions that make GRBs. This finding
is contrary to the Bromm & Loeb assumption that all stars in close Population
III binaries will be spun up by tides and produce a GRB. We find that there is
simply not enough fast rotating stars in Population III binaries to expect
detection with SWIFT. Predicted detection rates, even with very optimistic

very small: 0.1-0.01 per year.

modulation of the radio emission in Cyg X-1. The modulation occurs due to
free-free absorption in the wind from the companion star varying with the
orbital phase, and our results put strong constraints on the spatial
distribution of the jet radio emission at the frequencies of 2-15 GHz. A
crucial role in enhancing the asymmetry of the wind absorption suffered by the
jet emission is played by the irradiation by X-rays emitted in the vicinity of
the black hole. This increases the wind temperature by more than order of
magnitude with respect to that of the wind of an isolated supergiant. The
observed phase lags of the minima of the radio emission with respect to the
spectroscopic zero phase strongly imply the bulk of the mass of the jet is
nonrelativistic (~5 x 10^8 cm/s) within the jet core. The jet can, however,
become relativistic outside the core. Also, the jet can have a two-component
structure, being slow on the outside and fast inside, in which case its
synchrotron-emitting part may be relativistic already in the core. We also
consider the observed superorbital modulation of the radio emission (with the
period of ~150 d) and find it can be explained by a jet precession both causing
variable wind absorption and changing the jet Doppler factor. Finally, we
consider the case of Cyg X-3, and show that its lack of observable orbital
radio modulation (in spite of strong modulation of X-rays) is explained by that
system being both much more compact and much more luminous than Cyg X-1.

distances of a metric space or a graph. Given a graph, the problem of
constructing a spanning tree in a graph which strongly preserves distances in
the graph is a fundamental problem in network design. We present scaling
distortion embeddings where the distortion scales as a function of $\epsilon$,
with the guarantee that for each $\epsilon$ the distortion of a fraction
$1-\epsilon$ of all pairs is bounded accordingly. Such a bound implies, in
particular, that the \emph{average distortion} and $\ell_q$-distortions are
small. Specifically, our embeddings have \emph{constant} average distortion and
$O(\sqrt{\log n})$ $\ell_2$-distortion. This follows from the following
results: we prove that any metric space embeds into an ultrametric with scaling
distortion $O(\sqrt{1/\epsilon})$. For the graph setting we prove that any
weighted graph contains a spanning tree with scaling distortion
$O(\sqrt{1/\epsilon})$. These bounds are tight even for embedding in arbitrary
trees.
  For probabilistic embedding into spanning trees we prove a scaling distortion
of $\tilde{O}(\log^2 (1/\epsilon))$, which implies \emph{constant}
$\ell_q$-distortion for every fixed $q<\infty$.

subtraction of a perturbative part defined by a diverging series. A common
procedure consists in dropping the order of minimal contribution and the higher
orders. This allows us to isolate very accurately the one-instanton effect for
the double-well potential. For the one plaquette gauge theory, an exact
analytical expression can be written for the non-perturbative part. We report
recent attempts to extend this approach to the average plaquette of quenched
QCD. Our goal is to express the non-perturbative effects in terms of
expressions of the form beta^B exp(-A beta) calculable semi-classically. The
situation is complicated by zeroes of the partition function in the complex
$\beta$ plane (presumably near 5.75 pm i 0.2). We discuss two methods to
describe the intermediate and large order behavior of the perturbative series.
One is inspired by mean field theory (logarithmic specific heat) and reproduces
accurately the known perturbative series with only two free parameters. A
diagrammatic interpretation of this fact is still lacking. The other is based
on infra-red renormalons with a factorial growth showing up at order larger
than 20 and a possible effective theory interpretation. These extrapolations
are compatible with the non-perturbative part of the plaquette being
proportional to a^4. We propose an exponential parametrization to the
corrections to the universal part of the beta function and find results
compatible with the suggestion of a^2 corrections made by C. Allton.

eigenvalues and mixing suitable for the explanation of neutrino oscillations.
The model has a good CDM candidate which contributes to the radiative neutrino
mass generation. The stability of the CDM candidate is ensured by $Z_2$ which
is the residual symmetry of a spontaneously broken U(1)$^\prime$. We discuss
the values of $U_{e3}$ and also estimate the masses of the relevant fields to

regularization of the membrane Hamiltonians. The mass gap is shown to be
naturally organized as an expansion in a 'hidden' parameter, which turns out to
be $\frac{1}{d}$: d being the related to the dimensionality of the background
space. We then proceed to develop a large $N$ perturbation theory for the
membrane/matrix-model Hamiltonians around the quantum/mass corrected effective
potential. The same parameter that controls the perturbation theory for the
mass gap is also shown to control the Hamiltonian perturbation theory around
the effective potential. The large $N$ perturbation theory is then translated
into the language of quantum spin chains and the one loop spectra of various

effective Hamiltonians for membranes in flat space times. Apart from membranes

networks: the set of transcription factors and target genes which control the
involvement of different biological processes in living cells. Previous
statistical approaches for identifying gene regulatory networks have used gene
expression data, ChIP binding data or promoter sequence data, but each of these
resources provides only partial information. We present a Bayesian hierarchical
model that integrates all three data types in a principled variable selection
framework. The gene expression data are modeled as a function of the unknown
gene regulatory network which has an informed prior distribution based upon
both ChIP binding and promoter sequence data. We also present a variable
weighting methodology for the principled balancing of multiple sources of prior
information. We apply our procedure to the discovery of gene regulatory
relationships in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Yeast) for which we can use several
external sources of information to validate our results. Our inferred
relationships show greater biological relevance on the external validation
measures than previous data integration methods. Our model also estimates
synergistic and antagonistic interactions between transcription factors, many
of which are validated by previous studies. We also evaluate the results from
our procedure for the weighting for multiple sources of prior information.
Finally, we discuss our methodology in the context of previous approaches to
data integration and Bayesian variable selection.

term, as a rotating feature of the Universe. We give a picture on ""creation"" of
the Universe. By analogy with the original Brans-Dicke relation, several other
similar relations were obtained in a previous paper (Berman, 2007d), which we
now extend, by relating the angular momentum L, absolute temperature T, and the
cosmological ""constant"", with R, where R, M stand for the radius (scale-factor)
and the mass of the causally related Universe. We show here that these
properties, which characterize Machian Universes, can be put in the form of
equalities, which can be derived, from the conjecture that the total energy of
the Universe is null, alike with the effective energy density, and we therefore
imply that R depends linearly with M ; the angular momentum runs like squared R
; T, like R to the power -1/2 ; lambda, as R to the power -2 so that the total
entropy of the Universe grows with R to the power 3/2, and, then, also as M to
the power 3/2. The ""loss of information paradox"", for black holes, is
dismantled. It must be obvious, from this paper, that each type of energy
contribution, to the total energy of the Universe, divided by M multiplied by
c-squared, yields a constant, during all times, so that, for instance, if the
present contribution of the cosmological ""constant"", drives the present
Universe, it also must have driven alike, in all the lifespan of the Machian
Universe: the relative contributions of densities of each kind, towards the
total density, remain the same during all times. Berman (2008; 2008a; 2008b)

hypothesis) posits that large brains and distinctive cognitive abilities of
humans have evolved via intense social competition in which social competitors
developed increasingly sophisticated ""Machiavellian"" strategies as a means to
achieve higher social and reproductive success. Here we build a mathematical
model aiming to explore this hypothesis. In the model, genes control brains
which invent and learn strategies (memes) which are used by males to gain
advantage in competition for mates. We show that the dynamics of intelligence
has three distinct phases. During the dormant phase only newly invented memes
are present in the population. During the cognitive explosion phase the
population's meme count and the learning ability, cerebral capacity
(controlling the number of different memes that the brain can learn and use),
and Machiavellian fitness of individuals increase in a runaway fashion. During
the saturation phase natural selection resulting from the costs of having large
brains checks further increases in cognitive abilities. Overall, our results
suggest that the mechanisms underlying the ""Machiavellian intelligence""
hypothesis can indeed result in the evolution of significant cognitive
abilities on the time scale of 10 to 20 thousand generations. We show that
cerebral capacity evolves faster and to a larger degree than learning ability.
Our model suggests that there may be a tendency toward a reduction in cognitive
abilities (driven by the costs of having a large brain) as the reproductive
advantage of having a large brain decreases and the exposure to memes increases
in modern societies.

other fields, in which the interaction information is important. Examples are
