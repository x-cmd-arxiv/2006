the observed Keck spectra of three z>6.2 quasars with full Gunn-Peterson

J1623+3112 (z=6.22). We fit the probability density distributions (PDFs) of the
observed Ly alpha optical depths with those generated from the simulation, by
exploring a range of values for the size of the quasar's surrounding HII
region, R_S, the volume-weighted mean neutral hydrogen fraction in the ambient
IGM, x_H, and the quasar's ionizing photon emissivity, N_Q. In order to avoid
averaging over possibly large sightline-to-sightline fluctuations in IGM
properties, we analyze each observed quasar independently. We find the
following results for J1148+5251, J1030+0524, and J1623+3112: The best-fit
sizes R_S are 40, 41, and 29 (comoving) Mpc, respectively. These constraints
are tight, with only ~ 10% uncertainties, comparable to those caused by
redshift--determination errors. The best-fit values of N_Q are 2.1, 1.3, and
0.9 x 10^{57} s^{-1}, respectively, with a factor of ~ 2 uncertainty in each
case. Finally, the best--fit values of x_H are 0.16, 1.0, and 1.0,
respectively. The uncertainty in the case of J1148+5251 is large, and x_H is
not well constrained. However, for both J1030+0524 and J1623+3112, we find a
significant lower limit of x_H >~ 0.033. Our method is different from previous
analyses of the GP absorption spectra of these quasars, and our results
strengthen the evidence that the rapid end--stage of reionization is occurring
near z ~ 6.

planet is on an eccentric orbit then the presence of another planet causes a
secular advance of the transiting planet's pericenter over and above the effect
of general relativity. Although this secular effect is impractical to detect
over a small number of orbits, it causes long-term differences in when future
transits occur, much like the long-term decay observed in pulsars. Measuring
this transit-timing delay would thus allow the detection of either one or more
additional planets in the system or the first measurements of non-zero
oblateness ($J_2$) of the central stars.

momenta of dark-matter haloes depend on environment. We first present a
classification scheme that allows to distinguish between haloes in clusters,
filaments, sheets and voids in the large-scale distribution of matter. This
method is based on a local-stability criterion for the orbits of test particles
and closely relates to the Zel'dovich approximation. Applying this scheme to
our simulations we then find that: i) Mass assembly histories and formation
redshifts strongly depend on environment for haloes of mass M<M* (haloes of a
given mass tend to be older in clusters and younger in voids) and are
independent of it for larger masses; ii) Low-mass haloes in clusters are
generally less spherical and more oblate than in other regions; iii) Low-mass
haloes in clusters have a higher median spin than in filaments and present a
more prominent fraction of rapidly spinning objects; we identify recent major
mergers as a likely source of this effect. For all these relations, we provide
accurate functional fits as a function of halo mass and environment. We also
look for correlations between halo-spin directions and the large-scale
structures: the strongest effect is seen in sheets where halo spins tend to lie
within the plane of symmetry of the mass distribution. Finally, we measure the
spatial auto-correlation of spin directions and the cross-correlation between
the directions of intrinsic and orbital angular momenta of neighbouring haloes.
While the first quantity is always very small, we find that spin-orbit
correlations are rather strong especially for low-mass haloes in clusters and
high-mass haloes in filaments.

isotropy of the galaxy cluster autocorrelation function (an Alcock-Paczynski
test). The correlation function is distorted in redshift space because of the
cluster peculiar velocities, but if these are known and can be subtracted, the
correlation function measurement becomes in principle a pure test of cosmic
geometry. Galaxy cluster peculiar velocities can be measured using the kinetic
Sunyaev Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. Upcoming CMB surveys, e.g., ACT, SPT, Planck,
are expected to do this with varying levels of accuracy, dependent on
systematic errors due to cluster temperature measurements, radio point sources,
and the primary CMB anisotropy. We use the Hubble volume N-body simulation and
the hydrodynamic simulation results of Nagai et. al (2003) to simulate various
kSZ surveys. We find by model fitting that a measurement of the correlation
function distortion can be used to recover the cosmological parameters that
have been used to generate the simulation. However, the low space density of
galaxy clusters requires larger surveys than are taking place at present to
place tight constraints on cosmology. For example, with the SPT and ACT
surveys, Omega_Lambda could be measured to within 0.1 and 0.2 respectively at
one sigma, but only upper limits on the equation of state parameter w will be
possible. Nevertheless, with accurate measurements of the kSZ effect, this test
can eventually be used to probe the dark energy equation of state and its
evolution with redshift, with different systematic errors than other methods.

affect the evolution of a flame bubble in a Type Ia supernovae -- burning,
turbulence and buoyancy. Even in the vigorously turbulent conditions of a
convecting white dwarf, thermonuclear burning that begins at a point near the
center (within 100 km) of the star is dominated by the spherical laminar
expansion of the flame, until the burning region reaches kilometers in size.
Consequently flames that ignite in the inner ~20 km promptly burn through the
center, and flame bubbles anywhere must grow quite large--indeed, resolvable by
large-scale simulations of the global system--for significant motion or
deformation occur. As a result, any hot-spot that successfully ignites into a
flame can burn a significant amount of white dwarf material. This potentially
increases the stochastic nature of the explosion compared to a scenario where a
simmering progenitor can have small early hot-spots float harmlessly away.
Further, the size where the laminar flame speed dominates other relevant
velocities sets a characteristic scale for fragmentation of larger flame
structures, as nothing--by definition--can easily break the burning region into
smaller volumes. This makes possible the development of semi-analytic
descriptions of the earliest phase of the propagation of burning in a Type Ia
supernovae, which we present here. Our analysis is supported by fully resolved
numerical simulations of flame bubbles.

expected from the empirical relation $R_{BLRs} - L_{H\alpha}$ valid for
'normal' AGN: Seyfert 1s and quasars, except for the objects with accretion
rate $\dot{m_{H\alpha}}>10^{-5.5}$. Second, we find a positive correlation
between the line width of the narrow emission line (as tracer of velocity
dipersion and thus bulge and black hole mass) and the size of BLRs for both
normal and low luminosity AGN. In this paper we find a non-linear dependence of
the BLRs sizes of low luminosity AGN on BH masses. We also show that their
sizes of BLRs are more strongly dominated by the 'specific accretion rate'
$\dot{m_{H\alpha}}$ defined as $\dot{m_{H\alpha}} = L_{H\alpha}/L_{Edd}$, than
by the masses of their cetral black holes. As an expected result, the distance

during the supernova explosion and the surrounding interstellar gas. Particles
are accelerated to very high energies somewhere in the pulsar winds or at the
shocks produced in collisions of the winds with the surrounding medium. As a
result of interactions of relativistic leptons with the magnetic field and low
energy radiation (of synchrotron origin, thermal, or microwave background), the
non-thermal radiation is produced with the lowest possible energies up to
$\sim$100 TeV. The high energy (TeV) gamma-ray emission has been originally
observed from the Crab Nebula and recently from several other objects. Recent
observations by the HESS Cherenkov telescopes allow to study for the first time
morphology of the sources of high energy emission, showing unexpected spectral
features. They might be also interpreted as due to acceleration of hadrons.
However, theory of particle acceleration in the PWNe and models for production
of radiation are still at their early stage of development since it becomes
clear that realistic modeling of these objects should include their time
evolution and three-dimensional geometry. In this paper we concentrate on the
attempts to create a model for the high energy processes inside the PWNe which
includes existence not only relativistic leptons but also hadrons inside the
nebula. Such model should also take into account evolution of the nebula in
time. Possible high energy expectations based on such a model are discussed in

Population III stars were very massive and would end up as direct black holes,
rotation again have an interesting effect of enhancing mass loss through

Planetesimals are scattered outward almost as efficiently as protoplanets,

strong and terrestrial planet formation is able to resume. A simulation
extended for a few Myr after the migration of the giant planet halted at 0.1

PAH features, low ionization emission lines and H_2 rotational lines arising
from the dusty circumnuclear disk characterizing this galaxy. The central SED,
from X-ray to radio, is well fitted by a model of an exponential burst
superimposed on an old simple stellar population. From the lack of high
excitation nebular lines, the [NeIII]15.5/[NeII]12.8 ratio, the temperature of
molecular hydrogen, and the fit to the full X-ray to radio SED we argue that
the present activity of the galaxy is driven by star formation alone. The AGN
contribution to the ionizing flux is constrained to be less than 2%. The age of
the burst is found to be around 190 Myr and it is fully consistent with the
notion that the star formation process has been triggered by the interaction
with NGC4438. The mass involved in the rejuvenation episode turns out to be
less than 1.5% of the stellar galaxy mass sampled in a 5"" central aperture.
This is enough to render NGC4435 closely similar to a typical interacting
early-type galaxy with inverted CaII[H+K] lines that will later turn into a

formation in galaxies. From measured XP number counts we extract the collective
2-10 keV luminosity of young XPs, L_yXP, which we use to gauge the current
star-formation rate (SFR) in galaxies. We find that, for a sample of local
star-forming galaxies (i.e., normal spirals and mild starbursts), L_yXP
correlates linearly with the SFR over three decades in luminosity. A separate,
high-SFR sample of starburst ULIRGs can be used to check the calibration of the
relation. Using their (presumably SF-related) total 2-10 keV luminosities we
find that these sources satisfy the SFR-L_yXP relation, as defined by the
weaker sample, and extend it to span about 5 decades in luminosity. The
SFR-L_yXP relation is likely to hold also for distant Hubble Deep Field North
galaxies, especially so if these high-SFR objects are similar to the (more
nearby) ULIRGs. It is argued that the SFR-L_yXP relation provides the most
adequate X-ray estimator of instantaneous SFR by the phenomena characterizing
massive stars from their birth (FIR emission from placental dust clouds)
through their death as compact remnants (emitting X-rays by accreting from a
close donor). For local, low/intermediate-SFR galaxies, the simultaneous
existence of a correlation of the instantaneous SFR with the total 2-10 keV
luminosity, which traces the SFR integrated over (approximately) the last Gyr,
suggests that during such epoch the SF in these galaxies has been proceeding at
a relatively constant rate.

the possibility to constraint the existence and nature of the AGN population at

find that X-ray deep-field observations can set important constraints to the
faint-end of the AGN luminosity function at very high redshift. Planned X-ray
telescopes should be able to detect AGN hosting black holes with masses down to
>10^5 Msun (i.e., X-ray luminosities in excess of 10^42 erg s^-1), and can
constrain the evolution of the population of massive black hole at early times
(6<z<10). We find that this population of AGN should contribute substantially
(~25%) to the unresolved fraction of the cosmic X-ray background in the 0.5-10
keV range, and that a significant fraction (~3-4%) of the total background
intensity would remain unaccounted even after future X-ray observations. As
byproduct, we compute the expected UV background from AGN at z>6 and we discuss
the possible role of AGN in the reionization of the Universe at these early
epochs, showing that AGN alone can provide enough ionizing photons only in the
(improbable) case of an almost completely homogeneous inter-galactic medium.
Finally, we show that super-Eddington accretion, suggested by the observed QSOs

by an energy shift of the incoherent part. The band dispersion also shows the

transition is not described by the standard Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson critical

scale near the transition. The quasi-particle weight of the conduction electron
vanishes at this KI--ASL fixed point, indicating non-Fermi liquid behavior. The

simultaneously coupled to the electron density on the molecule. The conductance
is suppressed in regimes corresponding to non-integer occupancy of the
molecule. In the second model, where the CM mode is not directly coupled to the
electron density, the suppression of conductance is related to the dynamic
breaking of the inversion symmetry.

belief propagation decoding on memoryless channels. A concrete framework is
presented, admitting systematic searches for new bounds. Two noise measures are
considered: the Bhattacharyya noise parameter and the soft bit value for a
maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) decoder on the uncoded channel. For Zm
LDPC codes, an iterative m-dimensional bound is derived for
m-ary-input/symmetric-output channels, which gives a sufficient stability
condition for Zm LDPC codes and is complemented by a matched necessary
stability condition introduced herein. Applications to coded modulation and to
codes with non-equiprobable distributed codewords are also discussed.
  For binary codes, two new lower bounds are provided for symmetric channels,
including a two-dimensional iterative bound and a one-dimensional non-iterative
bound, the latter of which is the best known bound that is tight for binary
symmetric channels (BSCs), and is a strict improvement over the bound derived
by the channel degradation argument. By adopting the reverse channel
perspective, upper and lower bounds on the decodable Bhattacharyya noise
parameter are derived for non-symmetric channels, which coincides with the
existing bound for symmetric channels.

division multiplexing (OFDM) systems is investigated. The analysis is organized
into two parts. In the first part, the impact of system parameters on the OFDM
DLC is analyzed in a general setting. The main results are that under weak
assumptions the maximum achievable single user DLC is almost independent of the
distribution of the path attenuations in the low signal-to-noise (SNR) region
but depends strongly on the delay spread. In the high SNR region the roles are
exchanged. Here, the impact of delay spread is negligible while the impact of
the distribution becomes dominant. The relevant asymptotic quantities are
derived without employing simplifying assumptions on the OFDM correlation
structure. Moreover, for both cases it is shown that the DLC is maximized if
the total channel energy is uniformly spread, i.e. the power delay profile is
uniform. It is worth pointing out that since universal bounds are obtained the
results can also be used for other classes of parallel channels with block
fading characteristic. The second part extends the setting to the broadcast
channel and studies the corresponding OFDM DLC BC region. An algorithm for
computing the OFDM BC DLC region is presented. To derive simple but smart
resource allocation strategies, the principle of rate water-filling employing
order statistics is introduced. This yields analytical lower bounds on the OFDM
DLC region based on orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and
ordinal channel state information (CSI). Finally, the schemes are compared to
an algorithm using full CSI.

(LISA) is the detection of gravitational waves from the inspirals of
stellar-mass compact objects into supermassive black holes. Detection of these
sources is an extremely challenging computational problem due to the large
parameter space and low amplitude of the signals. However, recent work has
suggested that the nearest extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) events will be
sufficiently loud that they might be detected using computationally cheap,
template-free techniques, such as a time-frequency analysis. In this paper, we
examine a particular time-frequency algorithm, the Hierarchical Algorithm for
Clusters and Ridges (HACR). This algorithm searches for clusters in a power map
and uses the properties of those clusters to identify signals in the data. We
find that HACR applied to the raw spectrogram performs poorly, but when the
data is binned during the construction of the spectrogram, the algorithm can
detect typical EMRI events at distances of up to $\sim2.6$Gpc. This is a little
further than the simple Excess Power method that has been considered
previously. We discuss the HACR algorithm, including tuning for single and
multiple sources, and illustrate its performance for detection of typical EMRI
events, and other likely LISA sources, such as white dwarf binaries and
supermassive black hole mergers. We also discuss how HACR cluster properties
could be used for parameter extraction.

Here an empirically adequate generalized theory of the inertial structure is
discussed in which proper time is causally compelled to be tensed within both
spacetime and dynamics. This is accomplished by introducing the inverse of the
Planck time at the conjunction of special relativity and Hamiltonian mechanics,
which necessitates energies and momenta to be invariantly bounded from above,
and lengths and durations similarly bounded from below, by their respective
Planck scale values. The resulting theory abhors any form of preferred
structure, and yet captures the transience of now along timelike worldlines by
causally necessitating a genuinely becoming universe. This is quite unlike the
scenario in Minkowski spacetime, which is prone to a block universe
interpretation. The minute deviations from the special relativistic effects
such as dispersion relations and Doppler shifts predicted by the generalized
theory remain quadratically suppressed by the Planck energy, but may
nevertheless be testable in the near future, for example via observations of
oscillating flavor ratios of ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrinos, or of altering
pulse rates of extreme energy binary pulsars.

simply-connected spacetime. In this paper, the vacuum expectation value of the
stress-energy tensor for a massless scalar field is calculated in all 17

of the Einstein equation. Is it instead something emerging from a perturbative
calculus performed on the metric $g\_{\mu\nu}$ solution of the Einstein

Instead of a numerical resolution, we use the auxiliary field technique. It
allows to find simplified analytical mass spectra and wave functions, and still
leads to reliable qualitative predictions. We also investigate the light hybrid
sector, and found a mass for the lightest hybrid meson which is in satisfactory
agreement with lattice QCD and other effective models.

chiral D7 matter fields in IIB Calabi-Yau flux compactifications with
stabilised moduli. We determine explicit expressions for soft terms for the
single-modulus KKLT scenario and the multiple-moduli large volume scenario. In
particular we use the chiral matter metrics for Calabi-Yau backgrounds recently
computed in hep-th/0609180. These differ from the better understood metrics for
non-chiral matter and therefore give a different structure of soft terms. The
soft terms take a simple form depending explicitly on the modular weights of
the corresponding matter fields. For the large-volume case we find that in the
simplest D7 brane configuration, scalar masses, gaugino masses and A-terms are
very similar to the dilaton-dominated scenario. Although all soft masses are
suppressed by ln(M_P/m_{3/2}) compared to the gravitino mass, the
anomaly-mediated contributions do not compete, being doubly suppressed and thus
subdominant to the gravity-mediated tree-level terms. Soft terms are
flavour-universal to leading order in an expansion in inverse Kahler moduli.
They also do not introduce extra CP violating phases to the effective action.
We argue that soft term flavour universality should be a property of the
large-volume compactifications, and more generally IIB flux models, in which
flavour is determined by the complex structure moduli while supersymmetry is
broken by the Kahler moduli. For the simplest large-volume case we run the soft
terms to low energies and present some sample spectra and a basic
phenomenological analysis.

permutation. That is, given a permutation $ \sigma $ of $ N $ elements and a
vector $ (x_1,...,x_N) $ of $ N $ initial points we let the random processes
terminate in the points $ (x_{\sigma(1)},...,x_{\sigma(N)}) $ and then sum over
all possible permutations and initial points, weighted with an initial
distribution. There is a two-level random mechanism and we prove two-level
large deviations principles for the mean of empirical path measures, for the
mean of paths and for the mean of occupation local times under this symmetrised
measure. The symmetrised measure cannot be written as any product of single
random process distributions. We show a couple of important applications of
these results in quantum statistical mechanics using the Feynman-Kac formulae

  While applying our approach, the notion of a uniquely $k$-determined

of dimension $n\ge 2$ with a boundary and use Dirichlet boundary conditions on
connections as defined by Marini. A key step in the method of Narasimhan and
Ramadas consisted in showing that the linear space spanned by the curvature
form at one specially chosen connection is dense in the holonomy Lie algebra
with respect to an appropriate Sobolev norm.
  Our objective is to explore the effect of the presence of a boundary on this
construction of the holonomy Lie algebra. Fixing appropriate Sobolev norms, it
will be shown that the space spanned, linearly, by the curvature form at any
one connection is never dense in the holonomy Lie algebra. In contrast, the
linear space spanned by the curvature form and its first commutators at the
flat connection is dense and, in the $C^\infty$ category, is in fact the entire
holonomy Lie algebra. The former, negative, theorem is proven for a general
principle bundle over $M$, while the latter, positive, theorem is proven only
for a product bundle over the closure of a bounded open subset of
$\mathbb{R}^n$. Our technique for proving absence of density consists in
showing that the linear space spanned by the curvature form at one point is
contained in the kernel of a linear map consisting of a third order
differential operator, followed by a restriction operation at the boundary;
this mapping is determined by the mean curvature of the boundary.

the limiting vectors of average displacements per time on trajectory segments.
Naturally, these creatures are living in the (commutative) vector space
$\real^n$, if the toroidal billiard is given on the flat $n$-torus.
  The billard trajectories, being curves, oftentimes getting very close to
closed loops, quite naturally define elements of the fundamental group of the
billiard table. The simplest non-trivial fundamental group obtained this way
belongs to the classical Sinai billiard, i.e., the billiard flow on the 2-torus
with a single, convex obstacle removed. This fundamental group is known to be
the group $\textbf{F}_2$ freely generated by two elements, which is a heavily
noncommutative, hyperbolic group in Gromov's sense. We define the homotopical
rotation number and the homotopical rotation set for this model, and provide
lower and upper estimates for the latter one, along with checking the validity
of classicaly expected properties, like the density (in the homotopical
rotation set) of the homotopical rotation numbers of periodic orbits.
  The natural habitat for these objects is the infinite cone erected upon the
Cantor set $\text{Ends}(\textbf{F}_2)$ of all ``ends'' of the hyperbolic group
$\textbf{F}_2$. An element of $\text{Ends}(\textbf{F}_2)$ describes the
direction in (the Cayley graph of) the group $\textbf{F}_2$ in which the
considered trajectory escapes to infinity, whereas the height function $t$ ($t

article follows as it should have appeared. IMS apologizes to the author and
the readers for this error. A recent paper by Harrison and Van Mieghem
explained in general mathematical terms how one forms an ``equivalent workload
formulation'' of a Brownian network model. Denoting by $Z(t)$ the state vector
of the original Brownian network, one has a lower dimensional state descriptor
$W(t)=MZ(t)$ in the equivalent workload formulation, where $M$ can be chosen as
any basis matrix for a particular linear space. This paper considers Brownian
models for a very general class of open processing networks, and in that
context develops a more extensive interpretation of the equivalent workload
formulation, thus extending earlier work by Laws on alternate routing problems.
A linear program called the static planning problem is introduced to articulate
the notion of ``heavy traffic'' for a general open network, and the dual of
that linear program is used to define a canonical choice of the basis matrix
$M$. To be specific, rows of the canonical $M$ are alternative basic optimal
solutions of the dual linear program. If the network data satisfy a natural
monotonicity condition, the canonical matrix $M$ is shown to be nonnegative,
and another natural condition is identified which ensures that $M$ admits a
factorization related to the notion of resource pooling.

suppressed radiation spectrometer. Spectroscopic quality resolution of less
than 1% of the full-width half maximum of full energy deposition peaks was
demonstrated. The construction of the small apparatus used to obtain these
results is reported. The design concept is to use the liquid argon bath to both
cool the germanium crystal to operating temperatures and act as a scintillating
veto. The scintillation light from the liquid argon can veto cosmic-rays,
external primordial radiation, and gamma radiation that does not fully deposit
within the germanium crystal. This technique was investigated for its potential
impact on ultra-low background gamma-ray spectroscopy. This work is based on a
concept initially developed for future germanium-based neutrinoless double-beta
decay experiments.

The two-pion exchange interaction also yields a new spin structure, that

within the BCS theory, but decreases monotonously with increasing T. It is
demonstrated that this non-vanishing thermal pairing is the reason why the
width of the giant dipole resonance (GDR) does not increase with T up to T
around 1 MeV. At higher T, when the thermal pairing is small, the GDR width
starts to increase with T. The calculations within the phonon-damping model
yield the results in good agreement with the most recent experimental
systematic for the GDR width as a function of T. A similar effect, which causes
a small GDR width at low T, is also seen after thermal pairing is included in

theorems are (1) Potential flow (inviscid and irrotational) is stable. (2)
Inviscid rotational (nonzero vorticity) flow is unstable. (3) Velocity profile
with an inflectional point is unstable when there is no work input or output to
the system, for both inviscid and viscous flows. These theorems are, for the
first time, deduced, and are of great significance for the understanding of
generation of turbulence and the explanation of complex flows.
  From these results, it is concluded that the classical Rayleigh theorem
(1880) on inflectional velocity instability of inviscid flows is incorrect
which has last for more than a century. It is demonstrated that existence of
inflection point on velocity profile is a sufficient condition, but not a
necessary condition for flow instability, for both inviscid and viscous flows.
The paradox of dual role of viscosity has been resolved: viscosity has only
stable role. Why the paradox appeared is due to that the Rayleigh Theorem of
inviscid flows by linear analysis is incorrect.

dimension $N^2$. The application to the 2-sphere provides a family of
inequivalent CS quantizations, based on the spin spherical harmonics (the CS
quantization from usual spherical harmonics appears to give a trivial issue for
the cartesian coordinates). We compare these CS quantizations to the usual
(Madore) construction of the fuzzy sphere. The difference allows us to consider
our procedures as the constructions of new type of fuzzy spheres. The very
general character of our method suggests applications to construct fuzzy
versions of a variety of sets.

show that different Nash equilibria with different classical-quantum

information can be protected by suitably encoding this quantum information
across multiple independently erred quantum systems. Recently it was realized
that, since the most general method for encoding quantum information is to
encode it into a subsystem, there exists a novel form of quantum error
correction beyond the traditional quantum error correcting subspace codes.
These new quantum error correcting subsystem codes differ from subspace codes
in that their quantum correcting routines can be considerably simpler than
related subspace codes. Here we present a class of quantum error correcting
subsystem codes constructed from two classical linear codes. These codes are
the subsystem versions of the quantum error correcting subspace codes which are
generalizations of Shor's original quantum error correcting subspace codes. For
every Shor-type code, the codes we present give a considerable savings in the
number of stabilizer measurements needed in their error recovery routines.
