associated to known ultracompact HI I regions, whose young age ensures that
dynamic evolution of the clusters did not influence the intrinsic binarity

young massive stars are formed in close multiple systems, but may also be
consistent with most if not all young massive stars being binaries. In
addition, we show that the radial velocity dispersion of the full sample is
about 35 km/s, significantly larger than our estimated uncertainty (25 km/s).
This finding is consistent with similar measurements of the young massive

via a sequence of quiescent phases of a slow mass accretion intermitted by
violent episodes of major mergers. In the quiescent phases, the density is well
fitted by an NFW profile, the inner scale radius Rs and the mass enclosed
within it remain constant, and the virial radius (Rvir) grows linearly with the
expansion parameter ""a"". Within each quiescent phase the concentration
parameter (""c"") scales as ""a"", and the mass accretion history (Mvir) is well
described by the Tasitsiomi etal. fitting formula. In the violent phases the
halos are not in a virial equilibrium and both Rs and Rvir grow
discontinuously. The violent episodes drive the halos from one NFW dynamical
equilibrium to another. The final structure of a halo, including ""c"", depends
on the degree of violence of the major mergers and on their number. Next, we
find a distinct difference between the behavior of various NFW parameters taken
as averages over an ensemble of halos and those of individual halos. Moreover,
the simple scaling relations c--Mvir do not apply to the entire evolution of
individual halos, and so is the common notion that late forming halos are less

extrapolate the observed flare frequency-energy release scaling relation to
releases much larger than seen so far for the sun, an assumption supported by
observations of flares on other solar- and subsolar-mass main sequence stars.
We calculate the surficial reprocessed X-ray spectra using a Monte Carlo code
we have developed. Biological doses from indirect genome damage are calculated
for each parameterized flare spectrum by integration over the X-ray opacity of
water. We estimate the mean waiting time for solar flares producing a given
biological dose of ionizing radiation on Mars and compare with lethal dose data
for a wide range of terrestrial organisms. These timescales range from decades
for significant human health risk to 0.5 Myr for D. radiodurans lethality. Such
doses require total flare energies of 10^33--10^38 erg, the lower range of
which has been observed for other stars. Flares are intermittent bursts, so
acute lethality will only occur on the sunward hemisphere during a sufficiently
energetic flare, unlike low-dose-rate, extended damage by cosmic rays. We
estimate the soil and CO_2 ice columns required to provide 1/e shielding as
4--9 g cm^-2, depending on flare mean energy and atmospheric column density.
Topographic altitude variations give a factor of two variation in dose for a
given flare. Life in ice layers that may exist ~ 100 g cm^-2 below the surface

cosmological implications: Either the dark energy consists of multiple
components with at least one non-canonical phantom component or general
relativity needs to be extended to a more general theory on cosmological
scales. The former possibility requires the existence of a phantom component
which has been shown to suffer from serious theoretical problems and
instabilities. Therefore, the later possibility is the simplest realistic
theoretical framework in which such a crossing can be realized. After providing
a pedagogical description of various dark energy observational probes, we use a
set of such probes (including the Gold SnIa sample, the first year SNLS
dataset, the 3-year WMAP CMB shift parameter, the SDSS baryon acoustic
oscillations peak (BAO), the X-ray gas mass fraction in clusters and the linear
growth rate of perturbations at z=0.15 as obtained from the 2dF galaxy redshift

favor crossing of the phantom divide. We find that a low \Omega_m prior
(0.2<\Omega_m <0.25) leads, for most observational probes (except of the SNLS

interesting degeneracy of the ISW effect in the CMB perturbation spectrum is
also pointed out.

collisionless. Such accretion from a uniform and dynamically cold disk predicts
protoplanets with slow retrograde rotation. However, if the building blocks of
protoplanets, planetesimals, are small, of order of a meter in size, then they
are likely to collide within the protoplanet's sphere of gravitational
influence, creating a prograde accretion disk around the protoplanet. The
accretion of such a disk results in the formation of protoplanets spinning in
the prograde sense with the maximal spin rate allowed before centrifugal forces
break them apart. As a result of semi-collisional accretion, the final spin of
a planet after giant impacts is not completely random but is biased toward
prograde rotation. The eventual accretion of the remaining planetesimals in the
post giant-impact phase might again be in the semi-collisional regime and
delivers a significant amount of additional prograde angular momentum to the
terrestrial planets. We suggest that in our Solar System, semi-collisional
accretion gave rise to the preference for prograde rotation observed in the
terrestrial planets and perhaps the largest asteroids.

sensitively on many poorly constrained quantities (the nature of the ionizing
sources, the clumpiness of the gas in the IGM, the degree to which
photo-ionizing feedback suppresses the abundance of low mass galaxies, etc.),
making it extremely difficult to interpret upcoming observations of this epoch.
We demonstrate that the actual situation is more encouraging, using a suite of
radiative transfer simulations, post-processed on outputs from a 1024^3, 94 Mpc
N-body simulation. Analytic prescriptions are used to incorporate small-scale
structures that affect reionization, yet remain unresolved in the N-body
simulation. We show that the morphology of the HII regions is most dependent on
the global ionization fraction x_i. This is not to say that the bubble
morphology is completely independent of all parameters besides x_i. The next
most important dependence is that of the nature of the ionizing sources. The
rarer the sources, the larger and more spherical the HII regions become. The
typical bubble size can vary by as much as a factor of 4 at fixed x_i between
different possible source prescriptions. The final relevant factor is the
abundance of minihalos or of Lyman-limit systems. These systems suppress the
largest bubbles from growing, and the magnitude of this suppression depends on
the thermal history of the gas as well as the rate at which minihalos are
photo-evaporated. We find that neither source suppression owing to
photo-heating nor gas clumping significantly affect the large-scale structure
of the HII regions. We discuss how observations of the 21cm line with MWA and
LOFAR can constrain properties of reionization, and we study the effect patchy
reionization has on the statistics of Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies. [abridged]

constrain the progenitors of supernovae. Radio observations of a number of

late times. Although several possibilities have been put forward to explain
these modulations, no single explanation has proven to be entirely
satisfactory. Here we suggest that Luminous Blue Variables undergoing S-Doradus
type variations give rise to enhanced phases of mass loss which are imprinted
on the immediate environment of the exploding star as a series of density
enhancements. The variations in mass loss arise from changes in the ionization
balance of Fe, the dominant ion that drives the wind. With this idea, we find
that both the recurrence timescale of the variability, as well as the amplitude
of the modulations are in line with the observations. Our scenario thus
provides a natural, single-star explanation for the observed behaviour that is,
in fact, expected on theoretical grounds.

which can use a single, relatively low order deformable mirror to correct the
wavefront errors from the lowest altitude turbulence. GLAO concentrates more
light from a point source in a smaller area on the science detector, but unlike
traditional adaptive optics, images do not become diffraction-limited. Rather
the GLAO point spread function (PSF) has the same functional form as a
seeing-limited PSF, and can be characterized by familiar performance metrics
such as Full-Width Half-Max (FWHM). The FWHM of a GLAO PSF is reduced by 0.1""
or more for optical and near-infrared wavelengths over different atmospheric
conditions. For the Cerro Pachon atmospheric model this correction is even
greater when the image quality is worst, which effectively eliminates
""bad-seeing"" nights; the best seeing-limited image quality, available only 20%
of the time, can be achieved 60 to 80% of the time with GLAO. This
concentration of energy in the PSF will reduce required exposure times and
improve the efficiency of an observatory up to 30 to 40%. These performance
gains are relatively insensitive to a number of trades including the exact
field of view of a wide field GLAO system, the conjugate altitude and actuator
density of the deformable mirror, and the number and configuration of the guide

is stochastically regenerated or originates in planetesimal belts evolving in
steady state. In this paper a simple model for the steady state evolution of
debris disks due to collisions is developed and confronted with the properties
of the emerging population of 7 sun-like stars that have hot dust <10AU. The
model shows there is a maximum possible disk mass at a given age, since more
massive primordial disks process their mass faster. The corresponding maximum
dust luminosity is f_max=0.00016r^(7/3)/t_age. The majority (4/7) of the hot
disks exceed this limit by >1000 and so cannot be the products of massive
asteroid belts, rather the following systems must be undergoing transient
events characterized by an unusually high dust content near the star: eta
Corvi, HD69830, HD72905 and BD+20307. It is also shown that the hot dust cannot
originate in a recent collision in an asteroid belt, since there is also a
maximum rate at which collisions of sufficient magnitude to reproduce a given
dust luminosity can occur. Further it is shown that the planetesimal belt
feeding the dust in these systems must be located further from the star than
the dust, typically at >2AU. Other notable properties of the 4 hot dust systems
are: two also have a planetesimal belt at >10AU (eta Corvi and HD72905); one
has 3 Neptune mass planets at <1AU (HD69830); all exhibit strong silicate
features in the mid-IR. We consider the most likely origin for the dust in
these systems to be a dynamical instability which scattered planetesimals
inwards from a more distant planetesimal belt in an event akin to the Late
Heavy Bombardment in our own system, the dust being released from such
planetesimals in collisions and possibly also sublimation.

Methods: The observations have been carried out using the NACO adaptive optics
(AO) instrument at the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope

and consists of a contribution of a non- or weakly polarized main flare with
highly polarized sub-flares. The flare activity shows a possible
quasi-periodicity of 20+-3 minutes consistent with previous observations.
Conclusions: The highly variable and polarized emission supports that the NIR
emission is non-thermal. The observations can be interpreted in a jet or

variations can be explained due to spots on relativistic orbits around the
central MBH. Alternative explanations for the high central mass concentration

its emission is significantly polarized during flares and consists of a non- or
weakly polarized main flare with highly polarized sub-flares. The flare
activity suggests a quasi-periodicity of ~20 minutes in agreement with previous
observations. Aims: By simultaneous fitting of the lightcurve fluctuations and
the time-variable polarization angle, we address the question of whether these
changes are consistent with a simple hot spot/ring model, in which the
interplay of relativistic effects plays the major role, or whether some more
complex dependency of the intrinsic emissivity is required. Methods: We discuss
the significance of the 20min peak in the periodogram of a flare from 2003. We
consider all general relativistic effects that imprint on the polarization
degree and angle and fit the recent polarimetric data, assuming that the
synchrotron mechanism is responsible for the intrinsic polarization and
considering two different magnetic field configurations. Results: Within the
quality of the available data, we think that the model of a single spot in
addition to an underlying ring is favoured. In this model the broad
near-infrared flares of Sgr A* are due to a sound wave that travels around the
MBH once while the sub-flares, superimposed on the broad flare, are due to
transiently heated and accelerated electrons which can be modeled as a plasma
blob. Within this model it turns out that a strong statement about the spin
parameter is difficult to achieve, while the inclination can be constrained to
values > 35 deg on a 3sigma level.

more than a fortnight apart they provide the first insight into the evolution
of the prominence system on such a young rapidly rotating star. The largest
prominences observed transiting the stellar disc are found at very similar
rotational phases between the epochs. This suggests that the magnetic
structures supporting the prominences retain their identity on a two to three
week timescale. We identify prominences as transient absorption features in all
lines of the Hydrogen Balmer series down to H_10. We use the ratios of the
prominence EWs in these lines to determine their column densities in the first
excited state of hydrogen. We determine the optical depths, finding prominences
to be rather optically thick (\tau \approx 20) in the H_alpha line. The total
hydrogen column density and thus the prominence masses are determined via
observations of the CaII H&K lines. We find typical masses for four of the
largest prominences to be in the range 0.5 - 2.3 x10^{14} kg, slightly larger
than giant solar prominence masses. Rotationally modulated emission is seen
outside of the H_alpha line. These loops of emission are shown to be caused by
prominences seen off the stellar disc. We find that all of the large emission
loops can be associated with prominences we see transiting the stellar disc.
This combined with the fact that many prominences appear to eclipse the
off-disc emission of others, strongly suggests that the prominence system is
highly flattened and likely confined to low stellar latitudes.

significant fraction of the bolometric luminosity. Analysis of the full

self-consistent $N$-body simulations. When the bar forms, it is as thin as the
disc. Its three-dimensional shape, however, evolves, so that, at later times,
it has a thick inner part and a thin, more extended outer part. The former,
when viewed edge-on, is called a boxy/peanut bulge, because of its shape. The
strength of the box/peanut correlates with the bar strength, the strongest
cases having formed after two buckling episodes. The extent of the box/peanut
is considerably shorter than the bar length, in good agreement with orbital
structure studies and with observations. Viewed at an angle near to, but not
quite edge-on, barred galaxies show specific isodensity/isophotal shapes, which
are different in the thick and in the thin part of the bar. The isophotes of
M31 also have such shapes. This, taken together with radial photometric
profiles and kinematics, argue that M31 is a barred galaxy. Thus, the

Telescopes (XRT) and the X-ray Imaging Spectrometers (XIS) onboard Suzaku,
mainly for the scientific analysis of spatially and spectroscopically complex
celestial sources. A photon-by-photon instrumental simulator is built on the
ANL platform, which has been successfully used in ASCA data analysis. The
simulator has a modular structure, in which the XRT simulation is based on a
ray-tracing library, while the XIS simulation utilizes a spectral
""Redistribution Matrix File"" (RMF), generated separately by other tools.
Instrumental characteristics and calibration results, e.g., XRT geometry,
reflectivity, mutual alignments, thermal shield transmission, build-up of the
contamination on the XIS optical blocking filters (OBF), are incorporated as
completely as possible. Most of this information is available in the form of
the FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) files in the standard calibration
database (CALDB). This simulator can also be utilized to generate an ""Ancillary
Response File"" (ARF), which describes the XRT response and the amount of OBF
contamination. The ARF is dependent on the spatial distribution of the
celestial target and the photon accumulation region on the detector, as well as
observing conditions such as the observation date and satellite attitude. We
describe principles of the simulator and the ARF generator, and demonstrate
their performance in comparison with in-flight data.

plasma is studied in order to find a possible explanation of the hard X-ray
(HXR) emission detected from the Coma cluster. We calculate the necessary
energy supply as a function of the plasma temperature and of the electron
energy. We show that, for the same value of the HXR flux, the energy supply
changes gradually from its high value (when emitting particle are non-thermal)
to lower values (when the electrons are thermal). The kinetic equations we use
include terms describing particle thermalization as well as momentum diffusion
due to the Fermi II acceleration. We show that the temporal evolution of the
particle distribution function has, at its final stationary stage, a rather
specific form: it cannot be described by simple exponential or power-law
expressions. A broad transfer region is formed by Coulomb collisions at
energies between the Maxwellian and power-law parts of the distribution
function. In this region the radiative lifetime of a single electron differs
greatly from the lifetime of the distribution function as a whole. For a plasma
temperature of 8 keV, the particles emitting bremsstrahlung at 20-80 keV lie in
this quasi-thermal regime. We show that the energy supply required by
quasi-thermal electrons to produce the observed HXR flux from Coma is one or
two orders of magnitude smaller than the value derived from the assumption of a
nonthermal origin of the emitting particles. This result may solve the problem
of rapid cluster overheating by nonthermal electrons. We finally predict the
change in Coma's SZ effect caused by the distortions of the Maxwellian electron
spectrum, and we show that evidence for acceleration of subrelativistic
electrons can be derived from detailed spectral measurements.

supplementary to that of its charge. While initial analyses of MR in such
multilayers assumed that the direction of the spin of each electron stayed
fixed as the electron transited the multilayer, we now know that this is true
only in a certain limit. Generally, the spins 'flip' in a distance
characteristic of the metal, its purity, and the temperature. They can also
flip at F/N or N1/N2 interfaces. In this review we describe how to measure the
lengths over which electron moments flip in pure metals and alloys, and the
probability of spin-flipping at metallic interfaces. Spin-flipping within
metals is described by a spin-diffusion length,l^M(sf), where the metal M = F
or N. Spin-diffusion lengths are the characteristic lengths in the
current-perpendicular-to-plane (CPP) and lateral non-local (LNL) geometries
that we focus upon in this review. In certain simple cases, l^N(sf) sets the
distance over which the CPP-MR and LNL-MR decrease as the N-layer thickness
(CPP-MR) or N-film length (LNL) increases, and l^F(sf) does the same for
increase of the CPP-MR with increasing F-layer thickness. Spin-flipping at
M1/M2 interfaces can be described by a parameter, delta(M1/M2), which
determines the spin-flipping probability, P = 1 - exp(-delta). Increasing
delta(M1/M2) usually decreases the MR. We list measured values of these
parameters and discuss the limitations on their determinations.

been investigated by electric field effect (EFE). The high resistivity of such
thin films warrants a high sensitivity of the EFE method. The SrTiO3 substrate
serves as the dielectric layer in the Gate-Dielectric-PbTe structure. Due to
the large dielectric constant of SrTiO3, particularly at low temperatures, the
electric displacement D in the film reaches the high value of about 10^8 V/cm,
and the EFE introduced charge into the PbTe film amounts to ~ 8 microC/cm2. The
high D permits to measure the EFE resistance and Hall constant over a wide
region of D, revealing the characteristic features of their D-dependence. An
appropriate theoretical model has been formulated, showing that, for such
films, one can measure the dependence of the Fermi level on D. In fact, we
demonstrate that shifting the Fermi level across the gap by varying D, the
density-of-states of the in-gape states can be mapped out. Our results show,
that the PbTe layers studied, possess a mobility gap exceeding the gap of bulk
PbTe.

the general features of neutrino mixing and relaxation via charged currents in
a medium. The reduced density matrix and the non-equilibrium effective action
that describes the propagation of neutrinos is obtained by integrating out the
bath degrees of freedom. We obtain the dispersion relations, mixing angles and
relaxation rates of ``neutrino'' quasiparticles. The dispersion relations and
mixing angles are of the same form as those of neutrinos in the medium, and the
relaxation rates are given by $\Gamma_1(k) = \Gamma_{ee}(k)

limited data $(5-10 fb^{-1})$, and improved with more data. This is because of
two reasons -- a) it is possible in many cases to reliably go from
(semi)realistic microscopic string construction to the space of experimental
observables, say, LHC signatures. b) The patterns of signatures at the LHC are
sensitive to the structure of the underlying theoretical constructions. We
illustrate our approach by analyzing two promising classes of string
compactifications along with six other string-motivated constructions. Even
though these constructions are not complete, they illustrate the point we want
to emphasize. We think that using this technique effectively over time can
eventually help us to meaningfully connect experimental data to microscopic

the background field method, we demonstrate that, contrary to the standard
formulation, the non-perturbative gluon self-energy is transverse
order-by-order in the dressed loop expansion, and separately for gluonic and
ghost contributions. We next present a comprehensive review of several subtle
issues relevant to the search of infrared finite solutions, paying particular
attention to the role of the seagull graph in enforcing transversality, the
necessity of introducing massless poles in the three-gluon vertex, and the
incorporation of the correct renormalization group properties. In addition, we
present a method for regulating the seagull-type contributions based on
dimensional regularization; its applicability depends crucially on the
asymptotic behavior of the solutions in the deep ultraviolet, and in particular
on the anomalous dimension of the dynamically generated gluon mass. A
linearized version of the truncated Schwinger-Dyson equation is derived, using
a vertex that satisfies the required Ward identity and contains massless poles
belonging to different Lorentz structures. The resulting integral equation is
then solved numerically, the infrared and ultraviolet properties of the
obtained solutions are examined in detail, and the allowed range for the
effective gluon mass is determined. Various open questions and possible

neutrino flavor oscillations in vacuum since the calculated transition and

heuristic constructions of compact incomplete examples, geodesics in warped,

problems on stability of completeness.
  Then, we study the variational framework, and focus on two fundamental
problems of this approach, which regards geodesic connectedness. The first one
deals with a variational principle for stationary manifolds, and its recent
implementation inside Causality Theory. The second one concerns orthogonal
splitting manifolds, and a reasonably self-contained development is provided,

  Form Factors and Their Ratio at Q^2 = 2.64, 3.20, and 4.10 GeV^2","Ph.D. Thesis, Northwestern University, Advisor: Ralph E. Segel",,,,"nucl-ex",,"  Due to the inconsistency in the results of the GEp/Gmp ratio of the proton,
as extracted from the Rosenbluth and recoil polarization techniques, high
precision measurements of the e-p elastic scattering cross sections were made
at Q^2 = 2.64, 3.20, and 4.10 GeV^2. Protons were detected, in contrast to
previous measurements where the scattered electrons were detected, which
dramatically decreased epsilon-dependent systematic uncertainties and
corrections. A single spectrometer measured the scattered protons of interest
while simultaneous measurements at Q^2 = 0.5 GeV^2 were carried out using
another spectrometer which served as a luminosity monitor in order to remove
any uncertainties due to beam charge and target density fluctuations. The
absolute uncertainty in the measured cross sections is \approx 3% for both
spectrometers and with relative uncertainties, random and slope, below 1% for
the higher Q^2 protons, and below 1% random and 6% slope for the monitor
spectrometer. The extracted electric and magnetic form factors were determined
to 4%-7% for GEp and 1.5% for GMp. The ratio GEp/Gmp was determined to 4%-7%
and showed mu_p GEp/GMp \approx 1.0. The results of this work are in agreement
with the previous Rosenbluth data and inconsistent with high-Q^2 recoil
polarization results, implying a systematic difference between the two
techniques.

conjugated one-nucleon decays, can be extended to mirror-conjugated
$\alpha$-particles decays, both virtual and real. For virtual $\alpha$-decays
of bound mirror pairs this symmetry manifests itself as a relation between the
Asymptotic Normalization Coefficients (ANCs) of $\alpha$-particle overlap
integrals. This relation is given by a simple analytical formula which involves
$\alpha$-particle separation energies and charges of residual nuclei. For
bound-unbound mirror pairs, the ANC of a bound nucleus is related to the
$\alpha$-width of the mirror unbound level. For unbound mirror pairs we get a
new analytical formula that relates the widths of mirror resonances. We test
the validity of these analytical formuli against the predictions of a two-body
potential and of a many-body microscopic cluster model for several mirror
states in $^7$Li-$^7$Be, $^{11}$B-$^{11}$C and $^{19}$F-$^{19}$Ne isotopes. We
show that these analytical formulae are valid in many cases but that some

excited cores. In general, the results from microscopic model are not very
sensitive to model assumptions and can be used to predict unknown
astrophysically relevant cross sections using known information about mirror

Maxwell's equations for a theory in which the electrostatic force of repulsion
between like charges differs fundamentally in magnitude from the electrostatic
force of attraction between unlike charges. We elaborate on Lorentz'
description by means of electric and magnetic field strengths, whose governing
equations separate into two fully relativistic Maxwell systems--one describing
ordinary electromagnetism, and the other describing a universally attractive or
repulsive long-range force. If such a force cannot be ruled out {\it a priori}

a single site of a two-dimensional lattice of area $A\sim 35\times 35

an optical depth for an on-resonant probe beam $>80$ which is an increase by a

the transmitted wave can appear in the form of a frozen mode with very large
