massive, dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters, spanning the redshift range
0.06<z<0.7. The observed dark matter and total mass (dark-plus-luminous matter)
profiles can be approximated by the Navarro Frenk & White (hereafter NFW) model
for cold dark matter (CDM) halos; for ~80 per cent of the clusters, the NFW
model provides a statistically acceptable fit. In contrast, the singular
isothermal sphere model can, in almost every case, be completely ruled out. We
observe a well-defined mass-concentration relation for the clusters with an
intrinsic scatter in good agreement with the predictions from simulations. The
slope of the mass-concentration relation, c\propto M_vir^a/(1+z)^b with
a=-0.45\pm0.12 at 95 per cent confidence, is steeper than the value a~-0.1
predicted by CDM simulations for lower mass halos. With the slope a included as
a free fit parameter, the redshift evolution of the concentration parameter,
b=0.71\pm0.52 at 95 per cent confidence, is consistent with the same
simulations (b~1). Fixing a~-0.1 leads to an apparent evolution that is
significantly slower, b=0.30\pm0.49, although the goodness of fit in this case
is significantly worse. Using a generalized NFW model, we find the inner dark
matter density slope, alpha, to be consistent with unity at 95 per cent
confidence for the majority of clusters. Combining the results for all clusters
for which the generalized NFW model provides a good description of the data, we
measure alpha=0.88\pm0.29 at 95 per cent confidence, in agreement with CDM
model predictions.

K~3-35 is remarkable because it is one of the two PNe reported to exhibit water
maser emission, which is present in the central region as well as at a distance

dense molecular clumps, that may provide the shielding mechanism which protects

For the specific detector and shielding geometry considered here and an orbit

extragalactic below 200 keV. Prompt and delayed hadronic backgrounds grow
increasingly important above this energy, becoming the main contributors to the

important dynamical instabilities, such as Kelvin-Helmholtz or Rayleigh-Taylor,

Gaussian random fields, and have been previously neglected or ignored. We
measure these higher order terms from radiative transfer simulations and
estimate them using cosmological perturbation theory. In our simulated models,
the higher order terms are significant: neglecting them leads to a >~100% error
in 21 cm power spectrum predictions on scales of k >~ 1 Mpc^{-1} when the
neutral fraction is <x_H>~0.5. The higher order terms have a simple physical
interpretation. On small scales they are produced by gravitational mode
coupling. Small scale structure grows more readily in large-scale overdense
regions, but the same regions tend to be ionized and hence do not contribute to
the 21 cm signal. This acts to suppress the influence of non-linear density
fluctuations and the small-scale amplitude of the 21 cm power spectrum. These
results modify earlier intuition that the 21 cm power spectrum simply traces
the density power spectrum on scales smaller than that of a typical bubble, and
imply that small scale measurements contain more information about the nature
of the ionizing sources than previously believed. On large scales, higher order
moments are not directly related to gravity. They are non-zero because
over-dense regions tend to ionize first and are important in magnitude at late
times owing to the large fluctuations in the neutral fraction. (Abridged)

For roughly half of the SDSS samples, the Bayesian abundances obtained by the

abundance by a factor of ~0.20 dex and ~0.06 dex, respectively. The N2 index,
rather than the O3N2 index, provides relatively consistent O/H abundances with
the Te-method, but with some scatter. The relations of N2, O3N2, S2 with
log(O/H) are consistent with the photoionization model calculations of Kewley &

We have performed 3-D MHD simulations of the solar radiative interior to check
whether a fossil magnetic field is able to prevent the spread of the
tachocline. Starting with a purely poloidal magnetic field and a latitudinal
shear meant to be imposed by the convection zone at the top of the radiation
zone, we have investigated the interactions between magnetic fields, rotation
and shear, using the spectral code ASH on massive parallel supercomputers. In
all cases we have explored, the fossil field diffuses outward and ends up
connecting with the convection zone, whose differential rotation is then
imprinted at latitudes above 40 deg throughout the radiative interior,
according to Ferraro's law of isorotation. Rotation remains uniform in the
lower latitude region which is contained within closed field lines. We find
that the meridional flow cannot stop the inward progression of the differential
rotation. Further, we observe the development of non-axisymmetric
magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, first due to the initial poloidal
configuration of the fossil field, and later to the toroidal field produced by
shearing the poloidal field through the differential rotation. We do not find
dynamo action as such in the radiative interior, since the mean poloidal field
is not regenerated. But the instability persists during the whole evolution,
while slowly decaying with the mean poloidal field. According to our numerical
simulations, a fossil magnetic field cannot prevent the radiative spread of the
tachocline, and thus it is unable to enforce uniform rotation in the radiation
zone. Neither can the observed thinness of that layer be invoked as a proof for
such an internal fossil magnetic field.

shown that a fraction of them originate in the local universe. These systems
may well be the result of giant flares from Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs)
believed to be magnetars (neutron stars with extremely large magnetic fields >=
10^14 G). If these magnetars are formed via the core collapse of massive stars,
then it would be expected that the bursts should originate from predominantly
young stellar populations. However, correlating the positions of BATSE short
bursts with structure in the local universe reveals a correlation with all
galaxy types, including those with little or no ongoing star formation. This is
a natural outcome if, in addition to magnetars forming via the core collapse of
massive stars, they also form via Accretion Induced Collapse following the
merger of two white dwarfs, one of which is magnetic. We investigate this
possibility and find that the rate of magnetar production via WD-WD mergers in
the Milky Way is comparable to the rate of production via core collapse.
However, while the rate of magnetar production by core collapse is proportional
to the star formation rate, the rate of production via WD-WD mergers (which
have long lifetimes) is proportional to the stellar mass density, which is
concentrated in early-type systems. Therefore magnetars produced via WD-WD
mergers may produce SGR giant flares which can be identified with early type
galaxies. We also comment on the possibility that this mechanism could produce
a fraction of the observed short duration GRB population at low redshift.

radiative envelope. The MHD equations are solved using the ASH code to examine
turbulent flows and magnetic fields, both of which exhibit intricate time
dependence. By introducing small seed magnetic fields into our progenitor
hydrodynamic models rotating at one and four times the solar rate, we assess
here how the vigorous convection can amplify those fields and sustain them
against ohmic decay. Dynamo action is indeed realized, ultimately yielding
magnetic fields that are in energy equipartion with the flow. Such magnetism
reduces the differential rotation obtained in the progenitors, partly by
Maxwell stresses that transport angular momentum poleward and oppose the
Reynolds stresses in the latitudinal balance. In contrast, in the radial
direction we find that the Maxwell and Reynolds stresses may act together to
transport angular momentum. The central columns of slow rotation established in
the progenitors are weakened, with the differential rotation waxing and waning
in strength as the simulations evolve. We assess the morphology of the flows
and magnetic fields, their complex temporal variations, and the manner in which
dynamo action is sustained. Differential rotation and helical convection are
both found to play roles in giving rise to the magnetic fields. The magnetism
is dominated by strong fluctuating fields throughout the core, with the

elements. Self-consistent MHD simulations which realistically incorporate all
of these processes are not yet computationally feasible, though some elements
can now be studied with reasonable fidelity. Here we consider the manner in
which turbulent compressible convection within the bulk of the solar convection
zone can generate large-scale magnetic fields through dynamo action. We
accomplish this through a series of three-dimensional numerical simulations of
MHD convection within rotating spherical shells using our ASH code on massively
parallel supercomputers. Since differential rotation is a key ingredient in all
dynamo models, we also examine here the nature of the rotation profiles that
can be sustained within the deep convection zone as strong magnetic fields are
built and maintained. We find that the convection is able to maintain a
solar-like angular velocity profile despite the influence of Maxwell stresses
which tend to oppose Reynolds stresses and thus reduce the latitudinal angular
velocity contrast throughout the convection zone. The dynamo-generated magnetic
fields exhibit a complex structure and evolution, with radial fields
concentrated in downflow lanes and toroidal fields organized into twisted
ribbons which are extended in longitude and which achieve field strengths of up
to 5000 G. The flows and fields exhibit substantial kinetic and magnetic
helicity although systematic hemispherical patterns are only apparent in the
former. Fluctuating fields dominate the magnetic energy and account for most of
the back-reaction on the flow via Lorentz forces. Mean fields are relatively
weak and do not exhibit systematic latitudinal propagation or periodic polarity
reversals as in the sun. This may be attributed to the absence of a tachocline.

which takes into account the stochastic nature of the sedimentation process
using a Fokker-Planck equation for the particle distribution function in phase
space, is used to obtain the vertical scale height of the solid layer as a
function of the vertical component of the turbulent gas velocity correlation
function and the particle stopping time. This is found to be of the same form

linking the soft excess to either reflection or absorption from relativistic,
partially ionized material close to the black hole. The reflection models can
also simultaneously produce the 7 keV feature from fluorescent iron Ka line
emission from the disc. Here we show that absorption can also produce a sharp
feature at 7 keV from the P Cygni profile which results from
absorption/scattering/emission of He- and H-like iron Ka resonance lines in the

XMM-Newton data from 1H 0707-495 to a P Cygni profile. The resulting column and
ionization required to produce this feature are probably larger than those
needed to produce the soft excess. Nonetheless, the absorbing material could

Nebulae (PNe) observed in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) with the Hubble
Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The Hubble Space Telescope's
spatial resolution allows us to resolve the central star from its nebula (and
line-of-sight stars) at the distance of the LMC, eliminating the dependency on
photoionization modeling in the determination of the stellar flux. For the PNe
in which the central star is detected we obtain the stellar luminosities by
directly measuring the stellar fluxes through broad-band imaging and the
stellar temperatures through Zanstra analysis. From the position of the central
stars in the HR diagram with respect to theoretical evolutionary tracks, we are
able to determine reliable core masses for 21 central stars. By including the
central star masses determined in this paper to the 16 obtained previously
using the same technique (Villaver et al. 2003), we have increased the sample
of central star masses in the LMC to 37, for which we find a non-Gaussian mass
distribution. The average central star mass for this sample is <m_CS, LMC>=
0.65\pm 0.07 Msun, slightly higher than the one reported in the literature for
both white dwarfs and the central stars of PNe in the Galaxy. If significant,
this higher average central star mass in the LMC can be understood in terms of
a metallicity dependency on mass-loss rates during the Asymptotic Giant Branch,
since the LMC has on average half the metallicity compared to the Galaxy.
Finally, for the 37 objects analyzed in the LMC, we do not find any significant
correlation between the mass of the central star and the morphology of the
nebula.

Our analysis starts by noting that the BGS entropy is a special case of
relative entropy. The latter characterizes probability distributions with
respect to a pre-specified reference measure. To identify the canonical BGS
entropy with a relative entropy is appealing for two reasons: (i) the maximum
entropy principle assumes a coordinate invariant form; (ii) thermodynamic
equilibrium distributions, which are obtained as solutions of the maximum
entropy problem, may be characterized in terms of the transformation properties
of the underlying reference measure (e.g., invariance under group
transformations). As examples, we analyze two frequently considered candidates
for the one-particle equilibrium velocity distribution of an ideal gas of
relativistic particles. It becomes evident that the standard J\""uttner
distribution is related to the (additive) translation group on momentum space.
Alternatively, imposing Lorentz invariance of the reference measure leads to a
so-called modified J\""uttner function, which differs from the standard
J\""uttner distribution by a prefactor, proportional to the inverse particle
energy.

quenched disorder in the pairing potential and thermal fluctuations in both
phase and amplitude of the superconducting gap. Most of our calculations assume
two types of superconducting regions: $\alpha$, with a small gap and large
superfluid density, and $\beta$, with the opposite. If the $\beta$ regions are
randomly embedded in an $\alpha$ host, the LDOS on the $\alpha$ sites still has
a sharp coherence peak at $T = 0$, but the $\beta$ component does not, in
agreement with experiment. An ordered arrangement of $\beta$ regions leads to
oscillations in the LDOS as a function of energy. The model leads to a
superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ well below the pseudogap
temperature $T_{c0}$, and has a spatially varying gap at very low $T$, both
consistent with experiments in underdoped Bi2212. Our calculated

Anisotropy plays a central role in the stability against agglomeration of

all-electron approach the wurtzite polymorph has a smaller equilibrium volume

simulate the diametric compression of a disc shape specimen under a constant
external force. The model allows to follow the development of the fracture
process on the macro- and micro-level varying the relative influence of the
mechanisms of damage accumulation over the load history and healing of
microcracks. As a specific example we consider recent experimental results on
the fatigue fracture of asphalt. Our numerical simulations show that for
intermediate applied loads the lifetime of the specimen presents a power law
behavior. Under the effect of healing, more prominent for small loads compared
to the tensile strength of the material, the lifetime of the sample increases
and a fatigue limit emerges below which no macroscopic failure occurs. The
numerical results are in a good qualitative agreement with the experimental
findings.

nanotubes and from a more general point of view the understanding of the
microscopic origin of friction. Indeed, the relative simplicity of the system
allows us to interpret more easily the physical phenomenon observed than in
larger systems. In order to achieve this goal, non-equilibrium statistical
mechanics permitted first to develop models based on Langevin equations
describing the dynamics of rotation and translation in double walled nanotubes.
The molecular dynamics simulations then permitted to validate these analytical
models, and thus to study general properties of friction such as the dependence
on area of contact, temperature and the geometry of the nanotubes. The results
obtained shows that friction increases linearly with the sliding velocity or
the angular velocity until very high values beyond which non-linearities appear
enhancing dissipation. In the linear regime, it is shown that the
proportionality factor between the dynamic friction force and the velocity is
given by the time integral of the autocorrelation function of the restoring
force for the sliding friction and of the torque for the rotational friction.
Furthermore, a novel resonant friction phenomenon increasing significantly
dissipation was observed for the sliding motion in certain types of nanotubes.
The effect arises at sliding velocities corresponding to certain vibrational
modes of the nanotubes. When the dynamics is described by the linear friction
in velocity, the empirical law stating that friction is proportional to the
area of contact is very well verified thanks to the molecular dynamics
simulations. On the other hand, friction increases with temperature.

implicitly provides restrictions on the moments arising from the smoothness of
physically reasonable vector fields. We also show that requiring all of the

limiting the applicability of the Ehlers-Rudolph-Dixon notion of quasirigid

of shadows induced by inertial frame changes is studied in detail by proving
that, (i) the shadow of an object has the same shape in every
orthogonal-to-light screen, (ii) if two shadows are simultaneous in an
orthogonal-to-light screen then they are simultaneous in any such screen. In
particular, the Galilean group in 2+1 dimensions is recognized as an exact
symmetry of Nature which acts on the shadows of the events instead that on the
events themselves. The group theoretical approach to lightlike dimensional
reduction is used to solve the reconstruction problem of a trajectory starting
from its acceleration history or from its projected (shadow) trajectory. The
possibility of obtaining a Galilean projected physics starting from a
Poincar\'e invariant physics is stressed through the example of relativistic
collisions. In particular, it is shown that the projection of a relativistic
collision between massless particles gives a non-relativistic collision in

quantization constrain the spectrum as a branching of the adjoints of SO(32),

the single gauge coupling of type I could give rise to different coupling below

Posed in this way, any flow's unknown wavenumber coefficients can be solved for
recursively beginning with the zeroth-order coefficient representing any
initial flow. When all matrices in the time series commute, a flow's unknown
coefficients also represent the Taylor expansion of a stable matrix exponential

analysis. However, independent computation of the SVD for each sample taken
from a bandlimited matrix random process will result in singular value sample
paths whose tangled evolution is not consistent with the structure of the

follows: (i) a SVD with relaxed identification conditions is proposed, (ii) an
approach is formulated for computing the SVD's of two adjacent matrices in the
sample path with the objective of maximizing the correlation between
corresponding singular vectors of the two matrices, and (iii) an efficient
algorithm is given for untangling the singular value sample paths. The
algorithm gives a unique solution conditioned on the seed matrix's SVD. Its
effectiveness is demonstrated on bandlimited Gaussian random-matrix sample
paths. Results are shown to be consistent with those predicted by random-matrix
theory. A primary application of the algorithm is in multiple-antenna radio
systems. The benefit promised by using SVD untangling in these systems is that
the fading rate of the channel's SVD factors is greatly reduced so that the
performance of channel estimation, channel feedback and channel prediction can
be increased.

cluster models. The theory is based on a comprehensive nonperturbative
probabilistic description of long connected clusters in terms of essentially
one-dimensional chains of irreducible objects. Statistics of local observables,
for example, displacement, over such chains obey classical limit laws, and our
construction leads to an effective random walk representation of percolation
clusters. The results include a derivation of a sharp Ornstein--Zernike type
asymptotic formula for two point functions, a proof of analyticity and strict
convexity of inverse correlation length and a proof of an invariance principle
for connected clusters under diffusive scaling. In two dimensions duality
considerations enable a reformulation of these results for supercritical
nearest-neighbor random cluster measures, in particular, for nearest-neighbor
Potts models in the phase transition regime. Accordingly, we prove that in two
dimensions Potts equilibrium crystal shapes are always analytic and strictly
convex and that the interfaces between different phases are always diffusive.
Thus, no roughening transition is possible in the whole regime where our
results apply. Our results hold under an assumption of exponential decay of
finite volume wired connectivities [assumption (1.2) below] in rectangular
domains that is conjectured to hold in the whole subcritical regime; the latter
is known to be true, in any dimensions, when $q=1$, $q=2$, and when $q$ is
sufficiently large. In two dimensions assumption (1.2) holds whenever there is
an exponential decay of connectivities in the infinite volume measure. By
duality, this includes all supercritical nearest-neighbor Potts models with
positive surface tension between ordered phases.

extended Skorokhod map (ESM) that enable a pathwise construction of reflected
diffusions that are not necessarily semimartingales. Roughly speaking, given
the closure G of an open connected set in R^J, a non-empty convex cone d(x) in
R^J, specified at each point x on the boundary of G, and a cadlag trajectory
\psi taking values in R^J, the ESM defines a constrained version \phi of \psi
that takes values in G and is such that the increments of \phi - \psi on any
interval [s,t] lie in the closed convex hull of the directions d(\phi(u)), u in
(s,t]. General deterministic properties of the ESP are first established under
the only assumption that the graph of d(.) is closed. Next, for a class of
multi-dimensional ESPs on polyhedral domains, pathwise uniqueness and existence
of strong solutions to the associated stochastic differential equations is
established. In addition, it is also proved that these reflected diffusions are
semimartingales on [0,\tau_0], where \tau_0 is the time to hit the set of
points x on the boundary for which d(x) contains a line. One motivation for the
study of this class of reflected diffusions is that they arise as
approximations of queueing networks in heavy traffic that use the so-called
generalised processor sharing discipline.

kinetically constrained spin models (KCSM) intensively studied in the physical
literature as simple models sharing some of the features of a glass transition.
KCSM are interacting particle systems on $\Z^d$ with Glauber-like dynamics,
reversible w.r.t. a simple product i.i.d Bernoulli($p$) measure. The essential
feature of a KCSM is that the creation/destruction of a particle at a given
site can occur only if the current configuration of empty sites around it
satisfies certain constraints which completely define each specific model. No
other interaction is present in the model. From the mathematical point of view,
the basic issues concerning positivity of the spectral gap inside the
ergodicity region and its scaling with the particle density $p$ remained open
for most KCSM (with the notably exception of the East model in $d=1$
\cite{Aldous-Diaconis}). Here for the first time we: i) identify the ergodicity
region by establishing a connection with an associated bootstrap percolation
model; ii) develop a novel multi-scale approach which proves positivity of the
spectral gap in the whole ergodic region; iii) establish, sometimes optimal,
bounds on the behavior of the spectral gap near the boundary of the ergodicity
region and iv) establish pure exponential decay for the persistence function.
Our techniques are flexible enough to allow a variety of constraints and our
findings disprove certain conjectures which appeared in the physical literature
on the basis of numerical simulations.

highlight a generaic feature of the phase-transition phenomenology: the
temperature interval where pasta phases are formed is enhanced by
Coulomb-frustration effects. This result is at variance with the behaviour of
frustrated ferromagnetic systems as well as hot nuclei and mean-field
approaches. Moreover, the region of phase coexistence is not found to end upon
a critical point, indicating that no critical opalescence can occur in

plasma case a modified form of the HM equation, which takes into account
suppression of the magnetic-surface-averaged electron density response by a
small amount of rotational transform, is also analyzed. Excitation of zonal
mean flow by a modulated wave train is particularly strong in the modified HM
case. A local dispersion relation for a coherent wave train is calculated by
linearizing about a background mean flow and used to find the nonlinear
frequency shift by inserting the nonlinearly excited mean flow. Using the
generic nonlinear Schroedinger equation about a uniform carrier wave, the
criterion for instability of small modulations of the wave train is found, as
is the maximum growth rate and phase velocity of the modulations and zonal

``neutrophil'' type in which the long axis of cell roughly coincides with its
moving direction. This type of cell extends a leading edge at the front and
retracts a narrow tail at the rear, whose shape has been often drawn as a
typical amoeba in textbooks. The other one is the ``keratocyte'' type with
widespread lamellipodia along the front side arc. Short axis of cell in this
type roughly coincides with its moving direction. In order to understand what
kind of molecular feature causes conversion between two types of morphologies,
and how two typical morphologies are maintained, a mathematical model of
amoebic cells is developed. This model describes movement of cell and
intracellular reactions of activator, inhibitor and actin filaments in a
unified way. It is found that the producing rate of activator is a key factor
of conversion between two types. This model also explains the observed data
that the keratocye type cells tend to rapidly move along a straight line. The
neutrophil type cells move along a straight line when the moving velocity is
small, but they show fluctuated motions deviating from a line when they move as
fast as the keratocye type cells. Efficient energy consumption in the
neutrophil type cells is predicted.
