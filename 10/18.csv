given their expected accretion rates. This motivates models of radiatively
inefficient accretion, due to either ion-electron thermal decoupling,
generation of outflows that inhibit accretion, or settling of gas to a
gravitationally unstable disk that forms stars in preference to feeding the
black hole. The latter model predicts the presence of cold molecular gas in a
thin disk around the black hole. Here we report Submillimeter Array
observations of the nucleus of the giant elliptical galaxy M87 that probe 230
GHz continuum and CO(J=2--1) line emission. Continuum emission is detected from
the nucleus and several knots in the jet, including one that has been
undergoing flaring behavior. We estimate a conservative upper limit on the mass
of molecular gas within ~100pc and +-400km/s line of sight velocity of the
central black hole of ~8x10^6Msun, which includes an allowance for possible
systematic errors associated with subtraction of the continuum. Ignoring such
errors, we have a 3 sigma sensitivity to about 3x10^6Msun. In fact, the
continuum-subtracted spectrum shows weak emission features extending up to 4
sigma above the RMS dispersion of the line-free channels. These may be
artifacts of the continuum subtraction process. Alternatively, if they are
interpreted as CO emission, then the implied molecular gas mass is ~5x10^6Msun
spread out over a velocity range of 700km/s. These constraints on molecular gas
mass are close to the predictions of the model of self-gravitating,
star-forming accretion disks fed by Bondi accretion (Tan & Blackman 2005).

Detection of sea-surface glints would differentiate ocean-bearing terrestrial

for the fractional linear polarization of sea-surface reflections and of

The pulsar has a characteristic age of 1,700 yrs and inferred surface dipole

and unabsorbed luminosity of ~10^32 ergs/s in the 0.5-10.0 keV range (assuming
a distance of 2.7 kpc). A spatially resolved imaging analysis suggests the
presence of softer emission from the pulsar. No pulsations are detected from

a high space velocity. The first two interpretations imply equipartition fields
in the observed structures of ~40-100 uG, while the latter case implies a

systems that each occupy a single dark matter halo. We estimate group masses
from their abundances, and measure their relative large-scale bias as a
function of mass. Our measurements are in agreement with the theoretical halo
bias function, given a standard LCDM cosmological model, and they tend to favor
a low value of the power spectrum amplitude sigma_8. We search for a residual
dependence of clustering on other group properties at fixed mass, and find the
strongest signal for central galaxy color in high mass groups. Massive groups
with less red central galaxies are more biased on large scales than similar
mass groups with redder central galaxies. We show that this effect is unlikely
to be caused by errors in our mass estimates, and is most likely observational
evidence of recent theoretical findings that halo bias depends on a ``second
parameter'' other than mass, such as age or concentration. To compare with the
data, we study the bias of massive halos in N-body simulations and quantify the
strength of the relation between halo bias and concentration at fixed mass. In
addition to confirming a non-trivial prediction of the LCDM cosmological model,
these results have important implications for the role that environment plays

(1+$z$)$^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha$$\simeq0.4\pm$0.1. This evolution is
consistent with the integrated X-ray background, which provides the strongest

slowly. Giant molecular clouds convert only a few percent of their gas into
stars per free-fall time, and recent observations show that this low star
formation rate is essentially constant over a range of scales from individual
cluster-forming molecular clumps in the Milky Way to entire starburst galaxies.
This striking result is perhaps the most basic fact that any theory of star
formation must explain. I argue that a model in which star formation occurs in
virialized structures at a rate regulated by supersonic turbulence can explain
this observation. The turbulence in turn is driven by star formation feedback,
which injects energy to offset radiation from isothermal shocks and keeps
star-forming structures from wandering too far from virial balance. This model
is able to reproduce observational results covering a wide range of scales,
from the formation times of young clusters to the extragalactic IR-HCN
correlation, and makes additional quantitative predictions that will be
testable in the next few years.

thermal-infrared data. Tuning the model to match the observed shell thickness
allows us to determine the threshold density which permits survival of H2. An
average hydrogen density of n_H=(0.5-1)x10^7 cm-3 in the outer zone is required
to allow H2 to exist at all latitudes in the nebula, and for Fe+ to recombine.
This gives independent confirmation of the very large mass of the Homunculus,
indicating a total of roughly 15--35 Msun (although we note reasons why the
lower end of this range is favored). At the interface between the atomic and
molecular zones, we predict a sharp drop in the dust temperature, in agreement
with the bimodal dust color temperatures observed in the two zones. In the
outer molecular shell, the dust temperature drops to nearly the blackbody
temperature, and becomes independent of grain size because of self-shielding at
shorter UV wavelengths and increased heating at longer wavelengths. This
relaxes constraints on large grain sizes suggested by near-blackbody color
temperatures. Finally, from the strength of infrared [FeII] emission in the
inner shell we find that the gas-phase Fe abundance is roughly solar. This is
astonishing in such a dusty object, where one normally expects gaseous iron to
be depleted by two orders of magnitude.

empirically by cosmological distance measures, there exists two branches of
f(R) solutions that are parameterized by B propto d^2 f/dR^2. For B<0, which
include most of the models previously considered, there is a short-timescale
instability at high curvature that spoils agreement with high redshift
cosmological observables. For the stable B>0 branch, f(R) models can reduce the
large-angle CMB anisotropy, alter the shape of the linear matter power
spectrum, and qualitatively change the correlations between the CMB and galaxy
surveys. All of these phenomena are accessible with current and future data and
provide stringent tests of general relativity on cosmological scales.

  Neutrino 2006 conference, Santa Fe, June 2006",,,,"astro-ph",,"  I review the status and perspectives of the research on the diffuse flux of
(core collapse) supernova neutrinos (DF). In absence of a positive signal,
several upper bounds exist in different detection channels. Of these, the
strongest is the limit from SuperKamiokande (SK) of 1.2 electron antineutrinos
cm^-2 s^-1 at 90% confidence level above 19.3 MeV of neutrino energy. The
predictions of the DF depend on the cosmological rate of supernovae and on the
neutrino emission in a individual supernova (spectrum, luminosity,..). Above
the SK threshold, they range between 0.05 electron antineutrinos cm^-2 s^-1 up
to touching the SK limit. The SK upper bound constrains part of the parameter
space of the supernova rate - and indirectly of the star formation rate - only
in models with relatively hard neutrino spectra, while predictions with softer
spectra would need bounds stronger by about a factor of 4 to be tested.
Experimentally, a feasible and very important goal for the future is the
improvement of background discrimination and the resulting lowering of the
detection threshold. Theory instead will benefit from reducing the
uncertainties on the supernova neutrino emission (either with more precise
numerical modeling or with data from a galactic supernova) and on the supernova
rate. The latter will be provided precisely by next generation supernova
surveys up to a normalization factor. Therefore, the detection of the DF is
likely to be precious chiefly to constrain such normalization and to study the
physics of neutrino emission in supernovae.

such systems, namely the presence of rotating pseudo-bulges. We demonstate with
high mass and force resolution collisionless $N$-body simulations that
long-lived secondary bars can form spontaneously without requiring gas,
contrary to previous claims. We find that secondary bars rotate faster than
primary ones. The rotation is not, however, rigid: the secondary bars pulsate,
with their amplitude and pattern speed oscillating as they rotate through the
primary bars. This self-consistent study supports previous work based on
orbital analysis in the potential of two rigidly rotating bars. The pulsating
nature of secondary bars may have important implications for understanding the

structures of homogeneous Gaussian random fields are completely characterized
by the power spectrum. In non-Gaussian random fields, polyspectra, higher-order
counterparts of the power spectrum, are usually considered to characterize
statistical information contained in the fields. However, it is not trivial how
the Fourier modes are distributed in general non-Gaussian fields. In this
paper, distribution functions of Fourier modes are directly considered and
their explicit relations to the polyspectra are given. Under the condition that
any of the polyspectra does not diverge, the distribution function is expanded
by dimensionless combinations of polyspectra and a total volume in which the
Fourier transforms are performed. The expression up to second order is
generally given, and higher-order results are also derived in some cases. A
concept of N-point distribution function of Fourier modes are introduced and
explicitly calculated. Among them, the one-point distribution function is
completely given in a closed form up to arbitrary order. As an application,
statistics of Fourier phases are explored in detail. A number of aspects
regarding statistical properties of phases are found. It is clarified, for the
first time, how phase correlations arise in general non-Gaussian fields. Some
of our analytic results are tested against numerical realizations of
non-Gaussian fields, showing good agreements.

baseline. We detect 26 oscillation frequencies in the WIRE data set, but only
some of these can be seen clearly in the ground-based data. We have used the

differences in the Stromgren b-y colour and the y filter in an attempt to
identify the radial degree of the oscillation frequencies. We conclude that the
accuracies of the amplitudes and phases are not sufficient to constrain

rates and resulting disc luminosities for various disc models corresponding to
the classical Eddington limit by equating the attractive and repulsive forces
locally. We also discuss the observational appearance of such highly accreting
systems by analyzing their spectral energy distributions. Our calculations
indicate that the allowed mass accretion rates differ considerably from what
one expects by applying the Eddington limit in its classical form, while the
luminosities only weakly exceed their classical equivalent. Depending on the
orientation of the disc relative to the observer, mild relativistic beaming
turns out to have an important influence on the disc spectra. Thus, possible
super-Eddington accretion, combined with mild relativistic beaming, supports
the idea that ultraluminous X-ray sources host stellar mass black holes and
accounts partially for the observed high temperatures of these objects.

strictness. General conjectures referring to the structure of the one-parameter

bending phenomenon and stability with respect to axisymmetric perturbations is

are discussed, for a broad choice of phase transitions predicted by different

their late-M and mid-to-late L types. For these Teff, and an age of 5-10 Myrs,
evolutionary models imply M_A ~ 24+/-6 M_Jup and M_B ~ 8+/-2 M_Jup. Independent
comparisons of these models to the observed colors, spanning ~I to L', also
yield the same masses and temperatures. Our primary mass agrees with other
recent analyses; however, our secondary mass, while still in the planetary
regime, is 2-3 times larger than claimed previously. This discrepancy can be
traced to the luminosities: while the absolute photometry and Mbol of the
primary agree with theoretical predictions, the secondary is ~ 2.5+/-0.5 mag
fainter than expected in all bands from I to L' and in Mbol. This accounts for
the much lower secondary mass (and temperature) derived earlier. We argue that
this effect is highly unlikely to result from a variety of model-related
problems, and is instead real. This conclusion is bolstered by the absence of
any luminosity problems in either the primary, or in AB Pic B which we also
analyse. We therefore suggest grey extinction in 2M1207B, due to occlusion by
an edge-on circum-secondary disk. This is consistent with the observed
properties of edge-on disks around T Tauri stars, and with the known presence
of a high-inclination evolved disk around the primary. Finally, the system's
implied mass ratio of ~0.3 suggests a binary-like formation scenario.

and presents some personal opinions regarding their evolution. Three types of
interactions are distinguished: type I, where the binary companion induces the
mass loss; type II, where it shapes the mass loss but does not enhance it; type
III, where a wide orbit causes the centre of mass to move, leading to a spiral
embedded in the wind. Surveys for binary central stars are discussed, and the
separations are compared to the distribution for binary post-AGB stars. The
effect of close binary evolution on nebular morphology is discussed.
Post-common-envelope binaries are surrounded by thin, expanding disks, expelled
in the orbital plane. Wider binaries give rise to much thicker expanding torii.
Type I binary evolution predicts a wide distribution of masses of central
stars, skewed towards low masses. Comparison with observed mass distributions
suggests that this is unlikely to be the only channel leading to the formation
of a planetary nebula. A new sample of compact Bulge nebulae shows about 40% of
nebulae with binary-induced morphologies.

Stromgren bands with an automatic photometric telescope (APT) at Fairborn

rotational modulation of stellar brightness as well as from the modulation of
several photospheric line-depth ratios (LDRs). The presence of chromospheric
plage-like regions has been inferred from the rotational modulation of the
Halpha line equivalent width (EW_Halpha) evaluated with the spectral synthesis
method. The most relevant results are the strong correlation between the
brightness and temperature curves derived respectively from photometry and the
LDRs as well as the striking anti-correlation between brightness and Halpha

frequently observed for the largest sunspot groups (e.g., Catalano et al.

between high-temperature states, we study the magnetic phase transition of

PBAs is expressed in the proper way. First, we found systematic changes in the

magnetic-ordered high-temperature state is confirmed at temperatures lower than
that of the hysteresis region of spin transitions. Second, we found that the
magnetic interaction causes complex ordering processes of a spin transition and
a magnetic phase transition. The effect of a magnetic field on the phase

discussed and the host spins fluctuations are considered within the spin-wave
approximation (SWA). In the present paper we i) go beyond SWA and ii) study
impurities with spins $S\ge1/2$. It is demonstrated that in contrast to defects
coupled to sublattices asymmetrically longitudinal host spins fluctuations play
important role in the frustrated impurity dynamics. The spectral function, that
is proportional to $\omega^2$ within SWA, acquires new terms proportional to
$\omega^2$ and $\omega T^2$. It is observed that the spin-1/2 impurity
susceptibility has the same structure as that obtained within SWA: the Lorenz
peak and the non-resonant term. The difference is that the width of the peak
becomes larger being proportional to $f^2(T/J)^3$ rather than $f^4(T/J)^3$,
where $f$ is the dimensionless coupling parameter. We show that transverse
static susceptibility acquires a new negative logarithmic contribution. In
accordance with previous works we find that host spins fluctuations lead to an
effective one-ion anisotropy on the impurity site. Then defects with $S>1/2$
appears to be split. We observe strong reduction of the value of the splitting
due to longitudinal host spins fluctuations. We demonstrate that the dynamical
impurity susceptibility contains $2S$ Lorenz peaks corresponding to transitions
between the levels, and the non-resonant term.

assumption serves as an upper bound for the secrecy capacity when only the CSI
of the legitimate receiver is known at the transmitter, which is characterized

optimal power and rate allocation strategies. We then propose a low-complexity
on/off power allocation strategy that achieves near-optimal performance with

asymptotically optimal as the average SNR goes to infinity, and interestingly,

Incremental Redundancy Automatic Repeat reQuest (IR-ARQ) scheme, tailored to
jointly combat the effects of collisions, multi-path fading, and additive
noise, is developed. The Diversity-Multiplexing-Delay tradeoff (DMDT) of the
proposed scheme is analyzed for fully-loaded queues, and compared with that of
Gallager tree algorithm for collision resolution and the network-assisted
diversity multiple access (NDMA) protocol of Tsatsanis et al.. The fully-loaded
queue model is then replaced by one with random arrivals, under which these
protocols are compared in terms of the stability region, average delay and
diversity gain. Overall, our analytical and numerical results establish the
superiority of the proposed IR-ARQ scheme and reveal some important insights.
For example, it turns out that the performance is optimized, for a given total
throughput, by maximizing the probability that a certain user sends a new
packet and minimizing the transmission rate employed by each user.

on data recorded using the OPAL detector at LEP at centre-of-mass energies from

the analysis only hadronic decays of the Z boson are considered. A scan over
Higgs boson masses from 1 to 120 GeV and decay widths from 1 to 3000 GeV
revealed no indication for a signal in the data. From a likelihood ratio of
expected signal and Standard Model background we determine upper limits on
cross-section times branching ratio to an invisible final state. For moderate
Higgs boson decay widths, these range from about 0.07pb Mh = 60GeV) to 0.57pb
(Mh = 114GeV). For decay widths above 200GeV the upper limits are of the order
of 0.15pb. The results can be interpreted in general scenarios predicting a
large invisible decay width of the Higgs boson. As an example we interpret the
results in the so-called stealthy Higgs scenario. The limits from this analysis
exclude a large part of the parameter range of this scenario experimentally
accessible at LEP2.

effects and connects to the hot big-bang expansion phase, can produce an almost
scale invariant spectrum of perturbations provided the perturbations are
produced during an almost matter dominated era in the contraction phase. This
is achieved using Bohmian solutions of the canonical Wheeler-de Witt equation,
thus treating both the background and the perturbations in a fully quantum
manner. We find a very slightly blue spectrum ($n_{_\mathrm{S}}-1>0$). Taking
into account the spectral index constraint as well as the CMB normalization
measure yields an equation of state that should be less than $\omega\lesssim
8\times 10^{-4}$, implying $n_{_\mathrm{S}}-1 \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$, and
that the characteristic size of the Universe at the bounce is $L_0 \sim 10^3

implementation of appropriate boundary conditions. This leads us to consider a
Robin boundary condition that gives the quantization of the energy, the
existence of bound states and of critical heights at which the Dirac particle
bounces, extending the well-known results established from the Schrodinger
equation. We also allow for a nonminimal coupling to a weak magnetic field. The
problem is solved in an analytical way on the Rindler spacetime. In the other
cases, we compute the energy spectrum up to the first relativistic corrections,
exhibiting the contributions brought by both the geometry and the spin. These
calculations are done in two different ways. On the one hand, using a
relativistic expansion and, on the other hand, with Foldy-Wouthuysen
transformations. Contrary to what is sometimes claimed in the literature, both
methods are in agreement, as expected. Finally, we make contact with the GRANIT
experiment. Relativistic effects and effects that go beyond the equivalence
principle escape the sensitivity of such an experiment. However, we show that
the influence of a weak magnetic field could lead to observable phenomena.

Over the last decade, optimized Schwarz methods have been developed for
elliptic partial differential equations. These methods use more effective
transmission conditions between subdomains, and are also convergent without
overlap for elliptic problems. We show here why the classical Schwarz method
applied to the hyperbolic problem converges without overlap for Maxwell's

Math. 9 (2007), no. 4, 585-603","10.1142/S0219199707002551",,"math.PR math.CO",,"  We compute the mixing rate of a non-backtracking random walk on a regular
expander. Using some properties of Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind, we
show that this rate may be up to twice as fast as the mixing rate of the simple
random walk. The closer the expander is to a Ramanujan graph, the higher the
ratio between the above two mixing rates is.
  As an application, we show that if $G$ is a high-girth regular expander on
$n$ vertices, then a typical non-backtracking random walk of length $n$ on $G$
does not visit a vertex more than $(1+o(1))\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}$ times,
and this result is tight. In this sense, the multi-set of visited vertices is
analogous to the result of throwing $n$ balls to $n$ bins uniformly, in
contrast to the simple random walk on $G$, which almost surely visits some
vertex $\Omega(\log n)$ times.

  1. Let N be the maximal proper tensor ideal of T(A,d). We show that T(A,d)/N

excitations is included through the Babu-Brown induced interaction, and it is
found that in the absence of three-body forces the self-consistent solution to
the Babu-Brown equations is in poor agreement with the empirical values for the
nuclear observables. This is improved by lowering the nucleon and meson masses
according to Brown-Rho scaling, essentially by including a scalar tadpole
contribution to the meson and nucleon masses, as well as by scaling g_A. We
suggest that modifying the masses of the exchanged mesons is equivalent to
introducing a short-range three-body force, and the net result is that the

unified model for dark matter and quintessence is proposed. Inspired by (O'Dell
et al. 2000) which in an exciting study showed that particular configurations
of intense off-resonant laser beams (simulate the Bose-Einstein condensate) can
give rise to an attractive 1/r interatomic potential, I infer electromagnetic
origin of inertia and gravity. Time varying dark components result in time
varying electromagnetic fine structure constant (alpha) or the quantities given
in its definition (even an invariant alpha would not exclude the possibility
that these values might be changing in ratio to one another), in either case
variable speed of light (VSL) with dc/dt < 0. According to (Wetterich 2003a) a
bound R = delta_alpha(z = 0.13)/delta_alpha(z = 2) < 0.02 strongly favors
quintessence with a time varying equation of state w = p/rho, where the value
of (1+w) at present is substantially smaller than for z = 2 and equivalently
compressibility is increased in the medium and this process has significant
influences on the process of structure formation. These models typically
require quintessence coupling to a photon which would require large coupling
between non-baryonic dark matter and the scalar field therefore consistent with
our model, quintessence may couple to both non-baryonic dark matter and
radiation. Wetterich (2003b) observe that Omega_quint does not affect the time
evolution of the fundamental couplings and alpha depends only on the equation
of state w and this fascinating result further support the common essence of
light and boson dark matter.

adaptive decision-making based on the dilemma of deciding whether to
participate in voluntary influenza vaccination programs. The proportion of the
population vaccinated (i.e., the vaccination coverage) determines epidemic
severity. Above a critical vaccination coverage, epidemics are prevented; hence
individuals find it unnecessary to vaccinate. The adaptive dynamics of the
decisions directly affect influenza epidemiology and, conversely, influenza
epidemiology strongly influences decision-making. This feedback mechanism
creates a unique self-organized state where epidemics are prevented. This state
is attracting, but unstable; thus epidemics are rarely prevented. This result
implies that vaccination will have to be mandatory if the public health
objective is to prevent influenza epidemics. We investigated how collective
behavior changes when public health programs are implemented. Surprisingly,
programs requiring advance payment for several years of vaccination prevents
severe epidemics, even with voluntary vaccination. Prevention is determined by
the individuals' adaptability, memory, and number of pre-paid vaccinations.
Notably, vaccinating families exacerbates and increases the frequency of severe
epidemics.

evolving either on RNA neutral networks or in toy fitness landscapes. We
discuss the spread and the neutrality of the population in the steady state.
Different limits arise depending on whether selection or random drift are
dominant. In the presence of strong drift we show that observables depend
mainly on $M \mu$, $M$ being the population size and $\mu$ the mutation rate,
while corrections to this scaling go as 1/M: such corrections can be quite
large in the presence of selection if there are barriers in the fitness
landscape. Also we find that the convergence to the large $M \mu$ limit is
linear in $1/M \mu$. Finally we introduce a protocol that minimizes drift; then
observables scale like 1/M rather than $1/(M\mu)$, allowing one to determine
the large $M$ limit faster when $\mu$ is small; furthermore the genotypic
diversity increases from $O(\ln M)$ to $O(M)$.

a beam splitter, the photons will coalesce and leave together from the same
output port. This is a quantum interference effect, which occurs because the
two possible paths where the photons leave in different output ports interfere
destructively. This effect was first observed in parametric downconversion by
Hong, Ou and Mandel, and then with single photons produced one after the other
by the same quantum emitter. With the recent development of quantum
information, a lot of attention has been devoted to this coalescence effect as
a resource for quantum data processing using linear optics techniques. To
ensure the scalability of schemes based on these ideas, it is crucial that
indistinguishable photons are emitted by a collection of synchronized, but
otherwise independent sources. In this paper, we demonstrate the quantum
interference of two single photons emitted by two independently trapped single
atoms, bridging the gap towards the simultaneous emission of many
indistinguishable single photons by different emitters. Our data analysis shows
that the coalescence observed is mostly limited by the wavefront matching of
the light emitted by the two atoms, and to a lesser extent by the motion of
each atom in its own trap.
