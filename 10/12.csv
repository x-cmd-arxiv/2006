multiple, uncoupled scalar fields. This calculation thus applies to all models
of assisted inflation, including N-flation, where inflation is driven by
multiple axion fields arising from shift symmetries in a flux stabilized string
vacuum. The non-Gaussianities are associated with nonlinear evolution of the
field (and density) perturbations, characterized by the parameter $f_{NL}$. We
derive a general expression for the nonlinear parameter, incorporating the
evolution of perturbations after horizon-crossing. This is valid for arbitrary
separable potentials during slow roll. To develop an intuitive understanding of
this system and to demonstrate the applicability of the formalism we examine
several cases with quadratic potentials: two-field models with a wide range of
mass ratios, and a general N-field model with a narrow mass spectrum. We
uncover that $f_{NL}$ is suppressed as the number of e-foldings grows, and that
this suppression is increased in models with a broad spectrum of masses. On the
other hand, we find no enhancement to $f_{NL}$ that increases with the number
of fields. We thus conclude that the production of a large non-Gaussian signal
in multi-field models of inflation is very unlikely as long as fields are
slowly rolling and potentials are of simple, quadratic form. Finally, we
compute a spectrum for the scalar spectral index that incorporates the
nonlinear corrections to the fields' evolution.

relatively young remnant containing an X-ray point source that may be its

from our 30 ks exploratory Chandra observation shows very strong lines that
require elevated element abundances from ejecta, in particular of sulfur. A
plane-shock model fit gives a temperature $kT = 0.9 (0.8, 1.0)$ keV, an
ionization timescale $n_et = 6 (4, 9) \times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$ s, and a sulfur
abundance of 2.1 (1.7, 2.7) times solar (90% confidence limits). Two-component
models with one solar and one enriched component are also plausible, but are
not well constrained by the data. Various estimates give a remnant age of order
$10^3$ yr, which would make G15.9+0.2 among the dozen or so youngest remnants
in the Galaxy. The sparse point source spectrum is consistent with either a
steep $\Gamma \sim$ 4 power law or a $kT \sim$ 0.4 keV blackbody. The spectrum
is absorbed by a H column density $N_H \sim 4 \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ similar
to that required for the remnant shell. The implied 2--9.5 keV source
luminosity is about $10^{33}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ for an assumed distance of 8.5 kpc
consistent with the high absorption column. We suggest that the point source is
either a rotation-powered pulsar or a compact central object (CCO).

an anisotropic relation between redshifts and the luminosity distances of

tenuous radio plasma in radio jet cocoons is modelled by 2D compressible
hydrodynamic simulations. The initial setup is the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability
at a contact surface of density contrast 10,000. The denser medium contains
clouds of higher density. Optically thin radiation is realised via a cooling
source term. The cool phase effectively extracts energy from the other gas
which is both, radiated away and used for acceleration of the cold phase. This
increases the system's cooling rate substantially and leads to a massively
amplified cold mass dropout. We show that it is feasible, given small seed
clouds of order 100 solar masses, that all of the optically emitting gas in a
radio jet cocoon may be produced by this mechanism on the propagation timescale
of the jet. The mass is generally distributed as T^-1/2 with temperature, with
a prominent peak at 14,000 K. This peak is likely to be related to the
counteracting effects of shock heating and a strong rise in the cooling
function. The volume filling factor of cold gas in this peak is of the order
10^-5 to 10^-3 and generally increases during the simulation time. The
simulations tend towards an isotropic scale free Kolmogorov-type energy
spectrum over the simulation timescale. We find the same Mach-number density
relation as Kritsuk & Norman (2004) and show that this relation may explain the
velocity widths of emission lines associated with high redshift radio galaxies,
if the environmental temperature is lower, or the jet-ambient density ratio is
less extreme than in their low redshift counterparts.

distinguish the neutron stars oscillating modes. Moreover, since the source can
be identified by its characteristic damping time, we are able to extract

CN emission was delayed compared to the light curve of dust-scattered sunlight.
The CN emission also expanded faster than the cloud of scattering dust. The
emission of [OI] at 630 nm rose similarly to the scattered light, but then
remained nearly constant for several hours after impact. On the day following
the impact, both CN and [OI] emission concentrated on the comet nucleus had
returned nearly to pre-impact levels. We have also searched for differences in
the scattering properties of the dust ejected by the impact compared to the
dust released under normal conditions. Compared to the pre-impact state of the
comet, we find evidence that the color of the comet was slightly bluer during

times, in which binaries are disrupted faster compared to analogous simulations

and how SSP-equivalent parameters derived from different Balmer-line indices

We find that the SSP-equivalent age depends primarily on the age of the young

SSP-equivalent chemical composition depends mainly on the chemical composition
of the old population. Furthermore, while the SSP-equivalent chemical
composition tracks quite closely the V-band luminosity weighted one, the
SSP-equivalent age does not and is strongly biased towards the age of the young
population. In this bias the age of the young population and the mass fraction
between old and young population are degenerate. Finally, assuming typical
error bars, we find that a discrepancy between the SSP-equivalent parameters

young stellar population on top of an old one as long as the age of the young
population is less than ~2.5 Gyr and the mass fraction of young to old

(alpha-elements) and odd atomic number elements in red giants in the galactic

measure the abundances of the four light elements O, Na, Mg and Al in 13 red
clump and 40 red giant branch stars in four fields spanning the bulge from b=-3
to -12\deg. We show that the resulting abundance patterns point towards a
chemical enrichment dominated by massive stars at all metallicities. O, Mg and
Al ratios with respect to iron are overabundant with respect to both galactic
disks (thin and thick) for [Fe/H]$>-0.5$. A formation timescale for the
galactic bulge shorter than for both the thin and thick disks is therefore
inferred. Using Mg as a proxy for metallicity (instead of Fe) we further show
that: (i) the bulge stars [O/Mg] ratio follows and extend to higher
metallicities the decreasing trend of [O/Mg] found in the galactic disks. (ii)
the [Na/Mg] ratio trend with increasing [Mg/H] is found to increase in three
distinct sequences in the thin disk, the thick disk and the bulge. The bulge
trend is well represented by the predicted metallicity-dependent yields of
massive stars, whereas the galactic disks have too high Na/Mg ratios at low
metallicities, pointing to an additional source of Na from AGB stars. (iii)
Contrary to Na, there appears to be no systematic difference in the [Al/Mg]
ratio between bulge and disk stars, and the theoretical yields by massive stars
agree with the observed ratios, leaving no space for AGB contribution to Al.

uses a multiple regression technique and divides the variable component into
two components originating in the accretion disk at the center of AGNs and from
the dust torus that far surrounds the disk. Applying this analysis to the
long-term $VHK$ monitoring data of MCG+08-11-011 that were obtained by the
MAGNUM project, we found that the $(H-K)$-color temperature of the dust
component is $T = 1635$K $\pm20$K, which agrees with the sublimation
temperature of dust grains, and that the time delay of $K$ to $H$ variations is
$\Delta t\approx 6$ days, which indicates the existence of a radial temperature
gradient in the dust torus. As for the disk component, we found that the
power-law spectrum of $f_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha$ in the $V$ to near-infrared
$HK$ bands varies with a fixed index of $\alpha\approx -0.1$ -- +0.4, which is
broadly consistent with the irradiated standard disk model. The outer part of
the disk therefore extends out to a radial distance where the temperature
decreases to radiate the light in the near-infrared.

the main features of the observed light curve and spectrum.

Fewer than half of the absorbers are coincident on scales of 1-2 h_{70}^{-1}

estimate a typical absorption toward Cygnus OB2 of Av~7.0 mag. Although the
region is young, very few stars (~4.4 %) show disk-induced excesses in the

for at least 60 % of the variability. O- that early B-type stars are not
significantly variable. Typical X-ray spectral parameters are log(Nh)~22.25 and
kT~1.35 keV. Variable and flaring sources have harder spectra with median
kT=3.3 and 3.8 keV, respectively. OB stars are typically softer (kT~0.75 keV).

class of models which are consistent with recent astrometric and asteroseismic
data. The rotation pattern is determined by solving the Reynolds equation for
motion, including the convective energy transport, where the latter is
anisotropic owing to the Coriolis force action which produces a horizontal
temperature gradient between the poles and the equator. All the models show a
decrease of the rotation rate with increasing radius and solar-type isorotation
surfaces with the equator rotating faster than the poles, the horizontal
rotational shear being much smaller for models with a less extended convective
envelope. The meridional flow circulation can be either clockwise or
counter-clockwise, and in some cases a double latitudinal cell appears. The
rotational splittings are calculated for low degree $p$-modes with $l=1, m=1$
and $l=2, m=1,2$, and it is shown that, for modes with $m=1$, the stronger is
the horizontal differential rotation shear the weaker the effect on the average
rotational splitting expected, whilst the opposite happens for the mode with
$m=2$. On the basis of the present study, a resolution of $10 \rm nHz$ in
individual oscillation frequencies seems to be necessary to test the different
dynamical behaviour of the proposed models, that appears barely achievable even
in the forthcoming space missions. However, the average over several observed
splittings could produce the required accuracy.

the predictions obtained with XCOUNT, a model of the stellar X-ray content of
the Galaxy. The model predicts the number and properties of the stars to be
observed in terms of magnitude, colour, population and
$f_\mathrm{x}/f_\mathrm{v}$ ratio distributions of the coronal sources detected

As in other shallow surveys, we observe an excess of stars not predicted by our
Galaxy model. Comparing the colours of the identified infrared counterparts
with the model predictions, we observe that this excess is produced by yellow
(G+K) stars. The study of the X-ray spectrum of each source reveals a main
population of stars with coronal temperature stratification typical of
intermediate-age stars. As no assumptions have been made for the selection of
the sample, our results must be representative of the entire Solar
Neighbourhood. Some stars show excess circumstellar absorption indicative of
youth.

conditions that pertain to molecular gas close to the sources of radiation,
numerical models are constructed. These models determine the thermal and
chemical balance of molecular gas that is exposed to X-rays and far-ultraviolet
radiation, as a function of depth. We present a grid of XDR and PDR models that
span ranges in density, irradiation and column density. We find that the
fine-structure line ratios of e.g. [SiII] 35mum/[CII] 158 mum are larger in
XDRs than in PDRs, for a given density, column and irradiation strength. We
find that the line ratios HCN/HCO+ and HNC/HCN, as well as the column density

(>1) for XDRs (PDRs) if the density exceeds 10^5 cm^-3 and if the column
density is >10^23 cm^-2. For columns <10^ 22.5 cm^-2 the XDR HCN/HCO+ 1-0 ratio
becomes larger than one, although the individual HCN 1-0 and HCO+ 1-0 line
intensities are weaker. For modest densities, n=10^4-10^5 cm^-3, and strong
radiation fields (>100 erg s^-1 cm^-2), HCN/HCO+ ratios can become larger in
XDRs than PDRs as well. The HCN/CO 1-0 ratio is typically smaller in XDRs, and
the HCN emission in XDRs is boosted with respect to CO only for columns
>10^{23} cm^{-2} and densities <10^4 cm^-3. CO is typically warmer in XDRs than
in PDRs, for the same total energy input. This leads to higher CO J=N+1-N/CO

describing the linear response of the imperfect optical system and receiver,
and give a careful discussion of the behaviour of the induced systematic
effects under rotation of the instrument. We give the correspondence between
the matrix components and known optical and receiver imperfections, and compare
the likely performance of pseudo-correlation receivers and those that modulate
the polarization with a half-wave plate. The latter is shown to have the
significant advantage of not coupling the total intensity into polarization for
perfect optics, but potential effects like optical distortions that may be
introduced by the quasi-optical wave plate warrant further investigation. A
fast method for tolerancing time-invariant systematic effects is presented,
which propagates errors through to power spectra and cosmological parameters.
The method extends previous studies to an arbitrary scan strategy, and
eliminates the need for time-consuming Monte-Carlo simulations in the early
phases of instrument and survey design. We illustrate the method with both
simple parametrized forms for the systematics and with beams based on
physical-optics simulations. Example results are given in the context of

Due to the unsurpassed combined depth, area and image quality of the
Canada-France-Hawaii Legacy Survey it is becoming possible to uncover a large,
statistically well-defined sample of strong gravitational lenses which spans
the dark halo mass spectrum predicted by the concordance model from galaxy to
cluster haloes. METHODS: We describe the development of several automated
procedures to find strong lenses of various mass regimes in CFHTLS images.
RESULTS: The preliminary sample of about 40 strong lensing candidates
discovered in the CFHTLS T0002 release, covering an effective field of view of
28 deg$^2$ is presented. These strong lensing systems were discovered using an
automated search and consist mainly of gravitational arc systems with splitting
angles between 2 and 15 arcsec. This sample shows for the first time that it is
possible to uncover a large population of strong lenses from galaxy groups with
typical halo masses of about $10^{13}h^{-1}M_\odot$. We discuss the future
evolution of the SL2S project and its main scientific aims for the next 3
years, in particular our observational strategy to extract the hundreds of
gravitational rings also present in these fields.

small sample of high-redshift QSOs. We find that submillimetre wavelength data

near-IR imaging almost all of them are detected by Spitzer at 4.5, 8.0 and 24
um, showing that they have extremely red colours. However, they are not
detected in our XMM-Newton observations suggesting that any AGN must be highly
obscured. Optical-through-mid-IR SEDs show the redshifted 1.6 um bump from
star-light giving preliminary evidence that the galaxies lie at the same
redshift, and thus in the same structure, as the QSO although this finding must
be confirmed with photometric and/or spectroscopic redshifts.

than spectral class M4.5. Utilizing a new method based on the effects of a
field on the FeH band near 1 micron, we obtain information on whether the
integrated surface magnetic flux (Bf) is low (well under 1 kilogauss),
intermediate (between 1 and about 2.5 kG), or strong (greater than about 3 kG)
on a set of stars ranging from M2 down to M9. We also measure the rotational
broadening (vsini) and Halpha emission for more than 20 stars. Our goal is to
advance the understanding of how dynamo field production varies with stellar
parameters for very low-mass stars, how the field and emission activity are
related, and whether there is a connection between the rotation and magnetic
flux. We find that fields are produced throughout the M-dwarfs. Among the early
M stars we have too few targets to yield conclusive results. In the mid-M
stars, there is a clear connection between slow rotation and weak fields. In
the late-M stars, rotation is always measureable, and the strongest fields go
with the most rapid rotators. These very cool rapid rotators have the largest
magnetic flux in the whole sample. Halpha emission is found to be a good
general proxy for magnetic fields. The drop-off in fractional emission near the
bottom of the main sequence is not accompanied by a drop-off in magnetic flux,
lending credence to the hypothesis that it is due to atmospheric coupling to
the field rather than changes in the field itself. It is clear that the
methodology we have developed can be further applied to discover more about the
behavior of magnetic dynamos and magnetic activity in cool and fully convective
objects.

An alternative analysis method is applied, which fits the high quality, optical
HI data directly to the HeII spectrum. The results are compared to those
inferred from standard line profile analyses. This new method enables us to
derive redshift scales characterizing the fluctuations of the column density
ratio eta. We find eta changing smoothly with redshift on typical scales of
Delta z ~ 0.01-0.03 corresponding to 8-24 h^-1 Mpc comoving. The real length
scales of variations of the column density ratio might be even larger, since
part of the fluctuations may be caused by noise in the HeII data and by effects
due to the applied method. However, eta variations on small scales of a few Mpc
with an amplitude of about +/- 1.5 dex cannot be ruled out completely. The data
shows an apparent correlation between low eta regions and the presence of metal
line absorbers, which corresponds to the more general correlation of low eta
and strong HI absorption. Thermal line broadening is suggested as a probable
explanation for this apparent correlation, since both fit methods would
severely underestimate eta for absorbers with log N(HI) > 13 if the line width
was dominated by thermal broadening. Indeed, lines located close to the cut-off
of the b(N) distribution yield lower column density ratios compared to the
whole sample, in particular if high density absorbers are considered. We argue
that the apparent correlation of eta with the strength of the HI absorption is
caused by insufficient consideration of thermal broadened lines by the standard
analysis. As unbiased value of the column density ratio, we find eta ~80 in
agreement with previous estimates.

[cond-mat/0603053], is found to systematically vary with the carrier density.
Based on the results from four different GaAs heterojunction-insulated-gate
field-effect-transistor samples, it is shown that the power law exponent
depends on a single dimensionless parameter, the ratio between the mean carrier
separation and the distance to the metallic gate that screens the Coulomb
interaction. This dependence suggests that the carriers form a correlated state
in which the interaction effects play a significant role in the transport
properties.

symmetric double well potential when the Brownian particle is driven by {\it

neglected. The behavior of escaping trajectories from one well to another is
investigated by pointing to the special character that underpins the
noise-induced discontinuity which is caused by the generalized Brownian paths
that jump beyond the barrier location without actually hitting it. This fact
implies that the boundary conditions for the mean first passage time (MFPT) are
no longer determined by the well-known local boundary conditions that
characterize the case with normal diffusion. By numerically implementing
properly the set up boundary conditions, we investigate the survival
probability and the average escape time as a function of the corresponding
L\'evy white noise parameters. Depending on the value of the skewness $\beta$
of the L\'evy noise, the escape can either become enhanced or suppressed: a
negative asymmetry $\beta$ causes typically a decrease for the escape rate
while the rate itself depicts a non-monotonic behavior as a function of the
stability index $\alpha$ which characterizes the jump length distribution of
L\'evy noise, with a marked discontinuity occurring at $\alpha=1$. We find that
the typical factor of ``two'' that characterizes for normal diffusion the ratio
between the MFPT for well-bottom-to-well-bottom and well-bottom-to-barrier-top
no longer holds true. For sufficiently high barriers the survival probabilities
assume an exponential behavior. Distinct non-exponential deviations occur,
however, for low barrier heights.

mobility (spin flip) are permitted according to kinetic constraints determined
by the mobilities of the neighbouring cells. We introduce two types of cells
(``fast'' and ``slow'') with very different rates for spin flip. This
coarse-grained model qualitatively reproduces the mentioned anomalous
relaxation features observed for real binary mixtures.

are calculated for a two-dimensional disordered metal in a parallel magnetic
field via the quantum kinetic equation approach. For the thermal transport,
three regimes (diffusive, quasiballistic and truly ballistic) can be identified
as the temperature increases. For the diffusive and quasiballistic regimes, the
Lorentz number dependence on the temperature and on the magnetic field is
studied. The electron-electron interactions induce deviations from the
Wiedemann-Franz law, whose sign depend on the temperature: at low temperatures
the long-range part of the Coulomb interaction gives a positive correction,
while at higher temperature the inelastic collisions dominate the negative
correction. By applying a parallel field, the Lorentz number becomes a
non-monotonic function of field and temperature for all values of the
Fermi-liquid interaction parameter in the diffusive regime, while in the
quasiballistic case this is true only sufficiently far from the Stoner
instability.

of a system coupled to a reservoir becomes narrower when increasing the

resonance, where the fluctuating local magnetic fields created by randomly

activated. The existence of a motional narrowing effect in the optical response

important in this instance since the decoherence dynamics is a central issue
for the implementation of quantum information processing based on quantum dots.

diffusion phenomenon. Surprisingly, motional narrowing is achieved when
decreasing incident power or temperature, in contrast with the standard

exponentially as $G\to G^+$ in agreement with previous calculations. For the
higher orders, we employed the invariance of the bare parameters under the
change of the mass scale $t$ to fix the transformed form totally equivalent to
the original theory. The form so obtained up to $G^3$ is new and shows that all
the 1PI amplitudes are perurbative for both $G\ll 1$ and $G\gg 1$ regions. For
the intermediate region, we modified the fractal self-similar resummation
method to have a unique resummation formula for all $G$ values. This unique
formula is necessary because the effective potential is the generating
functional for all the 1PI amplitudes which can be obtained via $\partial^n
E/\partial b^n$ and thus we can obtain an analytic calculation for the 1PI
amplitudes. Again, the resummed from of the effective potential is new and
interpolates the effective potential between the perturbative regions.
Moreover, the resummed effective potential agrees in spirit of previous
calculation concerning bound states.

We restrict to solutions for which the scalar fields trace out geodesic curves
on the scalar manifold. Under these restrictions it is shown that the axionic
scalars are necessarily constant. The potential is then a sum of exponentials
and has a very specific form that allows for scaling solutions. The scaling
solutions describe eternal accelerating and decelerating power-law universes,
which are all unstable. An uplift of the solutions to 11-dimensional
supergravity is carried out and the resulting timedependent geometries are
discussed. In the discussion we briefly comment on the fact that N=2 gauged

additive nets of von Neumann algebras on the circle are in correspondence with
standard half-sided modular inclusions. We show that a finite index
endomorphism on a half-sided modular inclusion extends to a finite index
endomorphism on the corresponding net of von Neumann algebras on the circle.
Moreover, we present another approach to encoding endomorphisms on nets of
Neumann algebras on the circle into half-sided modular inclusions. There is a
natural way to associate a weight to a Moebius covariant endomorphism. The
properties of this weight has been studied by Bertozzini, Conti and Longo. In
this paper we show the converse, namely how to associate a Moebius covariant
endomorphism to a given weight under certain assumptions, thus obtaining a
correspondence between a class of weights on a half-sided modular inclusion and
a subclass of the Moebius covariant endomorphisms on the associated net of von
Neumann algebras. This allows us to treat Moebius covariant endomorphisms in
terms of weights on half-sided modular inclusions. As our aim is to provide a
framework for treating endomorphisms on nets of von Neumann algebras in terms
of the apparently simpler objects of weights on half-sided modular inclusions,
we lastly give some basic results for manipulations with such weights.

Newton-Raphson algorithm by a matrix $G$ which is an estimate of the variance
of the score under the true probability, which uses only the individual scores.
Thus an iteration of this algorithm requires much less computations than an
iteration of the Newton-Raphson algorithm. Moreover this estimate of the
variance of the score estimates the information matrix at maximum. We have also
studied a convergence criterion which has the nice interpretation of estimating
the ratio of the approximation error over the statistical error; thus it can be
used for stopping the iterative process whatever the problem. A simulation
study confirms that the RVS algorithm is faster than the Marquardt algorithm (a
robust version of the Newton-Raphson algorithm); this happens because the
number of iterations needed by the RVS algorithm is barely larger than that
needed by the Marquardt algorithm while the computation time for each iteration
is much shorter. Also the coverage rates using the matrix $G$ are satisfactory.

opposite sign (KdVII). Constructing the generalized Dirichlet to Neumann map
for the above problems means characterizing the unknown boundary values in
terms of the given initial and boundary conditions. For example, if
$\{q(x,0),q(0,t) \}$ and $\{q(x,0),q(0,t),q_{x}(0,t) \}$ are given for the KdVI

show that this can be achieved without solving for $q(x,t)$ by analysing a
certain ``global relation'' which couples the given initial and boundary
conditions with the unknown boundary values, as well as with the function
$\Phi^{(t)}(t,k)$, where $\Phi^{(t)}$ satisifies the $t$-part of the associated
Lax pair evaluated at $x=0$. Indeed, by employing a Gelfand--Levitan--Marchenko
triangular representation for $\Phi^{(t)}$, the global relation can be solved
\emph{explicitly} for the unknown boundary values in terms of the given initial

involved in modifications of cell wall components, wall structure, signaling
and interactions with plasma membrane proteins at the cell surface. The
application of proteomic approaches to the cell wall compartment raises
important questions: are there technical problems specific to cell wall
proteomics? What kinds of proteins can be found in Arabidopsis walls? Are some
of them unexpected? What sort of post-translational modifications have been
characterized in cell wall proteins to date? The purpose of this review is to
discuss the experimental results obtained to date using proteomics, as well as
some of the new questions challenging future research.

exhaustive identification of resident proteins; excluding proteins from other
cell compartments. Plant cell walls possess specific difficulties. Several
reported procedures to isolate cell walls for proteomic analyses led to the
isolation of a high proportion (more than 50%) of predicted intracellular
proteins. The rationales of several published procedures to isolate cell walls
for proteomics were analyzed, with regard to the bioinformatic-predicted
subcellular localization of the identified proteins. A new procedure was
developed to prepare cell walls from etiolated hypocotyls of Arabidopsis
thaliana. After salt extraction, a high proportion of proteins predicted to be
secreted was released (73%), belonging to the same functional classes as
proteins identified using previously described protocols. The new cell wall
preparation described in this paper gives the lowest proportion of proteins
predicted to be intracellular when compared to available protocols. The
application of its principles should lead to a more realistic view of the cell
wall proteome, at least for the weakly bound CWP extractable by salts. In
addition, it offers a clean cell wall preparation for subsequent extraction of
strongly bound CWP.

describe do not require the dual-containing constraint necessary for standard

that attain the Shannon capacity can be made into entanglement-assisted quantum
codes attaining the hashing bound (closely related to the quantum capacity).
For systems without large amounts of shared entanglement, these codes can also
be used as catalytic codes, in which a small amount of initial entanglement
enables quantum communication.

quantum evolution. Although exhibiting unusual characteristics, we show that
these evolutions cannot be dismissed on the basis of entropic or causal

Its rich symmetry - related to that of a classical phase space - helps to study
