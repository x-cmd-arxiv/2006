typical long GRBs, and is associated with a supernova (SN). The radio afterglow
displays no jet break, so that this burst might arise from a
mildly-relativistic spherical outflow produced by the SN shock sweeping the
stellar surface. Since this model is energetically difficult, we propose that
the radio afterglow is produced by a non-relativistic phase of an initially
collimated outflow (jet). Our jet model is supported by the detection of
optical linear polarization in the SN component. We also show analytically that
the jet can penetrate a progenitor star. We analyzed the observational data of
the prompt emission of this burst and obtained a smooth power-law light curve
which might last longer than 10^6s. This behavior contrasts with the long
intermittent activities with the X-ray flares of typical GRBs, implying that
the central engine of this burst is different from those of typical GRBs. This
argument is consistent with the analysis of the SN component of this burst,
which suggests that the progenitor star was less massive and collapsed to a
neutron star instead of a black hole. The collimation-corrected event rate of
such low-luminosity GRBs is estimated to be ~ 10 times higher than that of
typical long GRBs, and they might form a different GRB population:
low-luminosity GRBs are produced by mildly-relativistic jets from neutron stars
at the collapses of massive stars, while typical long GRBs by
highly-relativistic jets from black holes. We suggest that the central engine
of GRB 060218 is a pulsar (or a magnetar) with the initial rotation period P_0
\~ 10ms and the magnetic field B ~ 10^16G. A giant flare from the magnetar

  and cosmological simulations","20 pages, 8 figures, submitted to ApJ",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Models of disk galaxy formation commonly predict the existence of an extended
reservoir of hot gas surrounding massive spirals at low redshift. As a test of
these models, we have obtained X-ray and optical data of the two massive
edge-on spirals NGC 5746 and NGC 5170, in order to investigate the amount and
origin of hot gas in their disks and halos. Chandra observations of NGC 5746
reveal evidence for diffuse X-ray emission with a total luminosity of ~7 x
10^39 erg/s surrounding this galaxy out to at least ~20 kpc from the disk,
whereas an identical study of the less massive NGC 5170 fails to detect any
extraplanar X-ray emission. Unlike the case for other disk galaxies with
detected X-ray halos, the halo emission around NGC 5746 is not accompanied by
extraplanar H-alpha or radio emission, and there is no evidence for significant
nuclear or starburst activity in the disk. In contrast to these other cases,
the emission around NGC 5746 therefore appears to arise from the cooling of
externally accreted material rather than from disk outflows. To verify this
idea, we present results of cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and
evolution, showing our observations to be in good agreement with expectations
for cosmological accretion, while also confirming that the X-ray halos of other
spirals do not fit well into an accretion scenario. We find that the estimated
cooling rate of hot halo gas around NGC 5746 would provide sufficient material
for star formation in the disk to proceed at its present rate. This lends
support to the idea that a supply of hot ambient gas is potentially available
as fuel for star formation in massive, nearby spirals, and suggests that
accretion of hot gas could be important for maintaining the stellar disks of
such galaxies.

suppressed. The entry of the material into the magnetosphere is governed by
diffusion. Due to this reason the persistent accretion luminosity of isolated
neutron stars is limited to < 4E+26 erg/s. These objects can also appear as
X-ray bursters with the burst durations of about 30 minutes and repetition time
of about 1E+5 yr. This indicates that the number of the accreting isolated

for measuring which the forthcoming far-IR and submillimetre Herschel Space

understanding, about Herschel capabilities for investigating the early phases

luminosity Lir and dust temperature Td in star-forming galaxies, in which
larger Lir leads to higher dust temperature. The Lir-Td relation is commonly
seen as reflecting the increase in dust temperature in galaxies with higher
star formation rate. Even though the correlation shows a significant amount of
dispersion, a unique relation has been commonly used to construct spectral
energy distributions of galaxies in distant universe studies, such as source
number counting or photometric redshift determination. In this work, we
introduce a new parameter, namely the size of the star-forming region Rir and
lay out the empirical and modelled relation between the global parameters Lir,
Td and Rir of IR-bright non-AGN galaxies. IRAS 60-to-100um color is used as a
proxy for the dust temperature and the 1.4GHz radio contiuum emission for the
infrared spatial distribution. The analysis has been carried out on two
samples. The first one is made of the galaxies from the 60um flux-limited IRAS
Revised Bright Galaxy Samples which have a reliable RC size estimate from the
VLA follow-ups of the IRAS Bright Galaxy Samples. The second is made of the
sources from the 170um ISOPHOT Serendipity Sky Survey which are resolved by the
NVSS or FIRST surveys. We show that the dispersion in the Lir-Td diagram can be
reduced to a relation between the infrared surface brightness and the dust
temperature, a relation that spans 5 orders of magnitude in surface brightness.
We explored the physical processes giving rise to the Sir-Td relation, and show
that it can be derived from the Schmidt law, which relates the star formation
rate to the gas surface density.

to measure the Equivalent Width of the lithium line; these results are combined

spectra, these latter available for a subsample of our targets, are used to
classify CTTS and WTTS and to compare the properties of stars with and without

rotational velocity distributions of stars with IR excesses are statistically
different from that of stars without IR excesses, while the fraction of
binaries with disks is significantly smaller than that of single stars. Stars
with evidence for accretion show circumstellar disks; youth of cluster members
is confirmed by the lithium abundance consistent with the initial content. As
indicated by the disk-locking picture, stars with disks have in general

This Working Group's mandate was to concentrate on fundamental questions in
cosmology, and the scope for tackling these in Europe over the next ~15 years.
One major resulting recommendation concerns the provision of new generations of
imaging survey, where the image quality and near-IR sensitivity that can be
attained only in space are naturally matched by ground-based imaging and
spectroscopy to yield massive datasets with well-understood photometric
redshifts (photo-z's). Such information is essential for a range of new
cosmological tests using gravitational lensing, large-scale structure, clusters
of galaxies, and supernovae. Great scope in future cosmology also exists for
ELT studies of the intergalactic medium and space-based studies of the CMB and
gravitational waves; here the synergy is less direct, but these areas will
remain of the highest mutual interest to the agencies. All these recommended
facilities will produce vast datasets of general applicability, which will have
a tremendous impact on broad areas of astronomy.

coefficient, we explore how gas viscosity influences the properties of
AGN-driven bubbles. We also introduce a novel, self-consistent AGN feedback

black holes embedded in a cluster environment. We assume that black holes
accreting at low rates with respect to the Eddington limit are in a radiatively
inefficient regime, and that most of the feedback energy will appear in a
mechanical form. Thus, we introduce AGN-driven bubbles into the ICM with
properties, such as radius and energy content, that are directly linked to the
black hole physics. This model leads to a self-regulated mechanism for the
black hole growth and overcomes the cooling flow problem in host halos, ranging
from the scale of groups to that of massive clusters. (Abridged)

prevalence of silicate dust extinction. Evidence for silicate extinction is
found in ~1/8 of the sample, at strengths which indicate most normal galaxies

PAH emission to the total infrared power is found to peak near 10% and extend
up to ~20%, and is suppressed at metallicities Z < ~Z_sun/4, as well as in
low-luminosity AGN environments. Strong inter-band PAH feature strength
variations (2-5x) are observed, with the presence of a weak AGN and, to a
lesser degree, increasing metallicity shifting power to the longer wavelength
bands. A peculiar PAH emission spectrum with markedly diminished 5-8um features
arises among the sample solely in systems with relatively hard radiation fields
harboring low-luminosity AGN. The AGN may modify the emitting grain
distribution and provide the direct excitation source of the unusual PAH
emission, which cautions against using absolute PAH strength to estimate star
formation rates in systems harboring active nuclei. Alternatively, the low star
formation intensity often associated with weak AGN may affect the spectrum. The
effect of variations in the mid-infrared spectrum on broadband infrared surveys

wave searches and tests of general relativity using binary pulsars. The
conventional approach to timing explicitly assumes that the radio emitting
region is located at the center of the pulsar, while polarimetric observations
suggest that radio emission is in fact produced at altitudes ranging from tens
to thousands of kilometers above the neutron star surface. Here we present a
calculation of the effects of finite emission height on the timing of binary
pulsars using a simple model for the emitting region geometry. Finite height of
emission changes the propagation path of radio photons through the binary and
gives rise to a large spin velocity of the emission region co-rotating with the
neutron star. Under favorable conditions these two effects introduce
corrections to the conventional time delays at the microsecond level (for a
millisecond pulsar in a double neutron star binary with a period of several
hours and assuming the emission height of 100 km). Exploiting the dependence of
the emission height on frequency (radius-to-frequency mapping) and using
multi-frequency observations one should be able to detect these timing
corrections even though they are formally degenerate with conventional time
delays. Although even in the most accurately timed systems the magnitude of the
finite emission height effects is currently somewhat below timing precision,
longer-term observations and future facilities like SKA will make measurement
of these effects possible, providing an independent check of existing emission
height estimates.

lifetime in much longer than their crossing times. Hickson CGs clearly show
different stages of evolution, from weakly interacting galaxies to merging
systems. CGs infalling into clusters may provide a mechanism to form clusters
at high redshifts (e.g. in A1367). Massive versions of today's CGs may have
been the best candidate precursors of fossil groups. Do CGs mimic the high
redshift universe? This is still an open question. Indeed, their high density
and low velocity dispersion should induce a high interaction rate and fast
merging, CGs are nevertheless long-lived structures. On the other hand, there
is probably no (or a few) isolated CGs in the high z universe. CGs may fuel
high z clusters, they may produce fossil groups and fossil ellipticals. CGs at
high z are difficult to detect and are still to be discovered. Interpretation
of distant kinematics of galaxies may need nearby sample of galaxies to

an elliptical galaxy resolved in the HST-ACS image. Using the COSMOS
multiwavelength data set, we derive the radio properties of CWAT-01 and use the
optical and X-ray data to investigate its host environment. The cluster hosting
CWAT-01 is part of a larger assembly consisting of a minimum of four X-ray
luminous clusters within ~2 Mpc distance. We apply hydrodynamical models that
combine ram pressure and buoyancy forces on CWAT-01. These models explain the
shape of the radio jets only if the galaxy's velocity relative to the
intra-cluster medium (ICM) is in the range of about 300-550 km/s which is
higher than expected for brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in relaxed systems.
This indicates that the CWAT-01 host cluster is not relaxed, but is possibly
dynamically young. We argue that such a velocity could have been induced
through subcluster merger within the CWAT-01 parent cluster and/or
cluster-cluster interactions. Our results strongly indicate that we are
witnessing the formation of a large cluster from an assembly of multiple
clusters, consistent with the hierarchical scenario of structure formation. We
estimate the total mass of the final cluster to be approximately 20% of the

over the velocity distribution. Since the clustering of dark matter is known,
this amounts to asking how large the annihilation cross section can be.

section could turn a halo cusp into a core, improving agreement between
simulations and observations; Hui showed that unitarity prohibits this for
large dark matter masses. We show that if the annihilation products are

parameters of these eclipsing binaries has become feasible with 8 meter class
telescopes, making it possible to use eclipsing binaries as distance
indicators. Distances with eclipsing binaries provide an independent method for
calibrating the extragalactic distance scale and thus determining the Hubble
constant. This method has been used for determining distances to eclipsing
binaries in the Magellanic Clouds and the Andromeda Galaxy and most recently to
a detached eclipsing binary in the Triangulum Galaxy by the DIRECT Project. The
increasing number of eclipsing binaries found by microlensing and variability
surveys also provide a rich database for advancing our understanding of star
formation and evolution.

the fundamental nature of life on earth and the possibility of life elsewhere.
To achieve this goal, astrobiologists have initiated unprecedented
communication between the disciplines of astronomy, biology, chemistry, and
geology. The Astrobiology Primer has been created as a reference tool for those
who are interested in the interdisciplinary field of astrobiology. The field
incorporates many diverse research endeavors, but it is our hope that this slim
volume will present the reader with all he or she needs to know to become
involved and to understand, at least at a fundamental level, the state of the
art. Because of the great diversity of material, each section was written by a
different author with a different expertise. The Primer was constructed
collaboratively. Ninety researchers from around the world contributed
information with regard to what they expected from other astrobiologists and
what they would like to know themselves but still had difficulty understanding
(see Contributors). Those submissions were read and considered by the Editors
who produced a list of seven general categories of knowledge, represented by
the seven chapters in the Primer: 1) Stellar Formation and Evolution, 2)
Planetary Formation and Evolution, 3) Astrobiogeochemistry and the Origin of
Life, 4) Evolution of Life through Time, 5) Planet Detection &
Characterization, 6) Diversity of Life, and 7) Science in Space. No one volume,
of course, can contain the vast amount of information brought to play in
astrobiology, but we believe that the Primer will provide a forum and a
language around which the community will have the opportunity to develop a
consensus about central issues.

data of PSR B1133+16 from simultaneous multifrequency observations.
Observations were made at 325, 610, 1400 and 4850 MHz as part of a joint
program between the European Pulsar Network and the Giant Metrewave Radio
Telescope. The pulse energy time series are analysed to derive improved
statistics of nulling pulses as well as to investigate the frequency dependence
of the phenomenon. The pulsar is observed to be in null state for approximately
15% of the time; however, we find that nulling does not always occur
simultaneously at all four frequencies of observation. We characterise this
""selective nulling'' as a function of frequency, separation in frequency, and
combination of frequencies. The most remarkable case is a significantly large
number of nulls ($\approx$6%) at lower frequencies, that are marked by the
presence of a fairly narrow emission feature at the highest frequency of 4850
MHz. We refer to these as ""low frequency (LF) nulls."" Our analysis shows that
this high frequency emission tends to occur preferentially over a narrow range
in longitude and with pulse widths typically of the order of a few
milliseconds. We discuss the implications of our results for the pulsar
emission mechanism in general and for the broadbandness of nulling phenomenon
in particular. Our results signify the presence of an additional process of
emission which does not turn off when the pulsar nulls at low frequencies, and
becomes more prominent at higher frequencies. Our analysis also hints at a
possible outer gap origin for this new population of pulses, and thus a likely
connection to some high-energy emission processes that occur in the outer parts
of the pulsar magnetosphere.

synthesis model predictions. We find that the gas is single-phase with a
temperature of ~0.7 keV within 1Re. Outside 1Re the gas temperature increases
quickly outwards to >1 keV, indicating its group origin. We reveal that the
X-ray surface brightness profile shows a central excess in the innermost
region, and on both the total mass and dark matter profiles there is a
flattened feature at about <1Re, which coincides with the gas temperature
transition from the galactic level to the group level. The total mass and dark
matter distributions within 0.85Re are cuspy and can be approximated by
power-law profiles with indices of ~2, which are marginally consistent with the
generalized NFW profiles with zeta=2. The mass in outer regions can be well
fitted by a single NFW profile, with the derived concentration parameter
c=18.6\pm1.5. We find that the NGC 1407 group has a baryon-dominated core,

showing that the NGC 1407 group is an extremely dark system even comparable to
many clusters of galaxies. Since the obtained total mass is lower than those
given in the earlier galaxy kinematic works, we speculate that NGC 1400 is not
a virialized member in the group's gravitational potential well.

spectrally dispersed visibilities, as well as differential and closure phases,
with a resolution R = 1500 in the spectral band 1.95-2.17 micron. We interpret
these data in the context of a binary system with unresolved components,
neglecting in a first approximation the wind-wind collision zone flux
contribution. We show that the AMBER observables result primarily from the
contribution of the individual components of the WR+O binary system. We discuss
several interpretations of the residuals, and speculate on the detection of an
additional continuum component, originating from the free-free emission
associated with the wind-wind collision zone (WWCZ), and contributing at most
to the observed K-band flux at the 5% level. The expected absolute separation

  supernova remnants","6 pages, 4 figures, A&A accepted",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20065774",,"astro-ph",,"  The observed spectrum of a supernova remnant (SNR) is a superposition of many
``local'' spectra emitted by regions of SNRs that are under different physical
conditions. The question remains as to whether the broadening of the
high-energy end of the observed nonthermal spectrum of SNRs, like in G347.3-0.5
and SN 1006, can be an artifact of observations or it is a consequence of the
microphysics involved in the acceleration process. In this note we study the
influence of parameters variations (inside the volume and over the surface of
SNR) on the shape of the high-energy end of the synchrotron (and also inverse
Compton) spectrum. We consider three possibilities for these parameter
variations: i) gradients downstream of the shock with constant maximum energy
of the accelerated electrons and the potential variation in time of the
injection efficiency, ii) then we add the possibility of the maximum energy
depending on time, and finally iii) the possible obliquity dependences of
maximum energy and injection efficiency. It is shown that gradients of density
and magnetic field strength downstream of the shock are ineffective in
modifying the shape of the synchrotron spectrum, even if an SNR evolves in the
nonuniform interstellar medium and/or the injection efficiency varies in time.
The time dependence of the maximum energy of the electrons accelerated by the
shock is also not able to make the observed spectrum much broader. The only
possibility of producing considerable broadening in the spectrum is the
variation in the maximum energy of electrons over the surface of SNR. In such a
case, the obliquity dependence of the injection efficiency also affects the
shape of the spectrum, but its role is less significant.

limited samples, in different sky regions, obtained from the Fourth Data
Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The small scale properties are
characterized through the determination of the nearest neighbor probability
distribution. By using a very conservative statistical analysis, in the range
of scales [0.5,~30] Mpc/h we detect power-law correlations in the conditional
density in redshift space, with an exponent \gamma=1.0 \pm 0.1. This behavior
is stable in all different samples we considered thus it does not depend on
galaxy luminosity. In the range of scales [~30,~100] Mpc/h we find evidences
for systematic unaveraged fluctuations and we discuss in detail the problems
induced by finite volume effects on the determination of the conditional
density. We conclude that in such range of scales there is an evidence for a
smaller power-law index of the conditional density. However we cannot
distinguish between two possibilities: (i) that a crossover to homogeneity
(corresponding to \gamma=0 in the conditional density) occurs before 100 Mpc/h,
(ii) that correlations extend to scales of order 100 Mpc/h (with a smaller
exponent 0 < \gamma <1). We emphasize that galaxy distributions in these
samples present large fluctuations at the largest scales probed, corresponding
to the presence of large scale structures extending up to the boundaries of the
present survey. Finally we discuss several differences between the behavior of
the conditional density in mock galaxy catalogs built from cosmological N-body
simulations and real data. We discuss some theoretical implications of such a
fact considering also the super-homogeneous features of primordial density

background (XRB) based on the most up-to-date X-ray luminosity functions (XLF)
and evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). The large body of observational
results collected by soft (0.5-2 keV) and hard (2-10 keV) X-ray surveys are
used to constrain at best the properties of the Compton-thin AGN population and
its contribution to the XRB emission. The number ratio R between moderately
obscured (Compton-thin) AGN and unobscured AGN is fixed by the comparison
between the soft and hard XLFs, which suggests that R decreases from 4 at low
luminosities to 1 at high luminosities. From the same comparison there is no
clear evidence of an evolution of the obscured AGN fraction with redshift. The
distribution of the absorbing column densities in obscured AGN is determined by
matching the soft and hard source counts. A distribution rising towards larger
column densities is able to reproduce the soft and hard AGN counts over about 6
dex in flux. The model also reproduces with excellent accuracy the fraction of
obscured objects in AGN samples selected at different X-ray fluxes. The
integrated emission of the Compton-thin AGN population is found to
underestimate the XRB flux at about 30 keV and a population of heavily obscured
-Compton-thick- AGN, as large as that of moderately obscured AGN, is required
to fit the residual background emission. Remarkably, the fractions of
Compton-thick AGN observed in the Chandra Deep Field South and in the first
INTEGRAL and Swift catalogs of AGN selected above 10 keV are in excellent
agreement with the model predictions. [abridged]

parametrized by a power law of the form ~(1+z)^(-1.25). The observed evolution

factor of ~2 larger than at z=1.2. We confirm that the ICM is already

impurities to the Kondo resistivity shows size dependence in mesoscopic

responsible for the size dependence in cases where there is strong spin-orbit
interaction in the metallic host. The anisotropy energy has the form $\Delta
E=K_d ({\bf n}{\bf S})^2$ where ${\bf n}$ is the vector perpendicular to the
plane surface, ${\bf S}$ is the spin of the magnetic impurity and $K_d>0$ is
inversely proportional to distance $d$ measured from the surface. It has been
realized that in the tedious calculation an unjustified approximation was
applied for the hybridizations of the host atom orbitals with the conduction
electrons which depend on the position of the host atoms. Namely, the momenta
of the electrons were replaced by the Fermi momentum $k_F$. That is
reinvestigated considering the $k$-dependence which leads to singular energy
integrals and in contrary to the previous result $K_d$ is oscillating like
$\sin (2 k_F d)$ and the distance dependence goes like $1/d^3$ in the
asymptotic region. As the anisotropy is oscillating, for integer spin the
ground state is either a singlet or a doublet depending on distance $d$, but in
the case of the doublet there is no direct electron induced transition between
those two states at zero temperature. Furthermore, for half-integer ($S > 1/2$)
spin it is always a doublet with direct transition only in half of the cases.

all-to-all to a regular one of a two-dimensional triangular lattice. The
driving force in this dynamics is the reduction of frustrated triads in order
to reach a balanced state. The dynamics is parameterized by a so-called
propensity parameter $p$ that determines the tendency of negative links to
become positive. As a function of $p$ we find a phase transition between
different kind of absorbing states. The phases differ by the existence of an
infinitely connected (percolated) cluster of negative links that forms whenever
$p\leq p_c$. Moreover, for $p\leq p_c$, the time to reach the absorbing state
grows powerlike with the system size $L$, while it increases logarithmically
with $L$ for $p > p_c$. From a finite-size scaling analysis we numerically
determine the critical exponents $\beta$ and $\nu$ together with $\gamma$,
$\tau$, $\sigma$. The exponents satisfy the hyperscaling relations. We also
determine the fractal dimension $d_f$ that fulfills a hyperscaling relation as
well. The transition of triad dynamics between different absorbing states

theory of SU(2) angular momenta and can be viewed as a generalization to
arbitrary values of the spin variables of the usual quantum-circuit model based
on `qubits' and Boolean gates. Computational states belong to
finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces labelled by both discrete and continuous
parameters, and unitary gates may depend on quantum numbers ranging over finite
sets of values as well as continuous (angular) variables. Such a framework is
an ideal playground to discuss discrete (digital) and analogic computational
processes, together with their relationships occuring when a consistent
semiclassical limit takes place on discrete quantum gates. When working with
purely discrete unitary gates, the simulator is naturally modelled as families
of quantum finite states--machines which in turn represent discrete versions of
topological quantum computation models. We argue that our model embodies a sort
of unifying paradigm for computing inspired by Nature and, even more
ambitiously, a universal setting in which suitably encoded quantum symbolic
manipulations of combinatorial, topological and algebraic problems might find

of the total response functions of interferometers for GWs propagating from
arbitrary directions. In this paper the analysis of the response functions for
the magnetic components is generalized in its full frequency dependence, while
in the work of Baskaran and Grishchuk the response functions were computed only
in the approximation of wavelength much larger than the linear dimensions of
the interferometer. It is also shown that the response functions to the
magnetic components grow at high frequencies, differently from the values of
the response functions to the well known ordinary components that decrease at
high frequencies. Thus the magnetic components could in principle become the
dominant part of the signal at high frequencies. This is important for a
potential detection of the signal at high frequencies and confirms that the
magnetic contributions must be taken into account in the data analysis. More,
the fact that the response functions of the magnetic components grow at high
frequencies shows that, in principle, the frequency-range of Earth-based
interferometers could extend to frequencies over 10000 Hz.

with Delta^u representing non-divergent perturbative corrections. Here, we
calculate the anticommutators specified by Gamma^uv=.5{Gamma^u,Gamma^v}, and
then explore some consequences of employing these as a metric tensor
g^uv=Gamma^uv(p',q,p) in momentum space. The challenge is that Gamma^u and
Gamma^uv must them be introduced in place of gamma^u and n^uv throughout the
Lagrangian density, denoted L', resulting in what appears, superficially, to be
different physics from what is known and observed. However, with a suitable
reparameterization of fermion rest masses m', interaction charges e' and
momentum vectors p^u' into their observed counterparts m, e and p^u, it turns
out that L' can be made to describe physics identical to that of the customary
QED Lagrangian density L at low photon momentum q^u-->0, including the observed
magnetic anomaly. That is,we prove that one is able to obtain
L(m,e,p^u)=L'(m',e',p^u') for q^u-->0. We find through the Ward-Takahashi
identity, as summarized in Figure 2, that interaction vertexes are proportional
to the difference between the ordinary and covariant momentum-space derivatives
of the metric tensor, and thus an indicator of curvature. Finally, we obtain
additional non-longitudinal terms in the Ward-Takahashi relation.

consider two approaches of including photon radiation. A strict fixed-order
approach allows for comparison and consistency checks with published
semianalytic results in the literature. A version with soft- and hard-collinear
resummation of photon radiation, which combines photon resummation with the
inclusion of the NLO matrix element for the production process, avoids negative
event weights, so the program can simulate physical (unweighted) event samples.
Photons are explicitly generated throughout the range where they can be
experimentally resolved. In addition, it includes further higher-order
corrections unaccounted for by the fixed-order method. Inspecting the
dependence on the cutoffs separating the soft and collinear regions, we
evaluate the systematic errors due to soft and collinear approximations for NLO
and higher-order contributions. In the resummation approach, the residual
uncertainty can be brought down to the per-mil level, coinciding with the
expected statistical uncertainty at the ILC. We closely investigate the
two-photon phase space for the resummation method. We present results for cross
sections and event generation for both approaches.

within type IIB vacua, in a way which has recently become calculable. We
identify some of the ways these effects can alter inflationary scenarios, with
the following three results: (1) By examining how the forces on the brane due
to moduli-stabilizing interactions modify the angular motion of D3 branes
moving in Klebanov-Strassler type throats, we show how previous slow-roll
analyses can remain unchanged for some brane trajectories, while being modified
for other trajectories. These forces cause the D3 brane to sink to the bottom
of the throat except in a narrow region close to the D7 brane, and do not
ameliorate the \eta-problem of slow roll inflation in these throats; (2) We
argue that a recently-proposed back-reaction on the dilaton field can be used
to provide an alternative way of uplifting these compactifications to Minkowski
or De Sitter vacua, without the need for a supersymmetry-breaking anti-D3
brane; and (3) by including also the D-term forces which arise when
supersymmetry-breaking fluxes are included on D7 branes we identify the 4D
supergravity interactions which capture the dynamics of D3 motion in D3/D7
inflationary scenarios. The form of these potentials sheds some light on recent
discussions of how symmetries constrain D term interactions in the low-energy
theory.

in a similar manner. It is shown that the holonomy receives non-trivial
kinematical corrections. By comparing the new result with the already known
spin 1/2 case, one may conjecture a generalized formula for the corrections to
holonomy for higher spins.

group manifolds. The limit gives rise to rigid open strings, whose dynamics can
efficiently be described in terms of a matrix algebra. Alternatively, the
dynamics is coded in group theory coefficients whose properties are translated
in a diagrammatical language. In the case of compact groups, it is a simplified
version of rational boundary conformal field theories, while for non-compact
groups, the construction gives rise to new associative products. Secondly, we
argue that the intuitive formalism that we provide for the semi-classical
limit, extends to the case of quantum groups. The associative product we
construct in this way is directly related to the boundary vertex operator
algebra of open strings on symmetry preserving branes in WZW models, and
generalizations thereof, e.g. to non-compact groups. We treat the groups SU(2)
and SL(2,R) explicitly. We also discuss the precise relation of the

maximal dissipative operators or so-called Pseudo-Hamiltonians. In this paper
the scattering theory for such open systems is considered. First it is assumed
that a single maximal dissipative operator $A_D$ in a Hilbert space $\sH$ is
used to describe an open quantum system. In this case the minimal self-adjoint
dilation $\widetilde K$ of $A_D$ can be regarded as the Hamiltonian of a closed
system which contains the open system $\{A_D,\sH\}$, but since $\widetilde K$
is necessarily not semibounded from below, this model is difficult to interpret
from a physical point of view. In the second part of the paper an open quantum
system is modeled with a family $\{A(\mu)\}$ of maximal dissipative operators
depending on energy $\mu$, and it is shown that the open system can be embedded
into a closed system where the Hamiltonian is semibounded. Surprisingly it
turns out that the corresponding scattering matrix can be completely recovered
from scattering matrices of single Pseudo-Hamiltonians as in the first part of
the paper. The general results are applied to a class of Sturm-Liouville
operators arising in dissipative and quantum transmitting
Schr\""{o}dinger-Poisson systems.

partial solution to the Mahler conjecture on the product $v(K) = (\Vol K)(\Vol
K^\circ)$ of the volume of a symmetric convex body $K \in \R^n$ and its polar
body $K^\circ$. The Mahler conjecture asserts that the Mahler volume $v(K)$ is
minimized (non-uniquely) when $K$ is an $n$-cube. The bottleneck conjecture (in
its least general form) asserts that the volume of a certain domain $K^\diamond
\subseteq K \times K^\circ$ is minimized when $K$ is an ellipsoid. It implies
the Mahler conjecture up to a factor of $(\pi/4)^n \gamma_n$, where $\gamma_n$
is a monotonic factor that begins at $4/\pi$ and converges to $\sqrt{2}$. This
strengthens a result of Bourgain and Milman, who showed that there is a
constant $c$ such that the Mahler conjecture is true up to a factor of $c^n$.
  The proof uses a version of the Gauss linking integral to obtain a constant
lower bound on $\Vol K^\diamond$, with equality when $K$ is an ellipsoid. It
applies to a more general conjecture concerning the join of any two necks of
the pseudospheres of an indefinite inner product space. Because the
calculations are similar, we will also analyze traditional Gauss linking

patterns, using a novel computational algorithm that can handle an extremely
large number of unknowns simultaneously. The patterns surviving the LASSO are
further pruned in the framework of (parametric) generalized linear models. A
novel tuning procedure based on the GACV for Bernoulli outcomes, modified to
act as a model selector, is used at both steps. We applied the method to myopia
data from the population-based Beaver Dam Eye Study, exposing physiologically
interesting interacting risk factors. We then applied the method to data from a

Stein--Chen method. The rate of the Poisson approximation and the speed of
convergence to it are defined and make sense for the model. Thus, the two

explicitly uses the `parallel walls property' of Coxeter groups, proved by
Brink and Howlett, and heavily relies on meticulous calculations with the root
system associated with (W,R).
  We generalize their local finiteness result using the visual boundary of X,
endowed with the cone topology. We introduce an asymptotic condition on H
(`uniformness'), and show it is equivalent to H having the parallel walls
property together with boundedness of chambers. Uniformness regards the way in
which boundary points are approximated by the walls of H. We prove that if G is
a group acting geometrically on a CAT(0) space X and H is a uniform cubulation
of X invariant under G, then C(H) is locally-finite. We also show that the
obvious map of $X$ into $C(H)$ is a quasi-isometry, and use this to give
quantitative results strengthening the parallel walls property.

blocks overlying a soft layer underlain by a hard substratum. The results of
the theoretical analysis, appealing to a space-frequency mode-matching (MM)

method. The two methods are shown to give rise to much the same prediction of
seismic response for $N\_{b}=10$. The MM technique is also applied to the case
$N\_{b}=\infty$, notably to reveal the structure and natural frequencies of the
vibration modes of the urban site. The mechanism of the interaction between
blocks and the ground, as well as that of the collective effects of the blocks,
are studied. It is shown that the presence of a large number of blocks modifies
the seismic disturbance in a manner which evokes, and may partially account
for, what was observed during many earthquakes in Mexico City. Disturbances at
a much smaller level, induced by a small number of blocks are studied in the

incremental cost is easily justified by a considerable potential improvement of

Robins","Second look at the spread of epidemics on networks","29 pages, 5 figures","Physical Review E 76: 036113 (Sep., 2007)","10.1103/PhysRevE.76.036113",,"q-bio.QM cond-mat.stat-mech math.PR",,"  In an important paper, M.E.J. Newman claimed that a general network-based
stochastic Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) epidemic model is isomorphic to
a bond percolation model, where the bonds are the edges of the contact network
and the bond occupation probability is equal to the marginal probability of
transmission from an infected node to a susceptible neighbor. In this paper, we
show that this isomorphism is incorrect and define a semi-directed random
network we call the epidemic percolation network that is exactly isomorphic to
the SIR epidemic model in any finite population. In the limit of a large
population, (i) the distribution of (self-limited) outbreak sizes is identical
to the size distribution of (small) out-components, (ii) the epidemic threshold
corresponds to the phase transition where a giant strongly-connected component
appears, (iii) the probability of a large epidemic is equal to the probability
that an initial infection occurs in the giant in-component, and (iv) the
relative final size of an epidemic is equal to the proportion of the network
contained in the giant out-component. For the SIR model considered by Newman,
we show that the epidemic percolation network predicts the same mean outbreak
size below the epidemic threshold, the same epidemic threshold, and the same
final size of an epidemic as the bond percolation model. However, the bond
percolation model fails to predict the correct outbreak size distribution and
probability of an epidemic when there is a nondegenerate infectious period
distribution. We confirm our findings by comparing predictions from percolation
networks and bond percolation models to the results of simulations. In an
appendix, we show that an isomorphism to an epidemic percolation network can be
defined for any time-homogeneous stochastic SIR model.

  Valero-Cuevas","Estimating degrees of freedom in motor systems","44 pages, 30 figures",,,,"q-bio.QM physics.data-an",,"  Studies of the degrees of freedom or ""synergies"" in musculoskeletal systems
rely critically on algorithms to estimate the ""dimension"" of kinematic or
neural data. Linear algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA) are
used almost exclusively for this purpose. However, biological systems tend to
possess nonlinearities and operate at multiple spatial and temporal scales so
that the set of reachable system states typically does not lie close to a
single linear subspace. We compare the performance of PCA to two alternative
nonlinear algorithms (Isomap and our novel pointwise dimension estimation
(PD-E)) using synthetic and motion capture data from a robotic arm with known
kinematic dimensions, as well as motion capture data from human hands. We find
that consideration of the spectral properties of the singular value
decomposition in PCA can lead to more accurate dimension estimates than the
dominant practice of using a fixed variance capture threshold. We investigate
methods for identifying a single integer dimension using PCA and Isomap. In
contrast, PD-E provides a range of estimates of fractal dimension. This helps
to identify heterogeneous geometric structure of data sets such as unions of
manifolds of differing dimensions, to which Isomap is less sensitive. Contrary
to common opinion regarding fractal dimension methods, PD-E yielded reasonable
results with reasonable amounts of data. We conclude that it is necessary and
feasible to complement PCA with other methods that take into consideration the
nonlinear properties of biological systems for a more robust estimation of
their degrees of freedom.

predicted effect is much smaller than would be observable in the proposed
Marshall et al. mirror experiment. We then consider the ``Schrodinger -Newton''
equation for an N-particle system. We show that in the independent particle
approximation, it differs from the usual Hartree approximation applied to the
Newtonian potential by self-interaction terms, which do not have a consistent
Born rule interpretation. This raises doubts about the use of the
Schrodinger-Newton equation to calculate gravitational effects on molecular
interference experiments. When the effects of Newtonian gravitation on
molecular diffraction are calculated using the standard many-body Schrodinger
equation, no washing out of the interference pattern is predicted.
