The system has an orbital period of 0.3681414(3) days and an apparent magnitude
V ~ 12.6. The estimated effective temperatures of the stars are T_eff1 = 3615
+/- 72K and T_eff2 = 3513 +/- 31K. The space velocities of the system suggest
that it is a main sequence binary and with a metallicity that is approximately
solar. The two stars in this binary are located in a region of the Mass-Radius
relation where no accurate observational data were previously available.
Similarly to other low-mass binaries recently studied, the radius of each star
in NSVS01031772 exceeds the best evolutionary model predictions by about 8.5%
on average.

history (SFH), metal enrichment, and SN physics, particularly in galaxy
clusters with their deep, metal-retaining potentials, and simple SFH. However,
a low-redshift cluster SN rate has never been published. We derive the SN rate
in galaxy clusters at 0.06<z<0.19, based on type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) that
were discovered by the Wise Observatory Optical Transient Survey. As described
in a separate paper, a sample of 140 rich Abell clusters was monitored, in
which six cluster SNe Ia were found and confirmed spectroscopically. Here, we
determine the SN detection efficiencies of the individual survey images, and
combine the efficiencies with the known spectral properties of SNe Ia to
calculate the effective visibility time of the survey. The cluster stellar
luminosities are measured from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) database in
the griz SDSS bands. Uncertainties are estimated using Monte-Carlo simulations
in which all input parameters are allowed to vary over their known
distributions. We derive SN rates normalized by stellar luminosity, in SNU
units (SNe per century per 10^10 L_sun) in five photometric bandpasses, of

z~2 QSOs which have heavily absorbed X-ray spectra. These objects constitute
10% of the population at luminosities and redshifts characteristic of the main
producers of QSO luminosity in the Universe. Our follow up observations in the
submm show that these QSOs are often embedded in ultraluminous starburst
galaxies, unlike most QSOs at the same redshifts and luminosities. The
radically different star formation properties between the absorbed and
unabsorbed QSOs implies that the X-ray absorption is unrelated to the torus
invoked in AGN unification schemes. Instead, these results suggest that the
objects represent a transitional phase in an evolutionary sequence relating the
growth of massive black holes to the formation of galaxies. The most puzzling
question about these objects has always been the nature of the X-ray absorber.
We present our study of the X-ray absorbers based on deep (50-100ks) XMM-Newton
spectroscopy. We show that the absorption is most likely due to a dense ionised
wind driven by the QSO. This wind could be the mechanism by which the QSO
terminates the star formation in the host galaxy, and ends the supply of
accretion material, to produce the present day black hole/spheroid mass ratio.

unbound massive particle has a cosmological redshift z = (c / v_0) H_0 t, where
c is the speed of light in vacuum, v_0 is the initial velocity of the particle,
H_0 is Hubble's constant and t is the duration of time that the particle has
been unbound. The increase in wavelength of the particle corresponds to a
decrease in its speed by delta_v = - c H_0 t. Furthermore, it is hypothesized
that the solar system has escaped the gravity of the Galaxy as evidenced by its
orbital speed and radial distance and by the visible mass within the solar
system radius. This means that spacecraft which become unbound to the solar
system would also be galactically unbound and subject to the Hubble law. This
hypothesis and the extended Hubble law may explain the anomalous acceleration
found to be acting upon the unbound Pioneer 10 & 11 spacecraft. Thus, the
Pioneer anomaly may be a counter example to the dark matter hypothesis.

predicted that the navigation beam in open space would undergo a cosmological
redshift in its frequency which would be detectable with modern clocks.

  Three-Dimensional Magnetohydrodynamics","27 pages",,,,"math.AP math-ph math.MP",,"  Compressible vortex sheets are fundamental waves in entropy solutions to the
multidimensional hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. For the Euler
equations in 2-D gas dynamics, the classical linearized stability analysis on
compressible vortex sheets predicts stability when the Mach number $M>\sqrt{2}$
and instability when $M<\sqrt{2}$; and Artola-Majda's analysis reveals that the
nonlinear instability may occur if planar vortex sheets are perturbed by highly
oscillatory waves even when $M>\sqrt{2}$. For the Euler equations in 3-D, every
compressible vortex sheet is violently unstable and this violent instability is
the analogue of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability for incompressible fluids. The
purpose of this paper is to understand whether compressible vortex sheets in
3-D, which are unstable in the regime of pure gas dynamics, become stable under
the magnetic effect in 3-D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). One of the main features
is that the stability problem is equivalent to a free boundary problem whose
free boundary is a characteristic surface. Another feature is that the
linearized problem for current-vortex sheets in MHD does not meet the uniform
Kreiss-Lopatinskii condition. In this paper, we develop a nonlinear approach to
deal with these difficulties in 3-D MHD. We first carefully formulate the
linearized problem for the current-vortex sheets to show rigorously that the
magnetic effect makes the problem weakly stable and establish energy estimates,
especially high-order energy estimates, in terms of the nonhomogeneous terms
and variable coefficients without loss of the order. Then we exploit these
results to develop a suitable iteration scheme of Nash-Moser-H\""{o}rmander type
and establish its convergence, which leads to the existence and stability of
compressible current-vortex sheets, locally in time, in the 3-D MHD.

  derivation",,,,,"nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we present a systematic method to solve the variational problem
of the derivation of a self-consistent Kohn-Sham field from an arbitrary local
energy functional. We illustrate this formalism with an application in nuclear
physics and give the general mean field associated to the widely used Skyrme
effective interaction.

electronically stable state of positronic calcium with an orbital angular
momentum of L=1. This prediction relies on the use of an asymptotic series to
estimate the variational limit of the energy. The best estimate of the binding
energy is 37 meV. A discussion of the structure of the system is also
presented.

infections. We formalize the evolution that occurs in both HIV-1 and the immune
system quasispecies. Inclusion of competition in the immune system leads to a
novel balance between the immune response and HIV-1, in which the eventual
outcome is HIV-1 escape rather than control. The analytical model reproduces
the three stages of HIV-1 infection. We propose a vaccine regimen that may be
able to reduce competition between T cells, potentially eliminating the third
stage of HIV-1.

two schemes both reach unit.
