galactic nuclei (AGNs) is lower in clusters than in the field. This can result
from the suppression of galaxy-galaxy mergers in high-velocity dispersion
(sigma_v) clusters, if the formation and/or fueling of AGNs is directly related
to the merging process. We investigate the existence of a relation between
f_AGN and sigma_v in galaxy clusters in order to shed light on the formation
and evolution processes of AGNs and cluster galaxies. Using data from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey we determine f_AGN and sigma_v for the clusters in two
samples, extracted from the catalogs of Popesso et al. (2006a) and Miller et
al. (2005), and excluding clusters with significant evidence for substructures.
We find a significant f_AGN-sigma_v anti-correlation. Clusters with sigma_v
lower and, respectively, higher than 500 km/s have AGN fractions of $0.21 \pm
0.01$ and $0.15 \pm 0.01$, on average. The f_AGN-sigma_v relation can be
described by a model that assumes f_AGN is proportional to the galaxies merging
rate, plus a constant. Since f_AGN increases with decreasing sigma_v, AGNs are
likely to have played a significant role in heating the intra-cluster medium
and driving galaxy evolution in cluster precursors and groups.

Galactic latitude ROSAT PSPC pointings, virtually all pointed ROSAT data
suitable for the detection of distant clusters. The search volume for X-ray
luminous clusters within z<1 exceeds that of the entire local Universe (z<0.1).
We detected 287 extended X-ray sources with fluxes f>1.4e-13 erg/s/cm^2 in the
0.5-2 keV energy band, of which 266 (93%) are optically confirmed as galaxy
clusters, groups or individual elliptical galaxies. This paper provides a
description of the input data, the statistical calibration of the survey via
Monte-Carlo simulations, and the catalog of detected clusters. We also compare
the basic results to those from previous, smaller area surveys and find good
agreement for the log N - log S distribution and the local X-ray luminosity
function. Our sample clearly shows a decrease in the number density for the
most luminous clusters at z>0.3. The comparison of our ROSAT-derived fluxes
with the accurate Chandra measurements for a subset of high-redshift clusters
demonstrates the validity of the 400 square degree survey's statistical

spreads seen in absorption, this suggests that these absorbing regions are more
kinematically complex than local spirals such as the Milky Way. Our data
indicate that interactions and galaxy pairs may be a contributing factor to the

a population of galaxies with luminosities in the range 4L* \lesssim L \lesssim

modeling galaxy formation. The SDSS data show a genus curve that is broadly
characteristic of that produced by Gaussian random phase initial conditions.
Thus the data strongly support the standard model of inflation where Gaussian
random phase initial conditions are produced by random quantum fluctuations in
the early universe. But on top of this general shape there are measurable
differences produced by non-linear gravitational effects (cf. Matsubara 1994),

including those of interstellar medium, clusters of galaxies and circumstellar
regions. Turbulent motions induce Doppler shifts of observable emission and
absorption lines. In the review we discuss new techniques that relate the
spectra of underlying velocity turbulence and spectra of Doppler-shifted lines.
In particular, the Velocity-Channel Analysis (VCA) makes use of the channel
maps, while the Velocity Coordinate Spectrum (VCS) utilizes the fluctuations
measured along the velocity axis of the Position-Position Velocity (PPV) data
cubes. Both techniques have solid foundations based on analytical calculations
as well as on numerical testings. Among the two the VCS, which has been
developed quite recently, has two advantages. First of all, it is applicable to
turbulent volumes that are not spatially resolved. Second, it can be used with
absorption lines that do not provide good spatial sampling of different lags
over the image of turbulent object. In fact, numerical testing shows that
measurements of Doppler shifted absorption lines over a few directions is
sufficient for a reliable recovering of the underlying spectrum of the
turbulence. Our comparison of the VCA and the VCS with a more traditional
technique of Velocity Centroids, shows that the former two techniques recover
reliably the spectra of supersonic turbulence, while the Velocity Centroids may
have advantages for studying subsonic turbulence. In parallel with theoretical
and numerical work on the VCA and the VCS, the techniques have been applied to
spectroscopic observations. We discuss results on astrophysical turbulence
obtained with the VCA and the VCS.

infrared-luminous LINERs, which often show spatially extended (non-AGN) LINER
emission. We show that these two populations can be easily distinguished by
their mid-infrared spectra in three different ways: (i) their mid-IR spectral
energy distributions (SEDs), (ii) the emission features of polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), and (iii) various combinations of IR fine-structure line
ratios. IR-luminous LINERs show mid-IR SEDs typical of starburst galaxies,
while the mid-IR SEDs of IR-faint LINERs are much bluer. PAH flux ratios are
significantly different in the two groups. Fine structure emission lines from
highly excited gas, such as [O IV], are detected in both populations,
suggesting the presence of an additional AGN also in a large fraction of
IR-bright LINERs, which contributes little to the combined mid-IR light. The
two LINER groups occupy different regions of mid-infrared emission-line
excitation diagrams. The positions of the various LINER types in our diagnostic
diagrams provide important clues regarding the power source of each LINER type.
Most of these mid-infrared diagnostics can be applied at low spectral

Furthermore, the deep exposure allows not only the detection of numerous,

  Results. X-ray properties of T Tauri stars in Cha I are presented. The
XMM-Newton images resolve some previously blended X-ray sources, confirm
several possible ones and detect many new X-ray targets, resulting in the most
comprehensive list with 71 X-ray sources in the northern Cha I dark cloud. The
analysis of medium resolution spectra shows an overlapping distribution of
spectral properties for classical and weak-line T Tauri stars, with the X-ray
brighter stars having hotter coronae and a higher L_X/L_bol ratio. X-ray
luminosity correlates with bolometric luminosity, whereas the L_X/L_bol ratio
is slightly lower for the classical T Tauri stars. Large flares as well as a
low iron and a high neon abundance are found in both types of T Tauri stars.

campaigns of starburst galaxies has shown that a significant fraction of SNe is
missed by optical surveys. However, the number of SNe detected in ground-based
near-IR observations is still significantly lower than the number of SNe
extrapolated from the FIR luminosity of the hosts. A possibility is that most
SNe occur within the nuclear regions, where the limited angular resolution of
ground-based observations prevents their detection. This issue prompted us to
exploit the superior angular resolution of NICMOS-HST to search for obscured
SNe within the first kpc from the nucleus of strong starbursting galaxies. A
total of 17 galaxies were observed in SNAPSHOT mode. Based on their FIR
luminosity, we expected to detect not less than ~12 SNe. However, no confirmed
SN event was found. From our data we derive an observed nuclear SN rate <0.5
SN/yr per galaxy. The shortage of SN detections can be explained by a
combination of several effects. The most important are: i) the existence of a
strong extinction, A_V>11; ii) most SNe occur within the first 0.5"" (which
corresponds in our sample to about 500pc) where even NICMOS is unable to detect
SN events.

on diagnostics (FIR luminosity $L_{FIR}$, $R=\log(L_{FIR}/L_{B})$ and IRAS
colours) thought to be sensitive to effects of environment or interaction. The
distribution of $\log(L_{FIR})$ is sharply peaked from 9.0--10.5 with very few
($<$2%) galaxies above 10.5. The optically normalised luminosity diagnostic $R=
\log(L_{FIR}/L_{B})$ shows a distribution sharply peaked between 0.0 and
$-$1.0. These results were compared to the magnitude limited CfA sample that
was selected without environmental discrimination. This modestly (e.g. compared
to cluster, binary galaxy and compact group samples) environmentally affected
sample shows significantly higher mean $\log(L_{FIR})$ and $R$, whereas the
mean $\log(L_{B})$ is the same. Our sample shows a strong $L_{FIR}$ vs. $L_{B}$
correlation, with a slope steeper than one ($L_{FIR} \propto L_{B}^{1.41}$).
Interacting galaxies were found above this correlation, showing an enhancement
in $L_{FIR}$. With respect to the IRAS colours, we found higher
$F_{60}/F_{100}$ value for ellipticals and late-type galaxies than for spirals,
indicating a higher dust temperature. The results indicate that the FIR

shows the lowest possible mean value. This attests to the utility of our sample
for defining a nurture-free zero point.

Furthermore, the difference in the Fe mass fraction between the two metal

of pulsation modes is non-negligible: the blue border of the SPB instability
strip is displaced at higher effective temperatures, leading to a larger number
of models being hybrid SPB-$\beta$ Cephei pulsators. Moreover, higher overtone

Keplerian rotating rings in the equatorial plane of a rotating black hole.
Emission lines are characterised by a generalized fully relativistic Doppler
factor or redshift associated with the line core. Two modes of gravitational
redshift, shift and distortion, become stronger with the emitting region closer
to the Kerr black hole. Shifts of the line cores reveal an effect at levels of
0.0015 to 60 % at gravitational radii ranging from 100000 to 2. The
corresponding Doppler factors range from 0.999985 to 0.4048. Line shape
distortion by strong gravity, i.e. very skewed and asymmetric lines occur at
radii smaller than roughly ten gravitational radii. Gravitational redshift
decreases with distance to the black hole but remains finite due to the
asymptotical flatness of black hole space-time. The onset of gravitational
redshift can be tested observationally with sufficient spectral resolution.
Assuming a resolving power of ~100000, yielding a resolution of ~0.1 Angstroms
for optical and near-infrared broad emission lines, the gravitational redshift
can be probed out to approximately 75000 gravitational radii. In general,
gravitational redshift is an indicator of black hole mass and spin as well as
for the inclination angle of the emitter, e.g. an accretion disk. We suggest to
do multi-wavelength observations because all redshifted features should point

stars are part of a binary or multiple system. For our understanding of star
formation it is therefore of crucial importance to characterise the outcome of
the star forming process in terms of binary parameters. This thesis describes
the recovery of the primordial binary population in the nearby OB association
Sco OB2. The current binary population in Sco OB2 is first recovered using two
adaptive optics surveys (ADONIS, NAOS-CONICA), a literature study, and a
detailed analysis of the selection effects of visual, spectroscopic, and
astrometric binary surveys. Our results indicate a binary fraction close to
100%. The mass ratio distribution (among A/B primaries) has the form f(q) =
q^-0.4, while random pairing is excluded. The semi-major axis distribution has
the form f(log a) = constant. Due to its youth and low stellar density, the
current binary population of Sco OB2 is very similar to its primordial binary
population. Our study further indicates a small brown dwarf companion frequency
and a small substellar-to-stellar companion frequency among A and B type stars.
These properties, often referred to as the brown dwarf desert, are a natural

continues to illuminate a spectacular series of light echoes, as the outburst
light is scattered from circumstellar dust. V838 Mon has an unresolved B3 V
companion star.
  We serendipitously discovered that a neighboring 16th-mag star is also of
type B. We then carried out a survey of other stars in the vicinity, revealing
two more B-type stars within 45"" of V838 Mon. We have determined the distance
to this sparse, young cluster, based on spectral classification and photometric
main-sequence fitting of the three B stars. The cluster distance is found to be
6.2+-1.2 kpc, in excellent agreement with the geometric distance to V838 Mon of
5.9 kpc obtained from Hubble Space Telescope polarimetry of the light echoes.
  Using our distance determination, we show that the B3 V companion of V838 Mon
is sufficient to account for the entire luminosity of the star measured on
survey photographs before its outburst. The B3 star is currently, however,
about 1 mag fainter than before the eruption, suggesting that it is now
suffering extinction due to dust ejected from V838 Mon. Considerations of the
pre-outburst luminosity and cluster age appear to leave stellar-collision or
-merger scenarios as one of the remaining viable explanations for the outburst
of V838 Mon.

along the wires, each bridging plane shows two energy minima, one in the ground
state with the calculated Young modulus Y=82 GPa, and one in the stretched

experimental values and the origin of the discrepancy remains a puzzle. The
ideal tensile strength is about 8.4 GPa, the chains break in the Mo-Mo bonds
within the octahedra and not in the S bridges. The charge-carrier conductivity
is strongly anisotropic and the Mo_6S_3I_6 nanowires behave as
quasi-one-dimensional conductors in the whole range of investigated strains.
The conductivity is extremely sensitive to strain, making this material very
suitable for stain gauges. Very clean nanowires with good contacts may be
expected to behave as ballistic quantum wires over lengths of several $\mu $m.
On the other hand, with high-impedance contacts they are good candidates for
the observation of Luttinger liquid behaviour. The pronounced 1D nature of the

to the lack of time-reversal symmetry in the radiation, the optical transitions
depend on the direction of motion of the electrons, leading to a current at
zero bias voltage. The photocurrent increases with the number of rings within a
wide range of physical parameters. A weak non-linear dependence of the current
in the number of rings, related to quantum interference effects, is also
predicted. This geometry suggests a scalable method for the generation of
sizeable photocurrents based on nanoscale components.

  Some of the most intriguing problems in solid state physics arise when the
motion of one electron dramatically affects the motion of surrounding
electrons. Traditionally, such highly-correlated electron systems have been
studied mainly in materials with complex transition metal chemistry. Over the
past decade, researchers have learned to confine one or a few electrons within
a nanoscale semiconductor ""artificial atom"", and to understand and control this
simple system in exquisite detail. In the accompanying Article, we combine such
individually well-understood components to create a novel highly-correlated
electron system within a nano-engineered semiconductor structure. We tune the
system in situ through a quantum phase transition between two distinct states,
one familiar and one subtly new. The boundary between these states is a quantum
critical point: the exotic and previously elusive two-channel Kondo state, in
which electrons in two reservoirs are entangled through their interaction with
a single localized spin.

by both orders, and the effective gap is non-monotonic d-wave-like in the
momentum space. Alternatively the gap was also speculated as a pure pairing
gap. Using an effective microscopic model, we consider the manifestation of the
quasi-particle gap in the electronic Raman spectra in a range of doping levels,
where the relative strength of the SC and AFM order parameters varies. We
demonstrate that from the electronic Raman spectra the effective

sufficient to characterize a noisy communication channel if the channel is
intended to be used as part of a feedback loop to stabilize an unstable scalar
linear system. While classical capacity is not enough, a sense of capacity
(parametrized by reliability) called ""anytime capacity"" is both necessary and
sufficient for channel evaluation in this context. The rate required is the log
of the open-loop system gain and the required reliability comes from the
desired sense of stability. Sufficiency is maintained even in cases with noisy
observations and without any explicit feedback between the observer and the
controller. This established the asymptotic equivalence between scalar
stabilization problems and delay-universal communication problems with
feedback.
  Here in part II, the vector-state generalizations are established and it is
the magnitudes of the unstable eigenvalues that play an essential role. To deal
with such systems, the concept of the anytime rate-region is introduced. This
is the region of rates that the channel can support while still meeting
potentially different anytime reliability targets for parallel message streams.
All the scalar results generalize on an eigenvalue by eigenvalue basis. When
there is no explicit feedback of the noisy channel outputs, the intrinsic delay
of the unstable system tells us what the feedback delay needs to be while
evaluating the anytime-rate-region for the channel. An example involving a
binary erasure channel is used to illustrate how differentiated service is
required in any separation-based control architecture.

gravitational-wave detections on the ground; ones with much longer arms are
being planned for space-based detection. One fundamental motivation for long
baseline interferometry is from displacement noise. In general, the longer the
arm length L, the larger the motion the gravitational-wave induces on the test
masses, until L becomes comparable to the gravitational wavelength. Recently,
schemes have been invented, in which displacement noises can be evaded by
employing differences between the influence of test-mass motions and that of
gravitational waves on light propagation. However, in these schemes, such
differences only becomes significant when L approaches the gravitational
wavelength, and shot-noise limited sensitivity becomes worse than that of
conventional configurations by a factor of at least (f L/c)^(-2), for f<c/L.
Such a factor, although can be overcome theoretically by employing high optical
powers, makes these schemes quite impractical. In this paper, we explore the
use of time delay in displacement-noise-free interferometers, which can improve
their shot-noise-limited sensitivity at low frequencies, to a factor of (f
L/c)^(-1) of the shot-noise-limited sensitivity of conventional configurations.

expressions available in the low temperature regime with focus on the
possibility of achieving strong dissipation within this approximation. Two
different types of models are examined: monomial or equivalently chaotic type
potentials, and hybrid like models where the energy density during inflation is
dominated by the false vacuum. In both cases dissipation is shown to typically
increase during inflation and bring the system into the strong dissipative
regime. Observational consequences are explored for the amplitude of the
primordial spectrum and the spectral index, which translate into constraints on
the number of fields mediating the dissipative mechanism, and the number of
light degrees of freedom produced during inflation. This paper furthers the
foundational development of warm inflation dynamics from first principles
quantum field theory by calculating conservative lower bound estimates on
dissipative effects during inflation using the well established thermal
equilibrium approximation. This approximation does not completely represent the
actual physical system and earlier work has shown relaxing both the equilibrium

regime, but these improvements still need further theoretical development.

equation in the form of an inversion identity satisfied by the commuting

Temperley-Lieb algebra and holds independently of the space of link states on
which the transfer matrices act. Different sectors are obtained by acting on
link states with s-1 defects where s=1,2,3,... is an extended Kac label. The
bulk and boundary free energies and finite-size corrections are obtained from
the Euler-Maclaurin formula. The eigenvalues of the transfer matrix are
classified by the physical combinatorics of the patterns of zeros in the
complex spectral-parameter plane. This yields a selection rule for the
physically relevant solutions to the inversion identity and explicit finitized

of strings, then massive string states will be excited near the bounce, and the
bounce will occur inside (or at the onset of) the Hagedorn phase for string
matter. As we discuss in this paper, in this case cosmological fluctuations can
be generated via the string gas mechanism recently proposed in hep-th/0511140.
In fact, the model discussed here demonstrates explicitly that it is possible
to realize the assumptions made in hep-th/0511140 in the context of a concrete
set of dynamical background equations. We also calculate the spectral tilt of
thermodynamic stringy fluctuations generated in the Hagedorn regime in this

the N=2 supersymmetric case in which one of the adjoint chiral multiplets is

a generalization of the known expressions for the backreaction of G_3 in the
case of three equal masses to generic mass values. We work to second order in
the masses to obtain the embedding of D7-brane probes in the background. At
this order, the 2-form potentials corresponding to the background flux induce
an 8-form potential which couples to the worldvolume of the D7-branes. We show
that the embeddings preserve an SU(2) x SU(2) symmetry. We study possible
embeddings both analytically in a particular approximation, as well as
numerically. The embeddings preserve supersymmetry, as we investigate using the
approach of holographic renormalization. The meson spectrum associated to one

investigated. It is shown that for a given function w(x) the equation admits an
infinite set of polynomial solutions P(x). For polynomial solutions, this
nonlinear integral equation reduces to a finite set of coupled linear algebraic
equations for the coefficients of the polynomials. Interestingly, the set of
polynomial solutions is orthogonal with respect to the measure x w(x). The
nonlinear integral equation can be used to specify all orthogonal polynomials
in a simple and compact way. This integral equation provides a natural vehicle
for extending the theory of orthogonal polynomials into the complex domain.
Generalizations of the integral equation are discussed.

The framework described is quite general and can be applied to a variety of
problems where matches are to be found in data surveyed at a number of
locations (or at a single location over a number of days). As an example, the
framework is applied to the problem of false matches in licence plate survey
data. The specific problem addressed is that of estimating how many vehicles
were genuinely sighted at every one of a number of survey points when there is
a possibility of accidentally confusing two vehicles due to the nature of the
survey undertaken.
  In this paper, a method for representing the possible ""types of match"" is
outlined using set theory. The phrase ""types of match"" will be defined and
formalised in this paper. A method for enumerating the set of all types of
match over n survey sites, is described. The method is applied to the problem
of correcting survey data for false matches using a simple probabalistic
method. An algorithm is developed for correcting false matches over multiple
survey sites and its use is demonstrated with simulation results.

growing function of $N$. It grows faster that all functions previously
encountered in Mathematics (outside of Logic) including non-computable

the third busy beaver function that measures the maximal productivity of Turing
machines with $\leq N$ states that use the oracle for the halting problem of
Turing machines using the oracle for the halting problem of usual Turing
machines. We also describe the fastest possible growth of a sequence of finite
Betti numbers of a finitely presented group. In particular, it cannot grow as
fast as the third busy beaver function but can grow faster than the second busy
beaver function that measures the maximal productivity of Turing machines using
an oracle for the halting problem for usual Turing machines. We describe a
natural problem about Betti numbers of finitely presented groups such that its
answer is expressed by a function that grows as the fifth busy beaver function.
Also, we outline a construction of a finitely presented group all of whose

experimental sources of systematic error, such as the electronic threshold in
the detectors, summing of gamma-rays, internal electron conversion, and the
isomeric state in bismuth, have been taken into account. Gamma-ray absorption
effects inside the sample have been corrected by employing a nonpolynomial
weighting function. Because Bi209 is the last stable isotope in the reaction
path of the stellar s-process, the Maxwellian averaged capture cross section is
important for the recycling of the reaction flow by alpha-decays. In the
relevant stellar range of thermal energies between kT=5 and 8 keV our new
capture rate is about 16% higher than the presently accepted value used for
nucleosynthesis calculations. At this low temperature an important part of the
heavy Pb-Bi isotopes are supposed to be synthesized by the s-process in the He
shells of low mass, thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch stars. With the
improved set of cross sections we obtain an s-process fraction of 19(3)% of the

multifragmentation has still a minor share in the total reaction cross section,
it was observed to have, together with fission, a prominent role in the
production and the kinematics of intermediate-mass fragments, so as to
condition the whole production of light and heavy nuclides. The experimental
observables we dispose of attribute rather elusive properties to the
intermediate-mass fragments and do not allow to classify them within one
exclusive picture which is either multifragmentation or fission. Indeed, these
two decay mechanisms, driven by different kinds of instabilities, exhibit
behaviours which are closely comparable. High-resolution measurements of the

The relationship between the binding energy of projectiles and the strength of
proton-neutron correlation function at small relative momentum has been
explored, while proton-proton correlation function shows its sensitivity to the
proton density distribution. Those results show that nucleon-nucleon
correlation function is useful to reflect some features of the neutron- or
proton-halo nuclei and therefore provide a potential tool for the studies of
radioactive beam physics.

waves in a planar optical waveguide via a long-period modulation of the usual
quasi-phase-matching pattern of ferroelectric domains. The MM may also be
implemented by dint of the Feshbach resonance in a harmonically-modulated
magnetic field in a hybrid atomic-molecular Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC),
with the atomic and molecular mean fields (MFs) playing the roles of the FF and
SH, respectively. The problem is analyzed by two methods. First, we identify
stability regions for spatial solitons in the MM system, in terms of the MM
amplitude and period, using the MF equations for spatially-inhomogeneous
configurations. In particular, an instability enclave is found inside the
stability area.The robustness of the solitons is also tested against variation
of the shape of the input pulse, and a threshold for the formation of stable
solitons is found in terms of its power. Interactions between solitons are
virtually unaffected by the MM. The second method (\textit{parametric
approximation}), going beyond the MF description, is developed for
spatially-homogeneous states. It demonstrates that the MF description is valid
for large modulation periods, while at smaller periods the non-MF component
acquires gain, which implies destruction of MF under the action of the
high-frequency MM.

introduce two measures to distinguish the mechanisms responsible for the bursty

that while the burstiness of natural phenomena is rooted in both the interevent

formulas, all experiments which support general relativity can also be

interpreted by means of the electrokinetic potential, which is usually positive
in the flow direction (i.e. Zeta potential of the rock is negative). The
water-rock interactions in hydrothermal zones alter the primary minerals
leading to the formation of secondary minerals. This work addresses the study
of calcite precipitation in a sand composed of 98% quartz and 2% calcite using
streaming potential measurements. The precipitation of calcite as a secondary
mineral phase, inferred by high calcite saturation indices and by a fall in
permeability, has a significant effect on the electrokinetic behaviour, leading
to a significant reduction in the Zeta potential (in absolute value) and even a
change in sign. The measured decrease in Zeta potential from -16 mV to
-27&plusmn;4 mV takes place as the pH rises from 4 to 7, while it remains
constant at -25&plusmn;1 mV as the pH increases from 8 to 10.5. For pH higher
than 10.5, calcite precipitates and is expected to coat the quartz surface. The
measured Zeta potential vary from -17 to +8 mV for pH ranging from 10.6 to 11.7
depending on the amount of precipitated calcite indicated by the decrease in
permeability. The observed change in sign of the electrical surface potential
rules out the usual qualitative interpretation of SP anomalies in order to
determine fluid circulations, even at pH lower than 9 if calcite is widely
present as a secondary mineral phase, since the electrical surface potential of
calcite depends also on CO2 partial pressure and [Ca2+]. Therefore SP anomalies
as measured in hydrothermal field, without mineralogical analyses of
hydrothermal deposits, and without geochemical fluid survey, should be
interpreted with caution.

"quant-ph/0610220","Cristian S. Calude","Cristian S. Calude","De-Quantising the Solution of Deutsch's Problem","8 pages",,,"CDMTCS Research Report 285","quant-ph",,"  Probably the simplest and most frequently used way to illustrate the power of
quantum computing is to solve the so-called {\it Deutsch's problem}. Consider a
Boolean function $f: \{0,1\} \to \{0,1\}$ and suppose that we have a
(classical) black box to compute it. The problem asks whether $f$ is constant
(that is, $f(0) = f(1)$) or balanced ($f(0) \not= f(1)$). Classically, to solve
the problem seems to require the computation of $f(0)$ and $ f(1)$, and then
the comparison of results. Is it possible to solve the problem with {\em only
one} query on $f$? In a famous paper published in 1985, Deutsch posed the
problem and obtained a ``quantum'' {\em partial affirmative answer}. In 1998 a
complete, probability-one solution was presented by Cleve, Ekert, Macchiavello,
and Mosca. Here we will show that the quantum solution can be {\it
de-quantised} to a deterministic simpler solution which is as efficient as the
quantum one. The use of ``superposition'', a key ingredient of quantum
algorithm, is--in this specific case--classically available.

where the excited state of a laser-driven transition is coupled by a second
laser to a top, more stable level, as for alkali-earth atoms. The second laser
action modifies the atomic scattering cross section and produces temperatures
lower than those reached by Doppler cooling on the lower transition. When
multiphoton processes due to the second laser are relevant, an electromagnetic
induced transparency modifies the absorption of the first laser, and the final
temperature is controlled by the second laser parameters. When the intermediate
state is only virtually excited, the dynamics is dominated by the two-photon
process and the final temperature is determined by the spontaneous decay rate
of the top state.

that this phase shift is easily observable in a closed loop interference

sensing applications. The spread in phase shift due to the atom transverse
