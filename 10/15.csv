field models where the effective potential can be described by a polynomial
series - exploring their dynamical behavior using the method of flow equations
that has previously been applied to inflationary models. Using supernova,
baryon oscillation, CMB and Hubble constant data, and an implicit theoretical
prior imposed by the scalar field dynamics, we find that the LCDM model
provides an excellent fit to the data. Constraints on the generic scalar field
potential parameters are presented, along with the reconstructed w(z) histories
consistent with the data and the theoretical prior. We propose and pursue
computationally feasible algorithms to obtain estimates of the principal
components of the equation of state, as well as parameters w_0 and w_a.
Further, we use the Monte Carlo Markov Chain machinery to simulate future data
based on the Joint Dark Energy Mission, Planck and baryon acoustic oscillation
surveys and find that the inverse area figure of merit improves nearly by an
order of magnitude. Therefore, most scalar field models that are currently
consistent with data can be potentially ruled out by future experiments. We
also comment on the classification of dark energy models into ""thawing'"" and
""freezing"" in light of the more diverse evolution histories allowed by this
general class of potentials.

low-resolution (R ~ 2000 and 4000) spectropolarimetric data collected from 2003
to 2005 at the Very Large Telescope (ESO, Chile) with the multi-mode instrument
FORS1. We show that the spectropolarimetric results strongly depend on the
level of CS contribution to the stellar spectra. We have improved the
determination accuracy of magnetic fields up to the 7 sigma level in the two
Herbig Ae stars HD139614 and HD144432, observed in 2005 when these objects were
at a low level state of their CS activity. We have established that at a higher
level state of CS activity the polarisation signatures are related mainly to
the CS matter. The presence of CS polarisation signatures formed in the stellar
wind supports the assumption that the magnetic centrifuge is a principal
mechanism of wind acceleration. We conclude that the most effective way to
investigate the magnetism of Herbig Ae stars is to monitor their
spectropolarimetric behaviour at different states of CS activity. Obviously,
higher resolution spectropolarimetric observations would extend the sample of
spectral lines to be used for the measurements of magnetic fields at different
levels in the stellar atmosphere and CS envelope. Such observations will give a
more complete insight into the magnetic topology in Herbig Ae stars.

non-Arrhenius dynamics. We find a unique structural environment for strings
that is different from the structure of the bulk liquid at any T. This unique
string environment persists from the melting T upon cooling to the lowest T
studied in the vicinity of the mode-coupling temperature, and is explained by
the existence of rigid elongated cages. We also form a criterion based solely

assignments to arbitrary formulas in the logical language). `Corresponds' means
that execution of either event in a given information state results in

a heterogeneous catalytic reaction mechanism with an uncertain atomistic

appropriately initialized computational experiments with the SSA code. The

coarse-grained state for the expected behavior of the SSA at each value of the
uncertain parameter; and (c) the desired fully coarse-grained level:
distributions of the coarse-grained behavior over the range of uncertain
parameter values. The latter are computed in the form of generalized Polynomial
Chaos (gPC) coefficients in terms of the random parameter. Coarse projective
integration and coarse fixed point computation are employed to accelerate the
computational evolution of these desired observables, to converge on random
stable/unstable steady states, and to perform parametric studies with respect

photon-pair generation from parametric down-conversion (PDC). It uses the same
experimental setup as the conventional protocol, but a refined data analysis
enables detection of photon-number splitting attacks by utilizing information
from a built-in decoy state. Assuming the use of practical detectors, we
analyze the unconditional security of the new scheme and show that it improves
the secure key generation rate by several orders of magnitude at long
distances, using a high intensity PDC source.

A 76, 032321 (2007).","10.1103/PhysRevA.76.032321",,"quant-ph",,"  The linear optical creation of Gaussian cluster states, a potential resource
for universal quantum computation, is investigated. We show that for any
Gaussian cluster state, the canonical generation scheme in terms of QND-type
interactions, can be entirely replaced by off-line squeezers and beam
splitters. Moreover, we find that, in terms of squeezing resources, the
canonical states are rather wasteful and we propose a systematic way to create
cheaper states. As an application, we consider Gaussian cluster computation in
multiple-rail encoding. This encoding may reduce errors due to finite
squeezing, even when the extra rails are achieved through off-line squeezing
and linear optics.

designed adiabatic evolution may be detected directly via the quantum state
tomography developed for superconducting qubits.
