implies a time-scale problem given the age of the Trapezium, and an IMF problem
for the whole OB star population in the ONC. Given the estimated crossing time
of the Trapezium, it ought to have totally dynamically decayed by now.
Furthermore, by combining the lower limit of the ONC mass with a standard IMF
it emerges that the ONC should have formed at least about 40 stars heavier than
5 M_sun while only ten are observed. Using N-body experiments we (i) confirm
the expected instability of the trapezium and (ii) show that beginning with a
compact OB-star configuration of about 40 stars the number of observed OB stars
after 1 Myr within 1 pc radius and a compact trapezium configuration can both
be reproduced. These two empirical constraints thus support our estimate of 40
initial OB stars in the cluster. Interestingly, a more-evolved version of the
ONC resembles the Upper Scorpius OB association. The N-body experiments are
performed with the new C-code CATENA by integrating the equations of motion
using the chain-multiple-regularisation method. In addition, we present a new
numerical formulation of the initial mass function.

Miller et al., at r/r_g = 10^(4.7-5.7). The expected wind velocity, as well as
the computed equivalent widths of more than 50 absorption lines in this

upon our theoretical analysis of the power excess on small angular scales. We
have taken into account several important effects such as the modified matter
sound speed in the presence of a magnetic field. An upper limit to the field
strength of $|B_\lambda|\lesssim$ 4.7 nG at the present scale of 1 Mpc is
deduced. This is obtained by comparing the calculated theoretical result
including the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect with recent observed data on the
small scale CMB anisotropies from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe

High-resolution, high signal-to-noise ESO VLT-UVES spectra of MACHO47.2496.8
are analysed by performing detailed spectrum synthesis modelling using
state-of-the-art carbon-rich MARCS atmosphere models. Results. The spectrum of
MACHO47.2496.8 is not only dominated by bands of carbon bearing molecules, but
also by lines of atomic transitions of s-process elements. The metallicity of
[Fe/H]=-1.4 is surprisingly low for a field LMC star. The C/O ratio, however
difficult to quantify, is greater than 2, and the s-process enrichment is
large: the light s-process elements are enhanced by 1.2 dex compared to iron
([ls/Fe]=+1.2), while for the heavy s-process elements an even stronger
enrichment is measured: [hs/Fe]=+2.1. The lead abundance is comparable to the
[hs/Fe]. With its low intrinsic metallicity and its luminosity at the low end
of the carbon star luminosity function, the star represents likely the final
stage of a low initial mass star. Conclusions. The LMC RV Tauri star
MACHO47.2496.8 is highly carbon and s-process enriched, and is most probable a
genuine post-C(N-type) AGB star. This is the first detailed abundance analysis

could contribute up to 30% to the total light of these galaxies. We derived the
effective radius R_e and the mean surface brightness <mu_e> within R_e of our
galaxies and we compared them with those of early-types at lower redshifts. We
find that the surface brightness <mu_e> of our galaxies should get fainter by
2.5 mag from z~1.5 to z~0 to match the surface brightness of the local
ellipticals with comparable R_e, i.e. the local Kormendy relation. Luminosity
evolution without morphological changes can only explain half of this effect,
as the maximum dimming expected for an elliptical galaxy is ~1.6 mag in this
redshift range. Thus, other parameters, possibly structural, may undergo
evolution and play an important role in reconciling models and observations.
Hypothesizing an evolution of the effective radius of galaxies we find that R_e
should increase by a factor 1.5 from z~1.5 to z~0.

The scatter around the mean is entirely explained by our estimate of the
observational error and does not allow for any intrinsic scatter in the Li
abundances. In addition, we conclude that a systematic error of the order of
200 K in any of the current temperature scales remains possible. The iron
excitation equilibria in our stars support our adopted temperature scale, which
is based on a fit to wings of the Halpha line, and disfavour hotter scales,
which would lead to a higher Li abundance, but fail to achieve excitation
equilibrium for iron. Conclusions. We confirm the previously noted discrepancy
between the Li abundance measured in extremely metal-poor turnoff stars and the
primordial Li abundance predicted by standard Big-Bang nucleosynthesis models
adopting the baryonic density inferred from WMAP. We discuss recent work
explaining the discrepancy in terms of diffusion and find that uncertain
temperature scales remain a major question. (abridged)

parallax, proper motion, perturbation period, perturbation inclination, and
perturbation size. Because of the long period of the companion, \eps b, we
extend our astrometric coverage to a total of 14.94 years (including the three
year span of the \HST data) by including lower-precision ground-based
astrometry from the Allegheny Multichannel Astrometric Photometer. Radial
velocities now span 1980.8 -- 2006.3. We obtain a perturbation period, P = 6.85
+/- 0.03 yr, semi-major axis, alpha =1.88 +/- 0.20 mas, and inclination i =
30.1 +/- 3.8 degrees. This inclination is consistent with a previously measured
dust disk inclination, suggesting coplanarity. Assuming a primary mass M_* =
0.83 M_{\sun}, we obtain a companion mass M = 1.55 +/- 0.24 M_{Jup}. Given the
relatively young age of epsilon Eri (~800 Myr), this accurate exoplanet mass
and orbit can usefully inform future direct imaging attempts. We predict the

Eri b will appear brightest in reflected light very nearly at periastron.
Radial velocities spanning over 25 years indicate an acceleration consistent
with a Jupiter-mass object with a period in excess of 50 years, possibly

they emit up to 10^54 erg in the hard X-ray band in few tens of seconds. The
cosmological origin of GRBs has been confirmed by several spectroscopic
measurements of their redshifts, distributed in the range 0.1-6.3. These two
properties make GRBs very appealing to investigate the far Universe. The
energetics implied by the observed fluences and redshifts span at least four
orders of magnitudes. Therefore, at first sight, GRBs are all but standard
candles. But there are correlations among some observed quantities which allow
us to know the total energy or the peak luminosity emitted by a specific burst
with a great accuracy. Through these correlations, GRBs become ""known"" candles
to constrain the cosmological parameters. One of these correlation is between
the rest frame peak spectral energy E_peak and the total energy emitted in
gamma--rays E_gamma, properly corrected for the collimation factor. Another
correlation, discovered very recently, relates the total GRB luminosity L_iso,
its peak spectral energy E_peak and a characteristic timescale T_0.45, related
to the variability of the prompt emission. It is based only on prompt emission
properties, it is completely phenomenological, model independent and
assumption--free. The constraints found through these correlations on the
Omega_M and Omega_Lambda parameters are consistent with the concordance model.

necessary to calibrate these correlations, makes the cosmological constraints
obtained with GRBs still large compared to those obtained with other
cosmological probes (e.g. SNIa or CMB). However, the newly born field of
GRB--cosmology is very promising for the future.

accelerating phase of expansion. The fundamental quest in theoretical cosmology
is to identify the origin of this phenomenon. In principle there are two
possibilities: 1) the presence of matter which violates the strong energy
condition (a substantial form of dark energy), 2) modified Friedmann equations
(Cardassian models -- a non-substantial form of dark matter). We classify all
these models in terms of 2-dimensional dynamical systems of the Newtonian type.
We search for generic properties of the models. It is achieved with the help of
Peixoto's theorem for dynamical system on the Poincar{\'e} sphere. We find that
the notion of structural stability can be useful to distinguish the generic
cases of evolutional paths with acceleration. We find that, while the
$\Lambda$CDM models and phantom models are typical accelerating models, the
cosmological models with bouncing phase are non-generic in the space of all
planar dynamical systems. We derive the universal shape of potential function
which gives rise to presently accelerating models. Our results show explicitly
the advantages of using a potential function (instead of the equation of state)
to probe the origin of the present acceleration. We argue that simplicity and
genericity are the best guide in understanding our Universe and its
acceleration.

filled-skutterudite compounds (Pr_1-xLa_x)Os_4Sb_12. The Sb-NQR spectra have
split into two sets, arising from different Sb_12 cages containing either Pr or
La, which enables us to measure two kinds of nuclear spin-lattice relaxation
time T_1^Pr and T_1^La. In the normal state, the temperature (T) dependence of
1/T^Pr_1T showed almost the same behavior as that for PrOs_4Sb_12 regardless
of. In contrast, 1/T^La_1T markedly decreases with increasing La concentration.
In the superconducting state for x=0.05 and 0.2, 1/T_1^Pr exponentially
decreases down to T=0.7 K with no coherence peak below T_c as well as in
PrOs_4Sb_12. A remarkable finding is that the residual density of states at the
Fermi level below T_c is induced by La substitution for Pr. These results are
proposed to be understood in terms of a multiband-superconductivity model that
assumes a full gap for part of the FS and the presence of point nodes for a
small 4f^2-derived FS inherent in PrOs_4Sb_12. For x=0.8 and 1,1/T^La_1
exhibits a coherence peak and the nodeless energy gap characteristic for
weak-coupling s-wave superconductors. With increasing Pr content, T_c and the
energy gap increases. The novel strong-coupling superconductivity in
PrOs_4Sb_12 is inferred to be mediated by the local interaction between
4f^2-derived crystal-electric-field states with the electric quadrupole degree
of freedom and conduction electrons. This coupling causes a mass enhancement of
quasi-particles for a part of FS and induces a small FS, which is responsible
for point nodes in the superconducting gap function. Note that the small FS
does not play any primary role for the strong-coupling superconductivity in
PrOs_4Sb_12.

self-energy-functional theory (SFT) is proposed which is applicable to systems
of interacting electrons with disorder. Similar to the pure case without
disorder, a variational principle is set up which gives the physical (disorder)
self-energy as a stationary point of the (averaged) grand potential. Although
the resulting self-energy functional turns out to be more complicated, the
formal structure of the theory can be retained since the unknown part of the
functional is universal. This allows to construct non-perturbative and
thermodynamically consistent approximations via searching for a stationary
point on a restricted domain of the functional. The theory and the possible
approximations are worked out for models with local interactions and local
disorder. This results in a derivation of different mean-field approaches and
various cluster extensions, including well-known concepts as the statistical
dynamical mean-field theory, the molecular coherent-potential approximation and
the dynamical cluster approximation. Due to the common formal framework
provided by the SFT, one achieves a general systematization of dynamical
approaches, i.e. approaches based on the spectrum of one-particle excitations.
New mean-field and new cluster schemes naturally appear in this framework and
complement the existing ones. Their prospects for future applications are
discussed.

discrete-lattice calculations and a micromagnetic continuum approach. Ultrathin

the turbulent superfluid helium is studied. We perform investigation on the
base of the ""rate equation"" for the distribution function $n(l)$ of number of
loops in space of their length $l$. There are two mechanisms for change of
quantity $n(l)$. Firstly, the function changes due to deterministic process of
mutual friction, when the length grows or decreases depending on orientation.
Secondly, the change of $n(l)$ occurs due to random events when the loop
crosses itself breaking down into two daughter or two loops collide merging
into one larger loop. Accordingly the ""rate equation"" includes the ""collision""
term collecting random processes of fusion and breakdown and the deterministic
term. Assuming, further, that processes of random colliding are fastest we are
in position to study more slow processes related to deterministic term. In this
way we study the evolution of full length of vortex loops per unit volume-so
called vortex line density ${\cal L}(t)$. It is shown this evolution to obey
the famous Vinen equation. In conclusion we discuss properties of the Vinen
equation from the point of view of the developed approach.

interplanetary spaceprobes like ULYSSES, Galileo and especially the two NASA

which up to now have been explained as caused by anomalous non-Newtonian
decelerations of these probes recognizable at solar distances beyond 5 AU. In
this paper we study cosmological conditions for the transfer of radiosignals
between the Earth and these distant probes. Applying general relativity, we
derive both the geodetic deceleration as well as the cosmological redshift and
compare the resulting frequency shift with the observed effect. We find that
anomalous decelerations do act on these probes which are of cosmological
nature, but these are, as expected from standard cosmology, much too low to
explain the observed effect. In contrast, the cosmological redshift of
radiophotons suffered during the itinerary to the probe and back due to the
local spacetime expansion reveals a frequency shift which by its magnitude is
in surprisingly good agreement with the long registered phenomenon, and thus
explains the phenomenon well, except for the sign of the effect. Problems of a
local Hubble expansion may give the reason for this.

global well-posedness and scattering in dimensions 3, 4 and 5. This is sharp
since if the data is in the inhomogeneous Sobolev space H^1, of energy smaller
than the standing wave but of larger homogeneous H^1 norm, we have blow-up in

this type of critical problem. By concentration-compactness we produce a
critical element, which modulo the symmetries of the equation is compact, has
minimal energy among those which fail to have the conclusion of our theorem. In
addition, we show that the dilation parameter in the symmetry, for this

piston-like programmed wavemakers in a water flume with horisontal dimensions
6x12x1.5 meters. Our main finding is that for a wide range of excitation
amplitudes the energy spectrum has a power-law scaling, $E_\omega \sim
\omega^{-\nu}$. These scalings were achieved in up to one-decade wide frequency
range, which is significantly wider than the range available in field
observations and in numerical simulations. However, exponent $\nu$ appears to
be non-universal. It depends on the wavefield intensity and ranges from about
6.5 for weak forcing to about 3.5 for large levels of wave excitations. We
discuss our results in the context of the key theoretical predictions, such as
Zakharov-Filonenko spectrum $\nu=-4$, Phillips spectrum $\nu = -5$, Kuznetsov's
revision of Phillips spectrum (leading to $\nu=-4$) and Nazarenko's prediction

decaying GP turbulence in order to establish whether BEC can occur without

wavenumber-frequency plots which allow us to clearly separate the condensate
and the wave components and,therefore, to conclude if BEC is present. We
observe that BEC in such a system happens even for very weakly nonlinear
initial conditions without any visible threshold.
  BEC arises via a growing phase coherence due to anihilation of phase
defects/vortices. We study this process by tracking of propagating vortex
pairs. The pairs loose momentum by scattering the background sound, which
results in gradual decrease of the distance between the vortices. Occasionally,
vortex pairs collide with a third vortex thereby emitting sound, which can lead
to more sudden shrinking of the pairs. After the vortex anihilation the pulse
propagates further as a dark soliton, and it eventually bursts creating a
shock.

ingenious concept, it has ever since been troubled by the so called twin image
problem limiting the information that can be obtained from a holographic
record. Due to symmetry reasons there are always two images appearing in the
reconstruction process. Thus, the reconstructed object is obscured by its
unwanted out of focus twin image. Especially for emission electron as well as
for x- and gamma-ray holography, where the source-object distances are small,
the reconstructed images of atoms are very close to their twin images from
which they can hardly be distinguished. In some particular instances only,
experimental efforts could remove the twin images. More recently, numerical
methods to diminish the effect of the twin image have been proposed but are
limited to purely absorbing objects failing to account for phase shifts caused
by the object. Here we show a universal method to reconstruct a hologram
completely free of twin images disturbance while no assumptions about the
object need to be imposed. Both, amplitude and true phase distributions are
retrieved without distortion.

width, and amplitude-to-width ratio) depend strongly on the polarization of the
light wave. In particular, the resonance amplitude can increase by more than an
order of magnitude when the polarization changes from linear to optimal
elliptic. It has been shown that this effect is associated with the Doppler
frequency shift for atoms in a gas. The theoretical results have been
corroborated in experiments in Rb vapor.

three driving fields is studied perturbatively and analytical results are
presented. Numerical results where the driving field strengths are treated upto
all orders are presented. The absorption features is studied in two regimes, i)
the weak middle transition coupling, i.e.
  $\Omega_2 << \Omega_{1,3}$ and ii) the strong middle transition coupling
  $\Omega_2 >>\Omega_{1,3}$. In case i), it is shown that the ground state
absorption and the saturation characteristics of the population of level 2
reveal deviation due to the presence of upper level couplings. In particular,
the saturation curve for the population of level 2 shows a dip for $\Omega_1 =
\Omega_3$. While the populations of levels 3 and 4 show a maxima when this
resonance condition is satisfied. Thus the resonance condition provides a
criterion for maximally populating the upper levels. A second order
perturbation calculation reveals the nature of this minima (maxima). In the
second case, I report two important features: a) Filtering of the Aulter-Townes
doublet in the three-peak absorption profile of the ground state, which is
achieved by detuning only the upper most coupling field, and b) control of
line-width by controlling the strength of the upper coupling fields. This
filtering technique coupled with the control of linewidth could prove to be
very useful for high resolution studies.

consists of one-parameter groups that can jointly be inverted for all times
$t\in\R{}$ because their Hamiltonian generators satisfy $K H K^{-1} = \Ad K (H)
