intensity reduction differences between a ""Gaussian"" tapered focal plane
coronagraphic mask and a classical hard-edged ""Top Hat"" function mask at
Extreme Adaptive Optics (ExAO) Strehl ratios of ~94%. However, unlike a
traditional coronagraph design, we insert a reflective focal plane mask at 45
degree to the optical axis. We also used an intermediate secondary mask
(""Mask_2"") before a final image in order to block additional mask-edge
diffracted light. The test bench simulates the 8.1m Gemini North telescope. It
includes one spider vane, different mask radii (r= 1.9, 3.7, 7.4 lambda/D) and
two types of reflective focal plane masks (hard-edged ""Top Hat"" and ""Gaussian""
tapered profiles). In order to investigate the relative performance of these
competing coronagraphic designs with regard to extra-solar planet detection
sensitivity, we utilize the simulation of realistic extra-solar planet
populations (Nielson et al. 2006). With an appropriate translation of our
laboratory results to expected telescope performance, a ""Gaussian"" tapered mask
radius of 3.7 lambda/D with an additional mask (""Mask_2"") performs best
(highest planet detection sensitivity). For a full survey with this optimal
design, the simulation predicts ~30% more planets detected compared to a
similar sized ""Top Hat"" function mask with ""Mask_2."" Using the best design, the
point contrast ratio between the stellar PSF peak and the coronagraphic PSF at
10 lambda/D (0.4"" in H band if D = 8.1m) is ~10 times higher than a classical
Lyot ""Top Hat"" coronagraph. Hence, we find a Gaussian apodized mask with an
additional blocking mask is a superior (~10x higher contrast) than use of a
classical Lyot coronagraph for ExAO-like Strehls.

Faulkes Telescope South (FTS) began observing 137 s after the onset of the
gamma-ray emission, when the optical counterpart was already decaying from R
10.3 mag, and continued observing for the next 5.5 hours. These observations
begin during the final gamma-ray flare and continue through and beyond a long,
soft tail of gamma-ray emission whose flux shows an underlying simple power-law
decay identical to that seen at optical and X-ray wavelengths, with temporal
slope alpha 1.7 This remarkably simple decay in all of these bands is rare for
Swift bursts, which often show much more complex light curves. We suggest the
afterglow emission begins as early as 30-100 s and is contemporaneous with the
on-going variable prompt emission from the central engine, but originates from
a physically distinct region dominated by the forward shock. The afterglow
continues unabated until at least 10^5 s showing no evidence of a break. The
observed multiwavelength evolution of GRB 061007 is explained by an expanding
fireball whose optical, X-ray and late-time gamma-ray emission is dominated by
emission from a forward shock with typical synchrotron frequency, nu_m, that is
already below the optical band as early as t=137 s and a cooling frequency,
nu_c, above the X-ray band to at least t=10^5 s. In contrast, the typical
frequency of the reverse shock lies in the radio band at early time. We suggest
that the unexpected lack of bright optical flashes from the majority of Swift
GRBs may be explained with a low nu_m originating from small microphysics
parameters, epsilon_e and epsilon_B. (Abridged)

merger mass ratios, and viewing angles this merger fraction can be converted

may eventually lead to the formation of planets. It is not known when and where
grain growth occurs, as models that explain the observations are often
degenerate. A way to break this degeneracy is to resolve the sources under
study. AIMS - To find evidence for the existence of grains of millimetre sizes
in disks around in T Tauri stars, implying grain growth. METHODS - The
Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) was used to observe 15 southern T
Tauri stars, five in the constellation Lupus and ten in Chamaeleon, at 3.3
millimetre. The five Lupus sources were also observed with the Submillimeter
Array (SMA) at 1.4 millimetre. Our new data are complemented with data from the
literature to determine the slopes of the spectral energy distributions in the
millimetre regime. RESULTS - Ten sources were detected at better than 3sigma
with the ATCA, with sigma ~1-2 mJy, and all sources that were observed with the
SMA were detected at better than 15sigma, with sigma ~4 mJy. Six of the sources
in our sample are resolved to physical radii of ~100 AU. Assuming that the
emission from such large disks is predominantly optically thin, the millimetre
slope can be related directly to the opacity index. For the other sources, the
opacity indices are lower limits. Four out of six resolved sources have opacity
indices <~1, indicating grain growth to millimetre sizes and larger. The masses
of the disks range from < 0.01 to 0.08 MSun, which is comparable to the minimum
mass solar nebula. A tentative correlation is found between the millimetre
slope and the strength and shape of the 10-micron silicate feature, indicating
that grain growth occurs on similar (short) timescales in both the inner and
outer disk.

reveals a nested coupling structure of the Froehlich interaction. The theory is
non-perturbative and well adapted for strong electron-phonon coupling, such as
found in quantum dot (QD) structures. For those particular structures we
introduce a minimal model that allows the computation and qualitative
prediction of the spectrum and geometry of polarons. The model uses a generic

symmetry-related electronic degeneracies are studied in detail and are shown to
generate unentangled zero-shift polarons, which we consistently eliminate. As a
practical example, these developments are applied to realistic pyramidal GaAs

analyzed, and prove that realistic pyramidal QDs clearly fall in the regime of
strong coupling. Further investigation reveals an unexpected substructure of

the strong spectral weight appears at incommensurate positions, namely at q neq
Q =(pi,pi), for low energy, the incommensurate signals disperse with increasing
omega and finally merge into a commensurate signal at a particular energy
omega=omega_Q. These features are seen in both the d-wave pairing state and the
normal state. In particular, the incommensurate signals below omega_Q in the
normal state are due to the Fermi surface geometry, which we expect for
La-based cuprates because of a tendency to d-wave type Fermi surface
deformations. Above omega_Q, strong signals appear to trace an upward
dispersion especially for a low doping rate in the d-wave pairing state while
typically broad spectral weight is obtained around q=Q in the normal state.
Salient features of magnetic excitations in La-based cuprates are thus
naturally captured in terms of particle-hole excitations. Global understanding
of magnetic excitations in high-Tc cuprates is discussed through a comparison

Einstein, until 1980 when John Stachel (Talk on Einsteins Search for General
Covariance, 1912-1915 at the GRG meeting in Jena 1980) recognized its highly
non-trivial character. Since then the argument has been intensively discussed
by many physicists and philosophers of science. (See e.g., Earman & Norton

lower dimensional spacetime is a well known technique in field theory and
gravity. Recently, its use has been advocated in numerical relativity as an
efficient computational technique for the numerical study of axisymmetric
asymptotically flat 4-dimensional spacetimes. We prove here that if the
dimensionally reduced spacetime is a physically reasonable 3-dimensional
asymptotically flat or asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime, then,
surprisingly, the topology of the higher dimensional spacetime must be one of
two product topologies. Reductions of other topologies result in physically
pathological spacetimes. In particular, reduction of asymptotically flat
4-dimensional spacetimes must lead to pathologies. These results use only the
topological censorship theorem and topological methods and consequently are
independent of the field equations and reduction method.

SM family should exist and there are serious arguments disfavoring the fifth SM

boson production cross-section at hadron colliders and the Tevatron can
discover the Higgs boson before the LHC, if it mass is between 140 and 200 GeV.

tan(beta) approx.eq. 40 if there are three MSSM families; super-partner of the

solutions to the isotropic conductivity problem in the presence of adjacent
conductivity inclusions as the distance between the inclusions goes to zero and
their conductivities degenerate. This difficult question arises in the study of
composite media. Frequently in composites, the inclusions are very closely
spaced and may even touch. It is quite important from a practical point of view
to know whether the electric field (the gradient of the potential) can be
arbitrarily large as the inclusions get closer to each other or to the boundary
of the background medium.
  In this paper, we establish both upper and lower bounds on the electric field
in the case where two circular conductivity inclusions are very close but not
touching. We also obtain such bounds when a circular inclusion is very close to
the boundary of a circular domain which contains the inclusion. The novelty of
these estimates, which improve and make complete our earlier results published

factors (TFs) that bind directly to short segments of DNA in close proximity to
specific genes. These binding sites have a conserved nucleotide appearance,
which is called a motif. Several recent studies of transcriptional regulation
require the reduction of a large collection of motifs into clusters based on
the similarity of their nucleotide composition. We present a principled
approach to this clustering problem based upon a Bayesian hierarchical model
that accounts for both within- and between-motif variability. We use a
Dirichlet process prior distribution that allows the number of clusters to vary
and we also present a novel generalization that allows the core width of each
motif to vary. This clustering model is implemented, using a Gibbs sampling
strategy, on several collections of transcription factor motif matrices. Our
clusters provide a means by which to organize transcription factors based on
binding motif similarities, which can be used to reduce motif redundancy within
large databases such as JASPAR and TRANSFAC. Finally, our clustering procedure
has been used in combination with discovery of evolutionarily-conserved motifs
to predict co-regulated genes. An alternative to our Dirichlet process prior
distribution is explored but shows no substantive difference in the clustering
results for our datasets. Our Bayesian clustering model based on the Dirichlet
process has several advantages over traditional clustering methods that could
make our procedure appropriate and useful for many clustering applications.

turbulent boundary layers with the important example of the atmospheric
boundary layer with a stable temperature stratification in mind. Traditional
approaches to this problem, based on the profiles of mean quantities, velocity
second-order correlations, and dimensional estimates of the turbulent thermal
flux run into a well known difficulty, predicting the suppression of turbulence
at a small critical value of the Richardson number, in contradiction with
observations. Phenomenological attempts to overcome this problem suffer from
various theoretical inconsistencies. Here we present an approach taking into
full account all the second-order statistics, which allows us to respect the
conservation of total mechanical energy. The analysis culminates in an analytic
solution of the profiles of all mean quantities and all second-order
correlations removing the unphysical predictions of previous theories. We
propose that the approach taken here is sufficient to describe the lower parts
of the atmospheric boundary layer, as long as the Richardson number does not
exceed an order of unity. For much higher Richardson numbers the physics may
change qualitatively, requiring careful consideration of the potential
Kelvin-Helmoholtz waves and their interaction with the vortical turbulence.

that an unusual \emph{negative reflection} occurs at the interface of the
chiral medium and a perfectly conducting plane, where the incident wave and one
of reflected eigenwaves lie in the same side of the boundary normal. Using such
a property, we further demonstrate that such a conducting plane can be used for
focusing in the strong chiral medium. The related equations under paraxial
optics approximation are deduced. In a special case of chiral medium, the
chiral nihility, one of the bi-reflections disappears and only single reflected
eigenwave exists, which goes exactly opposite to the incident wave. Hence the
incident and reflected electric fields will cancel each other to yield a zero
total electric field. In another word, any electromagnetic waves entering the
chiral nihility with perfectly conducting plane will disappear.
