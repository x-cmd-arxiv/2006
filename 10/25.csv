spin of the accretor in an ultra-compact double white dwarf binary. This novel
synchronization mechanism relies on a nonlinear wave interaction spinning down
the background star. The essential physics of the synchronization mechanism is
summarized as follows. As the compact binary coalesces due to gravitational
wave emission, the largest star eventually fills its Roche lobe and accretion
starts. The accretor then spins up due to infalling material and eventually
reaches a spin frequency where a normal mode of the star is resonantly driven
by the gravitational tidal field of the companion. If the resonating mode
satisfies a set of specific criteria, which we elucidate in this paper, it
exchanges angular momentum with the background star at a rate such that the
spin of the accretor locks at this resonant frequency, even though accretion is
ongoing. Some of the accreted angular momentum that would otherwise spin up the
accretor is fed back into the orbit through this resonant tidal interaction.
  Two modes capable of stabilizing the accretor's spin are the l=4,m=2 and
l=5,m=3 CFS unstable hybrid r-modes, which stabilize the spin of the accretor
at frequency 2.6 and 1.5 times the binary's orbital frequency respectively.
Since the stabilization mechanism relies on continuously driving a mode at
resonance, its lifetime is limited since eventually the mode amplitude
saturates due to non-linear mode-mode coupling. Rough estimates of the lifetime
of the effect lie from a few orbits to millions of years.

more nebulous UV morphologies and that larger, more luminous galaxies may drive
stronger outflows, but otherwise conclude that UV morphology is either
statistically decoupled from the majority of physical observables or determined
by too complex a combination of physical processes to provide characterizations
with predictive power. Given the absence of strong correlations between UV
morphology and physical parameters such as star formation rates, we are
therefore unable to support the hypothesis that morphologically irregular
galaxies predominantly represent major galaxy mergers. Comparing galaxy
samples, we find that IR-selected BzK galaxies and radio-selected submillimeter

observations if the rebrightening is due to the jet, moving at 0.5c and
inclined ~ 0 - 40 degrees toward the observer, colliding with a density
discontinuity in the ISM at a radius of several 10^16 cm. We also find that a
jet with a higher velocity, >~ 0.7c, and larger inclination, >~ 70 degrees,

miss the details of rebrightening. The latter, uniform ISM model predicts an

suggests an independent test which might discriminate between the two. One of
the strongest constraints of both models is that the data seems to require a

distribution of gas is sufficiently non-uniform. We investigate the velocity
size-scale relation $\sigma \propto r^{\alpha}$ for simulations of clumpy and
fractal gas, and show that clumpy shocks can produce realistic velocity
size-scale relations with mean $\alpha \thicksim 0.5$. For a fractal
distribution, with a fractal dimension of 2.2 similar to what is observed in
the ISM, we find $\sigma \propto r^{0.4}$. The form of the velocity size-scale
relation can be understood as due to mass loading, i.e. the post-shock velocity
of the gas is determined by the amount of mass encountered as the gas enters
the shock. We support this hypothesis with analytical calculations of the

Vcirc/sigma_0=2(1-B/T), where B/T is the bulge-to-total light ratio. For pure

error bars; for dwarf systems, however, kinematical measurements at the galaxy
center and optical edge suggest Vcirc(Rmax) > 2*sigma_0 (in contrast with past

Our metallicity results in general agree with the ones based on spectroscopy of

moduli implied by the most reliable solutions, correlate with the reddening
values, as expected from the non-negligible three-dimensional distribution of
the clusters within the LMC. The inferred spatial distribution for these

formation of stars in each galaxy, at the epoch identified with the mean
mass-weighted stellar age, is accompanied by the prompt assembly of the nuclear
supermassive black hole (SMBH); (ii) the mass of the SMBH obeys the
M_bh-sigma_v correlation observed in nearby galaxies; (iii) the SMBH radiates

luminosity <log L_Q> at fixed sigma_v. These assumptions require that the SMBH

Lyman alpha systems (DLA; absorbers with log(NHI) >= 20.3 cm^-2). We find that
that f(N,X) of the SLLS can be reasonably described with a power-law of index
alpha = -1.43^{+0.15}_{-0.16} or alpha = -1.19^{+0.20}_{-0.21} depending on
whether we set the lower N(HI) bound for the analysis at 10^{19.0} cm^-2 or
10^{19.3}$ cm^-2, respectively. The results indicate a flattening in the slope
of f(N,X) between the SLLS and DLA. We find little evidence for redshift
evolution in the shape of f(N,X) for the SLLS over the redshift range of the
sample 1.68 < z < 4.47 and only tentative evidence for evolution in the zeroth
moment of f(N,X), the line density l_lls(X). We introduce the observable
distribution function O(N,X) and its moment, which elucidates comparisons of HI
absorbers from the Lyman-alpha through to the DLA. We find that a simple three
parameter function can fit O(N,X) over the range 17.0 <= log(NHI) <=22.0. We
use these results to predict that f(N,X) must show two additional inflections
below the SLLS regime to match the observed f(N,X) distribution of the
Lyman-alpha forest. Finally, we demonstrate that SLLS contribute a minor
fraction (~15%) of the universe's hydrogen atoms and, therefore, an even small
fraction of the mass in predominantly neutral gas.

  Journal","Astron.J.133:2584-2606,2007","10.1086/514337",,"astro-ph",,"  We have developed a new method for determining the corotation radii of
density waves in disk galaxies, which makes use of the radial distribution of
an azimuthal phase shift between the potential and density wave patterns. The
approach originated from improved theoretical understandings of the relation
between the morphology and kinematics of galaxies, and on the dynamical
interaction between density waves and the basic-state disk stars which results
in the secular evolution of disk galaxies. In this paper, we present the
rationales behind the method, and the first application of it to several
representative barred and grand-design spiral galaxies, using near-infrared
images to trace the mass distributions, as well as to calculate the potential
distributions used in the phase shift calculations. We compare our results with
those from other existing methods for locating the corotations, and show that
the new method both confirms the previously-established trends of bar-length
dependence on galaxy morphological types, as well as provides new insights into
the possible extent of bars in disk galaxies. Application of the method to a
larger sample and the preliminary analysis of which show that the phase shift
method is likely to be a generally-applicable, accurate, and essentially
model-independent method for determining the pattern speeds and corotation
radii of single or nested density wave patterns in galaxies. Other implications
of this work are: most of the nearby bright disk galaxies appear to possess
quasi-stationary spiral modes; that these density wave modes and the associated
basic state of the galactic disk slowly transform over time; and that
self-consistent N-particle systems contain physics not revealed by the passive
orbit analysis approaches.

self-gravitating, AU-sized gas clouds. The data also show that the ionised gas
is confined by ram pressure, with the clouds moving at hundreds of km/s
relative to the diffuse ISM and causing strong shocks. These conclusions are
supported by a quantitative model in which heat from the shocked ISM evaporates
gas from the surface of a cold cloud; this model readily explains the physical
conditions which are required for Extreme Scattering and yields passable
reproductions of the light-curves. The magnetotail of the cloud provides a site
in which two other ``anomalous'' radio-wave propagation phenomena -- IntraDay
Variability of quasars, and pulsar parabolic arcs -- can plausibly arise, thus
linking three anomalous propagation phenomena in a single physical model.
Locally there must be thousands of these neutral clouds per cubic parsec and by

The second is the observations of extremely metal poor stars. In this paper, we
present pre-supernova evolution models of massive rotating stars at very low Z
(Z=1e-8) and at Z=0. Rotation has a strong impact on mass loss and
nucleosynthesis. Models reaching break-up velocities lose up to ten percents of
their initial mass. In very low Z models, rotational and convective mixing
enhances significantly the surface content in carbon, nitrogen and oxygen (CNO)
when the star becomes a red supergiant. This induces a strong mass loss for
stars more massive than about 60 solar masses. Our models predict type Ib,c
supernovae and gamma-ray bursts at very low Z. Rotational mixing also induces a
large production of CNO elements, in particular of primary nitrogen. The
stellar wind chemical composition is compatible with the most metal-poor star
know to date, HE 1327-2326, for CNO elements. Our models reproduce the early
evolution of nitrogen in the Milky Way.

discuss the question whether the classical Eddington limit - which has been

approximation if applied locally in the disc. For this purpose, a critical
accretion rate corresponding to this type of modified classical Eddington limit
is calculated from thin alpha-disc models and slim disc models. We account for
the non-spherical symmetry of the disc models by computing the local upper
limits on the accretion rate from vertical and radial force equilibria
separately.
  It is shown that the results can differ considerably from the classical
(global) value: The vertical radiation force limits the maximum accretion rate
in the inner disc region to much less than the classical Eddington value in
thin alpha-discs, while it allows for significantly higher accretion rates in
slim discs. We discuss the implications of these results for the evolution of

Recent Spitzer observations have revealed CO2 ice in high abundances and it has
been suggested that CO2 mixed into H2O ice can affect relative strengths of the
3 um and 6 um bands. We used laboratory infrared transmission spectroscopy of
H2O:CO2 ice mixtures to investigate the effects of CO2 on H2O ice spectral
features at 15-135 K. We find that the H2O peak profiles and band strengths are
significantly different in H2O:CO2 ice mixtures compared to pure H2O ice. In
all H2O:CO2 mixtures, a strong free-OH stretching band appears around 2.73 um,
which can be used to put an upper limit on the CO2 concentration in the H2O
ice. The H2O bending mode profile also changes drastically with CO2
concentration; the broad pure H2O band gives way to two narrow bands as the CO2
concentration is increased. This makes it crucial to constrain the environment
of H2O ice to enable correct assignments of other species contributing to the
interstellar 6 um absorption band. The amount of CO2 present in the H2O ice of
B5:IRS1 is estimated by simultaneously comparing the H2O stretching and bending
regions and the CO2 bending mode to laboratory spectra of H2O, CO2, H2O:CO2 and
HCOOH.

to two distinct galaxy classes. This is evident in the colour-structure plane
which clearly shows that elliptical galaxies (bulge-only) lie in the red
compact peak and late-type spiral galaxies (disc-dominated) lie in the blue
diffuse peak. Early-type spirals (bulge plus disc systems) sprawl across both
peaks. However after bulge-disc decomposition the bulges of early-type spirals
lie exclusively in the red compact peak and their discs in the blue diffuse
peak (exceptions exist but are rare, e.g., dust reddened edge-on discs and blue
pseudo-bulges). Movement between these two peaks is not trivial because whilst
switching off star-formation can transform colours from blue to red, modifying
the orbits of ~1 billion stars from a planar diffuse structure to a triaxial
compact structure is problematic (essentially requiring an equal mass merger).
We propose that the most plausible explanation for the dual structure of
galaxies is that galaxy formation proceeds in two stages. First an initial
collapse phase (forming a centrally concentrated core and black hole), followed
by splashback, infall and accretion (forming a planar rotating disc). Dwarf
systems could perhaps follow the same scenario but the lack of low luminosity
bulge-disc systems would imply that the two components must rapidly blend to
form a single flattened spheroidal system.

above the value predicted by Big Bang nucleosynthesis. They cannot be explained
by galactic cosmic-ray interactions in the interstellar medium either. Various
pre-galactic sources of 6-Li have been proposed in the literature. We study the
possibility that the observed 6-Li was produced by repeated solar-like flares
on the main sequence of these low-metallicity stars. The time-dependent flaring
activity of these objects is estimated from the observed evolution of
rotation-induced activity in Pop I dwarf stars. As in solar flares, 6-Li could
be mainly created in interactions of flare-accelerated 3-He with stellar
atmospheric 4-He, via the reaction 4-He(3-He,p)6-Li. Stellar dilution and
destruction of flare-produced 6-Li are evaluated from the evolutionary models
of metal-poor stars developed by Richard and co-workers. Stellar depletion
should be less important for 6-Li atoms synthesized in flares than for those of
protostellar origin. Theoretical frequency distributions of 6-Li/7-Li ratios
are calculated using a Monte-Carlo method and compared with the observations.
Excellent agreement is found with the measured 6-Li/7-Li distribution, when
taking into account the contribution of protostellar 6-Li originating from
galactic cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis. We propose as an observational test of the
model to seek for a positive correlation between 6-Li/7-Li and stellar rotation
velocity. We also show that the amounts of 7-Li, Be and B produced in flares of
metal-poor halo stars are negligible as compared with the measured abundances
of these species. 6-Li in low-metallicity stars may be a unique evidence of the

CFHT. A weak but clear Stokes $V$ signature is detected on three of the four
nights of June 2006 during which we have recorded data. This polarimetric
signature indicates with no ambiguity the presence of a magnetic field at the
star's surface, with intensity of just a few Gauss.
  The analysis of the photospheric lines of $\tau$ Boo at ultra-high
signal-to-noise reveals the presence of an 18% relative differential rotation.
Tentative Zeeman-Doppler imaging, using our spectropolarimetric observations
covering only a fraction of the star's rotational phase, indicates a magnetic
field with a dominant potential field component. The data are best fitted when
a 3.1d period of modulation and an intermediate inclination are assumed.
Considering the level of differential rotation of $\tau$ Boo, this implies a
rotation period of 3.0d at the equator and of 3.7d at the pole, and a topology
of the magnetic field where its main non-axisymmetric part is located at low
latitudes.
  The planet is probably synchronised with the star's rotation at intermediate
latitudes, while the non-axisymmetric part of the magnetic field seems located
at lower latitudes. Our limited data do not provide sufficient constraints on
the magnetic field to study a possible interaction of the planet with the
star's magnetosphere. Investigating this issue will require data with much
better phase coverage. Similar studies should also be performed for other stars
hosting close-in giant planets.

Moreover, the evolution of the 180o stripe domains in the BaTiO3 systems, when

Region I for which the magnitude of the down dipoles (i.e., those that are

in a bulk perovskite structure, via deposition on Pt(111)//Al2O3 (0001) and

polarization hysteresis loop demonstrated the existence of ferroelectricity in
our hexagonal DyMnO3 films at least below 70 K. The observed 2.2 uC/cm^2
remnant polarization at 25 K corresponded to a polarization enhancement by a
factor of 10 compared to that of the bulk orthorhombic DyMnO3. Interestingly,
this system showed an antiferroelectric-like feature in its hysteresis loop.
Our hexagonal DyMnO3 films showed an antiferromagnetic Neel temperature around
60 K and a spin reorientation transition around 40 K. We also found a clear
hysteresis in the temperature dependence of the magnetization, which was
measured after zero-field-cooling and field-cooling. This hysteresis may well
have been of spin glass origin, which was likely to arise from the geometric
frustration of antiferromagnetically-coupled Mn spins with an edge-sharing
triangular lattice.

  vibrational insight in (Zn,Be)Se by Raman scattering and first-principles
  calculations","revised version on 16 pages; 7 unchanged figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  The recent finding of a 1-bond->2-phonon `percolation'-type behaviour in
several random zincblende alloys, supporting an unsuspected 1-bond->2-mode
behaviour in the bond length distribution, renews interest for a discussion of
CuPt-type spontaneous ordering (CPSO) as a purely intrinsic effect. We
investigate this key issue from both experimental (Raman scattering) and
theoretical (first-principles bond length and phonon calculations) sides,
focusing on Zn[1-x]Be[x]Se (0<x=0.92). Its large contrast in cation-anion bond
lengths should stimulate CPSO to some extent, and is at the origin of a
uniquely well-resolved 1-bond->2-phonon behaviour for the Be-Se species. Based
on percolation, CPSO finds a previously missing natural explanation, at the
mesosocopic scale. Also, the transfer of oscillator strength from the high- to
the low-frequency Be-Se mode in the Raman spectra potentially emerges as a
sensitive probe of CPSO in ZnBeSe. First-principles calculations indicate that
the transfer is completed for the value of the long range order parameter of
eta~0.5 in ZnBeSe2 (x~0.5), corresponding to a pure 1-bond->1-mode behaviour.
With further ordering the alloy is forced to re-adopt a non-rewarding
1-bond->2-mode behaviour, due to the formation of ZnSe/BeSe micro-domains in
the crystal. Therefore eta~0.5 appears as an intrinsic limit to CPSO in
ZnBeSe2, and possibly in stoichiometric alloys in general.

numerically examined for the number of channels ranging from a few to close to

modulation ratio, defined as the ratio between the maximum and minimum

affected by large resonance peaks that arise from the electron confinement

investigate the number of ways to arrange dimers on $m \times n$
two-dimensional rectangular lattice strips with fixed dimer density $\rho$. For
any dimer density $0 < \rho < 1$, we find a logarithmic correction term in the
finite-size correction of the free energy per lattice site. The coefficient of
the logarithmic correction term is exactly -1/2. This logarithmic correction
term is explained by the newly developed asymptotic theory of Pemantle and
Wilson. The sequence of the free energy of lattice strips with cylinder
boundary condition converges so fast that very accurate free energy $f_2(\rho)$
for large lattices can be obtained. For example, for a half-filled lattice,
$f_2(1/2) = 0.633195588930$, while $f_2(1/4) = 0.4413453753046$ and $f_2(3/4) =

0.662798972834$ at $\rho^* = 0.6381231$, with 11 correct digits. This is also
the \md constant for two-dimensional rectangular lattices. The asymptotic
expressions of free energy near close packing are investigated for finite and
infinite lattice widths. For lattices with finite width, dependence on the

-- all the source symbols are known in advance at the encoders. This paper
instead considers a streaming setting in which iid source symbol pairs are
revealed to the separate encoders in real time and need to be reconstructed at
the decoder with some tolerable end-to-end delay using finite rate noiseless
channels. A sequential random binning argument is used to derive a lower bound
on the error exponent with delay and show that both ML decoding and universal
decoding achieve the same positive error exponents inside the traditional
Slepian-Wolf rate region. The error events are different from the block-coding
error events and give rise to slightly different exponents. Because the
sequential random binning scheme is also universal over delays, the resulting
code eventually reconstructs every source symbol correctly with probability 1.

function of variable-length block codes over discrete memoryless channels with

Yamamoto and Itoh via a particularly simple and instructive scheme. Their idea
is to alternate between a communication and a confirmation phase until the
receiver detects the codeword used by the sender to acknowledge that the
message is correct. We provide a converse that parallels the Yamamoto-Itoh
achievability construction. Besides being simpler than the original, the
proposed converse suggests that a communication and a confirmation phase are
implicit in any scheme for which the probability of error decreases with the
largest possible exponent. The proposed converse also makes it intuitively
clear why the terms that appear in Burnashev's exponent are necessary.

Gauss-Bonnet term. For an anti-de Sitter bulk, the five-dimensional
perturbation equations share the same form as in the Randall-Sundrum model,
which allows us to obtain metric perturbations in terms of a master variable.
We derive the boundary conditions for the master variable from the generalized
junction conditions on the brane. We then investigate several limiting cases in
which the junction equations are reduced to a feasible level. In the low energy
limit, we confirm that the standard result of four-dimensional Einstein gravity
is reproduced on large scales, whereas on small scales we find that the
perturbation dynamics is described by the four-dimensional Brans-Dicke theory.
In the high energy limit, all the non-local contributions drop off from the
junction equations, leaving a closed system of equations on the brane. We show
that, for inflation models driven by a scalar field on the brane, the
Sasaki-Mukhanov equation holds on the high energy brane in its original
four-dimensional form.

In this paper, it is shown that the a-function has always a unique critical

a-function is given by the volume of a three dimensional polytope called

classical Lie algebra (for example the algebra of matrices of the zero trace)
then leads to parametrizing the variety. The problem of finding an isomorphism

The last is a classical problem in number theory, when regarded over
algebraically non-closed fields. We give algorithms for trivializing algebras

Examples, including the well-known Stenzel metrics, are discussed. Next, we
present a simplification of the Einstein condition on a compact four manifold
with $T^{2}$-isometry to a system of second-order elliptic equations in
two-variables with well-defined boundary conditions. We then study the Einstein

the classical K41 phenomenology, here, the leading contribution to the

linear behavior in time for a typical velocity fluctuation in the time interval
$t$. The contribution to the Lagrangian velocity fluctuations of local eddies
(i.e. with a characteristic time of order $t$), whose space/time scalings are
ruled by the Bolgiano--Obukhov theory, is thus not detectable by standard

in collisionless ion-electron-neutrals plasma contradicts to the law of energy
conservation of a wave damping/growing in space. There is also no criterion of
a choice either damping or growing solution in difference from always
non-damping in the direction of propagation Vlasov waves. Variety of other
incongruities as consequence of Landau damping is specified also. Absence of
explicit positivity and finiteness of wave solutions for electron distribution
function near singularity point leads to need of imposing additional cutting
off constraints with resulting positivity and finiteness of the electron
distribution function at the singularity points and finiteness of the complex
dispersion integral. Landau damping as a real physical phenomenon of
collisionless damping does not exist. A relation is established for the real
dispersion equation with real waves (see Appendices 2,4) between the averaged
over period wave damping decrement and the collisional energy-exchange term of
kinetic equation. Collisionless Vlasov-Landau damping is explained finally by
the usual wrong use of nonlinearly complex wave functions leading to complex
dispersion equation. All used solution of the complex dispersion equation for
the simultaneously existing collisionless both exponentially damping and
growing nonlinear complex waves is entirely, quantitatively and in its logical
sense, different from the solution of initially real dispersion equation for
real either damping or growing waves and should be discarded (see Appendices
2,4,5,6). Collisionless damping is caused by unreasonable use of wave functions
with complex frequency or complex wave number leading to complex dispersion

Stability is analyzed by discretizing the system and diagonalizing the second
derivative of the potential energy. The structure is found to be stable when
the pressure in the wall is greater than a critical pressure. When membranes
are non-elastic, the critical pressure is found to be greater than the pressure
required for equilibrium by a factor of 4/3. When membranes have only finite
stiffness, a first order correction to the critical pressure is found.
Preliminary experimental data shows that a stable structure can be made in this

also found that such structures can be designed to have net positive buoyancy

extraordinary sociality and cooperation. Laboratory experiments on social
dilemma games and many field studies have quantified well-defined levels of
cooperation and propensity to punish/reward. The level of cooperation is
observed to be strongly dependent on the availability of punishments and/or
rewards. Here, we suggest that the propensity for altruistic punishment and
reward is an emergent property that has co-evolved with cooperation by
providing an efficient feedback mechanism through both biological and cultural
interactions. By favoring high survival probability and large individual gains,
the propensity for altruistic punishment and rewards reconciles self- and group
interests. We show that a simple cost/benefit analysis at the level of a single
agent, who anticipates the action of her fellows, determines an optimal level
of altruistic punishment, which explains quantitatively experimental results on
the third-party punishment game, the ultimatum game and altruistic punishment
games. We also report numerical simulations of an evolutionary agent-based
model of repeated agent interactions with feedback-by-punishments, which
confirms that the propensity to punish is a robust emergent property selected
by the evolutionary rules of the model.

impinging on a metal nano-layer have been analysed. The thickness of the layer
was assumed to be of order of 2-10 nm, and the metallic free electrons were
represented by a surface current density distributed at the plane boundary of a
dielectric substrate. The target studied this way can be imagined, for
instance, as a semi-transparent mirror produced by evapotating a thin aluminum
layer on the surface of a glass plate. The exact analytic solution has been
given for the system of the coupled Maxwell-Lorentz equations decribing the
dynamics of the surface current and the scattered radiation fields. It has been
shown that in general a non-oscillatoty frozen-in wake-field appears following
the main pulse with an exponential decay and with a definite sign of the
electric field. The characteristic time of these wake-fields is inversely
proportional with the square of the plasma frequency and with the thickness of
the metal nano-layer, and can be larger than the original pulse duration. The
magnitude of these wake-fields is proportional with the incoming field
strength, and the definite sign of them governed by the cosine of the
carrier-envelope phase difference of the incoming ultrashort laser pulse. As a
consequence, when we let such a wake-field excite the electrons of a secondary
target (say an electron beam, a metal plate or a gas jet), we obtain 100
percent modulation in the electron signal in a given direction, as we vary the
carrier-envelope phase difference. This scheeme can perhaps serve as a basis
for the construction of a robust linear carrier-envelope phase difference
meter.

a role in carcinogenesis. We discuss a genome-wide approach based on graph
theory and Gene Ontology vocabulary for the functional characterization of
common fragile sites and for the identification of genes that contribute to
tumour cell biology. CFS were assembled in a network based on a simple measure
of correlation among common fragile site patterns of expression. By applying
robust measurements to capture in quantitative terms the non triviality of the
network, we identified several topological features clearly indicating
departure from the Erdos-Renyi random graph model. The most important outcome
was the presence of an unexpected large connected component far below the
percolation threshold. Most of the best characterized common fragile sites
belonged to this connected component. By filtering this connected component
with Gene Ontology, statistically significant shared functional features were
detected. Common fragile sites were found to be enriched for genes associated
to the immune response and to mechanisms involved in tumour progression such as
extracellular space remodeling and angiogenesis. Our results support the
hypothesis that fragile sites serve a function; we propose that fragility is
linked to a coordinated regulation of fragile genes expression.

hybrid system is a compound of a classical magnetic particle and a quantum
single spin. Two cases are considered. In the first case, we investigate the
effect of the dissipative quantum subsystem on the motion of its classical
partner. Whereas in the second case we show how the dynamics of the quantum
single spin are affected by the dissipation of the classical particle.
Extension to general dissipative hybrid systems is discussed.

Phys. A 39, 14997 (2006)","10.1088/0305-4470/39/48/011",,"quant-ph cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  We study the quantum-mechanical transport on two-dimensional graphs by means
of continuous-time quantum walks and analyse the effect of different boundary
conditions (BCs). For periodic BCs in both directions, i.e., for tori, the
problem can be treated in a large measure analytically. Some of these results
carry over to graphs which obey open boundary conditions (OBCs), such as
cylinders or rectangles. Under OBCs the long time transition probabilities
(LPs) also display asymmetries for certain graphs, as a function of their
particular sizes. Interestingly, these effects do not show up in the marginal
distributions, obtained by summing the LPs along one direction.

superradiant instabilities. We experimentally study the sudden build-up of a
reverse light field in a laser-driven high-finesse ring cavity filled with
ultracold thermal or condensed atoms. While superradiant Rayleigh scattering
from atomic clouds is normally only observed at very low temperatures (i.e.
well below $1 \mu$K), the presence of the ring cavity enhances cooperativity
and allows for superradiance with thermal clouds as hot as several $10 \mu$K. A
characterization of the superradiance at various temperatures and cooperativity
parameters allows us to link it to the collective atomic recoil laser.

  Collapse","9 pages; Latex; more calculations and comments added","Int. J. Quant. Inf. 5 (2007) 279",,,"quant-ph",,"  Information-theoretical restrictions on the information transfer in quantum
measurements are studied. They are derived for the measurement of system S by
detector D, registrated and processed by information system O. The formalism of
inference maps in Hilbert space is used for it; it permit to calculate O
restricted state which contains available for O information on S parameters.
It's shown that the principal information losses, inevitable in this formalism
and induced by Heisenberg commutation relations, stipulate the stochasticity of
measurement outcomes, registrated by O in the individual events.
