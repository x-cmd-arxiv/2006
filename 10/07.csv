imaging instruments. Assuming this to be true offers a simple geometric
explanation for several current puzzles in coronal physics, including: the
apparent uniform cross-section of bright threadlike structures in the corona;
the low EUV contrast (long apparent scale height) between the top and bottom of
active region loops; and the inconsistency between loop densities derived by
spectral and photometric means. Treating coronal loops as a mixture of diffuse
background and very dense, unresolved filamentary structures address these
problems with a combination of high plasma density within the structures, which
greatly increases the emissivity of the structures, and geometric effects that
attenuate the apparent brightness of the feature at low altitudes. It also
suggests a possible explanation for both the surprisingly high contrast of EUV
coronal loops against the coronal background, and the uniform ``typical''
height of the bright portion of the corona (about 0.3 solar radii) in full-disk
EUV images. Some ramifications of this picture are discussed, including an
estimate (10-100 km) of the fundamental scale of strong heating events in the
corona.

  It is shown that the standard adaptive-optics atmospheric time constant is

``counts'' optically thick clumps is quantified using the formalism of
\citet{Martin84} for line emission in a clumpy cloud. Adopting the simplifying
assumptions of thermalized $\COone$ line emission and isothermal gas, an
effective optical depth, $\tef$, is defined as the product of the clump filling
factor within each velocity interval and the clump effective optical depth as a
function of the optical depth on the clump's central sightline, $\tau_0$. The
clump effective optical depth is well approximated as a power law in $\tau_0$
with power-law index, $\epsilon$, referred to here as the clump ``fluffiness,''
and has values between zero and unity. While the $\COone$ line is optically
thick within each clump (i.e., high $\tau_0$), it is optically thin ``to the
clumps'' (i.e., low $\tef$). Thus the dependence of $I(CO)$ on $\tef$ is
linear, resulting in an X-factor that depends only on clump properties and {\it
not} directly on the entire cloud. Assuming virialization of the clumps yields
an expression for the X-factor whose dependence on physical parameters like
density and temperature is ``softened'' by power-law indices of less than unity
that depend on the fluffiness parameter, $\epsilon$. The X-factor provides
estimates of gas column density because each sightline within the beam has
optically thin gas within certain narrow velocity ranges. Determining column
density from the optically thin gas is straightforward and parameters like
$\epsilon$ then allow extrapolation of the column density of the optically thin
gas to that of all the gas.

between coronal streamers and features on the solar disk remains unresolved. An
empirical three-dimensional model, which reproduces the evolution of the
large-scale coronal structure starting from the solar surface, is presented.
The model is based on the view that the source of the large-scale coronal
structure, namely streamers, is a consequence of the evolution of twisted
sheet-like structures originating from prominences (or, equivalently,
filaments) at the base of the corona. The high-density sheets evolve and merge
with height into a final radial configuration constrained by the oberved
position of streamers stalks higher up in the corona. The observational
constraints are provided by white light observations from the LASCO/C2 data
during the declining phase of solar activity, spanning the end of Carrington
Rotation (CR) 2005 and the start of CR 2006, i.e. July-August 2003, and the
position of filaments from the corresponding H$\alpha$ synoptic maps of the
Paris-Meudon Observatory. The 3D model thus derived yields a reasonable
agreement with the observed large-scale coronal structure, in particular the
shape of large helmet streamers. These results give confidence in the
underlying assumption that large helmet streamers can be the result of the
convergence of two or more sheet-like structures originating from a
distribution of prominences on the solar disk. The model supports the view that
streamers, during that time of the solar cycle, are often associated with
multiple current sheets.

also its time variation, known as torsional oscillations. So far there is no
generally accepted theoretical explanation for torsional oscillations, even
though a close relation to the solar activity cycle is evident. On the
theoretical side non-kinematic dynamo models (including the Lorentz force
feedback on differential rotation) have been used to explain torsional
oscillations. In this paper we use a slightly different approach by forcing
torsional oscillations in a mean field differential rotation model. Our aim is
not a fully self-consistent model but rather to point out a few general
properties of torsional oscillations and their possible origin that are
independent from a particular dynamo model. We find that the poleward
propagating high latitude branch of the torsional oscillations can be explained
as a response of the coupled differential rotation / meridional flow system to
periodic forcing in mid-latitudes, of either mechanical (Lorentz force) or
thermal nature. The speed of the poleward propagation sets constraints on the
value of the turbulent viscosity in the solar convection zone to be less than
3x10^8 m^2/s. We also show that the equatorward propagating low latitude branch
is very unlikely a consequence of mechanical forcing (Lorentz force) alone, but
rather of thermal origin due to the Taylor-Proudman theorem.

then allowed to relax into a new mechanically stable state. Three distinct
protocols for imposing disorder are compared. A quantitative measure of the
disorder is obtained from distributions of the coordination number and
three-particle contact angle. The distribution of normal contact forces show
dramatic qualitative changes with increasing disorder. In the regime where the
disorder is relatively weak, the pressure and the lowest normal mode frequency
scale approximately linearly in the coordination number, with distance from the
crystalline state. These results for P(f) are discussed in the context of

behaved discrete theories. We work out several finite dimensional examples that
exhibit behaviors expected to be of importance in the quantization of gravity.
We also work out the case of BF theory. At the time of quantization, one can
take two points of view. The technique can be used to define, upon taking the
continuum limit, the space of physical states of the continuum constrained
theory of interest. In particular we show in models that it agrees with the
group averaging procedure when the latter exists. The technique can also be
used to compute, at the discrete level, conditional probabilities and the
introduction of a relational time. Upon taking the continuum limit one can show
that one reproduces results obtained by the use of evolving constants, and
therefore recover all physical predictions of the continuum theory. This second
point of view can also be used as a paradigm to deal with cases where the
continuum limit does not exist. There one would have discrete theories that at
least at certain scales reproduce the semiclassical properties of the theory of
interest. In this way the approach can be viewed as a generalization of the
Dirac quantization procedure that can handle situations where the latter fails.

  23-27, 2006","PoSLAT2006:025,2006",,,"hep-lat",,"  Monte Carlo studies of pure glue SU(3) gauge theory using the overlap-based
topological charge operator have revealed a laminar structure in the QCD vacuum
consisting of extended, thin, coherent, locally 3-dimensional sheets of
topological charge embedded in 4D space, with opposite sign sheets interleaved.
Studies of localization properties of Dirac eigenmodes have also shown evidence
for the delocalization of low-lying modes on effectively 3-dimensional
surfaces. In this talk, I review some theoretical ideas which suggest the
possibility of 3-dimensionally coherent topological charge structure in
4-dimensional gauge theory and provide a possible interpretation of the
observed structure. I begin with Luscher's ``Wilson bag'' integral over the
3-index Chern-Simons tensor. The analogy with a Wilson loop as a charged world
line in 2-dimensional $CP^{N-1}$ sigma models suggests that the Wilson bag
surface represents the world volume of a physical membrane. The large-N chiral
Lagrangian arguments of Witten also indicate the existence of multiple
``k-vacuum'' states with discontinuous transitions between k-vacua at $\theta=$
odd multiples of $\pi$. The domain walls between these vacua have the
properties of a Wilson bag surface. Finally, I review the AdS/CFT duality view
of $\theta$ dependence in QCD. The dual realtionship between topological charge
in gauge theory and Ramond-Ramond charge in type IIA string theory suggests
that the coherent topological charge sheets observed on the lattice are the
holographic image of wrapped D6 branes.

exist irreducible unitary representations of these groups -- so-called
``special representations'' -- for which the first cohomology of the group with
coefficients in these representations is nontrivial. By technical reasons, it
is more convenient to consider the groups O(n,1) and U(n,1). Most part of the
paper is devoted to the group U(n,1). The main emphasis is on the so-called
commutative models of special and complementary series representations: in
these models, the maximal unipotent subgroup is represented by multiplicators
in the case of O(n,1), and by the canonical model of the Heisenberg
representations in the case of U(n,1). Earlier, these models were studied only
for the group $SL(2,\RR)$. They are especially important for realization of
nonlocal representations of current groups, which will be considered elsewhere.

study of SO(n,1): their restrictions to the maximal parabolic subgroup $ {{P}}

irreducible representation of ${{P}}$ to a representation of SO(n,1), we must
additionally define only one involution. For the group U(n,1), the situation is

migration-proliferation dichotomy in the spreading of tumor cells. By using a
continuous time random walk (CTRW) we formulate a system of the balance
equations for the cancer cells of two phenotypes with random switching between
cell proliferation and migration. The transport process is formulated in terms
of the CTRW with an arbitrary waiting time distribution law. Proliferation is
modeled by a standard logistic growth. We apply hyperbolic scaling and
Hamilton-Jacobi formalism to determine the overall rate of tumor cell invasion.
In particular, we take into account both normal diffusion and anomalous
transport (subdiffusion) in order to show that the standard diffusion
approximation for migration leads to overestimation of the overall cancer
spreading rate.

Accepted for publication in PRL","Physical Review Letters 98, 060502 (2007)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.060502",,"quant-ph",,"  Long-distance quantum communication via distant pairs of entangled quantum
bits (qubits) is the first step towards more secure message transmission and
distributed quantum computing. To date, the most promising proposals require
quantum repeaters to mitigate the exponential decrease in communication rate
due to optical fiber losses. However, these are exquisitely sensitive to the
lifetimes of their memory elements. We propose a multiplexing of quantum nodes
that should enable the construction of quantum networks that are largely
insensitive to the coherence times of the quantum memory elements.

schemes, within the constraints present in a superconducting charge qubit
system. Both schemes use a continuous measurement of charge (z) measurements,
and seek to minimize the time required to purify the conditional state. Our
methods are designed to make the purification process relatively insensitive to
rotations about the x-axis, due to the Josephson tunnelling Hamiltonian. The
first proposed method, based on the scheme of Jacobs [Phys. Rev. A 67,
030301(R) (2003)] uses the measurement results to control bias (z) pulses so as
to rotate the Bloch vector onto the x-axis of the Bloch sphere. The second
proposed method, based on the scheme of Wiseman and Ralph [New J. Phys. 8, 90
(2006)] uses a simple feedback protocol which tightly rotates the Bloch vector
about an axis almost parallel with the measurement axis. We compare the
performance of these and other techniques by a number of different measures.

calculation demonstrates that the engineered superposition retains coherence
for large times when the mean photon number of the prepared mode is on the
order of unity.

the halting machine, which is assumed from quantum theory, leads into a
contradiction when we consider the case when the observer's reference frame is
the system that is to be evolved in both pictures. We then show that in order
to include the evolution of observer's reference frame in a physically sensible
way, the Heisenberg picture with time going backwards yields a correct
description.

theorem and weak converse for this class of channels. The main techniques that
we employ, are a quantum version of Feinstein's Fundamental Lemma and a
