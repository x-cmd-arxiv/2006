the aim of determining the characteristic scales of galaxy clustering. Up to 20
h^{-1} Mpc (H_0 = 65 km s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}), the distribution of galaxies is
described by a power-law density-distance dependence, \Gamma*(r) proportional
to r^{-\gamma}, with an index \gamma approximately 1.0. A change in the state
of clustering (a significant deviation from the power law) was found on a scale
of 20-25 h^{-1}Mpc. The distribution of SDSS galaxies becomes homogeneous
(\gamma approximately 0) from a scale of ~60 h^{-1}Mpc. The dependence of
\gamma on the luminosity of galaxies in volume-limited samples was obtained.
The power-law index \gamma increases with decreasing absolute magnitude of
sample galaxies M_abs. At M_abs ~ -21.4, which corresponds to the
characteristic value Mr* of the SDSS luminosity function, this dependence
exhibits a break followed by a more rapid increase in \gamma.

important for the structure of giant planets: it determines the growth rate of
the solid core that may be present as well as their final enrichment in solids.
We use the RODEO hydrodynamics solver to solve the flow equations for the gas,
together with a particle approach for the dust. The solver for the particles'
equations of motion is implicit with respect to the drag force, which allows us
to treat the whole dust size spectrum. We find that dust accretion is limited
to the smallest particle sizes. The largest particles get trapped in outer
mean-motion resonances with the planet, while particles of intermediate size
are pushed away from the orbit of the planet by the density structure in the
gas disk. Only particles smaller than approximately s_max =10 micron may
accrete on a planet with the mass of Jupiter. For a ten times less massive
planet s_max=100 micron. The strongly reduced accretion of dust makes it very
hard to enrich a newly formed giant planet in solids.

only one, designated as CXOU J180351.4-213707, is significantly extended. The
source is about 40"" away from the radio pulsar PSR J1803-2137, which was the
target of the Chandra observation but was not detected in X-rays. A natural
question is whether the two sources are physically related. While it is
conceivable that CXOU J180351.4-213707 could be associated with a previously
unknown supernova remnant (SNR), in which the pulsar was born, it seems equally
plausible that it might be a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) that is powered by a
different pulsar whose emission is beamed away from us. In either case, we
argue that CXOU J180351.4-213707 is likely the X-ray counterpart of HESS
J1804-216, based on the fact that the Galactic TeV gamma-ray sources are
predominantly SNRs or PWNe. The X-ray spectrum of the source can be fitted well
with a power law, although the model is not well constrained due to large
statistical uncertainties. The spectrum seems to be very hard, with the
best-fit photon index about 1.2. Under the assumption that CXOU

observed luminosity dependence of the galaxy two-point correlation function
results in average mass-to-light ratios that are about 35 percent lower than in
a LCDM cosmology with Omega_m=0.3 and sigma_8=0.9 (hereafter WMAP1 cosmology).
This removes an important problem with previous halo occupation models which
had a tendency to predict cluster mass-to-light ratios that were too high. For
the WMAP3 cosmology our model yields average mass-to-light ratios, central
galaxy luminosities, halo occupation numbers, satellite fractions, and
luminosity-gap statistics, that are all in excellent agreement with those
obtained from a 2dFGRS group catalogue and from other independent studies. We
also use our CLF model to compute the probability distribution P(M|L_cen), that
a central galaxy of luminosity L_cen resides in a halo of mass M. We find this
distribution to be much broader than what is typically assumed in HOD models,
which has important implications for the interpretation of galaxy-galaxy
lensing data. Finally, reproducing the luminosity dependence of the pairwise
velocity dispersions in the 2dFGRS requires relatively low mass-to-light ratios
for clusters and a satellite fraction that decreases strongly with increasing
luminosity. This is only marginally consistent with our CLF constraints. We
argue that a cosmology with parameters between those of the WMAP1 and WMAP3
cosmologies is likely to yield results with a higher level of consistency.

Uncertainties in the observations are emphasized. We suggest there is a
distinct possibility that cluster IMFs vary systematically with density or
pressure. Dense clusters could have additional formation processes for massive
stars that are not present in low density regions, making the slope of the
upper mass IMF somewhat shallower in clusters. Observations of shallow IMFs in
some super star clusters and in elliptical galaxies are reviewed. We also
review mass segregation and the likelihood that peculiar IMFs, as in the Arches
cluster, result from segregation and stripping, rather than an intrinsically
different IMF. The theory of the IMF is reviewed in some detail. Several
problems introduced by the lack of a magnetic field in SPH simulations are
discussed. The universality of the IMF in simulations suggests that something
more fundamental than the physical details of a particular model is at work.
Hierarchical fragmentation by any of a variety of processes may be the dominant
cause of the power law slope. Physical differences from region to region may
make a slight difference in the slope and also appear in the low-mass turnover
point.

presented for all 75 galaxies in the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey

sample's spectral variations stem from two underlying components, one
representative of a galaxy with a low infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio and one
representative of a galaxy with a high infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio. The
influence of several parameters on the infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio is studied
(e.g., optical morphology, disk inclination, far-infrared color, ultraviolet
spectral slope, and star formation history). Consistent with our understanding
of normal star-forming galaxies, the SINGS sample of galaxies in comparison to
more actively star-forming galaxies exhibits a larger dispersion in the
infrared-to-ultraviolet versus ultraviolet spectral slope correlation. Early
type galaxies, exhibiting low star formation rates and high optical surface
brightnesses, have the most discrepant infrared-to-ultraviolet correlation.
These results suggest that the star formation history may be the dominant
regulator of the broadband spectral variations between galaxies. Finally, a new
discovery shows that the 24 micron morphology can be a useful tool for
parametrizing the global dust temperature and ultraviolet extinction in nearby
galaxies. The dust emission in dwarf/irregular galaxies is clumpy and warm
accompanied by low ultraviolet extinction, while in spiral galaxies there is
typically a much larger diffuse component of cooler dust and average
ultraviolet extinction. For galaxies with nuclear 24 micron emission, the dust
temperature and ultraviolet extinction are relatively high compared to disk
galaxies.

neutral helium (He I), plus the nS--1S and nD--1S two-photon transitions for H
(up to n=40) and among singlet states of He I (n<=10 and l<=7). The potential
importance of such transitions was first proposed by Dubrovich & Grachev (2005)
using an effective three-level atom model. Here, we relax the thermal
equilibrium assumption among the higher excited states to investigate the
effect of these extra forbidden transitions on the ionization fraction x_e and
the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) angular power spectrum C_l. The
spin-forbidden transition brings more than a percent change in x_e. The
two-photon transitions may also give non-negligible effects, but currently
accurate rates exist only for n<=3. We find that changes in both x_e and C_l
would be at about the percent level with the approximate rates given by
Dubrovich & Grachev (2005). However, the two-photon rates from 3S to 1S and 3D
to 1S of H appear to have been overestimated, and our best numerical
calculation puts the effect on x_e and C_l at below the percent level.
Nevertheless, we do not claim that we have the definite answer, since several
issues remain open; sub-percent level computation of the C_ls requires improved
calculations of atomic transition rates as well as increasingly complex
multi-level atom calculations.

(2002)), which no longer appear unusual in images averaged over 1--2-h time
intervals. Such structures appear as families of light and dark concentric
rings or families of light and dark parallel strips (``ridges'' and
``trenches'' in the brightness distributions). In some cases, rings are
combined with radial ``spokes'' and can thus form ``web'' patterns. The
characteristic width of a ridge or trench is somewhat larger than the typical
size of granules. Running-average movies constructed from the series of images
are used to seek such structures. An algorithm is developed to obtain, for
automatically selected centres, the radial distributions of the azimuthally
averaged intensity, which highlight the concentric-ring patterns. We also
present a time-averaged granulation image processed with a software package
intended for the detection of geological structures in aerospace images. A
technique of running-average-based correlations between the brightness
variations at various points of the granular field is developed and indications
are found for a dynamical link between the emergence and sinking of hot and
cool parcels of the solar plasma. In particular, such a correlation analysis
confirms our suggestion that granules -- overheated blobs -- may repeatedly
emerge on the solar surface. Based on our study, the critical remarks by Rast
(2002) on the original paper by Getling and Brandt (2002) can be dismissed.

properties through decoherence when their wavelengths become larger than the
Hubble scale. Although decoherence is effective, it is not complete, so a
significant part of primordial correlations remains up to the present moment.
We address the issue of the pointer states which provide a classical basis for
the fluctuations with respect to the influence by an environment (other
fields). Applying methods from the quantum theory of open systems (the Lindblad
equation), we show that this basis is given by narrow Gaussians that
approximate eigenstates of field amplitudes. We calculate both the von Neumann
and linear entropy of the fluctuations. Their ratio to the maximal entropy per
field mode defines a degree of partial decoherence in the entropy sense. We
also determine the time of partial decoherence making the Wigner function
positive everywhere which, for super-Hubble modes during inflation, is
virtually independent of coupling to the environment and is only slightly
larger than the Hubble time. On the other hand, assuming a representative
environment (a photon bath), the decoherence time for sub-Hubble modes is
finite only if some real dissipation exists.

successful in reproducing most of the observed features of the large scale
solar magnetic cycle, generally produce an inappropriate latitudinal
distribution of the toroidal magnetic fields, showing fields of large magnitude
in polar regions where the radial shear has a maximum amplitude. Employing a
kinematic solar dynamo model, we here explore the contribution of both the
radial and the latitudinal shear in the generation of the toroidal magnetic
fields by varying the shape and the thickness of the solar tachocline. We also
explore the effects of the diffusivity profile of the convective zone. We find
that the latitudinal component is always dominant over the radial component at
producing toroidal field amplification. These results are very sensitive to the
adopted diffusivity profile, specially in the inner convection zone. A diagram
of the toroidal field at a latitude of 60 degrees versus the diffusivity at the
convection layer for different values of the tachocline width has revealed that
these fields are mainly eliminated for tachoclines with width d_1>0.08 Ro, for
a restric range of diffusivites; or for d_1<0.02 and almost any value of eta_c
in the appropriate solar range. For intermediate values of d_1=0.04Ro-0.06Ro,
strong toroidal fields should survive at high latitudes in the butterfly

  Analysis of the eclipsing binary radial distribution has revealed an apparent

populations. Four detached binaries have short periods (<2.5d) and are likely
composed of low-mass M-dwarf components, useful for testing stellar evolution
models. One further detached system has a period of 0.8 days and due to the
blueness of the system could be composed of white dwarf stars. Analysis of the

the accuracy of photometry which can routinely be obtained is limited by
significant sky concentration and other effects.
  Photometric standard observations are routinely obtained by ESO, and nightly
zero points are computed mainly for the purpose of monitoring the instrument
performance. The accuracy of these zero points is about 10%.
  Recently, we have started a program to investigate, if and how percent-level
absolute photometric accuracy with FORS can be achieved. The main results of
this project are presented in this paper. We first discuss the quality of the
flatfields and how it can be improved. We then use data with improved
flat-fielding to investigate the usefulness of Stetson standard fields for FORS
calibration and the accuracy which can be achieved. The main findings of the
FORS Absolute Photometry Project program are as follows. There are significant
differences between the sky flats and the true photometric response of the
instrument which partially depend on the rotator angle. A second order
correction to the sky flat significantly improves the relative photometry
within the field. Percent level photometric accuracy can be achieved with
FORS1. To achieve this accuracy, observers need to invest some of the assigned
science time for imaging of photometric standard fields in addition to the
routine nightly photometric calibration.

planetary bow shocks, and they are invoked as a key component of models of
nonthermal radio emission, such as solar radio bursts. A simulation study is
carried out of electron acceleration for high Mach number, quasi-perpendicular
shocks, typical of the shocks in the solar wind. Two dimensional
self-consistent hybrid shock simulations provide the electric and magnetic
fields in which test particle electrons are followed. A range of different
shock types, shock normal angles, and injection energies are studied. When the
Mach number is low, or the simulation configuration suppresses fluctuations
along the magnetic field direction, the results agree with theory assuming
magnetic moment conserving reflection (or Fast Fermi acceleration), with
electron energy gains of a factor only 2 - 3. For high Mach number, with a
realistic simulation configuration, the shock front has a dynamic rippled
character. The corresponding electron energization is radically different:
Energy spectra display: (1) considerably higher maximum energies than Fast
Fermi acceleration; (2) a plateau, or shallow sloped region, at intermediate
energies 2 - 5 times the injection energy; (3) power law fall off with
increasing energy, for both upstream and downstream particles, with a slope
decreasing as the shock normal angle approaches perpendicular; (4) sustained
flux levels over a broader region of shock normal angle than for adiabatic
reflection. All these features are in good qualitative agreement with
observations, and show that dynamic structure in the shock surface at ion
scales produces effective scattering and can be responsible for making high
Mach number shocks effective sites for electron acceleration.

Continua are detected in about 36% of the objects in our sample (in 26% their
intrinsic width is <10 eV); b) higher order transitions are generally enhanced
with respect to pure photoionization, indicating that resonant scattering plays
an important role in the ionization/excitation balance. These results support
the scenario, whereby the active nucleus is responsible for the X-ray ``soft
excess'' almost ubiquitously observed in nearby obscured AGN via
photoionization of circumnuclear gas. They confirm on a statistical basis the
conclusions drawn from the detailed study of the brightest spectra in the
sample. Furthermore, we propose a criterion to statistically discriminate
between AGN-photoionized sources and starburst galaxies, based on intensity of

coherence due to entanglement with a controlled quantum system ('which path'
detector). In experiments that were conducted thus far in mesoscopic systems
only partial dephasing was achieved. This was due to weak interactions between
many detector electrons and the interfering electron, resulting in a Gaussian
phase randomizing process [4-10]. Here, we report the opposite extreme: a
complete destruction of the interference via strong phase randomization only by
a few electrons in the detector. The realization was based on interfering edge
channels (in the integer quantum Hall effect regime, filling factor 2) in a
Mach-Zehnder electronic interferometer, with an inner edge channel serving as a
detector. Unexpectedly, the visibility quenched in a periodic lobe-type form as
the detector current increased; namely, it periodically decreased as the
detector current, and thus the detector's efficiency, increased. Moreover, the
visibility had a V-shape dependence on the partitioning of the detector
current, and not the expected dependence on the second moment of the shot
noise, T(1-T), with T the partitioning. We ascribe these unexpected features to
the strong detector-interferometer coupling, allowing only 1-3 electrons in the
detector to fully dephase the interfering electron. Consequently, in this work
we explored the non-Gaussian nature of noise [11], namely, the direct effect of
the shot noise full counting statistics [12-15].

perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the waveguide; the variation of
the potential in the transverse direction may be arbitrary. The sets of
parameters defining a given slice are taken to be statistically independent
from those of any other slice and identically distributed. In the

controlling concurrent accesses to ressources without the need for explicit
lock-based synchronization mechanisms. A key feature of STM is to provide a way
to group sequences of read and write actions inside atomic blocks, similar to
database transactions, whose whole effect should occur atomically. In this
paper, we investigate STM from a process algebra perspective and define an
extension of asynchronous CCS with atomic blocks of actions. Our goal is not
only to set a formal ground for reasoning on STM implementations but also to
understand how this model fits with other concurrency control mechanisms. We
also view this calculus as a test bed for extending process calculi with atomic
transactions. This is an interesting direction for investigation since, for the
most part, actual works that mix transactions with process calculi consider
compensating transactions, a model that lacks all the well-known ACID
properties. We show that the addition of atomic transactions results in a very
expressive calculus, enough to easily encode other concurrent primitives such
as guarded choice and multiset-synchronization (\`{a} la join-calculus). The
correctness of our encodings is proved using a suitable notion of bisimulation

fixed-delay} setting also presents such an opportunity for generic channels.
  While $E_{sp}(R)$ continues to bound the tradeoff between bit error and fixed
end-to-end latency for symmetric channels used {\em without} feedback, a new
bound called the ``focusing bound'' gives the limits on what can be done with
feedback. If low-rate reliable flow-control is free (ie. the noisy channel has
strictly positive zero-error capacity), then the focusing bound can be
asymptotically achieved. Even when the channel has no zero-error capacity, it
is possible to substantially beat the sphere-packing bound by synthesizing an
appropriately reliable channel to carry the flow-control information.

of connection functors in terms of a generalized differential geometric
dynamics of the corresponding fields in the regime of these topoi. In

This model predicts a new singly-charged Higgs bosons $H_2^\pm$, namely a
scalar bilepton (a particle of lepton number 2) with mass proportional to the

$H_2^\pm$ at high energy $e^+ e^-$ colliders with polarization of $e^+$, $e^-$

Based on the result, it shows that production cross sections of $H^{-}_2W^+$

the study of the breaking of the universality between K, B_d and B_s systems

signals some sensitivity to the ultraviolet completion of the theory. Including
an estimate of this contribution, we calculate the branching ratios for the

Significant enhancements of the decay rates $K_L \to\pi^0\ell^+\ell^-$ are also
possible. Simultaneously, the CP-asymmetries $S_{\psi \phi}$ and
$A^s_\text{SL}$ can be enhanced by an order of magnitude, while the electroweak

and obtain analytic expressions for the poles from 1/e^8 through 1/e^4. We give
numerical results for the coefficients of the 1/e^3 and 1/e^2 poles. These
results all match the known exponentiated structure of the infrared
divergences, at four separate kinematic points. The value of the 1/e^2
coefficient allows us to test a conjecture of Eden and Staudacher for the
four-loop cusp (soft) anomalous dimension. We find that the conjecture is
incorrect, although our numerical results suggest that a simple modification of
the expression, flipping the sign of the term containing zeta_3^2, may yield
the correct answer. Our numerical value can be used, in a scheme proposed by
Kotikov, Lipatov and Velizhanin, to estimate the two constants in the
strong-coupling expansion of the cusp anomalous dimension that are known from
string theory. The estimate works to 2.6% and 5% accuracy, providing
non-trivial evidence in support of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We also use the
known constants in the strong-coupling expansion as additional input to provide
approximations to the cusp anomalous dimension which should be accurate to
under one percent for all values of the coupling. When the evaluations of the
integrals are completed through the finite terms, it will be possible to test

higher-dimensional settings where the observable sector resides deep within a
strongly warped region, with supersymmetry breaking not necessarily localized
in that region. Our particular interest is in how the supersymmetry-breaking
scale seen by the observable sector depends on this warping. We obtain this
dependence in two ways: by computing within the microscopic (string) theory
supersymmetry-breaking masses in supermultiplets; and by investigating how
warping gets encoded into masses within the low-energy 4D effective theory. We
find that the lightest gravitino mode can have mass much less than the
straightforward estimate from the mass shift of the unwarped zero mode. This
lightest Kaluza-Klein excitation plays the role of the supersymmetric partner
of the graviton and has a warped mass m_{3/2} proportional to e^A, with e^A the
warp factor, and controls the size of the soft SUSY breaking terms. We
formulate the conditions required for the existence of a description in terms
of a 4D SUGRA formulation, or in terms of 4D SUGRA together with soft-breaking
terms, and describe in particular situations where neither exist for some
non-supersymmetric compactifications. We suggest that some effects of warping
are captured by a linear $A$ dependence in the Kahler potential. We outline
some implications of our results for the KKLT scenario of moduli stabilization

empirical study, some attractive features of MHD waves behavior are
investigated. Furthermore, it is shown that the presence of space
noncommutativity enhances slightly the phase velocity of the incompressive

the role of an additional compression on the medium, in which its relevant
effect on the fast mode occurs for highly oblique branchs, while the low effect
appears when the propagations are nearly parallel or anti-parallel. In
addition, it turned out that the influence of space deformation on the slow
modes is $\sim 10^{3}$ times smaller than that on the fast modes. The space
noncommutativity effect on the slow waves is negligible in low plasma $\beta $

such that the even part of $\gfrak$ is the even part of the super Lie algebra
of $\Gcal.$ In general, the module structure on $\gfrak$ is required to obtain
$\Gcal,$ but the ""structure constants"" involving the odd part of $\gfrak$ can
not be recovered without further restrictions. We also show that if $\Hcal$ is

describes gravitation as the response of an object to local spacetime
curvature. Gravitational waves travelling at the speed of light are then a
necessary mechanism to maintain the required consistency between local
curvature and distant gravitating mass. Gravitational waves will certainly be
subject to refraction by bodies such as the moon and we explore if such an

sections, and sweeping the magnetic field across them will allow a form of
quantum control in which separated atoms and molecules are associated to form
complexes. For the first resonance, where only elastic scattering is possible,
the scattering length shows a pole as a function of magnetic field and there is
a very large peak in the elastic cross section. For the second resonance,
however, inelastic scattering is also possible. In this case the pole in the
scattering length is dramatically suppressed and the cross sections show
relatively small peaks. The peak suppression is expected to be even larger in
systems with stronger inelasticity. The results suggest that calculations on

which discussed the harmonic structure of the genetic code (Rakocevic, 2004).
Several new harmonic structures presented in this paper, through specific unity
and coherence, together with the previously presented (Rakocevic, 2004), show
that it makes sense to understand genetic code as a set of several different
harmonic structures. Thereby, the harmonicity itself represents a specific
unity and coherence of physico-chemical properties of amino acid molecules and
the number of atoms and/or nucleons in the molecules themselves (in the form of
typical balances). A specific Gauss' arithmetical algorithm has the central
position among all these structures and it corresponds to the patterns of the
number of atoms within the side chains of amino acid molecules in the following
sense: G+V = 11; P+I = 21; S+T+L+A+G = 31; D+E+M+C+P = 41; K+R+Q+N+V = 61;

these regularities it make sense to talk about genetic code as a harmonic
system. On the other hand, such an order provides new evidence supporting the
hypothesis established in the previous paper (Rakocevic, 2004) that genetic
code has been complete from the very beginning and as such was the condition

protocol in the case where the key information is encoded in the relative phase
of a coherent-state reference pulse and a weak coherent-state signal pulse, as
in some practical implementations of the protocol. In contrast to previous
work, our proof applies even if the eavesdropper knows the phase of the
reference pulse, provided that this phase is not modulated by the source, and
even if the reference pulse is bright. The proof also applies to the case where
the key is encoded in the photon polarization of a weak coherent-state pulse
with a known phase, but only if the phases of the four BB84 signal states are
judiciously chosen. The achievable key generation rate scales quadratically
with the transmission in the channel, just as for BB84 with phase-randomized
weak coherent-state signals (when decoy states are not used). For the case
where the phase of the reference pulse is strongly modulated by the source, we
exhibit an explicit attack that allows the eavesdropper to learn every key bit
in a parameter regime where a protocol using phase-randomized signals is
provably secure.

alternative to the more familiar quantal formalism based on state-vectors,
selfadjoint operators, and external observers. Mathematically one generalizes
the path-integral-as-propagator to a {\it quantal measure} $\mu$ on the space
$\Omega$ of all ``conceivable worlds'', and this generalized measure expresses
the dynamics or law of motion of the theory, much as Wiener measure expresses
the dynamics of Brownian motion. Within such ``histories-based'' schemes new,
and more ``realistic'' possibilities open up for resolving the philosophical
problems of the state-vector formalism. In particular, one can dispense with
the need for external agents by locating the predictive content of $\mu$ in its
sets of measure zero: such sets are to be ``precluded''. But unrestricted
application of this rule engenders contradictions. One possible response would
remove the contradictions by circumscribing the application of the preclusion
concept. Another response, more in the tradition of ``quantum logic'', would
accommodate the contradictions by dualizing $\Omega$ to a space of
``co-events'' and effectively identifying reality with an element of this dual
space.

at the nodes and extrema of the eigenstates of confining potentials which are
functions of a single variable. At any boundstate energy the Schroedinger
equation has two linearly independent solutions one of which is normalisable
while the other is not. In the domain after the last node of a boundstate
eigenfunction the unnormalisable linearly independent solution has a simple
form which enables the construction of functions analogous to Green's functions
that lead to certain sum rules. One set of sum rules give conditions that must
be satisfied at the nodes and extrema of the boundstate eigenfunctions of
confining potentials. Another sum rule establishes a relation between an
integral involving an eigenfunction in the domain after the last node and a sum
involving all the eigenvalues and eigenstates. Such sum rules may be useful in
the study of properties of confining potentials. The exactly solvable cases of
the particle in a box and the simple harmonic oscillator are used to illustrate
the procedure. The relations between one of the sum rules and two-particle
densities and a construction based on Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics are
discussed.
