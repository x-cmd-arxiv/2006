quintessence field from current observational data. We extend the cosmological
dataset to include new supernova data, plus information from the cosmic
microwave background and from baryon acoustic oscillations. We extend the
modelling by considering Pad\'e approximant expansions as well as Taylor
series, and by using observations to assess the viability of the tracker
hypothesis. We find that parameter constraints have improved by a factor of
two, with a strengthening of the preference of the cosmological constant over
evolving quintessence models. Present data show some signs, though
inconclusive, of favouring tracker models over non-tracker models under our
assumptions.

forming galaxies by applying a population synthesis method to a sample of 84828

decomposes the entire observed spectrum in terms of a sum of simple stellar
populations spanning a wide range of ages and metallicities, thus allowing the
reconstruction of galaxy histories. A comparative study of galaxy evolution is
presented, where galaxies are grouped onto bins of nebular abundances or mass.
We find that galaxies whose warm interstellar medium is poor in heavy elements
are slow in forming stars. Their stellar metallicities also rise slowly with
time, reaching their current values ($Z_\star \sim 1/3 Z_\odot$) in the last
$\sim 100$ Myr of evolution. Systems with metal rich nebulae, on the other
hand, assembled most of their mass and completed their chemical evolution long
ago, reaching $Z_\star \sim Z_\odot$ already at lookback times of several Gyr.
These same trends, which are ultimately a consequence of galaxy downsizing,
appear when galaxies are grouped according to their stellar mass. The
reconstruction of galaxy histories to this level of detail out of integrated
spectra offers promising prospects in the field of galaxy evolution theories.

IRS spectra of the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant. We find that various IRAC
channels are each most sensitive to a different spectral and physical
component. Channel 1 (3.6 micron) matches radio synchrotron images. Where
Channel 1 is strong with respect to the other channels, the longer-wavelength
spectra show a broad continuum gently peaking around 26 micron, with weak or no
lines. We suggest that this is due to un-enriched progenitor circumstellar dust
behind the outer shock, processed by shock photons and electrons. Where Channel
4 (8 micron) is bright relative to the other IRAC channels, the long-wavelength
spectra show a strong, 2-3 micron-wide peak at 21 micron, likely due to
silicates and proto-silicates, as well as strong ionic lines of [Ar II], [Ar
III], [S IV] and [Ne II]. In these locations, the dust and ionic emission
originate from the explosion's O-burning layers. The regions where Channels 2
(4.5 micron) and 3 (5.6 micron) are strongest relative to Channel 4 show a
spectrum that rises gradually to 21 micron, and then flattens or rises more
slowly to longer wavelengths, along with higher ratios of [Ne II] to [Ar II].
Dust and ionic emission in these locations arise primarily from the C- and Ne-
burning layers. These findings are consistent with asymmetries in the explosion
producing variations in the velocity structure in different directions, but
preserving the nucleosynthetic layers. At each location, the dust and ionic
lines in the mid-infrared, and the hotter and more highly ionized optical and
X-ray emission are then dominated by the layer currently encountering the
reverse shock in that direction.

range 0.1<z<0.6, from the William Herschel Telescope and from the Spitzer IRAC
data archive. The groups are selected from the CNOC2 redshift survey, with
additional spectroscopy from the Baade telescope (Magellan). Our group samples
are statistically complete to K(Vega}=17.7 (INGRID) and [3.6](AB)=19.9 (IRAC).
  From these data we construct near-infrared luminosity functions, for groups
in bins of velocity dispersion, up to 800 km/s, and redshift. The total amount
of near-infrared luminosity per group is compared with the dynamical mass,
estimated from the velocity dispersion, to compute the mass-to-light ratio,
M/Lk. We find that the M/Lk values in these groups are in good agreement with
those of their statistical descendants at z=0, with no evidence for evolution
beyond that expected for a passively evolving population. There is a trend of
M/Lk with group mass, which increases from M/Lk~10 for groups with sigma<250
km/s to M/Lk~100 for sigma=425-800 km/s. This trend is weaker, but still
present, if we estimate the total mass from weak lensing measurements. In terms
of stellar mass, stars make up ~2 per cent of the mass in the smallest groups,
and ~1 per cent in the most massive groups. We also use the near-infrared data
to consider the correlations between stellar populations and stellar masses,
for group and field galaxies at 0.1<z<0.6. We find that fewer group galaxies
show strong [OII] emission compared with field galaxies of the same stellar
mass and at the same redshift. We conclude that most of the stellar mass in
these groups was already in place by z~0.4, with little environment-driven
evolution to the present day.

magnetized, rotating, massive stellar cores to proto-neutron stars (PNSs). We
perform axisymmetric numerical simulations in full general relativity with a
hybrid equation of state. The formation and early evolution of a PNS are
followed with a grid of 2500 x 2500 zones, which provides better resolution
than in previous (Newtonian) studies. We confirm that significant differential
rotation results even when the rotation of the progenitor is initially uniform.
Consequently, the magnetic field is amplified both by magnetic winding and the
magnetorotational instability (MRI). Even if the magnetic energy E_EM is much
smaller than the rotational kinetic energy T_rot at the time of PNS formation,
the ratio E_EM/T_rot increases to 0.1-0.2 by the magnetic winding. Following
PNS formation, MHD outflows lead to losses of rest mass, energy, and angular
momentum from the system. The earliest outflow is produced primarily by the
increasing magnetic stress caused by magnetic winding. The MRI amplifies the
poloidal field and increases the magnetic stress, causing further angular
momentum transport and helping to drive the outflow. After the magnetic field
saturates, a nearly stationary, collimated magnetic field forms near the
rotation axis and a Blandford-Payne type outflow develops along the field
lines. These outflows remove angular momentum from the PNS at a rate given by
\dot{J} \sim \eta E_EM C_B, where \eta is a constant of order 0.1 and C_B is a
typical ratio of poloidal to toroidal field strength. As a result, the rotation
period quickly increases for a strongly magnetized PNS until the degree of
differential rotation decreases. Our simulations suggest that rapidly rotating,
magnetized PNSs may not give rise to rapidly rotating neutron stars.

calibration of extinction and the [O II]/H-alpha line ratio, and separating
star formation from AGN emission. We use calibrated line luminosities from the
DEEP2 survey and Palomar K magnitudes to show that the behavior of emission
line ratios depends on galaxy magnitude and color. For galaxies on the blue
side of the color bimodality, the vast majority show emission signatures of
star formation, and there are strong correlations of extinction and [O

extinction-corrected H-alpha and thus to star formation rate has a significant

probed by nebular emission and by mid-IR luminosity. Although extinction is
correlated with luminosity, 98% of IR-luminous galaxies at z~1 are still

in time).The X-ray light curve showed a steepening with time, similar to many
other afterglows. However, the steepening was unusually smooth, over the
duration of the XRT observation, with no clear break time. The early decay was
too flat to be described in terms of standard models. We therefore explore
alternative explanations, such as the presence of a structured afterglow or of
long-lasting energy injection into the fireball from the central GRB engine.
The lack of a sharp break puts constraints on these two models. In the former
case, it may indicate that the angular energy profile of the jet was not a
simple power law, while in the second model it implies that injection did not
stop abruptly. The late decay may be due either to a standard afterglow (that
is, with no energy injection), or to a jetted outflow still being refreshed. A

construct their luminosity functions (LFs). These LFs are derived down to faint
magnitudes, which allows for a more accurate determination of the faint end
slope. With a large (N~200-900) sample for each redshift interval, a Schechter
profile is fitted to each LF. Prior to dust extinction corrections, the [O III]
and [O II] LFs reported in this paper agree reasonably well with those of
Hippelein et al. The z=0.08 Ha LF, which reaches two orders of magnitude
fainter than Gallego et al., is steeper by 25%. This indicates that there are
more low luminosity star-forming galaxies for z<0.1. The faint end slope \alpha
and \phi_{\star} show a strong evolution with redshift while L_{\star} show
little evolution. The evolution in \alpha indicates that low-luminosity
galaxies have a stronger evolution compared to brighter ones. Integrated star
formation rate densities are derived via Ha, [O III], and [O II] for
0.07<z<1.47. A steep increase in the star-formation rate density, as a function
of redshift, is seen for 0.4<z<0.9. For z>1, the star-formation rate densities
are more or less constant. The latter is consistent with previous UV and [O II]

II], and UV measurements, but other measurements are a factor of two higher.

main contenders are external Compton (EC) scattering off the cosmic microwave

electrons separate from those producing the radio - IR emission. So far, no
clear diagnostics have been presented to distinguish which of the two, if any,

on a fundamental difference between these two models: the production of
synchrotron X-rays requires multi - TeV electrons, while the EC/CMB model
requires a cutoff in the electron energy distribution (EED) below TeV energies.
This has significant implications for the gamma-ray emission predicted by these
two models, that can be tested through GeV and TeV observations of the nearby

to complete the CS disk census for the late-type members of the ~8 Myr-old eta
Chamaeleontis star cluster. Of the 15 K- and M-type members, eight show excess
emission. We find that the presence of a CS disk is anti-correlated with
binarity, with all but one disk associated with single stars. With nine single
stars in total, about 80% retain a CS disk. Of the six known or suspected close
binaries the only CS disk is associated with the primary of RECX 9. No
circumbinary disks have been detected. We also find that stars with disks are
slow rotators with surface values of specific angular momentum j = 2-15 j_sun.
All high specific angular momentum systems with j = 20-30 j_sun are confined to
the primary stars of binaries. This provides novel empirical evidence for
rotational disk locking and again demonstrates the much shorter disk lifetimes
in close binary systems compared to single star systems. We estimate the
characteristic mean disk dissipation timescale to be ~5 Myr and ~9 Myr for the
binary and single star systems, respectively.

search problems (ISP). We also assumed that an ISP is expressed in terms of the
user's expectations and that these expectations determine the activities or the
behaviors of the user, when he/she uses an IS. The model we are proposing is
used for the conception of the IS so that the process of retrieving of

leading gradually to the deformation of the initial fractal geometry. After
constructing an ensemble of configurations describing the initial state of the

larger than the time needed for the mass of the isoscalar particles to reach
the two-pion threshold. This result is more transparent in an event-by-event

with the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics appear to have
alternate, parallel explanations in terms of nonlinear dynamics and chaos.

nonlinear extensions of Bell's inequalities, spontaneous symmetry breaking and
the existence of intrinsically preferred internal oscillation modes
(quantization) in nonlinear systems, and perhaps even the production of
diffraction-like patterns by ""order in chaos."" The existence of such parallel
explanations leads to an empirical, quasi-experimental approach to the question
of whether or not there might be fundamental nonlinearities underying quantum
mechanics. This will be contrasted with recent more theoretical approaches, in
which nonlinear extensions have been proposed rather as corrections to a
fundamentally linear quantum mechanics. Sources of nonlinearity, such as
special relativity and the measurement process itself, will be investigated, as
will possible implications of nonlinearities for entanglement and decoherence.
It is conceivable that in their debates both Einstein and Bohr could have been
right -- for chaos provides the fundamental determinism favored by Einstein,
