close to the maximum intensity reported in the Einstein Slew Survey. The very
good statistics obtained in the 0.3-10 keV Swift X-ray spectrum allowed us to
detect highly significant deviations from a simple power law spectral
distribution. A log-parabolic model describes well the X-ray data and gives a
best fit curvature parameter of 0.18 and peak energy in the Spectral Energy
Distribution of about 2 keV. The UV spectral data from Swift UVOT join well
with a power law extrapolation of the soft X-ray data points suggesting that
the same component is responsible for the observed emission in the two bands.
The combination of synchrotron peak in the X-ray band and high intensity state
confirms PKS 0548-322 as a prime target for TeV observations. X-ray monitoring

extensive computations of adiabatic g-mode pulsation periods on PG1159

stellar models are extracted from the complete evolution of progenitor stars
started from the ZAMS, through the thermally pulsing AGB and born-again phases

J2117.1+3412 by comparing the observed period spacing with the asymptotic
period spacing and with the average of the computed period spacings. We also
employed the individual observed periods to find a representative seismological
model. We derive a stellar mass of 0.56-0.57 Mo from the period spacing data
alone. In addition, we found a best-fit model representative for RX
J2117.1+3412 with an effective temperature of 163,400 K, a stellar mass of
0.565 Mo, and a surface gravity log g= 6.61. The derived stellar luminosity and
radius are log(L/Lo)= 3.36 and log(R/Ro)= -1.23, respectively, and the He-rich
envelope thickness is Menv= 0.02 Mo. We derive a seismic distance of 452 pc and
a linear size of the planetary nebula of 1.72 pc. These inferences seem to
solve the discrepancy between the RX J2117.1+3412 evolutionary timescale and
the size of the nebula. All of the seismological tools we use concur to the

accounted for in terms of supernovae and OB stellar winds. Focusing on a
representative model, we show the formation of an oval disk and of a first
generation of nested bars with characteristic sub-kpc and a few kpc sizes. The
system evolves through successive dynamical couplings and decouplings, forcing
the gas inwards and settles in a state of resonant coupling. The inflow rate
can support a broad range of activity within the central kpc, from quasar- to
Seyfert-types, supplemented by a vigorous star formation as a by-product. The
initial bar formation is triggered in response to the tidal torques from the
triaxial DM halo, which acts as a finite perturbation. This first generation of
bars does not survive for more than 4--5 Gyr: by that time the secondary bar
has totally dissolved, while the primary one has very substantially weakened,
reduced to a fat oval. This evolution is largely due to chaos introduced by the
interaction of the multiple non-axisymmetric components.

area and long exposure, we were able to discriminate different X-ray continuum
spectral models. Neither the standard accretion disk model (where the radial
dependency of the disk effective temperature is T(r) \propto r^-3/4) nor a
power-law model gives a satisfactory fit. In fact, observed curvature of the
M82 X-1 spectrum was just between those of the two models. When the exponent of
the radial dependence (p in T(r) \propto r^-p) of the disk temperature is
allowed to be free, we obtained p =0.61^+0.03_-0.02. Such a reduction of p from
the standard value 3/4 under extremely high mass accretion rates is predicted
from the accretion disk theory as a consequence of the radial energy advection.
Thus, the accretion disk in M82 X-1 is considered to be in the Slim disk state,
where an optically thick Advection Dominant Accretion Flow (ADAF) is taking
place. We have applied a theoretical slim disk spectral model to M82 X-1, and
estimated the black hole mass ~ 19-32 M_odot. We propose that M82 X-1 is a

the same double-peaked line profiles for H$\beta$, FeII, H$\gamma$ and
HeII$\lambda4686\AA$ as that of double-peaked broad H$\alpha$ for all the 27

between FeII emission lines and the other broad emission lines for normal AGN
can be confirmed for dbp emitters. However, these results should be taken with
caution due to the small number of objects and the bias in selecting strong
FeII emitters. We show that for dbp emitters, BH masses seems to have more
influence on FeII properties than dimensionless accretion rate. We also find

Seyfert 1.9 galaxy MCG -5-23-16. The broad-band (0.4-100 keV) X-ray spectrum
allows us to determine the nature of the high energy emission with little
ambiguity. The X-ray continuum consists of a cutoff power-law of photon index
$\Gamma=1.9$, absorbed through Compton-thin matter of column density $N_{\rm
H}=1.6\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. A soft excess is observed below 1 keV and is
likely a combination of emission from scattered continuum photons and distant
photoionized gas. The iron K line profile is complex, showing narrow neutral
iron K$\alpha$ and K$\beta$ emission, as well as a broad line which can be
modeled by a moderately inclined accretion disk. The line profile shows either
the disk is truncated at a few tens of gravitational radii, or the disk
emissivity profile is relatively flat. A strong Compton reflection component is
detected above 10 keV, which is best modeled by a combination of reflection off
distant matter and the accretion disk. The reflection component does not appear
to vary. The overall picture is that this Seyfert 1.9 galaxy is viewed at
moderate (50 degrees) inclination through Compton-thin matter at the edge of a
Compton-thick torus covering $2\pi$ steradians, consistent with unified models.

broad absorption line (BAL) quasars (HE0143-3535, HE0436-2614), one quasar with
a mini-BAL (HE1105-0746), and one quasar with associated narrow absorption

lobe-dominated morphology, which argues against it being a blazar. The unusual

AGN observed as part of the Suzaku Guaranteed time program are reviewed. This
paper discusses a small sample of Compton-thin Seyferts observed to date with
Suzaku; namely MCG -5-23-16, MCG -6-30-15, NGC 4051, NGC 3516, NGC 2110, 3C 120
and NGC 2992. The broad iron K$\alpha$ emission line appears to be present in
all but one of these Seyfert galaxies, while the narrow core of the line from
distant matter is ubiquitous in all the observations. The iron line in MCG
-6-30-15 shows the most extreme relativistic blurring of all the objects, the
red-wing of the line requires the inner accretion disk to extend inwards to
within 2.2Rg of the black hole, in agreement with the XMM-Newton observations.
Strong excess emission in the Hard X-ray Detector (HXD) above 10 keV is
observed in many of these Seyfert galaxies, consistent with the presence of a
reflection component from reprocessing in Compton-thick matter (e.g. the
accretion disk). Only one Seyfert galaxy (NGC 2110) shows neither a broad iron
line nor a reflection component. The spectral variability of MCG -6-30-15, MCG
-5-23-16 and NGC 4051 is also discussed. In all 3 cases, the spectra appear
harder when the source is fainter, while there is little variability of the
iron line or reflection component with source flux. This agrees with a simple
two component spectral model, whereby the variable emission is the primary
power-law, while the iron line and reflection component remain relatively
constant.

Angular sizes were measured for an additional 8 dusty WR stars using aperture
masking interferometry, allowing us to probe characteristics sizes down to ~20
milliarcseconds (~40 AU for typical sources). With angular sizes and specific
fluxes, we can directly measure the wavelength-dependent surface brightness and
size relations for our sample. We discovered tight correlations of these
properties within our sample which could not be explained by simple
spherically-symmetric dust shells or even the more realistic ``pinwheel

While the tightly-correlated surface brightness relations we uncovered offer
compelling indirect evidence of a shared and distinctive dust shell geometry
amongst our sample, long-baseline interferometers should target the
marginally-resolved objects in our sample in order to conclusively establish
the presence or absence of the putative underyling colliding wind binaries

analyzed by means of the Monte Carlo Inversion method completed with the

z < 2.9 mostly due to radiative transfer processes in the clumpy IGM. At z <
1.8, the IGM becomes almost transparent both in the HI and HeII Lyman continua
and the variability of the spectral shape comes from diversity of spectral
indices describing the QSO/AGN intrinsic radiation. At z > 2.4, the recovered
spectral shapes show intensity depression between 3 and 4 Ryd due to HeII
Ly-alpha absorption in the IGM clouds (line blanketing) and continuous medium
(true Gunn-Petersen effect). The mean HeII Ly-alpha opacity estimated from the
depth of this depression corresponds within 1-2sigma to the values directly
measured from the HI/HeII Ly-alpha forest towards the quasars studied. The
observed scatter in eta = N(HeII)/N(HI) and anti-correlation between N(HI) and
eta can be explained by the combined action of variable spectral softness and
differences in the mean gas density between the absorbing clouds. Neither of
the recovered spectral shapes show features which can be attributed to the
putative input of radiation from soft sources like starburst galaxies.

asymmetric spectra observed at room temperature become much broader, symmetric,
and shift to lower fields upon cooling. An additional narrow spectral component
(with the line-width of 30 G) is found in the diluted samples, its magnitude
obeying the Arrhenius law with the activation temperature of about 850 K. The
longitudinal spin-relaxation time, T1 >> 10 ns, was determined by the specially
developed modulation method. Angular dependence of the EMR signal position in
field-freezing samples unambiguously points to the domination of the uniaxial
magnetic anisotropy. Substantial alignment is achieved in moderate freezing
fields of 4-5 kG, suggesting formation of dipolar-coupled chains consisting
from several particles separated by organic nanolayers. The shift and
broadening of the spectrum upon cooling are ascribed to the role of the surface
layer, which is considered with taking into acount the strong surface-related
anisotropy. To describe the overall spectrum shape, a quantization model is
used which includes summation of the resonances corresponding to varios
orientations of the particle magnetic moment. This approach, supplemented with

attention is paid to a possibility of a weak quantum diffusion along the

diffusion. It was found that quantum diffusion is possible only when the
perturbation is large enough in order to mix many near-separatrix levels. The
rate of the quantum diffusion turns out to be less than the corresponding
classical one, thus indicating the influence of quantum coherent effects.
Another important effect is the dynamical localization of the quantum
diffusion, that may be compared with the famous Anderson localization occurring
in 1D random potentials. Our estimates show that the quantum Arnol'd diffusion
can be observed in semi-metal rippled channels, for which the scattering and

assumptions concerning energy flow and relaxation times in this model. A
calculation of the rate of energy transfer from the electron gas to the lattice
finds that at the instability, the electronic temperature reaches a very high
value close to the critical temperature. Our calculated energy relaxation times
are consistent with those deduced from the experiments. We also estimate the
phonon mean free path and assess its effect on the flow of energy in the film.

on repulsive interactions between the particles. These repulsively bound pairs
exhibit long lifetimes, even under conditions when they collide with one
another. Stable repulsively bound objects should be viewed as a general

other composites with fermions or Bose-Fermi mixtures should exist in an

with more than two particles. In the following we will first explain the
theoretical background of repulsively atom pairs. Afterwards we will present
the experiments which demonstrate several key properties of the pairs. Finally

prevent this type of attack, this paper proposes the use of reversible logic
for designing the ALU of a cryptosystem. Ideally, reversible circuits dissipate
zero energy. Thus, it would be of great significance to apply reversible logic
to designing secure cryptosystems. As far as is known, this is the first
attempt to apply reversible logic to developing secure cryptosystems. In a
prototype of a reversible ALU for a crypto-processor, reversible designs of
adders and Montgomery multipliers are presented. The reversible designs of a
carry propagate adder, four-to-two and five-to-two carry save adders are
presented using a reversible TSG gate. One of the important properties of the
TSG gate is that it can work singly as a reversible full adder. In order to
design the reversible Montgomery multiplier, novel reversible sequential
circuits are also proposed which are integrated with the proposed adders to
design a reversible modulo multiplier. It is intended that this paper will
provide a starting point for developing cryptosystems secure against DPA

of existing 18x18 dedicated multipliers in FPGAs with dedicated 24x24
multipliers designed with small 4x4 bit multipliers. It is also proposed that
for every dedicated 24x24 bit multiplier block designed with 4x4 bit
multipliers, four redundant 4x4 multiplier should be provided to enforce the
feature of self repairability (to recover from the faults). In the proposed
CIFM reconfigurability at run time is also provided resulting in low power. The
major source of motivation for providing the dedicated 24x24 bit multiplier
stems from the fact that single precision floating point multiplier requires
24x24 bit integer multiplier for mantissa multiplication. A reconfigurable,
self-repairable 24x24 bit multiplier (implemented with 4x4 bit multiply
modules) will ideally suit this purpose, making FPGAs more suitable for integer
as well floating point operations. A dedicated 4x4 bit multiplier is also
proposed in this paper. Moreover, in the recent years, reversible logic has
emerged as a promising technology having its applications in low power CMOS,
quantum computing, nanotechnology, and optical computing. It is not possible to
realize quantum computing without reversible logic. Thus, this paper also paper
provides the reversible logic implementation of the proposed CIFM. The
reversible CIFM designed and proposed here will form the basis of the

spherically symmetric solutions that can be expected to result from
scalar-tensor and fourth-order theories of gravity. We find exact cosmological
solutions of various different kinds; isotropic and anisotropic, homogeneous
and inhomogeneous. These solutions are used to investigate the behaviour of the
Universes at both late and early times, to investigate the effects of
corrections to general relativity on approach to an initial singularity and to
look for effects which may be observable in the present day Universe. We use
physical processes, such as the primordial nucleosynthesis of the light
elements, to impose constraints upon any deviations from the standard model.
Furthermore, we investigate the vacuum spherically symmetric solutions of these
theories. This environment is of particular interest for considerations of the
local effects of gravity, where the most accurate experiments and observations
of gravitational phenomena can be performed. Exact solutions are obtained for
this situation and their stability analysed. It is found that a variety of new

Moreover, it will be argued that those cases entailing a violation of time
reversal symmetry of the motion equations could lead to problems with the
concept of entropy. Concerning the fermionic case it will be shown that Fermi
temperature suffers a modification due to the breakdown of Lorentz symmetry.

feature of this scenario is the possibility to determine the Higgs boson masses
by evolving the $\lambda_i$,s from the electroweak-Higgs unification scale
$M_{GH}$ down to the electroweak scale. The unification condition for the gauge

string approximation. Collision ``debris'' consist of closed as well as open
strings. If the latter have ends on two outgoing charges, and thus are being
``stretched'' along the collision axes. We discuss motion in AdS of some simple
objects first -- massless and massive particles -- and then focus on open
strings. We study the latter in a considerable detail, concluding that they
rapidly become ``rectangular'' in proper time -spatial rapidity $\tau-y$
coordinates with well separated fragmentation part and a near-free-falling
rapidity-independent central part. Assuming that in the collisions of ``walls''
of charges multiple stretching strings are created, we also consider the motion
of a 3d stretching membrane. We then argue that a complete solution can be
approximated by two different vacuum solutions of Einstein eqns, with matter
membrane separating them. We identify one of this solution with
Janik-Peschanski stretching black hole solution, and show that all objects

analogs in different geometries (projective, M\""obius, Laguerre, Lie). We find
the core of the theory to be a novel projective characterization of discrete
isothermic nets as Moutard nets. The latter belong to projective geometry and
are nets with planar faces defined through a five-point property: a vertex and
its four diagonal neighbors span a three dimensional space. Analytically this
property is equivalent to the existence of representatives in the space of
homogeneous coordinates satisfying the discrete Moutard equation. Restricting
the projective theory to quadrics, we obtain Moutard nets in sphere geometries.
In particular, Moutard nets in M\""obius geometry are shown to coincide with
discrete isothermic nets. The five-point property in this particular case says
that a vertex and its four diagonal neighbors lie on a common sphere, which is
a novel characterization of discrete isothermic surfaces. Discrete Laguerre
isothermic surfaces are defined through the corresponding five-plane property
which requires that a plane and its four diagonal neighbors share a common
touching sphere. Equivalently, Laguerre isothermic surfaces are characterized
by having an isothermic Gauss map. We conclude with Moutard nets in Lie
geometry.

curved interfaces between an inviscid and viscous fluids in a Hele-Shaw cell.
At t=0 the interface is assumed to be of the form |y|=A x^m, where A>0, m \geq
0, and x>0. The case of 0<m<1 corresponds to a smooth shape, m>1 corresponds to
a cusp, whereas m=1 corresponds to a wedge. The inviscid fluid tip retreats in
the process of relaxation, forming a lobe which size grows with time. Combining
analytical and numerical methods we find that, for any m, the relaxation
dynamics exhibit self-similar behavior. For m\neq 1 this behavior arises as an
intermediate asymptotics: at late times for 0\leq m<1, and at early times for
m>1. In both cases the retreat distance and the lobe size exhibit power law
behaviors in time with different dynamic exponents, uniquely determined by the
value of m. In the special case of m=1 (the wedge) the similarity is exact and
holds for the whole interface at all times t>0, while the two dynamic exponents
merge to become 1/3. Surprisingly, when m\neq 1, the interface shape, rescaled
to the local maximum elevation of the interface, turns out to be universal
(that is, independent of m) in the similarity region. Even more remarkably, the
same rescaled interface shape emerges in the case of m=1 in the limit of zero
wedge angle.

communication patterns of millions of mobile phone users, allowing us to
simultaneously study the local and the global structure of a society-wide
communication network. We observe a coupling between interaction strengths and
the network's local structure, with the counterintuitive consequence that
social networks are robust to the removal of the strong ties, but fall apart
following a phase transition if the weak ties are removed. We show that this
coupling significantly slows the diffusion process, resulting in dynamic
trapping of information in communities, and find that when it comes to
information diffusion, weak and strong ties are both simultaneously
ineffective.

of beads in a capillary tube. Dispersion is measured from light absorption
variations near the outlet following a steplike injection of dye at the inlet.
Visualizations using dye and pure glycerol are also performed in similar
geometries. Taylor dispersion is dominant both in an empty tube and for a
periodic array of beads: the dispersivity $l\_d$ increases with the P\'eclet
number $Pe$ respectively as $Pe$ and $Pe^{0.82}$ and is larger by a factor of 8
in the second case. In a disordered packing of smaller beads (1/3 of the tube
diameter) geometrical dispersion associated to the disorder of the flow field
is dominant with a constant value of $l\_d$ reached at high P\'eclet numbers.
The minimum dispersivity is slightly higher than in homogeneous nonconsolidated
packings of small grains, likely due heterogeneities resulting from wall
effects. In a disordered packing with the same beads as in the periodic
configuration, $l\_d$ is up to 20 times lower than in the latter and varies as
$Pe^\alpha$ with $\alpha = 0.5$ or $= 0.69$ (depending on the fluid viscosity).
A simple model accounting for this latter result is suggested.

biological network can constrain both its structural and dynamical network
properties. This approach is orthogonal to prior studies which examine the
functional consequences of a given structural feature, for example a scale free
architecture. A key step is to construct an algorithm that allows us to
efficiently sample from a maximum entropy distribution on the space of boolean
dynamical networks constrained to perform a specific function, or cascade of
gene expression. Such a distribution can act as a ""functional null model"" to
test the significance of any given network feature, and can aid in revealing
underlying evolutionary selection pressures on various network properties.
Although our methods are general, we illustrate them in an analysis of the
yeast cell cycle cascade. This analysis uncovers strong constraints on the
architecture of the cell cycle regulatory network as well as significant
selection pressures on this network to maintain ordered and convergent
dynamics, possibly at the expense of sacrificing robustness to structural
perturbations.

resist killing in many bacterial colony-antimicrobial confrontations. These
persisters are not believed to be mutants. Rather it has been hypothesized that
they are phenotypic variants. Current models allow cells to switch in and out
of the persister phenotype. Here we suggest a different explanation, namely
senescence, for persister formation. Using a mathematical model including age
structure, we show that senescence provides a natural explanation for
persister-related phenomena including the observations that persister fraction
depends on growth phase in batch culture and dilution rate in continuous

A 75, 032310, 2007","10.1103/PhysRevA.75.032310",,"quant-ph",,"  We investigate the influence of memory errors in the quantum repeater scheme
for long-range quantum communication. We show that the communication distance
is limited in standard operation mode due to memory errors resulting from
unavoidable waiting times for classical signals. We show how to overcome these
limitations by (i) improving local memory, and (ii) introducing two new
operational modes of the quantum repeater. In both operational modes, the
repeater is run blindly, i.e. without waiting for classical signals to arrive.
In the first scheme, entanglement purification protocols based on one-way
classical communication are used allowing to communicate over arbitrary
distances. However, the error thresholds for noise in local control operations
are very stringent. The second scheme makes use of entanglement purification
protocols with two-way classical communication and inherits the favorable error
thresholds of the repeater run in standard mode. One can increase the possible
communication distance by an order of magnitude with reasonable overhead in
physical resources. We outline the architecture of a quantum repeater that can
possibly ensure intercontinental quantum communication.
