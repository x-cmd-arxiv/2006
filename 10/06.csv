consisting of dark matter (DM), represented by an NFW model, and stars from the
central galaxy. The stellar component is required only for 8 systems, for which
reasonable stellar mass-to-light ratios (M/L_K) are obtained, assuming a Kroupa
IMF. Modifying the NFW dark matter halo by adiabatic contraction does not
improve the fit and yields systematically lower M/L_K. In contrast to previous
results for massive clusters, we find that the NFW concentration parameter
(c_vir) for groups decreases with increasing M_vir and is inconsistent with no
variation at the 3 sigma level. The normalization and slope of the c_vir-M_vir
relation are consistent with the standard LambdaCDM cosmological model with
sigma_8 = 0.9. The small intrinsic scatter measured about the c_vir-M_vir
relation implies the groups represent preferentially relaxed, early forming
systems. The mean gas fraction (f =0.05 +/- 0.01) of the groups measured within
an overdensity Delta=2500 is lower than for hot, massive clusters, but the
fractional scatter (sigma_f/f=0.2) for groups is larger, implying a greater
impact of feedback processes on groups, as expected.

the most relaxed systems possessing the highest quality data currently

to the X-ray c-M relation requires at high significance (6.6 sigma) that c
decreases with increasing M, which is a general feature of CDM models. The
median and scatter of the c-M relation produced by the flat, concordance LCDM

is comprised of the most relaxed, early forming systems, which is consistent
with our selection criteria. Holding the rest of the cosmological parameters
fixed to those in the concordance model the c-M relation requires 0.76< sigma_8
<1.07 (99% conf.), assuming a 10% upward bias in the concentrations for early
forming systems. The tilted, low-sigma_8 model suggested by a new WMAP analysis
is rejected at 99.99% confidence, but a model with the same tilt and
normalization can be reconciled with the X-ray data by increasing the dark
energy equation of state parameter to w ~ -0.8. When imposing the additional
constraint of the tight relation between sigma_8 and Omega_m from studies of
cluster abundances, the X-ray c-M relation excludes (>99% conf.) both open CDM
models and flat CDM models with Omega_m ~1. This result provides novel evidence
for a flat, low-Omega_m universe with dark energy using observations only in
the local (z << 1) universe. Possible systematic errors in the X-ray mass

appropriate for the LMC and the destruction of small grains via sputtering by

of both stars and the orbital period. We considered initial masses of 1.5 and
1.4 \msun for the normal (donor) and the neutron star, respectively. We assumed
two metallicity values (Z = 0.010 and 0.020), and an initial orbital period
near 3 days. We assume that the neutron star is only able to retain \lesssim
0.10 of the matter transferred by the donor star.
  Calculations were performed employing our binary hydro code that handles the
mass transfer rate in a fully implicit way together with state-of-the-art
physical ingredients, diffusion and a non-grey atmospheres.
  We compare the structure of the resulting white dwarfs with the
characteristic age of PSR J1713+0747 finding a nice agreement with observations
by Lundgren et al. especially for the case of a donor star with Z= 0.010. This
result indicates that the evolution of this kind of binary system is well
understood.
  The models predict that, due to diffusion, the atmosphere of the white dwarf
is an almost hydrogen-pure one. We find that such structures are unable to
account for the colours measured by Lundgren et al. within their error bars.

Cramer-Rao inequality is not applicable and the likelihood function is
unbounded with several points of maxima. However, the particular
characteristics of the likelihood function lead to ML estimates that are simple

We find that ML is better than the latter for values $\fnl$ away from the

and the other moment estimators. However, we show how for small $\fnl$, one can
easily improve the estimators by a simple shrinkage procedure. This is clearly

quantify the bimodality by a sum of two Gaussians on the colour and morphology
axes and show that, for the red/early-type population both colour and
morphology do not change significantly as a function of density. For the
blue/late-type population, with increasing density the colour becomes redder
but the morphology again does not change significantly. Both populations become
monotonically redder and of earlier type with increasing luminosity. There is
no significant qualitative difference between the behaviour of the two
morphological measures. We supplement the morphological sample with 13,655
galaxies assigned Hubble types by an artificial neural network. We find,
however, that the resulting distribution is less well described by two
Gaussians. Therefore, there are either more than two significant morphological
populations, physical processes not seen in colour space, or the Hubble type,
particularly the different subtypes of spirals Sa-Sd, has an irreducible
fuzziness when related to environmental density. For each of the three measures
of morphology, on removing the density relation due to it, we recover a strong

from N-body simulations that the clustering of haloes of given mass depends on
their formation history. We review why the standard implementation of this

principle, be rectified by implementing in full an ellipsoidal collapse model
where collapse depends not only on the overdensity but also on the shape of the
initial density field. We also present an alternative remedy for this
deficiency, namely the inclusion of collapse barriers for pancakes and
filaments, together with the assumption that formation history depends on when
these barriers are crossed. We implement both these extensions in a generalised
excursion set method, and run large Monte Carlo realisations to quantify the
effects. Our results suggest that effects as large as those found in
simulations can only arise in the excursion set formalism if the formation
history of a halo does indeed depend on the size of its progenitor filaments

from z~10 to z~50 and cover an order of magnitude in halo mas. We find that the
physical properties of the central star-forming clouds are very similar in all
of the simulated objects despite significant differences in formation redshift
and environment. The physical properties of the clouds have little correlation
with spin, mass, or assembly history of the host halo. The collapse of
protostellar objects at higher redshifts progresses much more rapidly due to
the higher densities, which accelerates the formation of molecular hydrogen,
enhances initial cooling and shortens the dynamical timescales. The mass of the
star-forming clouds cover a broad range, from a few hundred to a few thousand
solar masses, and exhibit various morphologies: some of have disk-like
structures nearly rotational supported; others form flattened spheroids; still
others form bars. All of them develop a single proto-stellar `seed' which does
not fragment into multiple objects up to the moment that the central gas
becomes optically thick to H2 cooling lines. At this time, the instantaneous
mass accretion rate onto the centre varies significantly from object to object,
with disk-like structuress have the smallest mass accretion rates. The
formation epoch and properties of the star-forming clouds are sensitive to the
values of cosmological parameters.

the ejection of matter with r-process potential, the wind-like character of the
explosion, and the fundamental anisotropy of the blasts. We find that the
breaking of spherical symmetry is central to the supernova phenomenon and the
blasts, when top-bottom asymmetric, are self-collimating. We see indications
that the initial explosion energies are larger for the more massive

neutrino contribution to the explosion energy may be an increasing function of
progenitor mass. The degree of explosion asymmetry we obtain is completely
consistent with that inferred from the polarization measurements of Type Ic
supernovae. Furthermore, we calculate for the first time the magnitude and sign
of the net impulse on the core due to anisotropic neutrino emission and suggest
that hydrodynamic and neutrino recoils in the context of our asymmetric

estimate these parameters with the hardness ratio information. The shallow
decay component commonly existing in early X-ray afterglows, if interpreted as

We calculate two radiative efficiencies using the afterglow kinetic energy E_K

when the energy injection phase ends, respectively. At t_b XRFs appear to be
less efficient than normal GRBs. However, when we analyze the data at t_{dec}
XRFs are found to be as efficient as GRBs. Short GRBs have similar radiative
efficiencies to long GRBs despite of their different progenitors. Twenty-two
bursts in the sample are identified to have the afterglow cooling frequency
below the X-ray band. Assuming \epsilon_e = 0.1, we find \eta_\gamma(t_b)

Nine GRBs in the sample have the afterglow cooling frequency above the X-ray

magnetic field are derived in Newtonian dynamics, on the assumption that the
axis of rotation is aligned with the magnetic axis so that perturbations on the
equilibrium can be represented by series expansions in terms of spherical
harmonic functions $Y_l^m(\theta,\phi)$ with different degrees $l$ for a given
azimuthal wave number $m$ around the the magnetic axis. Although the three
component models can support a rich variety of oscillation modes, axisymmetric
($m=0$) toroidal $_{l}t_n$ and spheroidal $_ls_n$ shear waves propagating in
the solid crust are our main concerns, where $l$ and $n$ denote the harmonic
degree and the radial order of the modes, respectively. In the absence of
rotation, axisymmetric spheroidal and toroidal modes are completely decoupled,
and we consider the effects of rotation on the oscillation modes only in the
limit of slow rotation. We find that the oscillation frequencies of the
fundamental toroidal torsional modes $_{l}t_n$ in the crust are hardly affected
by the magnetic field as strong as $B_S\sim 10^{15}$G at the surface. As the
radial order $n$ of the shear modes in the crust becomes higher, however, both
spheroidal and toroidal modes become susceptible to the magnetic field and
their frequencies in general get higher with increasing $B_S$. We also find
that the surface $g$ modes and the crust/ocean interfacial modes are suppressed

latitudes. DR1 is the first large release of survey-quality data from UKIDSS
and includes 320 sq degs of multicolour data to (Vega) K=18, complete
(depending on the survey) in three to five bands from the set ZYJHK, together
with 4 sq degs of deep JK data to an average depth K=21. In addition the
release includes a similar quantity of data with incomplete filter coverage. In
JHK, in regions of low extinction, the photometric uniformity of the
calibration is better than 0.02 mag. in each band. The accuracy of the
calibration in ZY remains to be quantified, and the same is true of JHK in
regions of high extinction. The median image FWHM across the dataset is 0.82
arcsec. We describe changes since the Early Data Release in the implementation,
pipeline and calibration, quality control, and archive procedures. We provide
maps of the areas surveyed, and summarise the contents of each of the five
surveys in terms of filters, areas, and depths. DR1 marks completion of 7 per
cent of the UKIDSS 7-year goals.

  12, 2 issues",,"10.1016/j.newast.2006.07.004",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a simple method to constrain the total mass of groups of galaxies.
Tidal theory predicts that a limit to the mass of bound groups of galaxies can
be obtained by using the fact that the tidal forces due to the external mass
distributions are insufficient to disrupt the groups. To illustrate how the
method works, we find tidal limits on the mass of eleven nearby galaxy groups.
In most cases, tidal limits placed on these groups show that mass estimations
obtained from methods based either on the application of the virial theorem or
moments of the projected mass are underestimated by a factor of about 2 even
if, in many cases, errors are large. Three groups show virial parameters fully
concordant with the tidal constraints while two outlier groups show anomalous
results. The irregular state of the latter suggests that the reliability of the
method depends on the physical properties of the test groups, which should
match the fundamental assumptions of spherical symmetry and dynamical
equilibrium state.

time series photometry in the Johnson V filter has been obtained during three
consecutive years. The resulting light curves have been subject to detailed
frequency analysis and the derived frequencies have been compared to model
predictions. Seven pulsation frequencies have been measured on the basis of the
best dataset obtained in 2004, ranging from $\sim$ 31 to $\sim$ 118 $\mu Hz$,
with an accuracy of the order of 0.5 $\mu Hz$. The comparison with an extensive
set of asteroseismological models shows that all the observed periodicities can
be reproduced if the stellar mass is close to $4 M_{\odot}$. Conversely, the
measured frequencies can be associated to $p$ modes only if the effective
temperature is significantly lower than that obtained from the spectral type
conversion. The present results seem to suggest that more accurate spectral
type determination is necessary in order to discriminate the best fit model

lines, are known to be fast rotators. This fast rotation is a requirement for
the formation of a Keplerian disk, which in turn gives rise to the emission.
However, the pulsating, magnetic B1IV star $\beta$ Cephei is a very slow
rotator that still shows H$\alpha$ emission episodes like in other Be stars,
contradicting current theories. We investigate the hypothesis that the
H$\alpha$ emission stems from the spectroscopically unresolved companion of
$\beta$ Cep. Spectra of the two unresolved components have been separated in
the 6350-6850\AA range with spectro-astrometric techniques, using 11 longslit
spectra obtained with ALFOSC at the Nordic Optical Telescope, La Palma. We find
that the H$\alpha$ emission is not related to the primary in $\beta$ Cep, but
is due to its 3.4 magnitudes fainter companion. This companion has been
resolved by speckle techniques, but it remains unresolved by traditional
spectroscopy. The emission extends from about $-$400 to +400 km s$^{-1}$. The
companion star in its 90-year orbit is likely to be a classical Be star with a
spectral type around B6-8. By identifying its Be-star companion as the origin
of the H$\alpha$ emission behaviour, the enigma behind the Be status of the
slow rotator $\beta$ Cep has been resolved.

Whereas LkCa 15 emission is optically thin, the optically thick core of MWC 480
is resolved at 1.4 mm with a radius of about 35 AU, constraining the dust
temperature. In MWC 480, the dust emission is coming from a colder layer than
the CO emission, most likely the disk mid-plane. These observations provide
direct evidence of an inner cavity around LkCa 15. Such a cavity most probably
results from the tidal disturbance created by a low mass companion or large
planet at about 30 AU from the star. These results suggest that planetary
system formation is already at work in LkCa 15. They also indicate that the
classical steady-state viscous disk model is a too simplistic description of
the inner 50 AU of ''proto-planetary'' disks, and that the disk evolution is
coupled to the planet formation process. The MWC 480 results indicate that a

the disc by including the effects of heating due to compression and shocks and
a simple prescription for cooling and find results that contrast with previous
isothermal simulations. In the present case we find that fragmentation is
inhibited by the interaction, due to the strong effect of tidal heating, which
results in a strong stabilization of the disc. A similar behaviour was also
previously observed in other simulations involving discs in binary systems. As
in the case of isolated discs, it appears that the condition for fragmentation

investigated extensively in recent years. This aging effect is commonly
observed by thermal remnant magnetization (TRM) experiments in which the
relaxation of the magnetization is found to be dependent on the time, tw, spent
at constant temperature before a field cut. The TRM curves scale with tw^\mu,
where \mu is less than 1, which is known as a ""subaging"" effect. The question
of whether this subaging effect is intrinsic, or due to experimental artifacts,
remains as yet unanswered. One possible experimental origin of subaging arises
from the cooling of the sample to the measuring temperature and it has been
proposed that with fast enough cooling \mu would go to 1 . Here we investigate
this possibility by studying the effect of cooling protocol on aging for 3 well
characterized spin glasses, CdCr1.7In0.3S4, Au:Fe8% and Fe0.5Mn0.5TiO3. We find
no strong influence of the cooling rate on \mu and no evidence that \mu would
go to 1 for very short cooling times. We propose additionally an argument which
shows that small (+/-150 mK) variations in the temperature of the sample during
the first tens of seconds of the TRM can significantly influence the behavior
of the relaxation of a spin glass which in turn may result in a misleading
interpretation of \mu values.

and clearly tend to be ubiquitous. In such systems, low-power and low-energy
usage get ever more crucial. Furthermore, these issues also become paramount in
(massively) multi-processors systems, either in one machine or more widely in a
grid. The various problems faced pertain to autonomy, power supply
possibilities, thermal dissipation, or even sheer energy cost. Although it has
since long been studied in harware, energy optimization is more recent in
software. In this paper, we thus aim at raising awareness to low-power and
low-energy issues in the language and compilation community. We thus broadly
but briefly survey techniques and solutions to this energy issue, focusing on a
few specific aspects in the context of compiler optimizations and memory
management.

this goal. Cross-repository interoperability must be augmented to support the
many workflows and value-chains involved in scholarly communication. This will
not be achieved through the promotion of single repository architecture or
content representation, but instead requires an interoperability framework to
connect the many heterogeneous systems that will exist.
  We present a simple data model and service architecture that augments
repository interoperability to enable scholarly value-chains to be implemented.
We describe an experiment that demonstrates how the proposed infrastructure can
be deployed to implement the workflow involved in the creation of an overlay

on the well known Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) family of distances by considering
the same set of elementary operations, namely substitutions and repetitions of

a given score, DTW algorithms use dynamic programming techniques to compute an
optimal sequence of operations with high overall score. In this paper we
consider instead the score spanned by all possible alignments, take a smoothed

proposed so far is to use some finite probability distributions instead. In
this paper, we determine the optimal finite distribution in order to decrease
extra memory amount. By our result, the extra memory is reduced to 1/32 of the
original, or even becomes needless, in some practical setting. Moreover, the
code length is also reduced, e.g. to about 20.6% of Tardos code asymptotically.
Finally, we address some other practical issues such as approximation errors

one-flavor QCD should have degenerate mass since they lie within the same
Wess-Zumino supermultiplet. We use lattice calculations to investigate the mass
shifts caused by ""double-hairpin"" annihilation diagrams in quenched QCD to test
for this degeneracy. Similar quark-antiquark annihilation processes are studied
in the 2-dimensional CP(N-1) model with quenched fermions.

non-linear sigma model on the supergroup PSU(1,1|2) is the essential building
block for string theory on AdS(3)xS(3)xT(4). Models associated with a
non-vanishing value of the RR flux can be obtained through a psu(1,1|2)
invariant marginal deformation of the WZNW model on PSU(1,1|2). We take this as
a motivation to present a manifestly psu(1,1|2) covariant construction of the
model at the Wess-Zumino point, corresponding to a purely NSNS background
3-form flux. At this point the model possesses an enhanced psu(1,1|2) current
algebra symmetry whose representation theory, including explicit character
formulas, is developed systematically in the first part of the paper. The space
of vertex operators and a free fermion representation for their correlation
functions is our main subject in the second part. Contrary to a widespread
claim, bosonic and fermionic fields are necessarily coupled to each other. The
interaction changes the supersymmetry transformations, with drastic
consequences for the multiplets of localized normalizable states in the model.
It is only this fact which allows us to decompose the full state space into
multiplets of the global supersymmetry. We analyze these decompositions
systematically as a preparation for a forthcoming study of the RR deformation.

arise via exponential tilting. As a special result it is shown that the
occupation time of a p-skewed random Bessel process or (generalized) bridge is
equivalent in distribution to the occupation time of a non-trivial randomly

strength of competition can be measured using the concept of a niche. A niche
comprises the set of requirements of an organism in terms of habitat,
environment and functional role. The more niches overlap, the stronger
competition is. The niche breadth is a measure of specialization: the smaller
the niche space of an organism, the more specialized the organism is. It
follows that, everything else being equal, generalists tend to be more
competitive than specialists. In this paper, we compare the outcome of
competition among generalists and specialists in a spatial versus a nonspatial
habitat in a heterogeneous environment. Generalists can utilize the entire
habitat, whereas specialists are restricted to their preferred habitat type. We
find that although competitiveness decreases with specialization, specialists
are more competitive in a spatial than in a nonspatial habitat as patchiness
increases.

Phys. Rev. A, 72, 053414 (2005)] it was proposed to use the residue theorem for
the exact calculation of the transition amplitude describing strong-field
ionization of atomic systems within Keldysh theory. This should avoid the
necessity to apply the method of steepest descent (saddle-point approximation).
Comparing the results of both approaches for atomic hydrogen a difference by a
factor of 2 was found for the 1s, and an even more drastic deviation for the 2s
state. Thus it was concluded that the use of the saddle-point approximation is
problematic. In this work the deviations are explained and it is shown that the
previous conclusion is based on an unjustified neglect of an important
contribution occurring in the application of the residue theorem. Furthermore,
the applicability of the method of steepest descent for the ionization of
Rydberg states is discussed and an improvement of the standard result is
suggested that successfully removes the otherwise drastic failure for large
principal quantum numbers.

Atmospheric Sciences",,,,"physics.ao-ph physics.geo-ph",,"  A new method of accurately calculating the capacitance of realistic ice
particles is described: such values are key to accurate estimates of deposition
and evaporation rates in NWP models. The trajectories of diffusing water
molecules are directly sampled, using random `walkers'. By counting how many of
these trajectories intersect the surface of the ice particle (which may be any
shape) and how many escape outside a spherical boundary far from the particle,
the capacitance of a number of model ice particle habits have been estimated,
including hexagonal columns and plates, `scalene' columns and plates, bullets,
bullet-rosettes, dendrites, and realistic aggregate snowflakes. For ice
particles with sharp edges and corners this method is an efficient and
straightforward way of solving Laplace's equation for the capacitance. Provided
that a large enough number of random walkers are used to sample the particle
geometry the authors expect the calculated capacitances to be accurate to
within ~1%. The capacitance for our modelled aggregate snowflakes (C/Dmax=0.25,
normalised by the maximum dimension Dmax) is shown to be in close agreement
with recent aircraft measurements of snowflake sublimation rates. This result
shows that the capacitance of a sphere (C/Dmax=0.5) which is commonly used in
numerical models, overestimates the evaporation rate by a factor of 2. The
effect of vapor `screening' by crystals growing in the vicinity of one another
has also been investigated. The results clearly show that neighbouring crystals
growing on a filament in cloud chamber experiments can strongly constrict the
vapor supply to each other, and the resulting growth rate measurements may
severely underestimate the rate for a single crystal in isolation (by a factor
of 3 in our model setup).

however, its dependence on the material parameters of the system and the
positions of the atoms is more complex. We also calculate the Casimir-Polder
