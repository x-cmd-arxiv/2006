Super-Earths. They are introducing a novel physical regime that has not been

of the bulk composition of Super-Earths will be possible in future transit

observed with a 15 sec cadence by the SOHO Solar EUV Monitor (SEM) since 1995.
During remarkably intense solar flares the SEM EUV measurements are saturated
in the central (zero) order channel (0.1 -- 50.0 nm) by the flare soft X-ray
and EUV flux. The first order EUV channel (26 -- 34 nm) is not saturated by the
flare flux because of its limited bandwidth, but it is sensitive to the arrival
of Solar Energetic Particles (SEP). While both channels detect nearly equal SEP
fluxes, their contributions to the count rate is sensibly negligible in the
zero order channel but must be accounted for and removed from the first channel
count rate. SEP contribution to the measured SEM signals usually follows the
EUV peak for the gradual solar flare events. Correcting the extreme solar flare
SEM EUV measurements may reveal currently unclear relations between the flare
magnitude, dynamics observed in different EUV spectral bands, and the measured
Earth atmosphere response. A simple and effective correction technique based on
analysis of SEM count-rate profiles, GOES X-ray, and GOES proton data has been
developed and used for correcting EUV measurements for the five extreme solar

with redshift of X-ray properties of radio-selected clusters provides an
important test of structure formation theories as, unlike X-ray selection, this
selection is not biased towards the most luminous clusters in the Universe. We
present new results from a sample of 19 luminous radio galaxies at redshifts
between 0.5 and 1. The properties of the gaseous atmosphere around these

figure of merit by considering power spectrum tomography. For this purpose, we
first consider an `ideal' survey which is both wide and deep and exempt from

studies, reaching one sigma precisions of 1% and 10% on the two parameters

degrading this ideal survey. In particular, we consider the effect of sky

systematics and uncertainties in the non-linear power spectrum predictions. We
find that, for a given observing time, it is always advantageous to choose a
wide rather than a deep survey geometry. We also find that the dark energy
constraints from power spectrum tomography are robust to photometric redshift
errors and catastrophic failures, if a spectroscopic calibration sample of
10^4-10^5 galaxies is available. The impact of these systematics is small
compared to the limitations that come from potential uncertainties in the power
spectrum, due to shear measurement and theoretical errors. To help the planning

influence of atomic level polarization on the emergent Stokes profiles for a
broad range of magnetic field strengths, in both 90 degree and forward
scattering geometry. We show that, contrary to a widespread belief, the
selective emission and absorption processes caused by the presence of atomic
level polarization may have an important influence on the emergent linear
polarization, even for magnetic field strengths as large as 1000 G.
Consequently, the modeling of the Stokes Q and U profiles should not be done by
taking only into account the contribution of the transverse Zeeman effect
within the framework of the Paschen-Back effect theory, unless the magnetic
field intensity of the observed plasma structure is sensibly larger than 1000
G. We point out also that in low-lying optically thick plasma structures, such
as those of active region filaments, the (horizontal) radiation field generated
by the structure itself may substantially reduce the positive contribution to
the anisotropy factor caused by the (vertical) radiation field coming from the
underlying solar photosphere, so that the amount of atomic level polarization
may turn out to be negligible. Only under such circumstances may the emergent
linear polarization of the He I 10830 multiplet in such regions of the solar

types, Ia and core-collapse supernovae. We test the SN-ABC performance on
published samples of SNe from the SNLS and GOODS projects that have both
broad-band photometry and spectroscopic classification (so the true type is
known). The SN-ABC correctly classifies up to 97% (85%) of the type Ia (II-P)
SNe in SNLS, and similar fractions of the GOODS SNe, depending on photometric
redshift quality. Using simulations with large artificial samples, we find
similarly high success fractions for type Ia and II-P, and reasonable (~75%)
success rates in classifying type Ibc SNe as core-collapse. Type IIn SNe,
however, are often misclassified as Ia's. In deep surveys, SNe Ia are best
classified at redshifts z >~ 0.6, or when near maximum, with success rates of
the order of 95%. Core-collapse SNe are best recognized several weeks after
maximum, or at z <~ 0.6, and reach success rates near 80%. Assuming the SNe are
young, as would be the case for rolling surveys, the success fractions improve,
by a degree dependent on the type and redshift. The SN-ABC also allows the
rejection of SN ""impostors"" such as active galactic nuclei (AGNs), with half of
of the AGNs we simulate rejected by the algorithm. Our algorithm also supplies
a good measure of the quality of the classification, which is valuable for
error estimation.

equivalent steady-state models, while CaII is weakened. Former successes of
steady-state CMFGEN models are unaffected, while former discrepancies are
cured. Time dependence affects all lines, while the continuum, from the UV to
the optical, changes only moderately. We identify two key effects: First, time
dependence together with the energy gain through changes in ionization and
excitation lead to an over-ionization in the vicinity of the photosphere,
dramatically affecting line optical depths and profiles. Second, the ionization
is frozen-in at large radii/velocities. This stems solely from the time-scale
contrast between recombination and expansion and will occur, modulo non-thermal

of 164 candidates with J = 10.5-18.7 mag from the (Z-J,Z) and (Y-J,Y) diagrams.
We further investigated the location of those candidates in the other
colour-magnitude and colour-colour diagrams to weed out contaminants. The
cross-correlation of the GCS catalogue with the 2MASS database confirms the
membership of 116 photometric candidates down to 20 Jupiter masses as they lie
within a 2 sigma circle centred on the association mean motion. The final list
of cluster members contains 129 sources with masses between 0.3 and 0.007 Msun.
We extracted a dozen new low-mass brown dwarfs below 20 Mjup, the limit of
previous surveys in the region. Finally, we have derived the mass function in
Upper Sco over the 0.3-0.01 Msun mass range, best fit by a single segment with
a slope of index alpha = 0.6+/-0.1, in agreement with previous determination in
open clusters.

provide very strong support for a quasi-periodicity of 15.5+-2 min. The mean
polarization of the flare is consistent with the direction of the electric
field vector that was reported in previous observations. The data can be

shows almost no temporal change. We find a distinct change of polarization
across the H$\alpha$ emission line, indicating the existence of polarization
component intrinsic to the microquasar. We estimate the interstellar
polarization (ISP) component from polarization of the H$\alpha$ line and derive
the intrinsic polarization component. The wavelength dependence of the
intrinsic component is well explained by Thomson scattering in equatorial disk
of the Be-type mass donor. The position angle (PA) of the intrinsic
polarization $\sim 25^{\circ}$ represents the rotational axis of the Be disk.
This PA is nearly perpendicular to the PA of the radio jet found during
quiescent phases. Assuming an orthogonal disk-jet geometry around the compact
star, the rotational axis of the accretion disk is almost perpendicular to that
of the Be disk. Moreover, according to the orbital parameters of the
microquasar, the compact star is likely to get across the Be disk around their
periastron passage. We discuss the peculiar circumstellar structure of this

identified nonextensive thermodynamics as an innovative approach to the
problem. The distribution function that results from adopting this framework
has the same form as for polytropes, but the polytropic index is now related to
the degree of nonextensiveness. In particular, the nonextensive approach can
mimic the equilibrium structure of dark matter density profiles found in

from ionized iron. There is no compelling evidence for significant broadening
of the line.We also detect a possible Doppler shifted absorption line at 8.1

gamma-rays, and thus are a good target for the Gamma Ray Large Area Space
Telescope (GLAST). As the blazars trace the large-scale structure of the
universe, one may observe spatial clustering of blazars. We calculate the
angular power spectrum of blazars that would be detected by GLAST. We show that
we have the best chance of detecting their clustering at large angular scales,
\theta >~ 10 deg, where shot noise is less important, and the dominant
contribution to the correlation comes from relatively low redshift, z <~ 0.1.
The GLAST can detect the correlation signal, if the blazars detected by GLAST
trace the distribution of low-z quasars observed by optical galaxy surveys,
which have the bias of unity. If the bias of blazars is greater than 1.5, GLAST
will detect the correlation signal unambiguously. We also find that GLAST may
detect spatial clustering of clusters of galaxies in gamma-rays. The shape of
the angular power spectrum is different for blazars and clusters of galaxies;
thus, we can separate these two contributions on the basis of the shape of the
power spectrum.

in the pulsar magnetosphere. Our discussion is based on the observationaly
infered fact that, as the pulsar spins down, the region of closed corotating
dipolar field lines grows with time. This implies that reconnection must take
place in the magnetosphere. We argue that non-dissipative reconnection along
the equatorial current sheet allows for the continuous channeling of pulsar
spindown energy into particle energy, all the way from the light cylinder to
the pulsar wind termination shock, and we propose that this effect may account
for the low \sigma values inferred by observations. We present a simple model
that allows us to relate the magnetic diffusivity in the equatorial current
sheet to an observable pulsar parameter, the braking index n. When n~1, the
global structure of the magnetosphere approaches that of a relativistic split
monopole where the pulsar spindown energy is carried by the electromagnetic
field. However, for values of n>1.5, almost all field lines close inside the
pulsar wind termination shock, and thus most of the electromagnetic pulsar
spindown energy flux is effectively transformed into particle energy in the
equatorial current sheet.

measuring its distance scale and the intrinsic burst properties. We performed a
detailed spectral and temporal analysis of both the prompt and the afterglow
emission and we estimated the distance scale of the likely host galaxy. We then
used the currently available sample of XRFs with known distance to discuss the
connection between XRFs and classical Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs). We found that
the prompt emission properties unambiguously identify this burst as an XRF,
with an observed peak energy of E_p=17+/-13 keV and a burst fluence ratio
S(2-30keV)/S(30-400keV)>1. A non-fading optical source with R~24 mag and with
an apparently extended morphology is spatially consistent with the X-ray
afterglow, likely the host galaxy. XRF 040912 is a very dark burst since no
afterglow optical counterpart is detected down to R>25 mag (3 sigma limiting
magnitude) at 13.6 hours after the burst. The host galaxy spectrum detected
from 3800A to 10000A, shows a single emission line at 9552A. The lack of any
other strong emission lines blue-ward of the detected one and the absence of
the Ly alpha cut-off down to 3800A are consistent with the hypothesis of the
[OII] line at redshift z=1.563+/-0.001. The intrinsic spectral properties rank
this XRF among the soft GRBs in the E_peak-E_iso diagram. Similar results were
obtained for most XRFs at known redshift. Only XRF 060218 and XRF 020903
represent a good example of instrinsic XRF(i-XRF) and are possibly associated
with a different progenitor population. This scenario may calls for a new

  At first the precession is treated in the linear approximation. For the
eigenmodes of the precession one has a `rule of geometric mean' for the
eigenfrequencies. For the eigenmodes pseudo-orthogonality relations are
obtained, which reflect the gyrotropic and elliptic character of the spin

pseudo-orthogonality relations are valid 'everywhere' (e.g., both in the outer

breaks the constraints of Purcell's scallop theorem, resulting in the
generation of a net propulsive force. This observation suggests a method to
design simple swimming devices - which we call ""elastic swimmers"" - where the
actuation mechanism is embedded in a solid body and the resulting swimmer is
free to move. In this paper, we study theoretically the kinematics of elastic
swimming. After discussing the basic physical picture of the phenomenon and the
expected scaling relationships, we derive analytically the elastic swimming
velocities in the limit of small actuation amplitude. The emphasis is on the
coupling between the two unknowns of the problems - namely the shape of the
elastic filament and the swimming kinematics - which have to be solved
simultaneously. We then compute the performance of the resulting swimming
device, and its dependance on geometry. The optimal actuation frequency and
body shapes are derived and a discussion of filament shapes and internal
torques is presented. Swimming using multiple elastic filaments is discussed,
and simple strategies are presented which result in straight swimming
trajectories. Finally, we compare the performance of elastic swimming with that
of swimming microorganisms.

theory in mesoscopic conductors employing the idea that heat is carried by the
quasiparticle modes propagating along the vortex core. We show that the vortex
heat conductance in a mesoscopic sample is strongly enhanced as compared to its
value for a bulk superconductor; it grows as the cylinder radius decreases.
This unusual behavior results from a strongly increased number of
single-particle transport modes due to giant mesoscopic oscillations of energy
levels, which originate from the interplay between the Andreev reflection at
the vortex core boundary and the normal reflection at the sample edge. We
derive the exact quantum-mechanical expression for the heat conductance and
solve the Bogoliubov--de Gennes equations numerically. The results of numerical
computations confirm the qualitative Landauer-type picture and allow us to take
into account the partial reflections of excitations. We analyze the effect of
surface imperfections on the spectrum of core excitations. We show that the

variable-rate signalling on the reverse link.
  Canonical family CQ has period N, normalized maximum-correlation parameter
theta_max bounded above by A sqrt(N), where 'A' ranges from 1.8 in the 16-QAM
case to 3.0 for large M. In a CDMA setting, each user is enabled to transfer 2m
bits of data per period of the spreading sequence which can be increased to 3m
bits of data by halving the size of the sequence family. The technique used to
construct CQ is easily extended to produce larger sequence families and an
example is provided.
  Selected family SQ has a lower value of theta_max but permits only (m+1)-bit
data modulation. The interleaved 16-QAM sequence family IQ has theta_max <=
sqrt(2) sqrt(N) and supports 3-bit data modulation.
  The remaining two families are over a quadrature-PAM (Q-PAM) subset of size
2M of the M^2-QAM constellation. Family P has a lower value of theta_max in
comparison with Family SQ, while still permitting (m+1)-bit data modulation.
Interleaved family IP, over the 8-ary Q-PAM constellation, permits 3-bit data
modulation and interestingly, achieves the Welch lower bound on theta_max.

explaining which extensions of the group of diffeomorphisms must be implemented

compare these different codes by monitoring the Einstein constraint equations,

predictions, which indeed seem to be mildly preferred by the data.
  When we take these corrections into account and extract string tensions from
the string masses, we find that their continuum limit is lower by 2%-1% from
the predictions of Karabli, Kim, and Nair. The discrepancy decreases with N,
but when we extrapolate our results to N=oo we still find a discrepancy of
0.88% which is a 4.5 sigma effect.

minimal Coulomb gauge. This leaves a residual or remnant gauge symmetry still
active which is global in three directions but still local in one. Using
averaged fourth-dimension pointing links as a spin-like order parameter, the
remnant symmetry appears to undergo spontaneous symmetry breaking at around
$\beta = 2.6$. Both the Binder cumulant and the magnetization itself exhibit
crossings in this region using lattices up to $20^4$, and a susceptibility peak
is also observed. Finite size scaling indicates a weak first-order transition.
The symmetry breaking is also observed to take place in the fundamental-adjoint
plane, and is coincident with the strong first-order transition that exists
there at large $\beta_{\rm{adjoint}}$. This provides confirmation that this
phase transition is a symmetry-breaking transition. A well-known theorem
concerning the instantaneous Coulomb potential has previously proven that a
transition where such a Coulomb-gauge remnant symmetry breaks is necessarily
deconfining.

correlations in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Using both
hydrodynamical and parametrized evolution models for the spacetime evolution of

different setups for the spacetime dependence of hard-parton energy losses.
Assuming that the energy loss of hard partons traversing the medium is
radiative and calculable in the BDMPS formalism, we adjust one parameter, the
quenching power scale, to the measured R_AA in each of the setups and study the
systematic variations of the back-to-back yield as a function of p_T. We show
which spacetime regions are probed by one-particle and two-particle observables
and study the role of longitudinal and transverse expansion in some detail. We
also comment on the importance of considering fluctuations around the average
energy loss. We conclude that while current data are too limited in momentum
coverage, future data for higher trigger energy might provide the lever arm in
away side hadron momentum necessary to perform medium tomography, provided that
sufficient precision can be achieved.

the Randall-Sundrum system and avoiding the restriction to orbifold geometries
as well as the introduction of the branes in the action by hand. We begin by
obtaining a smooth brane configuration that preserves 4D Poincar'e invariance

can have either compact or extended topology, depending on the values of the
parameters of the solution. In the non-compact case, our field configuration
represents a thick brane with positive energy density centered at y=c_2,
whereas in the compact case we get pairs of thick branes. We recast as well the
wave equations of the transverse traceless modes of the linear fluctuations of
the classical solution into a Schroedinger's equation form with a volcano
potential of finite bottom. We solve Schroedinger equation for the massless
zero mode m^2=0 and obtain a single bound wave function which represents a
stable 4D graviton and is free of tachyonic modes with m^2<0. We also get a
continuum spectrum of Kaluza-Klein (KK) states with m^2>0 that are suppressed
at y=c_2 and turn asymptotically into plane waves. We found a particular case

where in the simplest case it reproduces a spectrum similar to slow-roll models
of inflation. We also find the model provides a reasonable reheating
temperature after inflation ends. This type of model may also be relevant for
addressing the smallness of the vacuum energy today.

It is a consequence of the existence of an integrable marginal operator build
on, generically, non-Abelian parafermion bilinears. These are dressed with the
dilaton supported by the extra radial dimension, whose asymptotic value defines
the boundary. Depending on the hierarchy, this boundary can be time-like or

classical mechanics from first principles. Formulation is performed in
completely alternative way, i.e. without any resort to fuzzy and/or star
product philosophy, which are extensively applied within noncommutative quantum
theories. Newton-Lagrange noncommutative equations of motion are formulated and
their properties are analyzed from the pure geometrical point of view. It is
argued that the dynamical quintessence of the system consists in its kinetic
energy (Riemannian metric) specifying Riemann-Levi-Civita connection and thus
the inertia geodesics of the free motion. Throughout the paper,
''noncommutativity'' is considered as an internal geometric structure of the
configuration space, which can not be ''observed'' per se. Manifestation of the
noncommutative phenomena is mediated by the interaction of the system with
noncommutative background under the consideration. The simplest model of the
interaction (minimal coupling) is proposed and it is shown that guiding affine
connection is modified by the quadratic analog of the Lorentz electromagnetic
force (contortion term).

rate of a Poisson process from a known value to an unknown and unobservable
value at an unknown and unobservable disorder time. Our objective is to design
an alarm time which is adapted to the history of the arrival process and
detects the disorder time as soon as possible. In previous solvable versions of
the Poisson disorder problem, the arrival rate after the disorder has been
assumed a known constant. In reality, however, we may at most have some prior
information about the likely values of the new arrival rate before the disorder
actually happens, and insufficient estimates of the new rate after the disorder
happens. Consequently, we assume in this paper that the new arrival rate after
the disorder is a random variable. The detection problem is shown to admit a
finite-dimensional Markovian sufficient statistic, if the new rate has a
discrete distribution with finitely many atoms. Furthermore, the detection
problem is cast as a discounted optimal stopping problem with running cost for
a finite-dimensional piecewise-deterministic Markov process. This optimal
stopping problem is studied in detail in the special case where the new arrival
rate has Bernoulli distribution. This is a nontrivial optimal stopping problem
for a two-dimensional piecewise-deterministic Markov process driven by the same
point process. Using a suitable single-jump operator, we solve it fully,
describe the analytic properties of the value function and the stopping region,
and present methods for their numerical calculation. We provide a concrete
example where the value function does not satisfy the smooth-fit principle on a
proper subset of the connected, continuously differentiable optimal stopping
boundary, whereas it does on the complement of this set.

transformed into a set of beam acoustic modes [L. Yin et al., Phys. Rev. E 73,
025401 (2006)]. For the first time, a low phase velocity electron acoustic wave
(EAW) is seen developing from the self-consistent Raman physics. Backscatter of
the pump laser off the EAW fluctuations is reported and referred to as electron
acoustic Thomson scatter. This light is similar in wavelength to, although much
lower in amplitude than, the reflected light between the pump and SRBS
wavelengths observed in single hot spot experiments, and previously interpreted
as stimulated electron acoustic scatter [D. S. Montgomery et al., Phys. Rev.
Lett. 87, 155001 (2001)]. The EAW is strongest well below the phase-matched
frequency for electron acoustic scatter, and therefore the EAW is not produced
by it. The beating of different beam acoustic modes is proposed as the EAW
excitation mechanism, and is called beam acoustic decay. Supporting evidence
for this process, including bispectral analysis, is presented. The linear
electrostatic modes, found by projecting the numerical distribution function
onto a Gauss-Hermite basis, include beam acoustic modes (some of which are
unstable even without parametric coupling to light waves) and a strongly-damped
EAW similar to the observed one. This linear EAW results from non-Maxwellian
features in the electron distribution, rather than nonlinearity due to electron
trapping.

determined using results from group theory and isomer chemistry. We demonstrate

stomatal pores, each of which is regulated by a surrounding pair of guard
cells. During drought, the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) inhibits stomatal
opening and promotes stomatal closure, thereby promoting water conservation.
Here we synthesize experimental results into a consistent guard cell signal
transduction network for ABA-induced stomatal closure, and develop a dynamic
model of this process. Our model captures the regulation of more than forty
identified network components, and accords well with previous experimental
results at both the pathway and whole cell physiological level. Our analysis
reveals the novel predictions that the disruption of membrane depolarizability,
anion efflux, actin cytoskeleton reorganization, cytosolic pH increase, the
phosphatidic acid pathway or of K+ efflux through slowly activating K+ channels
at the plasma membrane lead to the strongest reduction in ABA responsiveness.
Initial experimental analysis assessing ABA-induced stomatal closure in the
presence of cytosolic pH clamp imposed by the weak acid butyrate is consistent
with model prediction. Our method can be readily applied to other biological
signaling networks to identify key regulatory components in systems where
quantitative information is limited.

involve two or more macroscopically distinct alternatives for a particle as a
pure {\it combined} one - the intermediate link between a pure {\it elementary}
state (indecomposable into macroscopically distinct parts) and statistical
mixture; (2) at the mathematical level, QM must provide the presentation of the
pure time-dependent combined state as a coherent superposition of
macroscopically distinct elementary states (MDESs); (3) at the experimental
level, QM must provide for such states two types of measurements - those for
observing the interference pattern resulting from the joint action of MDESs,
and non-demolishing 'which-way' measurements for scanning the individual
properties of MDESs.

quantum emitter and a single radiation-field mode. When an atom is in strong
coupling with a cavity mode1,2, it is possible to realize key quantum
information processing (QIP) tasks, such as controlled coherent coupling and
entanglement of distinguishable quantum systems. Realizing these tasks in the
solid state is clearly desirable, and coupling semiconductor self-assembled
quantum dots (QDs) to monolithic optical cavities is a promising route to this
end. However, validating the efficacy of QDs in QIP applications requires
confirmation of the quantum nature of the QD-cavity system in the strong
coupling regime. Here we find a confirmation by observing quantum correlations
in photoluminescence (PL) from a photonic crystal (PC) nanocavity3-5
interacting with one, and only one, QD located precisely at the cavity electric
field maximum. When off-resonance, photon emission from the cavity mode and QD
excitons is anti-correlated at the level of single quanta, proving that the
mode is driven solely by the QD despite an energy mis-match between cavity and
excitons. When tuned into resonance, the exciton and photon enter the
strong-coupling regime of cavity-QED and the QD lifetime reduces by a factor of
120. The photon stream from the cavity becomes anti-bunched, proving that the
coupled exciton/photon system is in the quantum anharmonic regime. Our
observations unequivocally show that QIP tasks requiring the quantum nonlinear
regime are achievable in the solid state.
