on dust grains and cosmic ray and photo destruction are included in
one-dimensional model slab clouds which incorporate time-independent density
and temperature distributions. We calculate 21cm spectral line profiles seen in
absorption against a background provided by general Galactic HI emission, and
compare the model spectra with HI Narrow Self-Absorption, or HINSA, profiles
absorbed in a number of nearby molecular clouds. The time evolution of the HI
and H2 densities is dramatic, with the atomic hydrogen disappearing in a wave
propagating from the central, denser regions which have a shorter H2 formation
time scale, to the edges, where the density is lower and the time scale for H2
formation longer. The model 21cm spectra are characterized by very strong
absorption at early times, when the HI column density through the model clouds
is extremely large. The minimum time required for a cloud to have evolved to
its observed configuration, based on the model spectra, is set by the
requirement that most of the HI in the outer portions of the cloud, which
otherwise overwhelms the narrow absorption, be removed. The characteristic time
that has elapsed since cloud compression and initiation of the HI to H2
conversion is a few x 10^{14} s or ~ 10^7 yr. This sets a minimum time for the
age of these molecular clouds and thus for the star formation that may take
place within them.

range of galaxy host properties. Also, we compare the X-ray hydrogen column

Below $\dot E_c$, the 2-10 keV PWN flux ratio $F_{PWN}/F_{PSR}$ decreases by an
order-of-magnitude. This threshold is predicted by the lower limit on the

the Mileura Wide-Field Array (MWA), will cover in 8 kHz bins the entire

which our civilization emits most of its radio power. We show that this and

molecular gas mass, and is consistent with most of their IR luminosities

radiative pressure onto the star-forming dense molecular gas. The highly

lenticular galaxies. This correlation is not present at later Hubble types,
where a sample of 31 active and 31 inactive galaxies all contain circumnuclear
dust. These archival, HST observations reveal a wide range of mostly chaotic
dust morphologies. Current estimates suggest the dust settling or destruction
time is on order of 10^8 years and therefore the presence of dust in ~ 50% of
early-type galaxies requires frequent replenishment and similarly frequent
fueling of their central, supermassive black holes. The observed dust could be
internally-produced (via stellar winds) or externally-accreted, although there
are observational challenges for both of these scenarios. Our analysis also
reveals that approximately a third of the early-type galaxies without
circumnuclear dust have nuclear stellar disks. These nuclear stellar disks may
provide a preferred kinematic axis to externally-accreted material and this
material may in turn form new stars in these disks. The observed incidence of

replenishment of nuclear stellar disks occurs and is approximately concurrent
with the fueling of the central AGN.

has been the recent discovery by INTEGRAL and RXTE of flat, hard X-ray
components in three AXPs. These non-thermal spectral components differ
dramatically from the steeper quasi-power-law tails seen in the classic X-ray
band in these sources. A prime candidate mechanism for generating this new
component is resonant, magnetic Compton upscattering. This process is very
efficient in the strong magnetic fields present in AXPs. Here an introductory
exploration of an inner magnetospheric model for upscattering of surface
thermal X-rays in AXPs is offered, preparing the way for an investigation of
whether such resonant upscattering can explain the 20-150 keV spectra seen by
INTEGRAL. Characteristically flat emission spectra produced by non-thermal
electrons injected in the emission region are computed using collision
integrals. A relativistic QED scattering cross section is employed so that
Klein-Nishina reductions are influential in determining the photon spectra and
fluxes. Spectral results depend strongly on the magnetospheric locale of the
scattering and the observer's orientation, which couple directly to the angular
distributions of photons sampled.

accretion disks in active galactic nuclei. The gas, gravitationally captured by
a super massive black hole, can be driven away by the energy and momentum of
the radiation emitted during black hole accretion. Assuming axisymmetry, I
study how the mass accretion and outflow rates, and the flow dynamics respond
to changes in radiation heating relative to radiation pressure. I find that for
a 10^8 MSUN black hole with the accretion luminosity of 0.6 of the Eddington
luminosity the flow settles into a steady state and has two components: (1) an
equatorial inflow and (2) a bipolar inflow/outflow with the outflow leaving the
system along the disk rotational axis. The inflow is a realization of a
Bondi-like accretion flow. The second component is an example of a non-radial
accretion flow which becomes an outflow once it is pushed close to the
rotational axis where thermal expansion and radiation pressure accelerate it
outward. The main result of this preliminary work is that although the above
two-component solution is robust, its properties are sensitive to the geometry
and spectral energy distribution of the radiation field.

that these disks are seen nearly edge-on, looking just over the edge of a
puffed-up inner rim, formed roughly at the dust sublimation radius. We find
that a single, relatively simple model is consistent with all the available
observational constraints spanning 4 orders of magnitude in wavelength and
spatial scales, providing strong support for this interpretation of UX Orionis
stars. The grains in the upper layers of the puffed-up inner rim must be small
(0.01-0.4 micron) to reproduce the colors (R_V ~ 3.6) of the extinction events,
while the shape and strength of the mid-infrared silicate emission features
indicate that grains in the outer disk (> 1-2 AU) are somewhat larger (0.3-3.0
micron). From the model fit, the location of the puffed-up inner rim is
estimated to be at a dust temperature of 1500 K or at 0.7-0.8 AU for small
grains. This is almost twice the rim radius estimated from near-infrared
interferometry. A best fitting model for the inner rim in which large grains in
the disk mid-plane reach to within 0.25 AU of the star, while small grains in
the disk surface create a puffed-up inner rim at ~0.7-0.8 AU, is able to
reproduce all the data, including the near-infrared visibilities. [Abstract

structure of the VV Ser disk has been constrained using a wide range of
observational data modeled by an axisymmetric Monte Carlo radiative transfer
code. In this paper we employ the model to study the nebulosity surrounding VV
Ser using quantum-heated PAH molecules and Very Small Grains (VSGs) consisting
of amorphous carbon in the thermal cooling approximation. Imprinted on the
nebulosity is a wedge-shaped dark band, centered on the star. We interpret this
dark wedge as the shadow cast by the inner regions of a near-edge-on disk in UV
light, allowing the PAHs to be excited only outside of this shadow. The
presence of a disk shadow strongly constrains the inclination as well as the
position angle of the disk. Although depending on the adopted PAH opacity, the
abundance of PAHs in the surrounding cloud is constrained to 5+/-2% of the
total dust mass, given the opacity. The extent of the nebulosity constrains the
density of the gas surrounding the VV Ser disk to 500+/-200 cm-3 for a
gas-to-dust ratio of 100. This low density suggests that the quantum heated
material is not part of the original envelope of VV Ser and that it is rather a
quiescent part of the Serpens molecular cloud that the star has passed into
after being formed. [Abstract abridged]

equations that appear in Sobouti's theory. We show in this article that the

of gravitational waves travelling at the speed of light in vacuum. In fact,
this is proved in general terms for all metric theories of gravity which can be
expressed as powers of Ricci's scalar. We also show that an extra additional

in the development of relativistic theories of gravity that could provide an

powerful HII regions, consistent with the majority of AGN in this local sample

observations show a clear correlation between the radio emission and the
orientation of the magnetosphere of this oblique rotator. Radio emission is
explained as the result of the acceleration of the wind particles in the
current sheets just beyond the Alfv\'en radius, that eventually return toward
the star following the magnetic field and emitting radiation by gyrosyncrotron
mechanism. The accelerated electrons have a hard energetic spectrum
($N(E)\propto E^{-2}$) and the acceleration process has an efficiency of about
$10^{-3}$. The Alfv\'en radius we determined is in the range of $12-17 R_\ast$

enough, some properties of circumstellar envelopes were derived by comparison
with spectra computed using a radiative transfer code. Of the 24 objects in our
sample, we detected millimetric continuum emission toward 11 sources. Two other
sources were detected at flux level close to 3$\sigma$. The derived
circumstellar dust masses range between 0.4 and $24 \times 10^{-4}$
M$_{\odot}$, but these results are affected from the uncertain about the source
distances. The parameters derived from the SED fits are consistent with the
values characteristic for these kind of object. As confirmed from the flux
density extrapolated in the first light channels of the Atacama Large
Millimetric Array, such sources would be good targets for future high
resolution mapping with the ALMA facility.

  Revista Mexicana de Astronomia y Astrofisica",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In order to find a law characterising the decrease of velocity along a jet,
five analytical methods are suggested. The first two simple models examine the
variation of velocity in the presence of Newton's or Stoke's resistance. The
equation that represents the conservation of the momentum along a pyramidal
sector is solved from an analytical point of view (third model). The
application of the conservation of the total momentum flux allows us to deduce
the velocity of the galaxy as a function of time for classical velocities
(fourth model) and relativistic velocities (fifth model). The variation of
velocity along the jet combined with an adequate composition of jet precession
velocity, rotational velocity of the galaxy, and galaxy dispersion velocity in
the cluster allows us to trace the geometrical pattern of the head-tail radio
sources. Application of the developed theory/code to the radio galaxies
NGC1265,NGC4061,NGC326, and Cygnus A gives the central galaxy's approximate
dispersion velocities in the direction perpendicular to the jet. A transition
from head--tails to classical double radio galaxies as a function of the
increasing jet's mechanical power is introduced.

that the disks are dissipated, starting from the inner region, by the radiation
of the central star and eventually by the formation of rocky planetesimals,
over a time scale of several million years. It was also shown that strong UV
radiation emitted by nearby massive stars can heat a circumstellar disk up to
some thousand degrees, inducing the photoevaporation of the gas. This process
strongly reduces the dissipation time scale. Aims: we study whether there
exists a correlation between the spatial distribution of stars with
circumstellar disks and the position of massive stars with spectral class
earlier than B5, in the open cluster NGC 6611. Methods: we created a multiband
catalog of the cluster, down to V~23, using optical data from a WFI observation
at 2.2m of ESO in the BVI bands, the 2MASS public point source catalog and an
archival X-ray observation made with CHANDRA/ACIS. We selected the stars with
infrared excess (due to the emission of a circumstellar disk) using suitable
color indices independent of extinction, and studied their spatial
distribution. Results: the spatial distribution of the stars with K band excess
(due to the presence of a circumstellar disk) is anti correlated with that of
the massive stars: the disks are more frequent at large distances from these
stars. We argue that this is in agreement with the hypothesis that the
circumstellar disks are heated by the UV radiation from the massive stars and
photoevaporated.

substantial corrections for the effects of line blending, which are only

not significantly affected by blending. Complete Stromgren uvby light curves
have been obtained and accurate radii have been measured from them using the
Wilson-Devinney program, constrained by an accurate spectroscopic light ratio.

wavelength. IRAC 4.5 micron traces extended stellar photospheric emission from
the body of the galaxy and hot dust continuum coming mainly from star-forming

horizontal branch (Rich et al.), together with a strong slope upward from the

corresponding to the well-known second parameter problem, are not explained by
conventional evolutionary models. Helium self-enrichment is proposed as a
possible solution to both questions, a mechanism already invoked for the
interpretation of the peculiarities in NGC 2808 and M13. We make use of
horizontal branch simulations, covering a wide range in main sequence helium
abundance, to investigate whether the main features of NGC 6441 horizontal
branch population, including the RR Lyrae variables period, can be reproduced.
To describe the horizontal branch of NGC 6441, the helium content Y in the red
clump must reach at least 0.35; values up to Y~0.37 are necessary to populate
the RR Lyr region, reproducing also the observed mean long periods; depending
on the dispersion in mass loss assumed in the simulations, values up to
Y~0.38--0.40 are necessary to populate the blue HB. The total self--enriched
population amounts to ~60% of the whole stellar content. Self-enrichment and
multiple star formation episodes in the early evolution of globular clusters
appear more and more able to account for many of the chemical and population
peculiarities observed in these systems. The very large helium abundances
(Y>0.35) required for ~14% of the horizontal branch population pose some
problem on the enrichment mechanisms.

larger than the ground state atoms are undergoing delta transitions (n~1009,
Delta n=4) in the cool tenuous medium located in the Perseus arm in front of
the supernova remnant, Cassiopeia A. Theoretical estimates had shown that atoms
which recombined in tenuous media are stable up to quantum levels n~1500. Our
data indicates that we have detected radiation from atoms in states very close
to this theoretical limit. We also report high signal-to-noise detections of
alpha, beta and gamma transitions in carbon atoms arising in the same clouds.
In these data, we find that the increase in line widths with quantum number
(proportional to n^5) due to pressure and radiation broadening of lines is much
gentler than expected from existing models which assume a power law background
radiation field. This discrepancy had also been noted earlier. The model line
widths had been overestimated since the turnover in radiation field of
Cassiopeia A at low frequencies had been ignored. In this paper, we show that,
once the spectral turnover is included in the modeling, the slower increase in
line width with quantum number is naturally explained.

implied SHB rates that we find range from \sim 8 to \sim 30h_(70)^3

such formation and dispersion cycles. The chemistry of the dense gas in
subsequent cycles is similar to that of the first, and a limit cycle is reached
quickly (2 - 3 cycles). Enhancement of hydrocarbon abundances during a specific
period of evolution is the strongest indicator of previous dynamical history.
The molecular content of the diffuse background gas in the molecular cloud is
expected to be strongly enhanced by the core formation and dispersion process.
Such enhancement may remain for as long as 0.5 Myr. The frequency of repetitive
core formation should strongly determine the level of background molecular
enhancement. We also convolve the emission from a synthesised dark cloud,
comprised of ensembles of transient dense cores. We find that the dynamical
history of the gas, and therefore the chemical state of the diffuse inter-core
medium, may be determined if a sufficient sample of cores is present in an
ensemble. Molecular ratios of key hydrocarbons with SO and SO2 are crucial to
this distinction. Only surveys with great enough angular resolution to resolve
individual cores, or very small groupings, are expected to show evidence of
repetitive dynamical processing. The existence of non-equilibrium chemistry in
the diffuse background may have implications for the initial conditions used in
chemical models. Observed variations in the chemistries of diffuse and
translucent regions may be explained by lines of sight which intersect a number

conserved locally. The isotropy and relaxation to equilibrium are analyzed and
measured. It is shown how a discrete-time projection operator technique can be
used to obtain Green-Kubo relations for the transport coefficients. Because of
a large viscosity no long-time tails in the velocity auto-correlation and
stress correlation functions were seen. Strongly reduced self-diffusion due to
caging and an order/disorder transition is found at high collision frequency,
where clouds consisting of at least four particles form a cubic phase. These
structures were analyzed by measuring the pair-correlation function above and
below the transition. Finally, the algorithm is extended to binary mixtures

undoubtedly signifies a gap over which the charge carriers are thermally

fluctuations are present at high temperature and the carrier number is not a

(RBS), which are efficient methods for multielemental analysis. Elemental maps
of major and trace elements were obtained at a micrometer scale and revealed
the bone bonding ability of the material. The formation of a calcium
phosphate-rich layer containing magnesium occurs after a few days of
interaction. We demonstrate that the presence of phosphorus in the material has
an impact on the development and the formation rate of the bone-like apatite
layer. Indeed, the Ca/P atomic ratio at the glass/biological fluids interface
is closer to the nominal value of pure apatite compared to P2O5 free glasses.
It would permit, in vivo, an improved chemical bond between the biomaterials
and bone.

to another is calculated with a standard electron-optical phonon hamiltonian,
and the electronic transport results from a parallel flow of electrons using
all the possible paths through the different subbands. Finally, the resistance
of such a complex device is given by a simple expression, with an excellent
agreement with experimental results. This relation involves the sum of
transitions rates between subbands, from one period of the device to the next

antenna broadcast (downlink) channel that involves transmission of multiple
data streams to each receiver such that no multi-user interference is
experienced at any of the receivers. This low-complexity scheme operates only a
few dB away from capacity but does require very accurate channel knowledge at
the transmitter, which can be very difficult to obtain in fading scenarios. We
consider a limited feedback system where each receiver knows its channel
perfectly, but the transmitter is only provided with a finite number of channel
feedback bits from each receiver. Using a random vector quantization argument,
we quantify the throughput loss due to imperfect channel knowledge as a
function of the feedback level. The quality of channel knowledge must improve
proportional to the SNR in order to prevent interference-limitations, and we
show that scaling the number of feedback bits linearly with the system SNR is
sufficient to maintain a bounded rate loss. Finally, we investigate a simple
scalar quantization scheme that is seen to achieve the same scaling behavior as
vector quantization.

Kant to Hermann Minkowksi to Albert Einstein, the question of the nature of
space and time has occupied scientists and philosophers. In the
four-dimensional space-time of Einstein's wonderful theory of gravity, the
squared interval, in units such that the speed of light is unity, is the
difference between a squared time increment and the sum of three squares
representing the three dimensions of spatial change. More recently higher
dimensional theories have been proposed, which aim to unify gravity with the
other forces in nature. Such theories typically have a hyperbolic character in
that there is one time variable and many spatial variables (rather than just
three) in the formula for the squared interval. Here a new physical theory is
advanced, based on spinors, which clearly predicts that the basic extra
dimensions are timelike: in its simplest form, there are three timelike and
three spatial degrees of freedom. It is expected that devices such as the Large
Hadron Collider will be sensitive to these new degrees of freedom and thus one
may hope that in the near future, this issue can be settled experimentally

autocorrelation or Patterson measure. A model set LAMBDA within a given cut and
project scheme is a Delone set that is defined through a window W in internal
space. The autocorrelation measure of LAMBDA is a pure point measure whose
coefficients can be calculated via the so-called covariogram of W. Two windows
with the same covariogram thus result in homometric model sets. On the other
hand, the inverse problem of determining LAMBDA from its diffraction image
ultimately amounts to reconstructing W from its covariogram. This is also known
as Matheron's covariogram problem. It is well studied in convex geometry, where
certain uniqueness results have been obtained in recent years. However, for
non-convex windows, uniqueness fails in a relevant way, so that interesting
applications to the homometry problem emerge. We discuss this in a simple
setting and show a planar example of distinct homometric model sets.

Perfectly reflecting boundary conditions are imposed on the system and all the

compactness argument to construct a sequence of measures that converge weakly
to a solution of the governing equation. Since the proof of existence is a

of diverse types, including measurements that we may consider binary, ordinal
and continuous. One approach to the analysis of such mixed data is to use a
copula model, in which the associations among the variables are parameterized
separately from their univariate marginal distributions. The purpose of this
article is to provide a method of semiparametric inference for copula models
via the construction of what we call a marginal set likelihood function for the
association parameters. The proposed method of inference can be viewed as a
generalization of marginal likelihood estimation, in which inference for a
parameter of interest is based on a summary statistic whose sampling
distribution is not a function of any nuisance parameters. In the context of
copula estimation, the marginal set likelihood is a function of the association
parameters only and its applicability does not depend on any assumptions about
the marginal distributions of the data, thus making it appropriate for the
analysis of mixed continuous and discrete data with arbitrary margins.
Estimation and inference for parameters of the Gaussian copula are available
via a straightforward Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm based on Gibbs
sampling.

expression and protein interaction networks occurs during infection. To
identify potential genome-wide protein interactions between variola and humans,
we performed a protein domain analysis of all smallpox and human proteins. We
found that only 55 of the 161 protein domains in smallpox are also present in
the human genome. These co-occurring domains are mostly represented in proteins
involved in blood coagulation, complement activation, angiogenesis,
inflammation, and hormone transport. Several of these proteins are within the
