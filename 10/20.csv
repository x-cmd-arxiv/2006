M_sun and ages between ~ 5 - 100 Myr, assuming a simple starburst star
formation history. However, stellar populations as old as 700 Myr are
admissible if a constant star formation rate model is considered. Very deep
near-IR observations may help to narrow the range of allowed models by
providing extra constraints on the rest-frame UV spectral slope. Our
narrow-band selected objects and other IRAC-detected z ~ 6 i'-dropout galaxies
have similar 3.6 um magnitudes and z' - [3.6] colors, suggesting that they
posses stellar populations of similar masses and ages. This similarity may be
the result of a selection bias, since the IRAC-detected LAEs and i'-dropouts
probably only sample the bright end of the luminosity function. On the other
hand, our LAEs have blue i' - z' colors compared to the i'-dropouts, and would
have been missed by the i'-dropout selection criterion. A better understanding
of the overlap between the LAE and the i'-dropout populations is necessary in
order to constrain the properties of the overall high-redshift galaxy
population, such as the total stellar mass density at z ~ 6.

cataclysmic variables (CVs). The calibration of the surface brightness of field
dwarfs of near-solar metalicity with spectral types A0 to L8 covers all
secondary spectral types detectable in CVs and related objects and will aid in
the measurement of their distances. The calibrations are based on the radii of
field dwarfs measured by the Infrared Flux Method and by interferometry.
Published photometry is used and homogenized to the Cousins Rc and Ic and the
CIT JHK photometric systems. The narrow band surface brightness at 7500A is
based on our own and published spectrophotometry. Care is taken to select the
dwarfs for near-solar metalicity, appropriate to CVs, and to avoid errors
caused by unrecognized binarity. Relations are provided for the surface
brightness in V, Rc, Ic, J, H, K and in a narrow band at 7500A as functions of
V-K and of spectral type. The method is tested with selected CVs for which
independent information on their distances is available. The observed spread in
the radii of early M-dwarfs of given mass or luminosity and its influence on
the distance measurements of CVs is discussed. As long as accurate
trigonometric parallaxes are not routinely available for a large number of CVs,
the surface brightness method remains a reliable means of determining distances
to CVs in which a spectral signature of the secondary star can be discerned.

combining a realisation of the Millennium Simulation (Springel et al.) with a
simulation of a smaller volume focussing on dwarf haloes, our study spans five
decades in halo mass, from 10^10 Msun/h to 10^15 Msun/h. We find that the
baryon fraction within the halo virial radius is typically 90% of the cosmic
mean, with an rms scatter of 6%, independently of redshift and of halo mass
down to the smallest resolved haloes. Our results show that, contrary to the
proposal of Mo et al. (2005), pre-virialisation gravitational heating is unable
to prevent the collapse of gas within galactic and proto-galactic haloes, and
confirm the need for non-gravitational feedback in order to reduce the
efficiency of gas cooling and star formation in dwarf galaxy haloes.
Simulations including a simple photoheating model (where a gas temperature
floor of T_{floor} = 2x10^4 K is imposed from z=11) confirm earlier suggestions
that photoheating can only prevent the collapse of baryons in systems with
virial temperatures T_{200} < ~2.2 T_{floor} ~ 4.4x10^4 K (corresponding to a
virial mass of M_{200} ~ 10^10 Msun/h and a circular velocity of V_{200} ~ 35
km/s). Photoheating may thus help regulate the formation of dwarf spheroidals
and other galaxies at the extreme faint-end of the luminosity function, but it
cannot, on its own, reconcile the abundance of sub-L* galaxies with the vast
number of dwarf haloes expected in the LambdaCDM cosmogony. The lack of
evolution or mass dependence seen in the baryon fraction augurs well for X-ray
cluster studies that assume a universal and non-evolving baryon fraction to
place constraints on cosmological parameters.

is also described, which approximately corrects for any residuals to the
shapelet expansions. A series of tests on simulated images shows that with this

creation of an extended density wave in the disk created by tidal forces. We
also discuss estimates of the size of the disk from the H-alpha equivalent
width measurements, and we suggest that the disk radius from the average
equivalent width corresponds to a resonant truncation radius of the disk while
the maximum equivalent width corresponds to a radius limited by the separation

we study the effects that opacity and noise have on the determination of Df. We
focus on two different fractal dimension estimators: the perimeter-area based
dimension (Dper) and the mass-size dimension (Dm). We first use simulated
fractal clouds to show that opacity does not affect the estimation of Dper.
However, Dm tends to increase as opacity increases and this estimator fails
when applied to optically thick regions. In addition, very noisy maps can
seriously affect the estimation of both Dper and Dm, decreasing the final
estimation of Df. We apply these methods to emission maps of Ophiuchus, Perseus
and Orion molecular clouds in different molecular lines and we obtain that the
fractal dimension is always in the range 2.6 < Df < 2.8 for these regions.
These results support the idea of a relatively high (> 2.3) average fractal
dimension for the interstellar medium, as traced by different chemical species.

Interesting, although perhaps not compelling, evidence has been found for solar
g modes in observations with the GOLF instrument on the SOHO spacecraft.
Extensive asteroseismic results have been obtained from ground-based
observations as well as from the WIRE and MOST satellites, and much is expected
from the upcoming launch of the CoRoT satellite and, in a few years, from the
Kepler mission. In parallel, stellar modelling is being extended to take some
account of hydrodynamical effects, while large-scale hydrodynamical
calculations are providing increasingly realistic simulations of these effects.
The outcome of these activities will undoubtedly be a far better understanding
of stellar internal properties and stellar evolution, together with an improved
insight into the physics of matter under the extreme conditions found in stars.

radially stratified molecular cloud, whose density distribution is represented
as n(r) \propto r^-w. We focus on cases with w \leq 1.5, when the ionization
front is ``trapped'' in the cloud and expands with the preceding shock front.
The simultaneous evolution of the outer photodissociation region (PDR) is
examined in detail. First, we analytically probe the time evolution of the
column densities of the shell and envelope outside the HII region, which are
key physical quantities for the shielding of dissociating photons. Next, we
perform numerical calculations, and study how the thermal/chemical structure of
the outer PDR changes with different density gradients. We apply our numerical
model to the Galactic HII region, Sharpless 219 (Sh219). The time evolution of
the column densities of the shell and outer envelope depends on w, and
qualitatively changes across w = 1. In the cloud with w < 1, the shell column
density increases as the HII region expands. The DFs are finally trapped in the
shell, and the molecular gas gradually accumulates in the shell. The molecular
shell and envelope surround the HII region. With w > 1, on the other hand, the
shell column density initially increases, but finally decreases. The column
density of the outer envelope also quickly decreases as the HII region swells
up. It becomes easier and easier for the dissociating photons to penetrate the
shell and envelope. The PDR broadly extends around the trapped HII region. A
model with w = 1.5 successfully explains the observational properties of Sh219.
Our model suggests that a density-bounded PDR surrounds the photon-bounded HII
region in Sh219.

statistically significant variability over a range of about $0.05\pm0.01$ mag.
This can not be explained by known systematics, background objects or some
periodical variation with periods less than two days in the light-curve. The
same applies to B, V and to less extent to I due to larger errors. In analogy
with Pluto and if confirmed by future observations, this ``long term''

difference to planets orbiting single stars can shed light on the formation and
evolution of planetary systems. As planets were found around components of
binaries with very different separation and mass ratio, it is particularly
important to study the characteristics of planets as a function of the
effective gravitational influence of the companion. A compilation of planets in
binary systems was made; a search for companions orbiting stars recently shown
to host planets was performed, resulting in the addition of two further binary
planet hosts (HD 20782 and HD 109749). The probable original properties of the
three binary planet hosts with white dwarfs companions were also investigated.
Using this updated sample of planets in binaries we performed a statistical
analysis of the distributions of planet mass, period, and eccentricity,
fraction of multiplanet systems, and stellar metallicity for planets orbiting
components of tight and wide binaries and single stars. The only highly
significant difference revealed by our analysis concerns the mass distribution
of short-period planets. Massive planets in short period orbits are found in
most cases around the components of rather tight binaries. The properties of
exoplanets orbiting the components of wide binaries are compatible with those
of planets orbiting single stars, except for a possible greater abundance of
high-eccentricity planets. The previously suggested lack of massive planets
with P>100 days in binaries is not confirmed. We conclude that the presence of
a stellar companion with separation smaller than 100-300 AU is able to modify
the formation and/or migration and/or the dynamical evolution history of giant
planets while wide companions play a more limited role

new self-organized phase due to the tendency of glass networks to minimize
internal stress. Recently, we have shown that an equilibrated self-organized
two-dimensional lattice-based model also possesses an intermediate phase in
which a percolating rigid cluster exists with a probability between zero and
one, depending on the average coordination of the network. In this paper, we
study the properties of this intermediate phase in more detail. We find that
microscopic perturbations, such as the addition or removal of a single bond,
can affect the rigidity of macroscopic regions of the network, in particular,
creating or destroying percolation. This, together with a power-law
distribution of rigid cluster sizes, suggests that the system is maintained in
a critical state on the rigid/floppy boundary throughout the intermediate
phase, a behavior similar to self-organized criticality, but, remarkably, in a
thermodynamically equilibrated state. The distinction between percolating and
non-percolating networks appears physically meaningless, even though the
percolating cluster, when it exists, takes up a finite fraction of the network.
We point out both similarities and differences between the intermediate phase
and the critical point of ordinary percolation models without
self-organization. Our results are consistent with an interpretation of recent
experiments on the pressure dependence of Raman frequencies in chalcogenide
glasses in terms of network homogeneity.

ratio of the level broadening to the mean level spacing of the random cavity,

independent of the ensembles at the resonant point, which can be understood by
the mode-locking mechanism. We also discuss the relation of our results to the

fermion pairs resulting in a resonant pairing formation. This system inherently
contains resonating fermion pairs on bonds which lead to a superconducting
phase provided that long range phase coherence between their constituents can
be established. The prerequisite is that the resonating fermion pairs can
become itinerant. This is rendered possible through the emergence of two kinds
of bond-fermions: individual and composite fermions made of one individual
electron attached to a bound pair on a bond. If the strength of the exchange
coupling exceeds a certain value, the superconducting ground state undergoes a
quantum phase transition into an insulating pair-bond liquid state. The gap of
the superfluid phase thereby goes over continuously into a charge gap of the
insulator. The change-over from the superconducting to the insulating phase is
accompanied by a corresponding qualitative modification of the dispersion of
the two kinds of fermionic excitations. Using a bond operator formalism, we
derive the phase diagram of such a scenario together with the elementary
excitations characterizing the various phases as a function of the exchange
coupling and the temperature.

Fermi surface and band dispersion is obtained for the wide range of doping
concentrations $x$. For p-type systems the three different types of behavior
are found and the transitions between these types are accompanied by the
changes in the Fermi surface topology. Thus a quantum phase transitions take
place at $x=0.15$ and at $x=0.23$. Due to the different Fermi surface topology

The calculated doping dependence of the nodal Fermi velocity and the effective

much attention in the last two decades. Typically, the running time of these
methods to obtain a $\epsilon$ approximate solution is proportional to
$\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}$. Recently, Bienstock and Iyengar, following Nesterov,
gave an algorithm for fractional packing linear programs which runs in
$\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ iterations. The latter algorithm requires to solve a
convex quadratic program every iteration - an optimization subroutine which
dominates the theoretical running time.
  We give an algorithm for convex programs with strictly convex constraints
which runs in time proportional to $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$. The algorithm does NOT
require to solve any quadratic program, but uses gradient steps and elementary
operations only. Problems which have strictly convex constraints include
maximum entropy frequency estimation, portfolio optimization with loss risk
constraints, and various computational problems in signal processing.
  As a side product, we also obtain a simpler version of Bienstock and
Iyengar's result for general linear programming, with similar running time.
  We derive these algorithms using a new framework for deriving convex
optimization algorithms from online game playing algorithms, which may be of
independent interest.

become popular for implementing agent-based and other object-based simulations
since objects in those languages can {\em reflect} (i.e. make runtime queries
of an object's structure). This allows, for example, a fairly trivial {\em
serialisation} routine (conversion of an object into a binary representation
that can be stored or passed over a network) to be written. However C++ does
not offer this ability, as type information is thrown away at compile time. Yet
C++ is often a preferred development environment, whether for performance
reasons or for its expressive features such as operator overloading.
  In scientific coding, changes to a model's codes takes place constantly, as
the model is refined, and different phenomena are studied. Yet traditionally,
facilities such as checkpointing, routines for initialising model parameters
and analysis of model output depend on the underlying model remaining static,
otherwise each time a model is modified, a whole slew of supporting routines
needs to be changed to reflect the new data structures. Reflection offers the
advantage of the simulation framework adapting to the underlying model without
programmer intervention, reducing the effort of modifying the model.
  In this paper, we present the {\em Classdesc} system which brings many of the
benefits of object reflection to C++, {\em ClassdescMP} which dramatically
simplifies coding of MPI based parallel programs and {\em

this is not strictly necessary. In these notes, I will introduce the concept of

will proceed in a rather informal way. The focus will be more on presenting
ideas than on presenting technical details. The goal of the course is to give
the student an overview of the theory of proof nets and make the vast amount of
literature on the topic easier accessible to the beginner. For introducing the
basic concepts of the theory, I will in the first part of the course stick to
the unit-free multiplicative fragment of linear logic because of its rather
simple notion of proof nets. In the second part of the course we will see proof
nets for more sophisticated logics. This is a basic introduction into proof
nets from the perspective of the identity of proofs. We discuss how deductive
proofs can be translated into proof nets and what a correctness criterion is.

chiral multiplets. Supersymmetry is broken via the D-term expectation value of
a secluded U(1) and it is transmitted to the Standard Model via gauge
interactions of messengers in N=2 hypermultiplets: gauginos thus receive Dirac
masses. The model has several distinct experimental signatures with respect to
ordinary models of gauge or gravity mediation realizations of the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). First, it predicts extra states as a
third chargino that can be observed at collider experiments. Second, the
absence of a D-flat direction in the Higgs sector implies a lightest Higgs
behaving exactly as the Standard Model one and thus a reduction of the `little'
fine-tuning in the low tan(beta) region. This breaking of supersymmetry can be
easily implemented in string theory models

higher-dimensional Planck scale may be as low as a TeV. In that case black
holes with masses of a few TeV are expected to be produced copiously in
multi-TeV collisions, in particular at the LHC. These black holes decay through
Hawking radiation into typically O(20) Standard Model particles. Most of these
particles would be strongly interacting. Naively this would lead to a final
state containing 10 or so hadronic jets. However, it has been argued that the
density of strongly interacting particles would be so large that they
thermalize, forming a ``chromosphere'' rather than well-defined jets. In order
to investigate this, we perform a QCD simulation which includes parton-parton
scattering in addition to parton showering. We find the effects of parton
scattering to remain small for all cases we studied, leading to the conclusion
that the decays of black holes with masses within the reach of the LHC will not
lead to the formation of chromospheres.

well-known power-law form factors without Regge-pole structure of the

done for bosonic string scatterings of arbitrary massive string states from

high-energy string scattering amplitudes at each fixed mass level break down
for the Domain-wall scatterings. This result gives a strong evidence that the
existence of the infinite linear relations, or stringy symmetries, of
high-energy string scattering amplitudes is responsible for the softer,
exponential fall-off high-energy string scatterings than the power-law field

scenario in the early universe within the brane world framework in string
theory. The naturalness and robustness of this realistic scenario is explained.
Its predictions on the cosmological observables in the cosmic microwave
background radiation, especially possible distinct stringy features, such as
large non-Gaussianity or large tensor mode that deviates from that predicted in
the slow roll scenario, are discussed. Stringy KK modes as hidden dark matter
is also a possibility. Another generic consequence of brane inflation is the
production of cosmic strings towards the end of inflation. These cosmic strings
are nothing but superstrings stretched to cosmological sizes. The properties of
these cosmic superstrings and their subsequent cosmological evolution into a
scaling network open up their possible detections in the near future, via
cosmological, astronomical and/or gravitational wave measurements. At the
moment, cosmological data is already imposing strong constraints on the details
of the scenario. Finding distinctive stringy signatures in cosmological
observations will go a long way in revealing the specific brane inflationary
scenario and validating string theory as well as the brane world picture.
Precision measurements may even reveal the structures of the flux
compactification. Irrespective of the final outcome, we see that string theory
is confronting data and making predictions.

particular, there are no exponentially small contributions to perturbation
theory in the string coupling, which normally are associated with branes and

so can be completely re-summed to yield all the non-perturbative physics. We
examine a number of other properties of the theories, for example constructing
and examining the physics of loop operators, which can be computed exactly, and
gain considerable understanding of the difference between these new theories

between the two types. Interestingly, the models we exhibit contain a family of
zeros of the partition function which suggest a novel phase structure. The
theories are defined naturally by starting with models that yield
well-understood string theories and allowing a flux-like background parameter
to take half-integer rather than integer values. The family of models thus
obtained are seeded by functions that are intimately related to the classic
rational solutions of the Painleve II equation, and a family of

the Peter-Weyl decomposition of this Hilbert space in the usual manner and thus

We allow both for finite activity and for infinite activity jump components.
Given discrete observations we disentangle the {\it integrated covariation}
(the covariation between the two diffusion parts, indicated by IC) from the
co-jumps. This has important applications to multiple assets price modeling for
forecasting, option pricing, risk and credit risk management. An approach
commonly used to estimate IC is to take the sum of the cross products of the
two processes increments; however this estimator can be highly biased in the
presence of jumps, since it approaches the quadratic ovariation, which contains
also the co-jumps. Our estimator of IC is based on a threshold (or truncation)
technique. We prove that the estimator is consistent in both cases as the
number of observations increases to infinity. Further, in presence of only
finite activity jumps 1) \hat{IC} is also asymptotically Gaussian; 2) a joint
CLT for \hat{IC} and threshold estimators of the integrated variances of the
single processes allows to reach consistent and asymptotically Gaussian
estimators even of the $\beta$s and of the correlation coefficient among the
diffusion parts of the two processes, allowing a better measurement of their
dependence; 3) thresholding gives an estimate of IC which is robust to the
asynchronicity of the observations. We conduct a simulation study to check that
the application of our technique is in fact informative for values of the step
between the observations large enough to avoid the typical problems arising in
presence of microstructure noises in the data, and to asses the choice of the
threshold parameters.

  the special issue on ""Nonlinear Waves: Computation and Theory""",,,,"nlin.PS",,"  It is well known that a symmetric soliton in coupled nonlinear Schroedinger
(NLS) equations with the cubic nonlinearity loses its stability with the
increase of its energy, featuring a transition into an asymmetric soliton via a
subcritical bifurcation. A similar phenomenon was found in a dual-core system
with quadratic nonlinearity, and in linearly coupled fiber Bragg gratings, with
a difference that the symmetry-breaking bifurcation is supercritical in those
cases. We aim to study transitions between symmetric and asymmetric solitons in
dual-core systems with saturable nonlinearity. We demonstrate that a basic
model of this type, viz., a pair of linearly coupled NLS equations with the
intra-core cubic-quintic (CQ) nonlinearity, features a bifurcation loop: a
symmetric soliton loses its stability via a supercritical bifurcation, which is
followed, at a larger value of the energy, by a reverse bifurcation that
restores the stability of the symmetric soliton. If the linear-coupling
constant is small enough, the second bifurcation is subcritical, and there is a
broad interval of energies in which the system is bistable, with coexisting
stable symmetric and asymmetric solitons. At larger values of the coupling
constant, the reverse bifurcation is supercritical, and the bifurcation loop
disappears if the linear coupling is very strong. Collisions between moving
solitons are studied too. Symmetric solitons always collide elastically, while
collisions between asymmetric solitons turns them into breathers, that
subsequently undergo dynamical symmetrization.

flow is used to constrain estimates for several transport coefficients

particles detected at the BRAHMS forward rapidity $y \sim 3$, is about $200
{\rm GeV}$, {\em i.e.} lies in the range of the values obtained for the highest
SPS energy. The chosen geometry of the fireball has a decreasing transverse
size as the magnitude of $\alpha_\parallel$ is increased, which also
corresponds to decreasing transverse flow. This feature is verified by
reproducing the transverse momentum spectra of pions and kaons at various
rapidities. The strange chemical potential obtained from the fit to the
$K^+/K^-$ ratio is such that the local strangeness density in the fireball is
compatible with zero. The resulting rapidity spectra of net protons are
described qualitatively in the model. As a result of the study, the knowledge
of the ``topography'' of the fireball is achieved, making other calculations
possible. As an example, we give predictions for the rapidity spectra of
hyperons.

Besides the concept of TTE, we take into account the non-gradient correction to
the traditional buoyancy flux formulation. The proposed model grants the
existence of turbulence at any gradient Richardson number, Ri. Instead of its
critical value separating - as usually assumed - the turbulent and the laminar
regimes, it reveals a transition interval, 0.1< Ri <1, which separates two
regimes of essentially different nature but both turbulent: strong turbulence
at Ri<<1; and weak turbulence, capable of transporting momentum but much less
efficient in transporting heat, at Ri>1. Predictions from this model are
consistent with available data from atmospheric and lab experiments, direct
numerical simulation (DNS) and large-eddy simulation (LES).

revealed by the Electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis, are renewal non-Poisson
processes living in the non-ergodic dominion. To reach this important
conclusion we process the data with the minimum spanning tree method, so as to
detect significant events, thereby building a sequence of times, which is the
time series to analyze. Then we show that in both cases, EEG and music
composition, these significant events are the signature of a non-Poisson
renewal process. This conclusion is reached using a techniques of statistical
analysis recently developed by our group, the Aging Experiment (AE). First, we
find that in both cases the distances between two consecutive events are
described by non-exponential histograms, thereby proving the non-Poisson nature
of these processes. The corresponding survival probabilities $\Psi(t)$ are well
fitted by stretched exponentials ($\Psi(t) \propto exp(-(\gamma t)^\alpha$),
with $0.5 <\alpha <1$.) The second step rests on the adoption of the AE, which
shows that these are renewal processes. We show that the renewal stretched
exponential is the emerging tip of an iceberg, whose underwater part has slow
tails with an inverse power law structure with power index $\mu = 1 + \alpha$.
We find that both EEG and music composition yield $\mu < 2$. On the basis of
the recently discovered complexity matching effect, according to which a
complex system $S$ with $\mu_S < 2$ responds only to a complex driving signal
$P$ with $\mu_P = \mu_S$, we conclude that the results of our analysis may
explain the influence of music on human brain.

  This thesis addresses two known quantities in quantum information science:
(1) entanglement cost, and (2) Holevo capacity. These quantities will be
crucial values when teleportation becomes common in daily life, perhaps
centuries from now.
  Assume that Alice desires to send a singing Japanese cricket to her friend
Bob in America, and that Alice and Bob already share a quantum entanglement.
First, Alice sends Bob a mass of information bits resulting from the
interaction between the cricket she holds in her hand and half of the
entanglement. Subsequently, Bob receives the information bits and manipulates
the other half of the entanglement, transforming them back into the original
cricket. Examining this situation from an instrumental engineering viewpoint,
quantifying the amount of the quantum entanglement and the number of
information bits is crucial for this transmission. If both values are enough,
Alice could even send herself to Bob's place instead of the tiny cricket.
  The topics of this thesis therefore are: (1) the mathematical properties of
the entanglement cost, such as whether it is an additive measure similar to
normal length or weight; and (2) how to calculate the Holevo capacity, an
ultimately achievable limit of the information conveyance capacity of an
information channel, such as of a single photon passing through an optical
fiber or space. These two distinct quantities are magically tied together by
several ``additive or not'' hypotheses, which await mathematical proof.
