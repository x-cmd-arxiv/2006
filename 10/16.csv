matter were previously lowered by slingshot ejection from a binary supermassive
black hole. The time scale for collisional growth of the crest is approximately
the two-body relaxation time as defined by the stars, which is < 10 Gyr at the
centers of stellar spheroids with luminosities comparable to that of the Milky

function is computed assuming spherical collapse, comparison with the
Sheth-Tormen fitting function (ST) shows that the new mass function of

predicts more small mass halos than the ST but less than the PS. The index

initial and boundary conditions to quantify the degree of asymmetry produced by
latitudinal variations in the momentum flux of the pulsar wind, radiative
cooling in the postshock flow, and density gradients in the interstellar medium
(ISM). We find that the bow shock is stable even when travelling through a
strong ISM gradient. We demonstrate how the shape of the bow shock changes when
the pulsar encounters density variations in the ISM. We show that a density
wall can account for the peculiar bow shock shapes of the nebulae around PSR
J2124-3358 and PSR B0740-28. A wall produces kinks in the shock, whereas a
smooth ISM density gradient tilts the shock. We conclude that the anisotropy of
the wind momentum flux alone cannot explain the observed bow shock morphologies
but it is instead necessary to take into account external effects. We show that
the analytic (single layer, thin shell) solution is a good approximation when
the momentum flux is anisotropic, fails for a steep ISM density gradient, and
ap- proaches the numerical solution for efficient cooling. We provide analytic
expressions for the latitudinal dependence of a vacuum-dipole wind and the
associated shock shape, and compare the results to a split-monopole wind. We
find that we are unable to distinguish between these two wind models purely

classifying our objects and studying the effects of intrinsic absorption in

models with variable element abundances and a photoelectric absorption
component. We interpret line flux ratios in He-like triplet of O VII as a
function of electron density and the UV radiation field. We use the nearby
co-eval classical T Tauri star SU Aur as a comparison. AB Aurigae reveals a
soft X-ray spectrum, most plasma being concentrated at 1-6 MK. The He-like
triplet reveals no signatures of increased densities and there are no clear
indications for strong abundance anomalies. The light curve displays modulated
variability, with a period of ~ 42 hr. It is unlikely that a nearby, undetected
lower-mass companion is the source of the X-rays. Accretion shocks close to the
star should be irradiated by the photosphere, leading to alteration in the
He-like triplet fluxes of O VII, which we do not measure. Also, no indications
for high densities are found, although the mass accretion rate is presently
unknown. Emission from wind shocks is unlikely, given the weak radiation
pressure. A possible explanation would be a solar-like magnetic corona.
Magnetically confined winds provide a very promising alternative. The X-ray
period is indeed close to periods previously measured in optical lines from the
wind.

assumptions on which the result is based that in course of a galaxy merger the
slingshot ejection of bound stars is sufficiently efficient to allow a
supermassive black hole binary to merge. A steep cusp with a power law index of
2.5 to 3 is required which is as massive as the binary and surrounds the BHs
when the binary becomes hard. This cusp is probably formed when both clusters,
surrounding each black hole, merge and combine with the matter funneled into
the center. We find this profile to be in agreement with observed post-merger
distributions after the cusp has been destroyed. The time dependency we derive
for the merger predicts that stalled black holes, if they exist at all, will
preferably be found in less than about 0.2 pc distance. To test this prediction
we compute the current semimajor axis of 12 candidates of ongoing mergers. We
find all binaries unambiguously to be already in the last phase when they decay
due to the emission of gravitational waves. Therefore, in striking
contradiction with predictions of a depleted loss-cone, the abscence of even a
single source in the slingshot phase strongly supports our previous and current
results: Binaries merge due to slingshot ejection of stars which have been
funneled into the central regions in course of a galaxy collision.

fundamental issue in achieving high dynamic range imaging. In this paper, we
investigate an instrumental setup which consists in applying interferometric
techniques on a single telescope, by filtering and dividing the pupil with an
array of single-mode fibers. We developed a new algorithm, which makes use of
the fact that we have a redundant interferometric array, to completely
disentangle the astronomical object from the atmospheric perturbations (phase
and scintillation). This self-calibrating algorithm can also be applied to any
- diluted or not - redundant interferometric setup. On an 8 meter telescope
observing at a wavelength of 630 nm, our simulations show that a single mode
pupil remapping system could achieve, at a few resolution elements from the
central star, a raw dynamic range up to 10^6; depending on the brightness of
the source. The self calibration algorithm proved to be very efficient,
allowing image reconstruction of faint sources (mag = 15) even though the
signal-to-noise ratio of individual spatial frequencies are of the order of
0.1. We finally note that the instrument could be more sensitive by combining
this setup with an adaptive optics system. The dynamic range would however be
limited by the noise of the small, high frequency, displacements of the
deformable mirror.

conditions. How would the atmospheric chemistry of the Earth respond if we
moved it to different orbital distances or changed its host star? This question
is central to astrobiology and aids our understanding of how the atmospheres of
terrestrial planets develop. To help address this question, we have performed a
sensitivity study using a coupled radiative-convective photochemical column
model to calculate changes in atmospheric chemistry on a planet having Earth's
atmospheric composition, which we subjected to small changes in orbital
position, of the order of 5-10 per cent for a solar-type G2V, F2V, and K2V

investigate the response of the biomarkers to changes in the input stellar

is however a major challenge for current radiative schemes, due, among other
things, to lacking spectroscopic data. Therefore, as a first step, we employ a
more moderate approach, by investigating small shifts in planet-star distance
and assuming an earthlike biosphere. To calculate this shift we assumed a
criteria for complex life based on the Earth, i.e. the earthlike planetary
surface temperature varied between zero to thirty degrees Centigrade which led

all other presolar spinel grains. Large excesses of the heavy Mg isotopes are
present and thus an origin from an intermediate-mass (IM) asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) star was previously proposed for this grain. We discuss the
isotopic compositions of presolar spinel grain OC2 and compare them to
theoretical predictions. We show that the isotopic composition of O, Mg and Al
in OC2 could be the signature of an AGB star of IM and metallicity close to
solar experiencing hot bottom burning, or of an AGB star of low mass (LM) and
low metallicity suffering very efficient cool bottom processing. Large
measurement uncertainty in the Fe isotopic composition prevents us from
discriminating which model better represents the parent star of OC2. However,
the Cr isotopic composition of the grain favors an origin in an IM-AGB star of
metallicity close to solar. Our IM-AGB models produce a self-consistent
solution to match the composition of OC2 within the uncertainties related to
reaction rates. Within this solution we predict that the 16O(p,g)17F and the
17O(p,a)14N reaction rates should be close to their lower and upper limits,
respectively. By finding more grains like OC2 and by precisely measuring their

identify large-scale structures: loops, arcs or cavities, in the far-infrared
emission in the Galaxy. Distances were attributed to a subsample of loops using

frequently overwrite the structure of the interstellar matter in the inner

transfer from a rotating bar in the baryonic disk can lower the halo density,
but they also contend that N-body simulations of this process will not reveal
the true continuum result unless many more than the usual numbers of particles
are employed. Adopting their simplified model of a rotating rigid bar in a live
halo, I have been unable to find any evidence to support their contention. I
find that both the angular momentum transferred and the halo density change are
independent of the number of particles over the range usually employed up to
that advocated by these authors. I show that my results do not depend on any
numerical parameters, and that field methods perform equally with grid methods.
I also identify the reasons that the required particle number suggested by
Weinberg & Katz is excessive. I further show that when countervailing
compression by baryonic settling is ignored, moderate bars can reduce the mean
density of the inner halo by 20% - 30%. Long, massive, skinny bars can reduce
the mean inner density by a factor ~10. The largest density reductions are
achieved at the expense of removing most of the angular momentum likely to
reside in the baryonic component. Compression of the halo by baryonic settling
must reduce, and may even overwhelm, the density reduction achievable by bar
friction.

the reduced light curve amplitude and metallicity dependence at these
wavelengths. This work presents such photometry for two young clusters known to
contain sizeable Cepheid populations: NGC 1866 and NGC 2031. Our goal is to
determine light curves and period-luminosity (PL) relations in the near-IR, to
assess the similarity between cluster and field pulsators, and to examine the
predictive capability of current pulsation models. The light curves are
obtained from multiwavelength broadband J,H,Ks photometry of Cepheids in both
clusters, with periods previously established from optical photometry. Mean
magnitudes for the Cepheids are used to construct PL relations in the near-IR.
The properties in the PL planes are compared with the behavior of field
Cepheids in the LMC and with the predictions of recent pulsational models, both
canonical and overluminous. Cluster and field Cepheids are homogeneous and the
inclusion of the cluster Cepheids in the field sample extends nicely the PL
relation. The slope of the PL relation is constant over the whole period range
and does not show -- at least in the adopted IR bands -- the break in slope at
P ~ 10 d reported by some authors. A comparison with the predictions of
pulsation models allows an estimate for the distance moduli of NGC 1866 and NGC
2031. The two clusters are found to lie at essentially the same distance.
Fitting of theoretical models to the data gives, for the K filter, (m-M)_0 =
18.62+-0.10 if canonical models are used and (m-M)_0 = 18.42+-0.10 if
overluminous models are used. On the basis of this result, some considerations
on the relationship between the clusters and the internal structure of the LMC
are presented.

complements extensive observations at other wavelengths, in particular X-rays

dependence of submm flux on the equivalent width of the characteristic CIV

absorption strength of the outflow - it has implications either for the

extragalactic jets with two-phase ambient media. These jets propagate through a
denser homogeneous gas and then impact clouds with densities 100 to 1000 times
higher than the initial beam density. The deflection angle of the jet is
influenced more by the density contrast of the cloud than by the beam Mach
number of the jet. A relativistic jet with low relativistic beam Mach number
can eventually be slightly bent after it crosses the dense cloud; however, we
have not seen permanently bent structures in the interaction of a high
relativistic beam Mach number jet with a cloud. The relativistic jet impacts on
dense clouds do not necessarily destroy the clouds completely, and much of the
cloud body can survive as a coherent blob. This enhancement of cloud durability
is partly due to the geometric influence of the off-axis collisions we consider
and also arises from the lower rate of cloud fragmentation through the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability for relativistic jets. To compare our simulations
with observed extragalactic radio jets, we have computed the approximate
surface distributions of synchrotron emission at different viewing angles.
These surface intensity maps show relativistic jets interacting with clouds can
produce synchrotron emission knots similar to structures observed in many
VLBI-scale radio sources. We find that the synchrotron emission increases
steeply at the moment of impact and the emission peaks right before the jet
passes through the cloud.

has triggered a substantial demand for {\it ab initio} transport calculations.
Even though program packages are commercially available and placed on custom
tailored to address this task, reliable information often is difficult and very
time consuming to attain in the vast majority of cases, namely when the
molecular conductance is much smaller than $e^2/h$. The article recapitulates
procedures for molecular transport calculations from the point of view of
time-dependent density functional theory. Emphasis is describing the
foundations of the ``standard method''. Pitfalls will be uncovered and the
domain of applicability discussed.

into propagating Kelvin waves. These waves cascade their energy down-scale and
their waveaction up-scale via weakly nonlinear interactions, and this is the
main mechanism of turbulence at the scales less than the inter-vortex distance.
In case of an idealised forcing concentrated around a single scale k0, the
turbulence spectrum exponent has a pure direct cascade form -17/5 at scales
k>k0 and a pure inverse cascade form -3 at k<k0. However, forcing produced by
the reconnections contains a broad range of Fourier modes. What scaling should
one expect in this case? In this Letter I obtain an answer to this question
using the differential model for the Kelvin wave turbulence. The main result is
that the direct cascade scaling dominates, i.e. the reconnection forcing is
more or less equivalent to a low-frequency forcing.

vs. $B$ relationship which depends strongly on the size of the blocks, $M$, and
rather weakly on the total polymer length, $N$. The overall behavior is
strongly influenced by the degree of selectivity between the two solvents
$\chi$.
  The variation of $\tau(N,M)$ with $N$ and $M$ in the regimes of weak and
strong selectivity of the interface is also studied by means of computer
simulations using a dynamic Monte Carlo coarse-grained model. Good qualitative
agreement with theoretical predictions is found. The MFPT distribution is found

chains.
  The strong sensitivity of the ``capture'' time $\tau(N,M)$ with respect to

  es (1998)",,,"cs.SE",,"  Program comprehension is the most tedious and time consuming task of software
maintenance, an important phase of the software life cycle. This is
particularly true while maintaining scientific application programs that have
been written in Fortran for decades and that are still vital in various domains
even though more modern languages are used to implement their user interfaces.
Very often, programs have evolved as their application domains increase
continually and have become very complex due to extensive modifications. This
generality in programs is implemented by input variables whose value does not
vary in the context of a given application. Thus, it is very interesting for
the maintainer to propagate such information, that is to obtain a simplified
program, which behaves like the initial one when used according to the
restriction. We have adapted partial evaluation for program comprehension. Our
partial evaluator performs mainly two tasks: constant propagation and
statements simplification. It includes an interprocedural alias analysis. As
our aim is program comprehension rather than optimization, there are two main
differences with classical partial evaluation. We do not change the original

Specification patterns are design patterns that are expressed in a formal

unification. This paper shows through examples how to define specification

asymmetry off the Z pole. We show that these discrepancies can be resolved in a
variant of the Randall-Sundrum extra-dimensional model in which the gauge
structure is extended to $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_X$ to allow for
relatively light Kaluza-Klein excitations of the gauge bosons. In this
scenario, the fermions are localized differently along the extra dimension, in
order to generate the fermion mass hierarchies, so that the electroweak
interactions for the heavy third generation fermions are naturally different
from the light fermion ones. We show that the mixing between the Z boson with
the Kaluza-Klein excitations allows to explain the $A_{FB}^b$ anomaly without
affecting (and even improving) the agreement of the other precision
observables, including the $Z \to bb$ partial decay width, with experimental
data. Some implications of this scenario for the ILC are summarized.

baseline coincides with the refraction length, $l_0$. The latter, in turn,

Therefore at the baseline $L = l_0$ the oscillation phase is $2\pi$, and
consequently, the ``solar'' amplitude of oscillations driven by $\theta_{12}$
and $\Delta m^2_{21}$ vanishes. As a result, in the lowest order (i) the
interference of amplitudes in the $\nu_e - \nu_\mu$ $(\nu_\tau)$ transition

to come out somewhere in the middle, neither preferring pure bound states, nor
effective meson-meson physics with only coupling constants and possibly form
factors. As a matter of fact, apart from a few exceptions, like pions and
kaons, Nature does not allow us to study mesonic bound states of any kind,
which is equivalent to saying that such states do not really exist. Hence,
instead of extrapolating from pions and kaons to the remainder of the meson
family, it is more democratic to consider pions and kaons mesonic resonances
that happen to come out below the lowest threshold for strong decay.
Nevertheless, confinement is an important ingredient for understanding the many
regularities observed in mesonic spectra. Therefore, excluding quark degrees of
freedom is also not the most obvious way of describing mesons in general, and
scalars and axial-vectors in particular.

The aim of this paper is to provide a companion algorithm to the
Kiefer--Wolfowitz--Blum algorithm, which allows one to simultaneously
recursively approximate the size $\mu$ of the maximum of the regression
function. A precise study of the joint weak convergence rate of both algorithms
is given; it turns out that, unlike the location of the maximum, the size of
the maximum can be approximated by an algorithm which converges at the
parametric rate. Moreover, averaging leads to an asymptotically efficient
algorithm for the approximation of the couple $(\theta,\mu)$.

each multi-index $I=i_1i_2...i_m (i_j\in\n)$. Here $m$ is called the length.
Let $r(I)$ denote the maximam number of times that any index appears. It is
known that Milnor invariants with $r=1$ are link-homotopy invariant. N.
Habegger and X. S. Lin showed that two string links are a link-homotopc if and
only if their Milnor invariants with $r=1$ coincide. This gives us that a link
in $S^3$ is link-homotopic to a trivial link if and only if the all Milnor
invariants of the link with $r=1$ vanish. Although Milnor invariants with $r=2$
are not link-homotopy invariants, T. Fleming and the author showed that Milnor
invariants with $r\leq 2$ are self $\Delta$-equivalence invariants. In this
paper, we give a self $\Delta$-equivalence classification of the set of
$n$-component links in $S^3$ whose Milnor invariants with length $\leq 2n-1$
and $r\leq 2$ vanish. As a corollary, we have that a link is self
$\Delta$-equivalent to a trivial link if and only if the all Milnor invariants
of the link with $r\leq 2$ vanish. This is a geometric characterization for
links whose Milnor invariants with $\leq 2$ vanish. The chief ingredient in our
proof is Habiro's clasper theory. We also give an alternate proof of a
link-homotopy classification of string links by using clasper theory.

is found to be much shorter, though still proportional to $\tau$. As a
consequence of these results, the synchronization is not significantly altered

calculation of the energy per particle $\bar E(k_f)$. In order to eliminate
possible high-momentum components from the interactions we introduce at each
pion-baryon vertex a form factor of monopole type. The empirical nuclear matter
saturation point, $\rho_0 \simeq 0.16 $fm$^{-3}$, $\bar E_0\simeq -16 $MeV, is
well reproduced with a monopole mass of $\Lambda \simeq 4\pi f_\pi \simeq 1.16
$GeV. As in the recent approach based on the universal low-momentum
$NN$-potential $V_{\rm low-k}$, the inclusion of three-body effects is crucial
in order to achieve saturation of nuclear matter. We demonstrate that the
dependence of the pion-exchange contributions to $\bar E(k_f)$ on the
''resolution'' scale $\Lambda$ can be compensated over a wide range of
$\Lambda$ by counterterms with two ''running'' contact-couplings. As a further
application we study the in-medium chiral condensate $<\bar q q >(\rho)$ beyond
the linear density approximation. For $\rho \leq 1.5 \rho_0$ we find small
corrections from the derivative $d \bar E(k_f)/d m_\pi$, which are stable
against variations of the monopole regulator mass $\Lambda$.

leading to a change in the equilibrium position of each oscillator, we
investigate in some detail the deformation of the initial fractal geometry as

can sustain for large times and we extract the properties of the chain which
determine the associated time-scales. Our analysis applies generally to
critical systems for which, after a slow developing phase where equilibrium
conditions are justified, a rapid evolution, induced by a sudden symmetry
breaking, emerges in time scales much shorter than the corresponding relaxation
or observation time. In particular, it can be used in the fireball evolution in
a heavy-ion collision experiment, where the QCD critical point emerges, or in

  Wissenschaft und Technik Verlag Berlin. Since it has proved to be of interest
  to some researchers, it is published here for an easier access",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We present a reformulation of quantum mechanics in terms of probability
measures and functions on a general classical sample space and in particular in
terms of probability densities and functions on phase space. The basis of our
proceeding is the existence of so-called statistically complete observables and
the duality between the state spaces and the spaces of the observables, the
latter holding in the quantum as well as in the classical case. In the
phase-space context, we further discuss joint position-momentum observables,
Hilbert spaces of infinitely differentiable functions on phase space, and
dequantizations. Finally, the relation of quantum dynamics to the classical
Liouville dynamics is investigated.

two-level atom. Applying the Heisenberg and quantum Langevin equations, we
calculate in the bad-cavity limit the mean photon number, the quadrature
variance, and the power spectrum for the cavity mode in general and for the
signal light and fluorescent light in particular. We also obtain the normalized
second-order correlation function for the fluorescent light. We find that the
presence of the two-level atom leads to a decrease in the degree of squeezing
of the signal light. It so turns out that the fluorescent light is in a
squeezed state and the power spectrum consists of a single peak only.

when the parametrization is given by the real and imaginary part of the entries
and they are estimated by independent measurements. It is established that the
properties of the estimation procedure depend very much on the invertibility of
the true state. In particular, in case of a pure state the estimation is less
efficient. Moreover, several estimation schemes are compared for the unknown
state of a qubit when one copy is measured at a time. It is shown that the
average mean quadratic error matrix is the smallest if the applied observables
are complementary. The results are illustrated by computer simulations.

qubits and defined the generalized singlet fraction. For single-qubit
teleportation, Badziag {\em et al.} [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 62}, 012311 (2000)] and
Bandyopadhyay [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 65}, 022302 (2002)] have obtained a family of
entangled two-qubit mixed states whose teleportation fidelity can be enhanced
by subjecting one of the qubits to dissipative interaction with the environment
via an amplitude damping channel. Here, we show that a dissipative interaction
with the local environment via a pair of time-correlated amplitude damping
channels can enhance fidelity of entanglement teleportation for a class of
entangled four-qubit mixed states. Interestingly, we find that this enhancement
corresponds to an enhancement in the quantum discord for some states.

trapping of the moving atom into its upper state due to multiparticle
influences and the corresponding decoupling from the interaction with the
environment such that the emitter does not {\it see} the induced potentials.

  Symposium, The University of Nottingham, July 2006, 8 pages, 4 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We present an analysis of spontaneous emission in a 3-level atom as an
example of a qutrit state under the action of noisy quantum channels. We choose
a 3-level atom with V-configuration to be the qutrit state. Gell-Mann matrices
and a generalized Bloch vector (8-dimensional) are used to describe the qutrit
density operator. Using the time-evolution equations of atomic variables we
find the Kraus representation of spontaneous emission quantum channel (SE
channel). Furthermore, we consider a generalized Werner state of two qutrits
and investigate the separability condition. We give similar analysis of
spontaneous emission for qubit channels. The influence of spontaneous emission
on the separability of Werner states for qutrit and qubit states is compared.

momentum Fisher information measures and derived from the non-relativistic
Hartree-Fock wave functions for atoms with Z=1-102, is found to correlate well
with the inverse of the experimental ionization potential. Strong direct
correlations of the net Fisher information are also reported for the static
dipole polarizability of atoms with Z=1-88. The complexity measure, defined as
the ratio of the net Onicescu information measure and net Fisher information,
exhibits clearly marked regions corresponding to the periodicity of the atomic
shell structure. The reported correlations highlight the need for using the net
information measures in addition to either the position or momentum space
analogues. With reference to the correlation of the experimental properties
considered here, the net Fisher information measure is found to be superior
than the net Shannon information entropy.

as a quantum clocking mechanism, and allow Grover's algorithm to be performed

resource usage in implementing such a Hamiltonian. In the familiar language of
Heisenberg spin-spin coupling, the clocking mechanism appears as an excitation
of a basically linear chain of spins, with occasional controlled jumps that
allow for motion on a planar graph: in this sense our model implements the idea
of ""timing"" a quantum algorithm using a continuous-time random walk. In this
context we examine some consequences of the entanglement between the states of
the input/output register and the states of the quantum clock.
