homogeneous and isotropic Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe to
vary with the cosmic time coordinate t of FLRW. It will be variable when the
radial co-moving differential coordinate of FLRW is interpreted as physical and
therefor transformable by a Lorentz transform locally to differentials of
stationary physical coordinates. Because the FLRW differential radial distance
has a time varying coefficient a(t), in the limit of a zero radial distance the
light speed c(t) becomes time varying, proportional to the square root of the
derivative of a(t) Since we assume homogeneity of space, this derived c(t) is
the physical light speed for all events in the FLRW universe. This impacts the
interpretation of astronomical observations of distant phenomena that are
sensitive to light speed. A transform from FLRW is shown to have a physical
radius out to all radial events in the visible universe. This shows a finite
horizon beyond which there are no galaxies and no space. The general relativity
(GR) field equation to determine a(t) and c(t) is maintained by using a
variable gravitational constant and rest mass that keeps constant the
gravitational and particle rest energies. This keeps constant the
proportionality constant between the GR tensors of the field equation and
conserves the stress-energy tensor of the ideal fluid used in the FLRW GR field
equation. In the same way all of special and general relativity can be extended
to include a variable light speed.

magnetocentrifugally driven winds are stable is a longstanding theoretical
problem. As a step towards addressing this problem, we perform the first
large-scale 3D MHD simulations that extend to a distance $\sim 10^2$ times
beyond the launching region, starting from steady 2D (axisymmetric) solutions.
In an attempt to drive the wind unstable, we increase the mass loading on one
half of the launching surface by a factor of $\sqrt{10}$, and reduce it by the
same factor on the other half. The evolution of the perturbed wind is followed
numerically. We find no evidence for any rapidly growing instability that could
disrupt the wind during the launching and initial phase of propagation, even
when the magnetic field of the magnetocentrifugal wind is toroidally dominated
all the way to the launching surface. The strongly perturbed wind settles into
a new steady state, with a highly asymmetric mass distribution. The
distribution of magnetic field strength is, in contrast, much more symmetric.
We discuss possible reasons for the apparent stability, including stabilization
by an axial poloidal magnetic field, which is required to bend field lines away
from the vertical direction and produce a magnetocentrifugal wind in the first
place.

Shelf: shelf ice is relatively transparent to electromagnetic radiation at
radio frequencies and the water-ice boundary below the shelf creates a good
mirror to reflect radio signals from neutrino interactions in any downward
direction. The high sensitivity results from nearly six months of continuous

could be due to fragmentation of the cores that form the massive stars. During
stellar formation circumstellar disks appear to be nearly ubiquitous. Their
large radii compared to stellar sizes increase the interaction radius
significantly, suggesting that disk interactions with neighboring stars could
assist in capturing binary companions. This mechanism has been studied for
stars of approximately solar mass and found to be inefficient. In this paper we
present simulations of interactions between a 22 Msun star-disk system and less
massive impactors, to study the disk-assisted capture formation of binaries in
a regime suited to massive stars. The formation of binaries by capture is found
to be much more efficient for massive capturers. We discuss the effects of a
mass dependent velocity dispersion and mass segregation on the capture rates,

Such studies are important for understanding the evolution of cores to stars,
and for comparison to formation processes in high and low mass star forming
regions. We used the SHARC II camera on the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory
telescope to obtain 350 \micron data having angular resolution of about 9
arcsec, which corresponds to 0.02 pc at the distance of Orion. Our analysis
combining dust continuum and spectral line data defines a sample of 51 Orion
molecular cores with masses ranging from 0.1 \Ms to 46 \Ms and a mean mass of
9.8 \Ms, which is one order of magnitude higher than the value found in typical
low mass star forming regions, such as Taurus. The majority of these cores
cannot be supported by thermal pressure or turbulence, and are probably
supercritical.They are thus likely precursors of protostars. The core mass
function for the Orion quiescent cores can be fitted by a power law with an
index equal to -0.85$\pm$0.21. This is significantly flatter than the Salpeter
initial mass function and is also flatter than the core mass function found in
low and intermediate star forming regions. Thus, it is likely that
environmental processes play a role in shaping the stellar IMF later in the
evolution of dense cores and the formation of stars in such regions.

originate in regions within their host galaxies with lower star formation rates

Moreover, although their hosts are predominantly nearby galaxies, no SNe have
been so far associated with short GRBs. We report here on the bright, nearby
GRB 060614 that does not fit in either class. Its ~102 s duration groups it
with long GRBs, while its temporal lag and peak luminosity fall entirely within
the short GRB subclass. Moreover, very deep optical observations exclude an
accompanying supernova, similar to short GRBs. This combination of a long

Specifically, in about a half of the late-type bulges in our sample the bulk of

Fitting the energy spectrum of the BL Lac object Mrk 501, we obtain tight
constrains on the beam properties. Launching a sufficiently energetic beam
requires rather strong magnetic fields close to the black hole 100-1000 G.
However, the model fits imply that the magnetic field in the emission region is
only 0.02 G. Thus, the particles are accelerated close to the black hole and
propagate a considerable distance before instabilities trigger the dissipation
of energy through synchrotron and self-Compton emission. We discuss various
approaches to generate enough power to drive the jet and, at the same time, to
accelerate particles to 20 TeV energies. Although the parallel beam model has
its own problems, it explains some of the long-standing problems that plague
models based on Fermi type particle acceleration, like the presence of a very
high minimum Lorentz factor of accelerated particles. We conclude with a brief
discussion of the implications of the model for the difference between the
processes of jet formation in BL Lac type objects and in quasars.

transformation of galaxies is to be sought, whose operation can be further
aided by environmental factors. The secular evolution mechanism, especially
with the discovery of a collisionless dissipation mechanism for stars within
the secular evolution paradigm, has provided just such a framework for
understanding the morphological evolution of galaxies across the Hubble time.
In this paper we will summarize the past theoretical results on the dynamical
mechanisms for secular evolution, and highlight new results in the analysis of
the observational data, which confirmed that density waves in physical galaxies
possess the kind of characteristics which could produce the observed rates of
morphological transformation for both cluster and field galaxies.

detection of the formation of the very first stars and galaxies in the universe
during the so-called epoch of reionization by measuring the power spectrum of
the neutral hydrogen 21-cm line (Shaver et al. 1999) on the ~5' scale; 2)
low-frequency surveys of the sky with of order $10^8$ expected new sources; 3)
all-sky monitoring and detection of transient radio sources such as gamma-ray
bursts, x-ray binaries, and exo-planets (Farrell et al. 2004); and 4) radio
detection of ultra-high energy cosmic rays and neutrinos (Falcke & Gorham 2003)

Carinae is on its way to become a supernova, the Red Rectangle is on its way to
form a planetary nebula. Despite the two orders of magnitude difference in
mass, these two systems show several similarities, both in the properties of
the stellar binary systems and the nebulae. From this comparison and further
analysis of the accretion process during the 20 years Great Eruption of Eta
Carinae, I strengthen the binary model for the formation of its bipolar
nebula--the Homunculus. In the binary model a large fraction of the mass lost
by the primary star during the Great Eruption was transferred to the secondary
star (the companion); An accretion disk was formed around the companion, and
the companion launched two opposite jets. I show that the gravitational energy
of the mass accreted onto the secondary star during the Great Eruption can
account for the extra energy of the Great Eruption, both the radiated energy
and the kinetic energy in the Homunculus. I also conclude that neither the
proximity of the primary star in Eta Car to the Eddington luminosity, nor the
rotation of the primary star are related directly to the shaping of the
Homunculus. I speculate that the Great Eruption of Eta Carinae was triggered by
disturbance in the outer boundary of the convective region, most likely by
magnetic activity, that expelled the outer radiative zone.

controlled by electron-electron collisions. The experimental results and

model on a square lattice, beginning with a random state with a specified
potential energy and zero kinetic energy. Coarsening of the system proceeds via
an increase in the kinetic energy and a decrease in the potential energy, with
the total energy being conserved. We find that the coarsening dynamics exhibits
a consistently superdiffusive growth of a characteristic length scale with 1/z
> 1/2 (ranging from 0.54 to 0.57). Also, the number of point defects (vortices
and antivortices) decreases with exponents ranging between 1.0 and 1.1. On the
other hand, the excess potential energy decays with a typical exponent of 0.88,
which shows deviations from the energy-scaling relation. The spin
autocorrelation function exhibits a peculiar time dependence with non-power law
behavior that can be fitted well by an exponential of logarithmic power in
time. We argue that the conservation of the total Josephson (angular) momentum
plays a crucial role for these novel features of coarsening in the Hamiltonian

design paradigm is presented whereby periodic unit cells are designed for
desired frequency band properties, and with appropriate scaling, these cells
are used as building blocks for forming fully periodic or partially periodic

dispersive design methodology, which is hierarchical and integrated, structures
can be devised for effective vibration or shock isolation without needing to
employ dissipative damping mechanisms. The speed of energy propagation in a
designed structure can also be dictated through synthesis of the unit cells.

hypermassive neutron stars (HMNSs), which have rest masses greater the mass
limit allowed by uniform rotation for a given equation of state. The remnant of
a binary neutron star merger is likely to be a HMNS. We find that magnetic
braking and the magnetorotational instability lead to the collapse of HMNSs and
the formation of rotating black holes surrounded by massive, hot accretion tori
and collimated magnetic field lines. Such tori radiate strongly in neutrinos,
and the resulting neutrino-antineutrino annihilation (possibly in concert with
energy extraction by MHD effects) could provide enough energy to power
short-hard gamma-ray bursts. To explore the range of outcomes, we also evolve
differentially rotating neutron stars with lower masses and angular momenta
than the HMNS models. Instead of collapsing, the non-hypermassive models form
nearly uniformly rotating central objects which, in cases with significant

Dirichlet boundary condition on the metric, a suitable choice of the boundary
conditions --compatible with any asymptotically AdS (AAdS) spacetime-- ensures
a finite action principle for all odd dimensions. Background-independent
conserved quantities are obtained as Noether charges associated to asymptotic
symmetries and their general expression appears naturally split in two parts.
  The first one gives the correct mass and angular momentum for AAdS black
holes and vanishes identically for globally AdS spacetimes. Thus, the second
part is a covariant formula for the vacuum energy in AAdS spacetimes and
reproduces the results obtained by the Dirichlet counterterms method in a

Euclidean action and recovers the correct black hole thermodynamics in odd

structure, where the classical Hardy space is replaced by (1) the Fock space of
formal power series in a collection of $d$ noncommuting indeterminates with
norm-square-summable vector coefficients, and (2) the reproducing kernel

  Probab. Statist",,,,"math.PR",,"  This paper studies countable systems of linearly and hierarchically
interacting diffusions taking values in the positive quadrant. These systems
arise in population dynamics for two types of individuals migrating between and
interacting within colonies. Their large-scale space-time behavior can be
studied by means of a renormalization program. This program, which has been
carried out successfully in a number of other cases (mostly one-dimensional),
is based on the construction and the analysis of a nonlinear renormalization
transformation, acting on the diffusion function for the components of the
system and connecting the evolution of successive block averages on successive
time scales. We identify a general class of diffusion functions on the positive
quadrant for which this renormalization transformation is well-defined and,
subject to a conjecture on its boundary behavior, can be iterated. Within
certain subclasses, we identify the fixed points for the transformation and
investigate their domains of attraction. These domains of attraction constitute
the universality classes of the system under space-time scaling.

double well Duffing potential having a negative square term and positive
quartic term has been generalized to a double well potential with a negative
square term and a positive one with an arbitrary real exponent $q > 2$. We have
also used a fractional damping term with an arbitrary power $p$ applied to
velocity which enables one to cover a wide range of realistic damping factors:
from dry friction $p \to 0$ to turbulent resistance phenomena $p=2$.
  Using perturbation methods we have found a critical forcing amplitude $\mu_c$
above which the system may behave chaotically. Our results show that the
vibrating system is less stable in transition to chaos for smaller $p$
satisfying an exponential scaling low. The critical amplitude $\mu_c$ as an
exponential function of $p$.
  The analytical results have been illustrated by numerical simulations using
standard nonlinear tools such as
  Poincare maps and the maximal Lyapunov exponent. As usual for chosen system

less polar macromolecule is immersed in a polar environment, the surface free
energy minimization occurs naturally to stabilizes the system, and leads to an
MMS separating the macromolecule from the solvent. For a given set of atomic
constraints (as obstacles), the MMS is defined as one whose mean curvature
vanishes away from the obstacles. An iterative procedure is proposed to compute
the MMS. Extensive examples are given to validate the proposed algorithm and
illustrate the new concept. We show that the MMS provides an indication to
DNA-binding specificity. The proposed algorithm represents a major step forward

types of biological networks, representing gene regulation, metabolic
processes, protein-protein interactions, etc. A common setting involves
inferring network edges in a supervised fashion from a set of high-confidence
edges, possibly characterized by multiple, heterogeneous data sets (protein
sequence, gene expression, etc.). Here, we distinguish between two modes of
inference in this setting: direct inference based upon similarities between
nodes joined by an edge, and indirect inference based upon similarities between
one pair of nodes and another pair of nodes. We propose a supervised approach
for the direct case by translating it into a distance metric learning problem.
A relaxation of the resulting convex optimization problem leads to the support
vector machine (SVM) algorithm with a particular kernel for pairs, which we
call the metric learning pairwise kernel (MLPK). We demonstrate, using several
real biological networks, that this direct approach often improves upon the
state-of-the-art SVM for indirect inference with the tensor product pairwise
kernel.

The integer part is a discrete random variable (we call it Planck variable)
whose distribution is just the Bose distribution yielding the Planck law of
black-body radiation. The fractional part is the dark part (we call is dark
variable) with a continuous distribution, which is, of course, not observed in

divisible, and the irreducible decomposition of it is given. The Planck
variable can be decomposed into an infinite sum of independent binary random
variables representing the binary photons (more accurately photo-molecules or
photo-multiplets) of energies 2^s*h*nu with s=0,1,2... . These binary photons
follow the Fermi statistics. Consequently, the black-body radiation can be
viewed as a mixture of statistically and thermodynamically independent fermion
gases consisting of binary photons. The binary photons give a natural tool for
the dyadic expansion of arbitrary (but not coherent) ordinary photon
excitations. It is shown that the binary photons have wave-particle
