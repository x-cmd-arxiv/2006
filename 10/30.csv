We also make predictions that should be testable by future instruments. The
power of the dynamical approach afforded by calculating fluxes from the merger

as seen in IRAC color-color plots with the relative amount of time the system
spends in a region of color-color space. We also present photo albums spanning
the lifetime of SMGs, from its infancy in the pre-merger phase to its final
stage as an elliptical galaxy, as seen in various bands. Finally, we compare
the SEDs from the simulations to recent observations of SMGs. Our calculations,
which match observed correlations both for local ULIRGs and higher redshift
systems, suggest that simulations of major mergers with black hole feedback
provide an excellent framework within which to understand the emission from
local ULIRGs, and their high redshift cousins, the submillimeter galaxies.

exists between equivalent widths of Li (EW(Li)) and rotation period (P$_{rot}$)
for Weak-line T
  Tauri stars (WTTSs). We find that rapidly rotating stars have lower EW(Li)
and the fast burning of Li begins at the phase when star's P$_{rot}$ evolves
towards 3 days among 0.9M$_\odot$ to 1.4M$_\odot$
  WTTSs in Taurus-Auriga. Our results support the conclusion by Piau &
Turch-Chi\'eze about a model for lithium depletion with age of the star and by
Bouvier et al. in relation to rotation evolution. The turn over of the curve
for the correlation between EW(Li) and P$_{rot}$ is at the phase of Zero-Age
Main Sequence (ZAMS).
  The EW(Li) decreases with decreasing P$_{rot}$ before the star reaches the
ZAMS, while it decreases with increasing P$_{rot}$ (decreasing rotation
velocity) for young low-mass main sequence stars. This result could be
explained as an age effect of Li depletion and the rapid rotation does not
inhibit Li destruction among low mass PMS stars.

epsilon Eridani, is usually attributed to resonances with embedded planets. In
a standard scenario, the Poynting-Robertson force, possibly enhanced by the
stellar wind drag, is responsible for the delivery of dust from outer regions
of the disk to locations of external mean-motion planetary resonances; the
captured particles then create characteristic ``clumps''. Alternatively, it has
been suggested that the observed features in systems like epsilon Eri may stem
from populations of planetesimals that have been captured in resonances with
the planet, such as Plutinos and Trojans in the solar system. A large fraction
of dust produced by these bodies would stay locked in the same resonance,
creating the dusty clumps. To investigate both scenarios and their
applicability limits for a wide range of stars, planets, disk densities, and
planetesimal families we construct simple analytic models for both scenarios.
In particular, we show that the first scenario works for disks with the pole-on
optical depths below about ~10^{-4}-10^{-5}. Above this optical depth level,
the first scenario will generate a narrow resonant ring with a hardly visible
azimuthal structure, rather than clumps. The efficiency of the second scenario
is proportional to the mass of the resonant planetesimal family, as example, a
family with a total mass of ~0.01 to 0.1 Earth masses could be sufficient to
account for the clumps of epsilon Eridani.

collisionless N-body and self-gravitating Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)
calculations which conserves momentum and energy exactly. This means that
spatially variable softening lengths can be used in N-body calculations without
secular increases in energy. The formalism requires the calculation of a small
additional term to the gravitational force related to the gradient of the
softening length. The extra term is similar in form to the usual SPH pressure
force (although opposite in direction) and is therefore straightforward to
implement in any SPH code at almost no extra cost. For N-body codes some
additional cost is involved as the formalism requires the computation of the
density via a summation over neighbouring particles using the smoothing kernel.
  The results of numerical tests demonstrate that, for homogeneous mass
distributions, the use of adaptive softening lengths gives a softening which is
always close to the `optimal' choice of fixed softening parameter, removing the
need for fine-tuning. For a heterogeneous mass distribution (as may be found in
any large scale N-body simulation) we find that the errors on the least-dense
component are lowered by an order of magnitude compared to the use of a fixed
softening length tuned to the densest component. For SPH codes our method
presents a natural and elegant choice of softening formalism which makes a
small improvement to both the force resolution and the total energy
conservation at almost zero additional cost.

For the first time we find evidence that cold, metal-rich gas is being
transported out of the center, possibly through bubble-induced mixing. Several
edges in the abundance map indicate an oscillation of the galaxy along the
NW/SE direction. Furthermore, the radio lobes appear to rise along the short
axis of the elliptical pressure distribution, following the steepest gradient
of the gravitational potential, and seem to contain a nonthermal pressure
component.

astronomical objects. Their modelisation in one dimension has been the subject
of numerous studies, but generalization to three dimensions is not
straightforward. We calculate analyticaly the absorption of radiation in a grey
uniform cylinder and show how it decreases with chi R, the product of the
opacity chi and of the cylinder radius R. Simple formulas, whose validity range
increases when chi R diminishes, are derived for the radiation field on the
axis of symmetry. Numerical calculations in three dimensions of the radiative
energy density, flux and pressure created by a stationary shock wave show how
the radiation decreases whith R. Finally, the bidimensional structures of both
the precursor and the radiation field are calculated with time-dependent
radiation hydrodynamics numerical simulations and the influence of
two-dimensional effects on the electron density, the temperature, the shock

INTEGRAL and archival Swift XRT observations. Methods: We performed an analysis
of INTEGRAL IBIS and JEM-X data with OSA 5.1 as well as an analysis of archive
Swift XRT data. Results: We report on fast flaring activity from the source on
timescales of a few tens of minutes, the first to be reported since its

Apr 2006) with similar peak fluxes and peak luminosities of 80 mCrab and

fully confirm the supergiant HMXB nature of AXJ1845.0-0433 which can therefore

3 different time intervals: before, during and after the flare. We fitted them
with a simple power law and then shifted a narrow emission and absorption line
template across the 2.5-10 keV data, in order to investigate the presence of
line-like features with a confidence level greater than 99%. Some highly
significant features were detected in 3 out of 7 sources studied. In
particular, the 3 sources, namely PG 1211+143, NGC 4051 and NGC 3783, showed
the presence of a variable emission feature in the 4.5-5.8 keV band,
characterized by an increase of its intensity after the flare peak. Because of
the observed variability pattern, this feature seems to be ascribable to a
reverbered redshifted relativistic component of the Fe K line.

emission from pulsars: the free electron maser models based on coherent inverse
Compton scattering of parallel oscillations of ambient electric field. The
observed properties of the pulsars imply that the Fourier spectrum of the
wiggler-like oscillations is narrow and that the broad-band character of the
radio emission reflects the width of the electron energy distribution. Such a
model provides a natural explanation for the frequency-independent separation
between the main pulse and interpulse of B0950+08 as well as for the lack of
radius to frequency mapping in the conal-like emission of J0437-4715. The
frequency behaviour of the main pulse in the profile of the first radio

solid-state gas sensors hailed for their exceptional sensitivity. The
fundamental reason limiting the resolution of such sensors is fluctuations due
to thermal motion of charges and defects which lead to intrinsic noise
exceeding the sought-after signal from individual molecules, usually by many
orders of magnitude. Here we show that micrometre-size sensors made from
graphene are capable of detecting individual events when a gas molecule
attaches to or detaches from graphenes surface. The adsorbed molecules change
the local carrier concentration in graphene one by one electron, which leads to
step-like changes in resistance. The achieved sensitivity is due to the fact
that graphene is an exceptionally low-noise material electronically, which
makes it a promising candidate not only for chemical detectors but also for
other applications where local probes sensitive to external charge, magnetic

dots (manifested through the appearance of Fano resonances in the conductance),
and interactions taken into account in the self-consistent Hartree-Fock

to the observation of more than one conductance peak per dot level as a
function of an applied gate voltage. This may explain recent experimental
findings, which were thought to be caused by interaction effects. For the
interacting case we find a wide variety of different interesting phenomena.
These include both monotonous and non-monotonous filling of the dot levels as a
function of an applied gate voltage, which may occur continuously or even
discontinuously. In many cases a combination of the different effects can occur
in the same sample. The behavior of the population influences, in turn, the
conductance lineshape, causing broadening and asymmetry of narrow peaks, and
determining whether there will be a zero transmission point. We elucidate the
essential role of the interference between the dot levels in determining these
outcomes. The effects of finite temperatures on the results are also examined.

distribution function for electrons in a nanochain evolves from the
Fermi-Dirac-like to the Luttinger-liquid-like with the increasing interatomic
distance. The concept of Hubbard subbands is introduced to nanoclusters, and
corresponds to the HOMO-LUMO splitting in the molecular and organic solid
states. Also, the nanochains exhibit magnetic splitting (Slater-like), even
without the symmetry breaking, since the spin-spin correlations extend over the
whole system. Thus, the correlated nanoscopic systems exhibit unique and
universal features, which differ from those of molecular and infinite systems.
These features define unique properties reflecting ""the Mott physics"" on the

means that a failure can be detected by at least one local stochastic diagnoser
within a finite delay. (2) We construct a codiagnoser from a given stochastic
automaton with multiple projections, and the codiagnoser associated with the
local diagnosers is used to test codiagnosability condition of SDESs. (3) We
deal with a number of basic properties of the codiagnoser. In particular, a
necessary and sufficient condition for the codiagnosability of SDESs is
presented. (4) We give a computing method in detail to check whether
codiagnosability is violated. And (5) some examples are described to illustrate
the applications of the codiagnosability and its computing method.

divided into two separate themes: coordinate conditions and perfect fluid
spheres. Regarding coordinate conditions we present a pedagogical discussion of
how the appropriate use of coordinate conditions can lead to simplifications in
the form of the spacetime curvature -- such tricks are often helpful when
seeking specific exact solutions of the Einstein equations. Regarding perfect
fluid spheres we present several methods of transforming any given perfect
fluid sphere into a possibly new perfect fluid sphere. This is done in three
qualitatively distinct manners: The first set of solution generating theorems
apply in Schwarzschild curvature coordinates, and are phrased in terms of the
metric components: they show how to transform one static spherical perfect
fluid spacetime geometry into another. A second set of solution generating
theorems extends these ideas to other coordinate systems (such as isotropic,
Gaussian polar, Buchdahl, Synge, and exponential coordinates), again working
directly in terms of the metric components. Finally, the solution generating
theorems are rephrased in terms of the TOV equation and density and pressure
profiles. Most of the relevant calculations are carried out analytically,
though some numerical explorations are also carried out.

equations of cosmology, leads to a modification of the latter to include energy
exchange between the matter and the ""dark energy"". The brane-world scenario
provides a natural set-up for such energy exchange and is analyzed in detail.
The role of brane-bulk energy exchange and of an induced gravity term on a
single braneworld of negative tension and vanishing effective cosmological
constant is studied. It is shown that for the physically interesting cases of
dust and radiation a unique global attractor which can realize our present
universe (accelerating and $0<\Omega_{m0}<1$) exists for a wide range of the
parameters of the model. For $\Omega_{m0}=0.3$, independently of the other
parameters, the model predicts that the equation of state for the dark energy
today is $w_{DE,0}=-1.4$, while $\Omega_{m0}=0.03$ leads to $w_{DE,0}=-1.03$.
In addition, during its evolution, $w_{DE}$ crosses the $w_{DE}=-1$ line to
smaller values.

the gauge theory Lagrangian and basic notions of AdS/CFT. This result may
provide an additional tool in exploring deformations of the N=4 SYM theory.

every parasupersymmetric quantum system of order p consists of N-fold
supersymmetric pairs with N<p or N=p and thus has weak quasi-solvability and

parasupersymmetry and is different from N-fold supersymmetry even in one-body
systems though the conserved charges are represented by higher-order linear
differential operators. To illustrate how our formulation works, we construct
second-order parafermionic algebra and three simple examples of
parasupersymmetric quantum systems of order 2, one is essentially equivalent to
the one-body Rubakov-Spiridonov type and the others are two-body systems in
which two supersymmetries are folded. In particular, we show that the first

holes in four-dimensional string theory. We point out there is a dual
relationship between entangled subsystems containing three and four tripartite
systems. This relationship is reflected in the structure of the expressions for
the black hole entropy in the N=4 and N=2 truncations of the $E_{7(7)}$
symmetric area form of N=8 supergravity. We conjecture that a similar picture
based on other qubit systems might hold for black hole solutions in magic

interpretations of the directly related Banach theorem about the inverse
operator has been touched. The contemporary apparatus of mathematical modeling
is shown to be in a drastic contradiction with concepts of J. Hadamard, S.
Banach and a number of other outstanding scientists in the sense that the
priority is given to the realization of algorithms, which actually imply that
ill-posed problems are adequate to real phenomena. A new method is developed
for solving problems traditionally associated with the Fredholm integral
equation of the first kind that admits of their reduction to Fredholm integral
equation of the second kind with properties most favorable for the numerical
realization. It is demonstrated that a wide circle of problems can be reduced
to two-dimensional Fredholm integral equations of the first kind; these are
linear boundary-value and initial-boundary-value problems with variable
coefficients, non-canonical domain of definition and others. The elaborated
algorithm is shown to be directly applicable to them and may be used for
testing their solvability. In discussing the formulation of problems of
mathematical physics, considerable attention is paid to methodological aspects.
Conclusions about cause-and-effect relations are argued to be essentially
illegitimate when the solution of a problem reduces to a primitive renaming of
known and unknown functions of a corresponding direct problem. The aim of this
work is a constructive realization of J. Hadamard's opinion that physically
meaningful problems are always well-posed.

algebraic Stein variety is not necessarily affine. In this paper, we give
sufficient and necessary conditions for an algebraic Stein variety to be
affine. One of our results is that an irreducible quasi-projective variety $Y$
defined over $\mathbb{C}$ with dimension $d$ ($d\geq 1$) is affine if and only
if $Y$ is Stein, $H^i(Y, {\mathcal{O}}_Y)=0$ for all $i>0$ and $\kappa(D, X)=
d$ (i.e., $D$ is a big divisor), where $X$ is a projective variety containing
$Y$ and $D$ is an effective divisor with support $X-Y$. If $Y$ is algebraic
Stein but not affine, we also discuss the possible transcendental degree of the
nonconstant regular functions on $Y$. We prove that $Y$ cannot have $d-1$
algebraically independent nonconstant regular functions. The interesting
phenomenon is that the transcendental degree can be even if the dimension of
$Y$ is even and the degree can be odd if the dimension of $Y$ is odd.

out of a unifying principle involving natural isomorphisms of the type
${(A\otimes B)\otimes(C\otimes D)\to(A\otimes C)\otimes(B\otimes D)}$, called
medial commutativity. Medial commutativity in the presence of the unit object
enables us to define associativity and commutativity natural isomorphisms. In
particular, Mac Lane's pentagonal and hexagonal coherence conditions for
associativity and commutativity are derived from the preservation up to a
natural isomorphism of medial commutativity by the biendofunctor $\otimes$.
This preservation boils down to an isomorphic representation of the Yang-Baxter
equation of symmetric and braid groups. The assumptions of monoidal categories,
and in particular Mac Lane's pentagonal coherence condition, are explained in
the absence of commutativity, and also of the unit object, by a similar
preservation of associativity by the biendofunctor $\otimes$. In the final
section one finds coherence conditions for medial commutativity in the absence
of the unit object. These conditions are obtained by taking the direct product
of the symmetric groups $S_{n \choose i}$ for $0\leq i\leq n$.

supersymmetric particle LSP or neutralino. 2) The lightest Kaluza-Klein
particles in theories of extra dimensions and 3) other extensions of the
standard model. In order to get the event rates one needs information about the
structure of the nucleon as well as as the structure of the nucleus and the
WIMP velocity distribution. These are also examined
  Since the expected event rates for detecting the recoiling nucleus are
extremely low and the signal does not have a characteristic signature to
discriminate them against background we consider some additional aspects of the
WIMP nucleus interaction, such as the periodic behavior of the rates due to the
motion of Earth (modulation effect). Since, unfortunately, this is
characterized by a small amplitude we consider other options such as
directional experiments, which measure not only the energy of the recoiling
nuclei but their direction as well. In these, albeit hard, experiments one can
exploit two very characteristic signatures: a)large asymmetries and b)
interesting modulation patterns. Furthermore we extended our study to include
evaluation of the rates for other than recoil searches such as: i) Transitions
to excited states, ii) Detection of recoiling electrons produced during the
neutralino-nucleus interaction and iii) Observation of hard X-rays following
the de-excitation of the ionized atom.

with a definite sign. The magnitude of these wake-fields is proportional with
the incoming field strength, and a sign of them is governed by the cosine of
the carrier-envelope phase difference of the incoming pulse. At relativistic
laser intensities the target is considered as a plasma layer in vacuum,
produced from a thin foil by a pre-pulse, which is followed by the main
high-intensity laser pulse. The nonlinearities stemming from the relativistic
kinematics of the surface current density (representing the plasma electrons)
lead to the appearance of higher-harmonics in the scattered spectra. In
general, the harmonic peaks are down-shited due to the presence of an
intensity-dependent factor. Certain regions of these spectra are very sensitive
to the variation of the carrier-envelope phase difference. The spectra has a
long tail where the heigths of the peaks vary practically within one order of
magnitude forming a quasi-continuum. By Fourier synthetising the components
from this plateau region attosecond pulses have been obtained.

cellular function, which in part involves comprehensive transcriptional
regulatory (TR) mechanisms carried out in response to complex environmental
signals in the context of the cell's own internal state. However, the network
topological basis of developing such integrated responses remains poorly
understood.
  RESULTS. By studying the TR network of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae we
show that an intermediate layer of transcription factors naturally segregates
into distinct subnetworks. In these topological units transcription factors are
densely interlinked in a largely hierarchical manner and respond to external
signals by utilizing a fraction of these subnets.
  CONCLUSIONS. As transcriptional regulation represents the ""slow"" component of
overall information processing, the identified topology suggests a model in
which successive waves of transcriptional regulation originating from distinct
fractions of the TR network control robust integrated responses to complex
stimuli.

spontaneously at low intraterminal calcium concentrations and is stimulated by
a rise in intracellular calcium. Exocytosis is compensated for by the
reformation of vesicles at plasma membrane and endosomes. Although the adaptor
complex AP-3 was proposed to be involved in the formation of SVs from
endosomes, whether its function has an indirect effect on exocytosis remains
unknown. Using mocha mice, which are deficient in functional AP-3, we identify
an AP-3-dependent tetanus neurotoxin-resistant asynchronous release that can be
evoked at hippocampal mossy fiber (MF) synapses. Presynaptic targeting of the
tetanus neurotoxin-resistant vesicle soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor
attachment protein receptor (SNARE) tetanus neurotoxin-insensitive
vesicle-associated membrane protein (TI-VAMP) is lost in mocha hippocampal MF
terminals, whereas the localization of synaptobrevin 2 is unaffected. In
addition, quantal release in mocha cultures is more frequent and more sensitive
to sucrose. We conclude that lack of AP-3 results in more constitutive
secretion and loss of an asynchronous evoked release component, suggesting an
important function of AP-3 in regulating SV exocytosis at MF terminals.
