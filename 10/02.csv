designed to account for the diversity of galaxy properties in the nearby
universe. To construct this system we statistically analyse a sample of >22,000
galaxies at v<15,000 km/s (z<0.05) with Spearman rank and principal component
analyses. Fourteen major galaxy properties are considered, including: Hubble
type, size, colour, surface brightness, magnitude, stellar mass, internal
velocities, HI gas content, and an index that measures dynamical disturbances.
We find, to a high degree, that most galaxy properties are correlated, with in
particular Hubble type, colour, and stellar mass all strongly related. We argue
that this tight 3-way correlation is a result of evolutionary processes that
depend on galaxy mass, as we show that the relation between colour and mass is
independent of Hubble type. Various principal component analyses reveal that
most of the variation in nearby galaxy properties can be accounted for by
eigenvectors dominated by: (i) the scale of a galaxy, such as its stellar mass,
(ii) the spectral type, and (iii) the degree of dynamical disturbances. We
suggest that these three properties: mass, star formation, and
interactions/mergers are the major features that determine a galaxy's physical
state, and should be used to classify galaxies. As shown in Conselice (2003),
these properties are measurable within the CAS (concentration, asymmetry,
clumpiness) structural system, thus providing an efficient mechanism for
classifying galaxies in optical light within a physical meaningful framework.
We furthermore discuss the fraction and number density of galaxies in the
nearby universe as a function of Hubble type, for comparison with higher
redshift populations.

loaded PNSs. When the toroidal magnetic component dominates over the poloidal

In this paper, we identify the intergalactic medium (i.e. the region between
gravitationally-bound galaxies) as a major sink for galactic dust. We discover
a systematic shift in the colour of background galaxies viewed through the
intergalactic medium of the nearby M81 group. This reddening coincides with
atomic, neutral gas previously detected between the group members. The
dust-to-HI mass ratio is high (1/20) compared to that of the solar neighborhood

power-law distribution $\propto \lambda^{-2.33}$. The tail of this curve agrees
well with the B, V, and J magnitudes of T Pyx, indicating that the contribution
of the secondary star is negligible. One peculiar aspect of T Pyx is that most
emission lines (the strongest ones being those of CIV 1550 and HeII 1640) show
substantial changes both in intensity and detectability, in contrast to the
near constancy of the continuum. Several individual spectra display emission
features that are difficult to identify, suggesting a composite spectroscopic
system. We tentatively ascribe the origin of these transient emission features
either to loops and jets from the irradiated secondary or to moving knots of
the surrounding nebula that are (temporarily) projected in front of the system.
The inspection of all IUE line-by-line images has led to the detection of
emission spikes outside the central strip of the spectrum, which in some cases
seem associated to known emission features in the (main) spectrum. A comparison

  shortened",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20065949",,"astro-ph",,"  Context: Sticking of colliding dust particles through van der Waals forces is
the first stage in the grain growth process in protoplanetary disks, eventually
leading to the formation of comets, asteroids and planets. A key aspect of the
collisional evolution is the coupling between dust and gas motions, which
depends on the internal structure (porosity) of aggregates. Aims: To quantify
the importance of the internal structure on the collisional evolution of
particles, and to create a new coagulation model to investigate the difference
between porous and compact coagulation in the context of a turbulent
protoplanetary disk. Methods: We have developed simple prescriptions for the
collisional evolution of porosity of grain-aggregates in grain-grain
collisions. Three regimes can then be distinguished: `hit-and-stick' at low
velocities, with an increase in porosity; compaction at intermediate
velocities, with a decrease of porosity; and fragmentation at high velocities.
(..) Results: (..) We can discern three different stages in the particle growth
process (..) We find that when compared to standard, compact models of
coagulation, porous growth delays the onset of settling, because the surface
area-to-mass ratio is higher, a consequence of the build-up of porosity during
the initial stages. As a result, particles grow orders of magnitudes larger in
mass before they rain-out to the mid-plane. Depending on the turbulent
viscosity and on the position in the nebula, aggregates can grow to (porous)
sizes of ~ 10 cm in a few thousand years. We also find that collisional
energies are higher than in the limited PCA/CCA fractal models, thereby
allowing aggregates to restructure. It is concluded that the microphysics of
collisions plays a key role in the growth process.

that all SAS-generated lightcurves are synchronised by time filtering, even if

have computed the main physical parameters in each bullet and compared them
with other tracers of warm and dense gas and with models for the SiO excitation
in shocks. We find that the bullets close to L1448--mm, associated with high
velocity gas, have higher excitation conditions (n(H2) ~ 10^{6} cm^{-3}, T >
500 K) with respect to the L1157 bullets (n(H2) ~1-5 10^{5} cm^{-3}, T ~
100-300 K). In both the sources, there is a clear evidence of the presence of
velocity components having different excitation conditions, with the denser
and/or warmer gas associated with the gas at the higher speed. In L1448 the
bulk of the emission is due to the high-excitation and high velocity gas, while
in L1157 most of the emission comes from the low excitation gas at ambient
velocity. The observed velocity-averaged line ratios are well reproduced by
shocks with speeds v_s larger than ~ 30 km/s and densities ~ 10^{5} - 10^{6}
cm^{-3}. Plane-parallel shock models, however, fail to predict all the observed
line profiles and in particular the very similar profiles shown by both low and
high excitation lines. The overall observations support the idea that the L1157
clumps are shock interaction events older than the L1448 bullets close to the
driving source. In the latter objects, the velocity structure and the
variations of physical parameters with the velocity resemble very closely those
found in optical/IR jets near the protostar, suggesting that similar launching
and excitation mechanisms are also at the origin of collimated jets seen at

  August 2006",,"10.1017/S1743921307000853",,"astro-ph",,"  We have performed the first three-dimensional non-linear simulation of the
turbulent convective envelope of a rotating 0.8 Msun RGB star using the ASH
code. Adopting a global typical rotation rate of a tenth of the solar rate, we
have analyzed the dynamical properties of the convection and the transport of
angular momentum within the inner 50% in radius of the convective envelope. The
convective patterns consist of a small number of large cell, associated with
fast flows (about 3000 m/s) and large temperature fluctuations (about 300 K) in
order to carry outward the large luminosity (L* = 400 Lsun) of the star. The
interactions between convection and rotation give rise to a large radial
differential rotation and a meridional circulation possessing one cell per
hemisphere, the flow being poleward in both hemisphere. By analysing the
redistribution of angular momentum, we find that the meridional circulation
transports the angular momentum outward in the radial direction, and poleward
in the latitudinal direction, and that the transport by Reynolds stresses acts
in the opposite direction. From this 3-D simulation, we have derived an average
radial rotation profile, that we will ultimately introduce back into 1-D
stellar evolution code.

based on high resolution, high S/N ratio spectra from AAT/UCLES. Our sample
includes stars from Feltzing & Holmberg (2000, A&A, 357, 153), as well as from
Eggen (1998, AJ, 115, 2453). Abundances were derived for Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca,
Mn, Fe, Ni, Zr, Ba, Ce, Nd, and Eu. The alpha, Fe, and Fe-peak element
abundances show a bimodal distribution, with four stars having solar
metallicities while the remaining 14 stars are metal rich [Fe/H] >= 0.25 dex.
However the abundances of these two groups converge for the heavier n-capture
elements. Based on their photometry and kinematics, three of the four deviating
stars are likely non-members or binaries. Although one star cannot be excluded
on these grounds, we do expect low-level contamination from field stars within
the HR1614 moving group's range of magnitude, color and space velocities.
Disregarding these four stars, the abundance scatter across the group members
for all elements is low. We find that there is an 80% probability that the
intrinsic scatter does not exceed the following values: Fe 0.01; Na 0.08; Mg
0.02; Al 0.06; Si 0.02; Ca 0.02; Mn 0.01; Ni 0.01; Zr 0.03; Ba 0.03; Ce 0.04;
Nd 0.01 and Eu 0.02 dex. The homogeneity of the HR 1614 group in age and
abundance suggests that it is the remnant of a dispersed star-forming event.
Its kinematical coherence shows that such a dispersing system need not be
significantly perturbed by external dynamical influences like galactic spiral
structure or giant molecular clouds, at least over a period of 2 Gyr.

argued that the 10 quasars in this article with a long term time average

fit the redshift (z) and the jet opening-angle distributions measured with
earlier GRB missions and with Swift. The effect of different sensitivities for
GRB triggering is sufficient to explain the difference in the z distributions
of the pre-Swift and Swift samples, with mean redshifts of <z> ~1.5 and
<z>~2.7, respectively. Assuming that the emission properties of GRBs do not
change with time, we find that the data can only be fitted if the comoving
rate-density of GRB sources exhibits positive evolution to z >~ 3-5. The mean
intrinsic beaming factor of GRBs is found to range from ~34-42, with the Swift
average opening half-angle <\theta_j> ~10 degree, compared to the pre-Swift
average of <\theta_j> ~7 degree. Within the uniform jet model, the GRB
luminosity function is proportional to L^{-3.25}_*, as inferred from our best
fit to the opening angle distribution. Because of the unlikely detection of
several GRBs with z <~ 0.25, our analysis indicates that low redshift GRBs
represent a different population of GRBs than those detected at higher
redshifts. Neglecting possible metallicity effects on GRB host galaxies, we
find that ~1 GRB occurs every 600,000 yrs in a local L_* spiral galaxy like the
Milky Way. The fraction of high-redshift GRBs is estimated at 8-12% and 2.5-6%
at z >= 5 and z >= 7, respectively, assuming continued positive evolution of

Maffei 2. The observations have allowed for a determination of the Galactic
extinction of this galaxy using a correlation between extinction and hydrogen
column density observed among spirals. The technique reveals that the optical
depth of Galactic dust at 1 micron obscuring Maffei 2 is tau1 = 2.017 +/-
0.211, which implies that A_V = 5.58 +/- 0.58 mag, significantly higher than
observed for the giant elliptical Maffei 1 despite its similar latitude. For
comparison, we apply the same technique to IC 342, a neighbouring spiral to
Maffei 2 but with more moderate obscuration by Galactic dust, owing to its
higher Galactic latitude. For this galaxy, we obtain tau1 = 0.692 +/- 0.066,
which agrees within errors with the value of 0.639 +/- 0.102 derived from the
reddening estimate of Schlegel et al. (1998, ApJ, 500, 525). We therefore adopt
the weighted mean of tau1 = 0.677 +/- 0.056 for the extinction of IC 342, which
implies that A_V = 1.92 +/- 0.16 mag. A new distance estimate for Maffei 2 of
3.34 +/- 0.56 Mpc is obtained from a self-consistent Tully-Fisher relation in I
adjusted to the NGC 4258 maser zero-point. With our new measurement of M_I,
Maffei 2 joins Maffei 1 and IC 342 as one of three giant members of the nearby

galaxies based on the most accurate extinction and distance estimates to date,
accounting for shifts in the effective wavelengths of broadband filters as this
effect can be significant for highly reddened galaxies. The revised distances
are consistent with what would be suspected for the Hubble Flow, making it

is possible to remove the tension between the above observations and model
predictions by allowing a fraction of stars to be scattered to the Diffuse
Stellar Component (DSC) of galaxy clusters at each galaxy merger, as recently
suggested by the analysis of N-body hydrodynamical simulations. To this
purpose, we use the MORGANA model of galaxy formation in a minimal version, in
which gas cooling and star formation are switched off after z=1. In this way,
any predicted evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function is purely driven by
mergers. We show that, even in this extreme case, the predicted degree of
evolution of the high end of the stellar mass function is larger than that
suggested by data. Assuming instead that a significant fraction, ~30 per cent,
of stars are scattered in the DSC at each merger event, leads to a significant
suppression of the predicted evolution, in better agreement with observational
constraints, while providing a total amount of DSC in clusters which is
consistent with recent observational determinations.

scattering of classical waves in random medium in different regimes is
investigated, with emphasize to weak localization effects. Many principle
topics are discussed once again. We obtain new expressions for the incoherent
and coherent multiple scattering intensities for the more general case of large
scattering angles and various observation points inside the medium with moving
scatterers and absorption. (The results, we reached, assuming white-noise
disorder for the impurities correlator, contain one-dimensional integration in
its final analytical form). Also new self-consistent formulas for incoherent
and coherent intensities for fixed multiplicity orders of scattering are given
and their lineshapes are graphically represented. Through these formulas we
clearly demonstrate that the impurities motion reduces the contribution to the
intensity of the scatterings with large multiplicity orders. The total
scattering intensities in $4\pi$ solid angle are calculated for the general
case and compared with their diffusion approximation. For coherent intensities
it is shown that a drastic deviation from the exact results occurs. It turns
out that the region of angles, for which the observed lineshape of the weak
localization effect tends to the incoherent background, give the main
contribution to the total coherent scattered intensity. The last quantity
happens to depend linearly instead of predicted quadratic dependence on the
perturbation parameter, 1/kl.

However, even though such devices are becoming increasingly important in

experiments needed to study the problem and the large number of tunable
parameters in such systems.
  In this paper we apply a recently introduced algorithm to implement
hydrophobic fluid-wall interactions in the lattice Boltzmann method. We find a
possible explanation for some experiments observing a slip length depending on
the flow velocity which is contradictory to many theoretical results and
simulations. Our explanation is that a velocity dependent slip can be detected
if the flow profile is not fully developed within the channel, but in a
transient state.
  Further, we show a decrease of the measured slip length with increasing
viscosity and demonstrate the effect of adding surfactant to a fluid flow in a
hydrophobic microchannel. The addition of surfactant can shield the repulsive
potential of hydrophobic walls, thus lowering the amount of slip with
increasing surfactant concentration.

curvature $\mu>0$. Earlier solutions of $R\to \infty$ version of this model
were based on combining the replica trick with the Gaussian Variational Ansatz
(GVA) for free energy, and revealed a possibility of a glassy phase at low
temperatures. For a general $R$, we show how to utilize instead the underlying
rotational symmetry of the replicated partition function and to arrive to a
compact expression for the free energy in the limit $N\to \infty$ directly,
without any need for intermediate variational approximations. This method
reveals striking similarity with the much-studied spherical model of spin
glasses. Depending on the value of $R$ and the three types of disorder -
short-ranged, long-ranged, and logarithmic - the phase diagram of the system in
the $(\mu,T)$ plane undergoes considerable modifications. In the limit of
infinite confinement radius our analysis confirms all previous results obtained
by GVA.

error not only in the value of the sample but in the effective position of the
drawn sample. We refer to the latter as imprecise sampling and apply this
concept to the fourier-based acquisition of magnetic resonance data. The
analysis shows that the effect of such imprecisely sampled data accounts for
contributions to noise, blurring, and intensity-bias in the image. Under
general circumstances, the blur and the bias may depend on the scanned specimen
itself. We show that for gaussian distributed imprecision of k-vector samples
the resulting intensity inhomogeneity can be explicitly computed. The presented
mechanism of imprecise k-space sampling (IKS) provides a complementary
explanation for the phenomenon of central brightening in high-field magnetic
resonance imaging. In computed experiments, we demonstrate the adequacy of the
IKS effect for explaining central brightening. Furthermore, the experiments
show that basic properties of IKS can in principle be inferred from real MRI
data by the analysis on the basis of bias fields in magnitude images and

consider two kinds of models. The first has $N$ standard model sectors
symmetric under arbitrary permutations thereof. The second has $p$ left-chiral
standard model sectors and $p$ right-chiral or mirror standard model sectors,
with $p$-fold permutation symmetries within both and a discrete parity
transformation interchanging left and right. In both kinds of models the
lightest scalar has an invisible width fraction 1/N, which will provide an
important means of experimentally testing this class of models.

generalizes Polyakov's two-dimensional quantum gravity when viewed as the

a similar way to the Gross-Witten transition in the D=1+1 SU(N\to\infty)

approximately the same coupling that increases with N, which is connected to
Z_N monopoles (instantons), reminiscent of the first order bulk transition that
occurs in D=3+1 for N > 4. Our calculations are not precise enough to determine
whether this peak is due to a second-order phase transition at N=\infty or to a
third-order phase transition with different critical behaviour to that of the
Gross-Witten transition. We investigate whether the trace of the Wilson loop
has a non-analyticity in the coupling at some critical area, but find no
evidence for this. However we do find that, just as one can prove occurs in
D=1+1, the eigenvalue density of a Wilson loop forms a gap at N=\infty at a
critical value of its trace. We show that this gap formation is in fact a
corollary of a remarkable similarity between the eigenvalue spectra of Wilson
loops in D=1+1 and D=2+1 (and indeed D=3+1): for the same value of the trace,
the eigenvalue spectra are nearly identical. This holds for finite as well as

of oscillatory integrals which frequently arise in problems connected to wave
propagation and general hyperbolic equations. The problem is to evaluate
numerically a so-called Fourier integral operator (FIO) of the form $\int
e^{2\pi i \Phi(x,\xi)} a(x,\xi) \hat{f}(\xi) \mathrm{d}\xi$ at points given on
a Cartesian grid. Here, $\xi$ is a frequency variable, $\hat f(\xi)$ is the
Fourier transform of the input $f$, $a(x,\xi)$ is an amplitude and
$\Phi(x,\xi)$ is a phase function, which is typically as large as $|\xi|$;
hence the integral is highly oscillatory at high frequencies. Because an FIO is
a dense matrix, a naive matrix vector product with an input given on a
Cartesian grid of size $N$ by $N$ would require $O(N^4)$ operations.
  This paper develops a new numerical algorithm which requires $O(N^{2.5} \log
N)$ operations, and as low as $O(\sqrt{N})$ in storage space. It operates by
localizing the integral over polar wedges with small angular aperture in the
frequency plane. On each wedge, the algorithm factorizes the kernel $e^{2 \pi i
\Phi(x,\xi)} a(x,\xi)$ into two components: 1) a diffeomorphism which is
handled by means of a nonuniform FFT and 2) a residual factor which is handled
by numerical separation of the spatial and frequency variables. The key to the
complexity and accuracy estimates is that the separation rank of the residual
kernel is \emph{provably independent of the problem size}. Several numerical
examples demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed methodology.
We also discuss the potential of our ideas for various applications such as
reflection seismology.

between the most important geometric objects associated to $(M,L)$ and the

$\widetilde{L}=e^{\sigma(x)} L$ being the Finsler conformal transformation. We
have found explicit global expressions relating the two associated Cartan
connections $\nabla$ and $\widetilde{\nabla}$, the two associated Berwald
connections $D$ and $\widetilde{D}$ and the two associated Barthel connections
$\Gamma$ and $\widetilde{\Gamma}$. The relationships between the corresponding
curvature tensors have been also found. The relations thus obtained lead in
turn to several interesting results.
  Among the results obtained, is a characterization of conformal changes, a
characterization of homotheties, some conformal invariants and conformal
$\sigma$-invariants. In addition, several useful identities have been found.
  Our global theory of conformal Finsler geometry is established within the
Pull-back approach, making simultaneous use of the Klein-Grifone approach. This
has been done via certain links we have found between both approaches (This
shows that these two approaches to global Finsler geometry are not alternatives
but rather complementary).
  Although our treatment is entirely global, the local expressions of the
obtained results, when calculated, coincide with the existing classical local
results.

covariant quantization of the electromagnetic field. We show two more evident
mathematical reasons why such indefinite metric appears. The first idea is the
replacement of involution on an algebra. For an algebra ${\cal A}$ with an
involution $\sdag$ such that a representation of the involutive algebra $({\cal
A},\sdag)$ brings an indefinite-metric space, we replace the involution $\sdag$
with a new one * on ${\cal A}$ such that $({\cal A},*)$ is a well-known
involutive algebra acting on a representation space with positive definite
metric. This explains that non-isomorphic two involutive algebras are
transformed each other by the replacement of involution. The second is that a
covariant (Hilbert space) representation $({\cal H},\pi,U)$ of an involutive
dynamical system $(({\cal A},*),{\bf Z}_{2},\alpha)$ brings a Krein space
representation of the algebra ${\cal A}$ with the replaced involution. For
example, we show representations of abnormal CCRs, CARs and pseudo-Cuntz
algebras arising from those of standard CCRs, CARs and Cuntz algebras.

various scientific domains. Examples can be found in physics, electrochemistry,
heterogeneous catalysis, physiology, etc. To obtain new information about
diffusive or Laplacian transport towards a semi-permeable or resistive
interface, one can study the random trajectories of diffusing particles
modeled, in a first approximation, by the partially reflected Brownian motion.
This stochastic process turns out to be a convenient mathematical foundation
for discrete, semi-continuous and continuous theoretical descriptions of
diffusive transport.
  This paper presents an overview of these topics with a special emphasis on
the close relation between stochastic processes with partial reflections and
Laplacian transport phenomena. We give selected examples of these phenomena
followed by a brief introduction to the partially reflected Brownian motion and
related probabilistic topics (e.g., local time process and spread harmonic
measure). A particular attention is paid to the use of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann

the target and projectile. However, in the case of reactions where at least one

signal sampling at evenly spaced time intervals is the rule: however this is

long-memory noise processes, i.e., power-law noises $1/f^\alpha$ with $\alpha >

discussion. Afterwards I got the impression that I had not succeeded in making
my points clear. Therefore, I wrote an explanatory letter to Prof. von
Weizsaecker. This was the beginning of a correspondence on the questions
intimated by the title above. In addition, a private discussion between Prof.
von Weizsaecker and myself took place. Some readers may be interested in the
answers which Carl Friedrich von Weizsaecker has given to the naive questions
and views of a physicist with only a rudimentary education in philosophy. The
starting point of our discussion was my remark that the conspicuous inability
of philosophers to agree on the deepest elements of human existence including
the basic questions of ethics, which is tantamount to the occurrence of
different schools of philosophy competing with each other, could perhaps be
traced back to the fundamental inability of man to attain self-knowledge.
Physicists, on the other hand, can reach consent, in an equally remarkable way,
on the results of their measurements and on whether or not these results agree
with the ideas of theory. They just have to deal with res extensa. Here the
yardstick does not intend to measure itself, but objects which are external to
it, and this is possible. There remains only the question what consequences can
be drawn from this realization. Is philosophy, in as much as it gives
statements on the totality of human existence, only an expression of the
prevailing social circumstances and views, interesting enough as such, but not
a gateway to truth?

in an ecological system. If it is assumed that urchins are asocial, and that
they move randomly, then the formation of these dense fronts is an apparent
paradox. The key lies in observations that urchins move further in areas where
their algal food is less plentiful. This naturally leads to the accumulation of
urchins in areas with abundant algae. If urchin movement is represented as a
random walk, with a step size that depends on algal concentration, then their
movement may be described by a Fokker-Planck diffusion equation. For certain
combinations of algal growth and urchin grazing, travelling wave solutions are
obtained. Two dimensional simulations of urchin algal dynamics show that an
initially uniformly distributed urchin population, grazing on an alga with a
smoothly varying density, may form a propagating front separating two sharply
delineated regions. On one side of the front algal density is uniformly low,
and on the other side of the front algal density is uniformly high. Bounds on
when stable fronts will form are obtained in terms of urchin density and
grazing, and algal growth.

weak coupling assumption, but no Born or Markov approximation. We derived a
non-Markovian master equation for the evolution of the reduced density matrix
of the two-qubit system after integrating out the electromagnetic field modes.
It contains a Markovian part with a Lindblad type operator and a nonMarkovian
contribution, the physics of which is the main focus of this study. We use the
concurrence function as a measure of quantum entanglement between the two
qubits. Two classes of states are studied in detail: Class A is a one parameter
family of states which are the superposition of the highest energy and Class B
states are linear combinations of the symmetric and the antisymmetric Bell
states. We obtain similar behavior for the Bell states as in earlier results
derived by using the Born-Markov approximation. However, in the Class A states
the behavior is qualitatively different: under the non-Markovian evolution we
do not see sudden death of quantum entanglement and subsequent revivals, except
when the qubits are sufficiently far apart. We provide explanations for such
differences of behavior both between these two classes of states and between
the predictions from the Markov and non-Markovian dynamics. We also study the
decoherence of this two-qubit system and find that the decoherence rate in the
case of one qubit initially in an excited state does not change significantly
with the qubits separation whereas it does for the case when one qubit is
initially in the ground state.

junction (JJ) as a ""macroscopic quantum system"". On the other hand the
interpretation of experimental data strongly depends on the assumed theoretical
model. We analyse the possible states of a Cooper pair box (""charge qubit"") for
the two types of models : two-mode Bose-Hubbard model with its large $N$
aproximations and the many-body description within the mean-field approximation
(Gross-Pitaevski equation). While the first class of models supports the
picture of JJ being a quantum subsystem of a single degree of freedom, the
second approach yields an essentially classical structure of accessible quantum
states which, in particular, implies the absence of entanglement for two
coupled JJ's. The arguments in favor of the mean-field theory are presented and
different experimental tests including a new proposal are briefly discussed.

  experiment","4 pages",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A new class of generalized solutions related to the essential spectrum of
linear Maxwell's equations is presented. The essential modes are given in terms
of normalized singular Weyl's sequences, whose square represents Dirac's delta
functions in spatial and angular frequency domains. The action integral
associated with essential modes is well-defined. We claim that these modes
represent the collapsed state of the electromagnetic field and, with some
additional assumptions on the conservation of action, are suitable for
describing the double-slit experiment in accordance with the orthodox point of
view.
