Strong variations of the pulse profile with the energy and source intensity

doubt into earlier claims supporting the former as a good tracer of such gas
(Gao & Solomon 2004; Wu et al. 2006). In this paper new sensitive HCN J=4--3
observations of four such galaxies are presented, revealing a surprisingly wide
excitation range for their dense gas phase that may render the J=1--0
transition from either species a poor proxy of its mass. Moreover the
well-known sensitivity of the HCO$^+$ abundance on the ionization degree of the
molecular gas (an important issue omitted from the ongoing discussion about the
relative merits of HCN and HCO$^+$ as dense gas tracers) may severely reduce
the HCO$^+$ abundance in the star-forming and highly turbulent molecular gas
found in LIRGs, while HCN remains abundant. This may result to the decreasing
HCO$^+$/HCN J=1--0 line ratio with increasing IR luminosity found in LIRGs, and
casts doubts on the HCO$^+$ rather than the HCN as a good dense molecular gas
tracer. Multi-transition observations of both molecules are needed to identify
the best such tracer, its relation to ongoing star formation, and constrain
what may be a considerable range of dense gas properties in such galaxies.

bound groups. Therefore, mergers between two clusters are likely to occur. If
these clusters both harbor an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH; 10^{2-4}
Msun) in their center, they can become a strong source of gravitational waves
when the black holes merge with each other. In order to understand the
dynamical processes that operate in such a scenario, one has to study the
evolution of the merger of two such young massive star clusters, and more
specifically, their respective IMBHs. We employ the direct-summation Nbody4
numerical tool on special-purpose GRAPE6 hardware to simulate a merger of two
stellar clusters each containing 63,000 particles and a central IMBH. This
allows us to study accurately the orbital evolution of the colliding clusters
and the embedded massive black holes. Within ~7 Myr the clusters have merged
and the IMBHs constitute a hard binary. The final coalescence happens in ~10^8
yrs. The implication of our analysis is that intermediate-mass black holes
merging as the result of coalescence of young dense clusters could provide a
source for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) space-based
gravitational wave detector mission. We find that interactions with stars
increase the eccentricity of the IMBH binary to about 0.8. Although the binary
later circularizes by emission of gravitational waves, the residual
eccentricity can be detectable through its influence on the phase of the waves
if the last few years of inspiral are observed.

have been assumed from their association with core-collapse supernovae. Several
implications follow from these findings. The redshift distribution of observed
GRBs is expected to peak at higher redshift (compared to cosmic star
formation), which is supported by the mean redshift of the Swift GRB sample,
<z>~3. If GRBs are, in fact, the source of the observed UHECR, then cosmic-ray
production would evolve with redshift in a stronger fashion than has been
previously suggested. This necessarily leads, through the GZK process, to an
enhancement in the flux of cosmogenic neutrinos, providing a near-term approach
for testing the gamma-ray burst-cosmic ray connection with ongoing and proposed

aligned along a direction close to the orientation of the molecular outflow
observed on angular scales of 1-10 arcsec, tracing possibly the disk-wind
emerging from the disk atmosphere. In AFGL 5142 water masers trace expansion at
the base of a protostellar jet, whilst methanol masers are more probably

of Nelemans et al. (2000) that formation via conservative mass transfer and a
common envelope with spiral-in based on energy balance or via two such
spiralins cannot explain the formation of all observed systems. We investigate
three different prescriptions of envelope ejection due to dynamical mass loss

structure formation scenarios, providing constraints on the nature of dark
matter itself. Several techniques have been used to probe the mass
distributions of clusters, sometimes yielding results which are discrepant, or
at odds with clusters formed in simulations - for example giving NFW
concentration parameters much higher than expected in the standard CDM model.
In addition, the velocity fields of some well studied galaxy clusters reveal
the presence of several structures close to the line-of-sight, often not
dynamically bound to the cluster itself. We investigate what impact such
neighbouring but unbound massive structures would have on the determination of
cluster profiles using weak gravitational lensing. Depending on its
concentration and mass ratio to the primary halo, one secondary halo close to
the line-of-sight can cause the estimated NFW concentration parameter to be
significantly higher than that of the primary halo, and also cause the
estimated mass to be biased high. Although it is difficult to envisage how this
mechanism alone could yield concentrations as high as reported for some
clusters, multiple haloes close to the line-of-sight, such as in the case of
Abell 1689, can substantially increase the concentration parameter estimate.
Together with the fact that clusters are triaxial, and that including baryonic
physics also leads to an increase in the concentration of a dark matter halo,
the tension between observations and the standard CDM model is eased. If the
alignment with the secondary structure is imprecise, then the estimated
concentration parameter can also be even lower than that of the primary halo,
reinforcing the importance of identifying structures in cluster fields.

unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV luminosity of ~2E40 erg/s (assuming a distance of 3.4Mpc)
and a soft spectrum apparently represented by a multi-color disk model with an
innermost disk temperature of 1.3-1.5 keV. Adding a power-law model further
improved the fit. However, as previously reported, the high luminosity cannot
be reconciled with the high disk temperature within a framework of the standard
accretion disk radiating at a sub-Eddington luminosity. Therefore, we modified
the multi-color disk model, and allowed the local disk temperature to scale as
r^(-p) on the distance r from the black hole, with p being a free parameter. We
then found that the XMM-Newton and the ASCA spectra can be both reproduced
successfully with p~0.6 and the innermost disk temperature of 1.4-1.8 keV.
These flatter temperature profiles suggest deviation from the standard
Shakura-Sunyaev disk, and are consistent with predictions of a slim disk model.

soft energy band plus a weak power-law tail that becomes dominant only above
\~20keV. The disk temperature decreases from 1.4keV to 1.2keV as the flux
decreases by a factor 2, consistent with a constant radius as expected for
disk-dominated spectra. All the observations reveal significant absorption
lines from highly ionized (H-like and He-like) iron Ka at 7.0keV and 6.7keV.
The brightest datasets also show significant but weaker absorption structures
between 7.8keV and 8.2keV, which we identify as a blend of iron Kb and nickel
Ka absorption lines. The energies of these absorption lines suggest a blue
shift with an outflow velocity of ~1000km/s.. The H-like iron Ka equivalent
width remains approximately constant at ~30 eV over all the observations, while
that of the He-like Ka line increases from 7 eV to 20 eV. Thus the ionization
state of the material decreases, as expected from the decline in flux. We fit
the profiles with Voigt functions (curve of growth) to derive absorbing
columns, then use these together with detailed photo-ionization calculations to
derive physical parameters of the absorbing material. The data then constrain
the velocity dispersion of the absorber to 200-2000 km/s, and the size of the

(QPOs), the ratio of the two frequencies is 3:2. This supports the suggestion
that double peak kHz QPOs are due to a non-linear resonance between two modes
of accretion disk oscillations. For the microquasars with known mass, we
briefly compare the black hole spin estimates based on the orbital resonance
model with the recently reported spin predictions obtained by fitting the
spectral continua. Results of these two approaches are not in good agreement.
We stress that if the spectral fit estimates are accurate and can be taken as
referential (which is still questionable), the disagreement between the
predicted and referential values would represent a rather generic problem for
any relativistic QPO model, as no spin influence would appear in the observed
1/M scaling of the QPO frequencies. The epicyclic frequencies relevant in these
models are often considered to be equal to those of a test particle motion.
However modifications of the frequencies due to the disc pressure or other
non-geodesic effects may play an important role, and the inaccuracy introduced
in the spin estimates by the test particle approximation could be crucial.

likely to play an important role in pre-main sequence evolution at these

momentum. The particular aim of this paper is to announce the detection of a
structured magnetic field in the Herbig Ae star HD 190073, and to discuss
various scenarii for the geometry of the star, its environment and its magnetic
field. We have used the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter at CFHT in 2005 and 2006 to
obtain high-resolution and signal-to-noise circular polarization spectra which
demonstrate unambiguously the presence of a magnetic field in the photosphere
of this star. Nine circular polarization spectra were obtained, each one
showing a clear Zeeman signature. This signature is suggestive of a magnetic
field structured on large scales. The signature, which corresponds to a
longitudinal magnetic field of 74+- 10 G, does not vary detectably on a
one-year timeframe, indicating either an azimuthally symmetric field, a zero
inclination angle between the rotation axis and the line of sight, or a very
long rotation period. The optical spectrum of HD 190073 exhibits a large number
of emission lines. We discuss the formation of these emission lines in the
framework of a model involving a turbulent heated region at the base of the
stellar wind, possibly powered by magnetic accretion. This magnetic detection
brings an important element for our understanding of stellar magnetism at
intermediate masses.

of third dredge-up.
  Using high resolution optical spectra obtained with the UVES spectrograph at
ESO's VLT we search for resonance lines of neutral Tc in the blue spectral
region of our sample stars. These measurements allow us to improve the
procedure of classification of stars with respect to their Tc content by using
flux ratios. Synthetic spectra based on MARCS atmospheric models are presented
and compared to the observed spectra around three lines of Tc. Bolometric
magnitudes are calculated based on near infrared photometry of the objects.
  Among the sample of 27 long period bulge variables four were found to
definitely contain Tc in their atmospheres.
  The luminosity of the Tc rich stars is in agreement with predictions from AGB
evolutionary models on the minimum luminosity at the time when third dredge-up
sets in. However, AGB evolutionary models and a bulge consisting of a single
old population cannot be brought into agreement. This probably means that a
younger population is present in the bulge, as suggested by various authors,
which contains the Tc-rich stars here identified.

Aims include: 1) to constrain the jet/ambient interaction regimes leading to

a shock forming at the interaction front between a continuous supersonic jet
and the surrounding medium; 2) to derive detailed predictions to be compared

modeling supersonic jets ramming a uniform ambient medium. The model takes into
account the most relevant physical effects, namely the thermal conduction and
the radiative losses. Our model explains the observed X-ray emission from

the presence of disks on spatial scales of order stellar radii. It is therefore
extremely useful in studying disks around young stars, while the method has
prospects for quantitative modelling. In this review we will discuss the status
on the study of (accretion) disks around intermediate- to high mass pre-main

dwarf galaxy population, based on a wide field imaging study of the central
cluster area in V and I. We used the instrument/telescope combination
IMACS/Magellan at Las Campanas Observatory, providing much larger light
collecting area and better image resolution than previous surveys.
  METHODS: We create a fiducial sample of Fornax cluster dwarf ellipticals
(dEs) in the following three steps: (1) To verify cluster membership, we
measured I-band surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) distances to candidate
dEs; (2) We re-assessed morphological classifications for candidate dEs too
faint for SBF detection; and (3) We searched for new candidate dEs in the
size-luminosity regime close to the resolution limit of previous surveys.
  RESULTS: (1) We confirm cluster membership for 28 candidate dEs in the range
-16.6<M_V<-10.1 mag by means of SBF distances. We find no SBF background
galaxy. (2) Of 51 further candidate dEs in the range -13.2<M_V<-8.6 mag, 2/3
are confirmed as probable cluster members by morphological re-assessment, while
1/3 are re-classified as probable background objects. (3) We find 12 new dE
candidates in the range -12.3<M_V<-8.8 mag.
  The surface brightness-magnitude relation defined by the resulting fiducial
dE sample shows that Fornax dEs are about 40% larger than Local Group dEs. The
Fornax dE sample furthermore defines a colour-magnitude relation that appears
slightly shallower than that of Local Group dEs. The early-type dwarf galaxy
luminosity function in Fornax has a faint end slope alpha = -1.1 +/- 0.1.
  We discuss these findings in the context of structure formation theories.

huge amount of energy released by SNe explosions, in our model the galaxy is
able to retain most of the gas allowing a long period ($> 3$ Gyr) of star
formation, consistent with the star formation history derived by observations.
The stellar [Fe/H] distribution found in our model matches very well the

different mixing of the metals produced by the two types of supernovae. We

influence of a low Schmidt number of a typical DPD fluid on the simulated

can lead to underdevelopment of the hydrodynamic interaction in polymer
solutions. Our analyses reveal that equilibrium polymer dynamics in dilute
solution, under a typical DPD simulation conditions, obey the Zimm model very
well. With a further reduction in the Schmidt number, a deviation from the Zimm
model to the Rouse model is observed. This implies that the hydrodynamic
interaction between monomers is reasonably developed under typical conditions
of a DPD simulation. Only when the Schmidt number is further reduced, the
hydrodynamic interaction within the chains becomes underdeveloped. The
screening of the hydrodynamic interaction and the excluded volume interaction
as the polymer volume fraction is increased are well reproduced by the DPD
simulations. The use of soft interaction between polymer beads and a low

high concentrations, except that the entanglement effect which is not captured

decoherence. We also observe the coherent band bottom at the zone center, whose

obtained, and is qualitatively consistent with the framework of Gutzwiller

features of a particular network from {\it a priori} expected features, are
random ensembles with the degree sequence fixed by the specific network of
interest. These ""fixed degree sequence"" (FDS) ensembles are, however, famously
resistant to analytic attack. In this paper we introduce ensembles with
partially-fixed degree sequences (PFDS) and compare analytic results obtained
for them with Monte Carlo results for the FDS ensemble. These results include
link likelihoods, subgraph likelihoods, and degree correlations. We find that
local structural features in the FDS ensemble can be reasonably well estimated
by simultaneously fixing only the degrees of few nodes, in addition to the
total number of nodes and links. As test cases we use a food web, two protein
interaction networks (\textit{E. coli, S. cerevisiae}), the internet on the
autonomous system (AS) level, and the World Wide Web. Fixing just the degrees
of two nodes gives the mean neighbor degree as a function of node degree,
$<k'>_k$, in agreement with results explicitly obtained from rewiring. For
power law degree distributions, we derive the disassortativity analytically. In
the PFDS ensemble the partition function can be expanded diagrammatically. We
obtain an explicit expression for the link likelihood to lowest order, which
reduces in the limit of large, sparse undirected networks with $L$ links and
with $k_{\rm max} \ll L$ to the simple formula $P(k,k') = kk'/(2L + kk')$. In a
similar limit, the probability for three nodes to be linked into a triangle
reduces to the factorized expression $P_{\Delta}(k_1,k_2,k_3) =

two-point probability distribution functions $P_\Gamma (l_\Gamma)$ and
$P_{\Gamma_1, \Gamma_2}(l_{\Gamma_1},l_{\Gamma_2})$, $l_\Gamma$ being the
interface position above a fixed point $\Gamma$ of the substrate, are derived
for temperature corresponding to the inhomogeneity's wetting transition. It is
demonstrated that in the limit of macroscopic inhomogeneity's size the net
effect of the remaining homogeneous parts of the substrate on the interfacial
morphology above the inhomogeneity is exactly equivalent to appropriate pinning
of the interface at its boundaries. The structure of the average interfacial
morphology and correlation function in this limit are discussed and compared to
earlier results obtained for systems with homogeneous substrate.

typically of the order of 1 V and even less. We discuss several applications of
the effect relevant to the field of microfluidics, focusing on the creation of
a nanometer-scale lubrication layer in the phase-separation process.

point of the construction. The dynamics is constructed as a continuum limit of
effective theories characterized by a scale, and requires a renormalization of

are studied. By taking reasonable intrinsic charm component into account, the
change of the theoretical prediction on the production of $\Xi_{cc}$ for LHC

The reason is that the collision energy at LHC and Tevatron is so large that
the gluon-gluon fusion sub-process, which is irrelevant to intrinsic charm,
becomes dominant. But the situation for SELEX is quite different. Our numerical
results for SELEX show that by considering all the contributions from various
sub-processes, the predicted cross-section may be enhanced by a factor so big
as $10^2$ due to a modulating intrinsic charm being taken into account.
Therefore, the hadronic production of $\Xi_{cc}$ at SELEX may be sensitive
enough in observing the intrinsic charm inside the incident hadrons.

theory in 4+2 dimensions which correctly reproduces the Standard Model (SM) in
3+1 dimensions (and no junk). Everything that is known to work in the SM still
works in the emergent 3+1 theory, but some of the problems of the SM get
resolved. The resolution is due to new restrictions on interactions inherited
from 4+2 dimensions that lead to some interesting physics and new points of
view not discussed before in 3+1 dimensions. In particular the strong CP
violation problem is resolved without an axion, and the electro-weak symmetry
breakdown that generates masses requires the participation of the dilaton, thus
relating the electro-weak phase transition to other phase transitions (such as
evolution of the universe, vacuum selection in string theory, etc.) that also
require the participation of the dilaton. The underlying principle of
2T-physics is the local symmetry Sp(2,R) under which position and momentum
become indistinguishable at any instant. This principle inevitably leads to
deep consequences, one of which is the two-time structure of spacetime in which
ordinary 1-time spacetime is embedded. The proposed action for the Standard
Model in 4+2 dimensions follows from new gauge symmetries in field theory
related to the fundamental principles of Sp(2,R). These gauge symmetries thin
out the degrees of freedom from 4+2 to 3+1 dimensions without any Kaluza-Klein
modes.

We further find that this linear field solutions are highly degenerate, and
their cosmological evolutions are actually equivalent to the divergent model
where its sound speed diverges. We also study the stability of the linear field

may be considered as a unified model of dark matter and dark energy. Finally we
study the case when the baryotropic index $\gamma$ is constant. It shows that,
unlike the K-essence, the detailed form of F(X) depends on the potential

matrix $X$ with columns that form an orthonormal basis for a subspace $\X$, and
a Hermitian matrix $A$, the eigenvalues of $X^HAX$ are called Ritz values of
$A$ with respect to $\X$. If the subspace $\X$ is $A$-invariant then the Ritz
values are some of the eigenvalues of $A$. If the $A$-invariant subspace $\X$
is perturbed to give rise to another subspace $\Y$, then the vector of absolute
values of changes in Ritz values of $A$ represents the absolute eigenvalue
approximation error using $\Y$. We bound the error in terms of principal angles
between $\X$ and $\Y$. We capitalize on ideas from a recent paper [DOI:
10.1137/060649070] by A. Knyazev and M. Argentati, where the vector of absolute
values of differences between Ritz values for subspaces $\X$ and $\Y$ was
weakly (sub-)majorized by a constant times the sine of the vector of principal
angles between $\X$ and $\Y$, the constant being the spread of the spectrum of
$A$. In that result no assumption was made on either subspace being
$A$-invariant. It was conjectured there that if one of the trial subspaces is
$A$-invariant then an analogous weak majorization bound should only involve
terms of the order of sine squared. Here we confirm this conjecture.
Specifically we prove that the absolute eigenvalue error is weakly majorized by
a constant times the sine squared of the vector of principal angles between the
subspaces $\X$ and $\Y$, where the constant is proportional to the spread of
the spectrum of $A$. For many practical cases we show that the proportionality
factor is simply one, and that this bound is sharp. For the general case we can

Euler's two zeta-function series for $\gamma$ to polylogarithm series for
$\gamma(z)$. Integrals for $\gamma(z)$ provide its analytic continuation to
$\C-[1,\infty)$. We prove several other formulas for $\gamma(z)$, including two
functional equations; one is an inversion relation between $\gamma(z)$ and
$\gamma(1/z)$. We generalize Somos's quadratic recurrence constant and sequence
to cubic and other degrees, give asymptotic estimates, and show relations to
$\gamma(z)$ and to an infinite nested radical due to Ramanujan. We calculate
$\gamma(z)$ and $\gamma'(z)$ at roots of unity; in particular, $\gamma'(-1)$
involves the Glaisher-Kinkelin constant $A$. Several related series, infinite
products, and double integrals are evaluated. The methods used involve the

maps, defined in terms of certain specified idempotents called the restriction
idempotents. All categories of partial maps are restriction categories;
conversely, a restriction category is a category of partial maps if and only if
the restriction idempotents split. Restriction categories facilitate reasoning
about partial maps as they have a purely algebraic formulation.
  In this paper we consider colimits and limits in restriction categories. As
the notion of restriction category is not self-dual, we should not expect
colimits and limits in restriction categories to behave in the same manner. The
notion of colimit in the restriction context is quite straightforward, but
limits are more delicate. The suitable notion of limit turns out to be a kind
of lax limit, satisfying certain extra properties.
  Of particular interest is the behaviour of the coproduct both by itself and
with respect to partial products. We explore various conditions under which the
coproducts are ``extensive'' in the sense that the total category (of the
related partial map category) becomes an extensive category. When partial
limits are present, they become ordinary limits in the total category. Thus,
when the coproducts are extensive we obtain as the total category a lextensive
category. This provides, in particular, a description of the extensive
completion of a distributive category.

complex adaptive combat model and conventional combat models. The work shows
that complex adaptive models may give rise to ""turbulent"" dynamics, which
emerge once the battlefield is no longer ""linear"", i.e. once military
formations no longer form ordered lines or columns. This is done using a
cellular automaton model. This model exhibits a high degree of complexity,
leading to a rich variety of behaviour. Conventional statistical methods fail
to adequately capture this richness. Particular attention is paid to the
properties of the attrition function. It is found that this function is
discontinuous and possesses non-linear properties such as clustering of
casualties, scaling of the statistical moments of the data and fat-tailed
probability distributions. Fractal methods are found to be capable of
quantifying these properties. A particularly significant result is the
non-linearity of the pay-off of improved weapons performance. This contrasts
with conventional models, where the attrition rate usually depends in a linear
way on kill probability. Additionally, the model is found to possess at least
two attractive states. A transition exists between the two cases in some
situations. This transition appears to behave in an analogous way to the
transition between laminar and turbulent states in fluid dynamics.

involved in a battle, and incorporates this by use of the concept of the
fractal dimension. In this report, the form of the expected Loss-Exchange-Ratio
function based on this equation is determined. It is shown how this function
can be used as a Metamodel to describe the outcome of some cellular automaton
models. While this is not an exhaustive proof of the validity of the equation,
the match for the case studied is convincing, pointing to the potential of the
equation to be adopted more generally for combat models. This is particularly
so in the context of earlier work studying historical battle data that also
supports an equation of the form of the author's proposal.

forcing, all forcings, observations, unforced variability among model ensemble

observations and simulations with all forcings are due to model deficiencies,
inaccurate or incomplete forcings, and imperfect observations. Although there
are notable discrepancies between model and observations, the fidelity is
sufficient to encourage use of the model for simulations of future climate
change. By using a fixed well-documented model and accurately defining the

Northern Hemisphere and too little in the Southern Hemisphere. The greatest
uncertainties in the forcings are the temporal and spatial variations of

these phenomena by propagating solitons that depend on the presence of
cooperative phase transitions in the nerve membrane. These transitions are,
however, strongly influenced by the presence of anesthetics. Therefore, the

capture this phenomenon of self-organization, which shapes the structure of the

define the occurrence and co-occurrence networks of consonants and
systematically study some of their important topological properties. A crucial
observation is that the occurrence as well as the co-occurrence of consonants
across languages follow a power law distribution. This property is arguably a
consequence of the principle of preferential attachment. In order to support
this argument we propose a synthesis model which reproduces the degree
distribution for the networks to a close approximation. We further observe that
the co-occurrence network of consonants show a high degree of clustering and
subsequently refine our synthesis model in order to incorporate this property.
Finally, we discuss how preferential attachment manifests itself through the
evolutionary nature of language.

for the robust topologies. Our results suggest that the requirement of
functional robustness drastically reduces the choices of viable topology to a
limited set of modular combinations among which nature optimizes its choice
under evolutionary and other biological constraints.

transitions due to a breakdown of the adiabatic approximation. Several papers
have studied this process for atoms with spin $F = 1/2$ or $F= 1$. The present
paper calculates the escape rate for atoms with spin $F > 1$. This problem has
new features because the perturbation $\Delta T$ which allows atoms to escape
satisfies a selection rule $\Delta F_z = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2$ and multi-step
processes contribute in leading order. When the adiabatic approximation is
satisfied the leading order terms can be summed to yield a simple expression

telecloning with a quantum gate array. We analyze the efficiency of this
processor by evaluating the fidelities between the desired operation and the
one generated by the processor and show that the two output states are the same
as the ones produced by the optimal universal asymmetric Pauli cloning machine.
The schemes require only local operations and classical communication, they
have the advantage of transmitting the two output states directly to two
spatially separated receivers but they have a success probability of 1/2. We
show further that we can perform the same one-qubit operation with unity
probability at the cost of using nonlocal operations. We finally generalize the
two schemes for D-level systems and find that the local ones are successful
with a probability of 1/D and the nonlocal generalized scheme is always
successful.
