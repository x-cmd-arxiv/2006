Broadband polarization was obtained in the Bessel BVRI filters;
spectropolarimetry was obtained with various grisms covering different optical
ranges and with a typical resolution of a few hundreds. Spectropolarimetric
data have been convolved with the transmission functions of the Bessel filters,
which enabled us to calculate polarization values equivalent to broadband
polarization measurements in imaging mode. Finally, for each star, instrument
mode, and for each Bessel filter band, we have calculated an average
polarization value obtained after filtering all available data with a k-sigma

constitute a substantial proportion in the extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars of
the Galactic Halo, by far larger than CH stars in Population II stars. We
investigate their origin with taking into account an additional evolutionary
path to the surface carbon-enrichment, triggered by hydrogen engulfment by the
helium flash convection, in EMP stars of $[Fe/H] \lesssim -2.5$. This process
is distinct from the third dredge-up operating in more metal-rich stars and
also in EMP stars. In binary systems of EMP stars, the secondary stars become
CEMP stars through mass transfer from the primary stars of low and intermediate
masses, which have developed the surface carbon-enhancement. Our binary
scenario can predict the variations in the abundances not only for carbon but
also for nitrogen and s-process elements and reasonably explain the observed
properties such as the stellar distributions with respect to the carbon
abundances, the binary periods, and the evolutionary stages. Furthermore, from
the observed frequencies of CEMP stars with and without s-process element
enhancement, we demonstrate that the initial mass function of EMP stars need to
give the mean mass $~10\msun$ under the reasonable assumptions on the
distributions of orbital separations and mass ratio of binary components. This
also indicates that the currently observed EMP stars were exclusively born as
the secondary members of binaries, making up $\sim 10%$ remnants of EMP binary
systems of mass $~10^8\msun$ in total; in addition to CEMP stars with white
dwarf companions, a significant fraction of them have experienced supernova
explosions of their companions. We discuss the implications of the present

transitions from the literature, and using a molecular excitation code and a
Voronoi optimisation algorithm. We test the model against existing millimeter
interferometric observations, near-infrared scattered light imaging, and 12CO

stellar mass of 1.3M$_\odot$ surrounded by a 0.10M$_\odot$ flattened envelope
with approximate scale height h\approx 0.57 R, inclined at 74^\circ. The
velocity field is strongly dominated by rotation, with the velocity vector
making an angle of 15^\circ with the azimuthal direction. Reproducing
low-excitation transitions requires that the emission and absorption by the
starless core 1' (8400 AU) east of L1489 IRS is included properly, implying
that L1489 IRS is located partially behind this core. We speculate that L1489
IRS was originally formed closer to the center of this core, but has migrated
to its current position over the past few times 10^5 yr, consistent with their
radial velocity difference of 0.4 kms-1. This suggests that L1489 IRS' unusual
appearance may be result of its migration, and that it would appear as a
`normal' embedded protostar if it were still surrounded by an extended cloud

dark matter haloes is investigated, while focussing on the dynamical flows
through their virial sphere. Our method relies on both cosmological
simulations, to constrain the environments, and an extension to the classical
matrix method to derive the response of the halo (see Pichon & Aubert (2006),
paper I).
  The current paper focuses on the statistical characterisation of the
environments surrounding haloes, using a set of large scale simulations. Our
description relies on a `fluid' halocentric representation where the
interactions between the halo and its environment are investigated in terms of
a time dependent external tidal field and a source term characterizing the
infall. The method is applied to 15000 haloes, with masses between 5 x 10^12 Ms
and 10^14 Ms evolving between z = 1 and z = 0.
  The net accretion at the virial radius is found to decrease with time,
resulting from both an absolute decrease of infall and from a growing
contribution of outflows. Infall is found to be mainly radial and occurring at
velocities ~ 0.75 V200. Outflows are also detected through the virial sphere
and occur at lower velocities ~ 0.6 V200 on more circular orbits. The external
tidal field is found to be strongly quadrupolar and mostly stationnary,
possibly reflecting the distribution of matter in the halo's near environment.
The coherence time of the small scale fluctuations of the potential hints a
possible anisotropic distribution of accreted satellites. The flux density of
mass on the virial sphere appears to be more clustered than the potential while
the shape of its angular power spectrum seems stationnary.

stellar structures. They often reveal a continuation of this hierarchy inside
of them, to smaller scales, when they are young, but orbital mixing eventually
erases these subparts and a only smooth cluster or smooth unbound group
remains. The stellar hierarchy follows a similar structure in the interstellar
gas, which is presumably scale-free because of supersonic motions in the
presence of turbulence and self-gravity. The efficiency of star formation
increases automatically with density in a hierarchical ISM, causing most dense
stellar groups to be initially bound for local conditions. In lower pressure
environments, the infant mortality rates should be higher. Also following from
hierarchical structure is the cluster mass distribution function and perhaps
also the cluster size distribution function, although the predicted mass-size
relation is not observed. Cluster destruction is from a variety of causes. The
destruction time should depend on cluster mass, but the various groups who have

of the odd-frequency spin-triplet superconductivity on the local density of
states (LDOS) in a diffusive ferromagnet (DF) attached to a superconductor.
Various possible symmetry classes in a superconductor are considered which are
consistent with the Pauli's principle: even-frequency spin-singlet even-parity
(ESE) state, even-frequency spin-triplet odd-parity (ETO) state, odd-frequency
spin-triplet even-parity (OTE) state and odd-frequency spin-singlet odd-parity
(OSO) state. For each of these states, the pairing state in DF is studied.
Particular attention is paid to the study of spin-singlet s-wave and
spin-triplet p-wave superconductors as the examples of ESE and ETO
superconductors. For spin-singlet case the magnitude of the OTE component of
the pair amplitude is enhanced with the increase of the exchange field in DF.
When the OTE component is dominant at low energy, the resulting LDOS in DF has
a zero energy peak (ZEP). On the other hand, in DF / spin-triplet p-wave
superconductor junctions LDOS has a ZEP in the absence of the exchange field,
where only the OTE paring state exists. With the increase of the exchange
field, the ESE component of the pair amplitude induced in DF is enhanced. Then,
the resulting LDOS has a ZEP splitting. We demonstrate that the appearance of
the dominant OTE component of the pair amplitude is the physical reason of the
emergence of the ZEP of LDOS.

many-body spectrum, striking a delicate balance between the degree of symmetry
breaking, the effects of the condensate's mean field, and that of atomic
correlation. It is found that, in general, the superposition state lies
energetically below its related self-trapped counterpart. Furthermore,
noticeably different spatial density profiles are associated with each type of

Gardiner, Phys. Rev. A 56, 1414 (1997)], and Castin and Dum [Y. Castin and R.
Dum, Phys. Rev. A 57, 3008 (1998)]. We consider what is effectively an
expansion in powers of the ratio of non-condensate to condensate particle
numbers, rather than inverse powers of the total number of particles. This
requires the number of condensate particles to be a majority, but not
necessarily almost equal to the total number of particles in the system. We
argue that a second-order treatment of the relevant dynamical equations of
motion is the minimum order necessary to provide consistent coupled condensate
and non-condensate number dynamics for a finite total number of particles, and
show that such a second-order treatment is provided by a suitably generalized
Gross-Pitaevskii equation, coupled to the Castin-Dum number-conserving
formulation of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. The necessary equations of
motion can be generated from an approximate third-order Hamiltonian, which
effectively reduces to second order in the steady state. Such a treatment as
described here is suitable for dynamics occurring at finite temperature, where
there is a significant non-condensate fraction from the outset, or dynamics
leading to dynamical instabilities, where depletion of the condensate can also
lead to a significant non-condensate fraction, even if the non-condensate
fraction is initially negligible.

the last two decades [1]. Among other problems, these phase transitions are
relevant in the study of heavy fermion systems, high temperature
superconductors and Bose-Einstein condensates. More recently there is
increasing evidence that in many systems which are close to a quantum critical
point (QCP) different phases are in competition. In this paper we show that the
main effect of this competition is to give rise to inhomogeneous behavior
associated with quantum first order transitions. These effects are described
theoretically using an action that takes into account the competition between
different order parameters. The method of the effective potential is used to
calculate the quantum corrections to the classical functional. These
corrections generally change the nature of the QCP and give rise to interesting
effects even in the presence of non-critical fluctuations. An unexpected result
is the appearance of an inhomogeneous phase with two values of the order
parameter separated by a first order transition. Finally, we discuss the
universal behavior of systems with a weak first order zero temperature
transition in particular as the transition point is approached from finite
temperatures. The thermodynamic behavior along this line is obtained and shown
to present universal features.

percolation theory, $P_{\infty}$, the fraction of nodes in the largest cluster

methods from percolation, we study Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) and scale-free (SF)

are: random removal, high degree removal and high betweenness centrality
removal. We find that for a network obtained after removal (all strategies) of
a fraction $q$ of nodes above percolation threshold, $P_{\infty}\approx
(1-F)^{1/2}$. For fixed $P_{\infty}$ and close to percolation threshold
($q=q_c$), we show that $1-F$ better reflects the actual fragmentation. Close

thus possible to improve the fragmentation of the network. We also study and

$T_K(g)$ over the complete parameter range and obtain a non-monotonous $T_K(g)$

areas in recent years due to its applicability to the wide scale of
disciplines. To detect communities in varied topics, there have been many
algorithms proposed so far. However, most of them still have some drawbacks to
be addressed. In this paper, we present an agent-based based community
detection algorithm. The algorithm that is a stochastic one makes use of agents
by forcing them to perform biased moves in a smart way. Using the information
collected by the traverses of these agents in the network, the network
structure is revealed. Also, the network modularity is used for determining the
number of communities. Our algorithm removes the need for prior knowledge about
the network such as number of the communities or any threshold values.
Furthermore, the definite community structure is provided as a result instead
of giving some structures requiring further processes. Besides, the
computational and time costs are optimized because of using thread like working
agents. The algorithm is tested on three network data of different types and
sizes named Zachary karate club, college football and political books. For all
three networks, the real network structures are identified in almost every run.

hadron chiral perturbation theory (HHChPT) in which heavy quark symmetry and
chiral symmetry are synthesized. HHChPT works excellently for describing the
strong decays of s-wave charmed baryons. For L=1 orbitally excited states, two
of the unknown couplings, namely, $h_2$ and $h_{10}$, are determined from the
resonant $\Lambda_c^+\pi\pi$ mode produced in the $\Lambda_c(2593)$ decay and
the width of $\Sigma_c(2800)$, respectively. Predictions for the strong decays
of the p-wave charmed baryon states $\Lambda_c(2625)$, $\Xi_c(2790)$ and
$\Xi_c(2815)$ are presented. Since the decay
$\Lambda_c(2593)^+\to\Lambda_c^+\pi\pi$ receives non-resonant contributions,
our value for $h_2$ is smaller than the previous estimates. We also discuss the
first positive-parity excited charmed baryons. We conjecture that the charmed
baryon $\Lambda_c(2880)$ with $J^P=\frac52^+$ is an admixture of
$\Lambda_{c2}(\frac52^+)$ with and $\tilde\Lambda''_{c3}(\frac52^+)$; both are
L=2 orbitally excited states. The potential model suggests $J^P=\frac52^-$ or
$\frac32^+$ for $\Lambda_c(2940)^+$. Measurements of the ratio of
$\Sigma_c^*\pi/\Sigma_c\pi$ will enable us to discriminate the $J^P$

of $\Xi_c(2980)$ and $\Xi_c(3077)$ are $\frac12^+$ and $\frac52^+$,

function of the spectral mass. Due to this feature the valence quarks never
become unbound nor dive into the negative spectrum, hence providing stable
solitons as absolute minima of the action. This is a manifestation of the

  Structures of the Universe"", La Thuile, Italy, March 18-25, 2006",,,,"hep-ph",,"  In this talk, I shall focus on theories beyond the Standard Model which
predict massive neutrinos. Hybrid inflation emerges naturally in these
theories: the slow-rolling inflaton field is a gauge singlet which couples with
a GUT Higgs field which triggers the end of inflation. In the standard
scenario, spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place at the end of inflation at
a scale $M$; $M_{GUT} > M > M_Z$ for inflation to solve the GUT monopole
problem and cosmic strings always form at this intermediate scale. WMAP data
constrain $M \in [10^{14.5}-10^{15.5}]$ GeV and the singlet-Higgs coupling
$\kappa \in [10^{-7} - 10^{-2}]$. The spectral index $n_s \gtrsim 0.98$ in
slight conflict with WMAP3. When the symmetry which is broken at the end of
inflation is gauged $B-L$, both the inflaton and the strings decay into
right-handed neutrinos. There are then two competing non-thermal scenarios for
baryogenesis via leptogenesis which take place at the end of inflation, during
reheating and from cosmic strings decay. Which of the two scenarios dominates
depends on the inflaton-neutrino sector parameters.

for the gauge couplings as for GUT theories, it predicts the Higgs scattering
parameter and the sum of the squares of Yukawa couplings. From these relations
one can extract predictions at low energy, giving in particular a Higgs mass
around 170 GeV and a top mass compatible with present experimental value. The
geometric picture that emerges is that space-time is the product of an ordinary
spin manifold (for which the theory would deliver Einstein gravity) by a finite
noncommutative geometry F. The discrete space F is of KO-dimension 6 modulo 8

Fix a

equivalent if D(X) and D(Y) are equivalent as triangulated categories.
  We give explicit combinatorial properties of a poset which are invariant
under derived equivalence, among them are the number of points, the
Z-congruency class of the incidence matrix, and the Betti numbers.
  Then we construct, for any closed subset Y of X, a strongly exceptional
collection in D(X) and use it to show an equivalence between D(X) and the
bounded derived category of a finite dimensional algebra A (depending on Y). We
give conditions on X and Y under which A becomes an incidence algebra of a
poset.
  We deduce that a lexicographic sum of a collection of posets along a
bipartite graph is derived equivalent to the lexicographic sum of the same
collection along the opposite graph. This construction produces many new
derived equivalences of posets and generalizes other well known ones.
  As a corollary we show that the derived equivalence class of an ordinal sum

the rise and fall of fragment production and deduced observables as, e.g., the
breakup temperature obtained from double ratios of isotope yields. The mass
distributions depend strongly on the neutron-to-proton ratio of the decaying
system, as expected for a simultaneous statistical breakup. The ratios of
light-isotope yields from neutron-rich and neutron-poor systems follow the law
of isoscaling. The deduced scaling parameters decrease strongly with increasing
centrality to values smaller than 50% of those obtained for the peripheral

computer and sensory substitution via the tongue in order to compensate for the
sensory loss in the buttock area for individuals with paraplegia. This sensory
compensation will enable individuals with spinal cord injuries to be aware of a
localized excess of pressure at the skin/seat interface and, consequently, will
enable them to prevent the formation of pressure ulcers by relieving the
cutaneous area of suffering. This work reports an initial evaluation of this
approach and the feasibility of creating an adapted behavior, with a change in
pressure as a response to electro-stimulated information on the tongue.
Obtained during a clinical study in 10 healthy seated subjects, the first
results are encouraging, with 92% success in 100 performed tests. These
results, which have to be completed and validated in the paraplegic population,

effects of diffraction in the near field. The contributions of homogeneous and
of evanescent waves to two-dimensional near-field diffraction patterns of
scalar fields are examined in detail. Exact relations are obtained for
calculating these contributions for arbitrary propagation distances, along with
approximate expressions for the near field. The behavior of the two
contributions is illustrated for the case of a plane wave diffracted by a slit
in an opaque screen. The finite-difference time-domain (FD-TD) method is used
examine the influence of exact boundary values on the near field for the case
of a slit in a thin perfectly conducting screen. The FD-TD numerical results
are displayed in color images that illustrate the intricate behavior of the
amplitude and the phase of the field in the vicinity of the slit. These
numerical results are compared with the predictions of approximate theories.
Some new methods for determining near-fields in rigorous diffraction problems
involving thin screens are discussed. Specifically, new approximate theories of
diffraction are introduced for both scalar and electromagnetic fields and an
iterative Fourier-based algorithm is proposed for solving the rigorous boundary
value problem. In order to understand the effects of an optical vortex on
diffraction, the field emerging from a spiral phase plate illuminated by a
Gaussian beam is examined. It is shown that the amplitude profile of the
emerging field changes appreciably over propagation distances that are much
smaller than the Rayleigh range.

wave approximation are considered. Diagonalization of the Hamiltonian is
performed exactly, leading to useful spectral decompositions of a series of
relevant operators. The latter include ladder operators acting between adjacent
energy eigenstates within two separate infinite discrete towers, except for a
singleton state. These ladder operators allow for the construction of
(p,q)-deformed vector coherent states. Using (p,q)-arithmetics, explicit and
exact solutions to the associated moment problem are displayed, providing new
classes of coherent states for such models. Finally, in the limit of decoupled
spin sectors, our analysis translates into (p,q)-deformations of the
supersymmetric harmonic oscillator, such that the two supersymmetric sectors
get intertwined through the action of the ladder operators as well as in the
associated coherent states.

method is applicable to a wide class of quantum error-correcting codes known as

concept of time delay for a class of one-dimensional anisotropic quantum
systems. These systems are described by a Schr\""{o}dinger Hamiltonian $H =
-\Delta + V$ with a potential $V(x)$ converging to different limits $V_{\ell}$
and $V_{r}$ as $x \to -\infty$ and $x \to +\infty$ respectively. Due to the
anisotropy they exhibit a two-channel structure. We first establish the
existence and properties of the channel wave and scattering operators by using
the modern Mourre approach. We then use scattering theory to show the identity
of two apparently different representations of time delay. The first one is
defined in terms of sojourn times while the second one is given by the
Eisenbud-Wigner operator. The identity of these representations is well known
for systems where $V(x)$ vanishes as $|x| \to \infty$ ($V_\ell = V_r$). We show
that it remains true in the anisotropic case $V_\ell \not = V_r$, i.e. we prove
the existence of the time-dependent representation of time delay and its
equality with the time-independent Eisenbud-Wigner representation. Finally we
use this identity to give a time-dependent interpretation of the
Eisenbud-Wigner expression which is commonly used for time delay in the
literature.

have a unique measure in terms of the von Neumann entropy of the reduced states
of either of its subsystems. The measure is established under entanglement
manipulation of an asymptotically large number of copies of the states. In this
paper, different asymptotic measures of entanglement assigned to arbitrary
sequences of bipartite pure states are shown to coincide only when the sequence
is information stable, in terms of the quantum spectral information rates of
the sequence of subsystem states. Additional bounds on the optimal rates of
entanglement manipulation protocols in quantum information are also presented,
including bounds given by generalizations of the coherent information and the
relative entropy of entanglement.

decoding is to produce from any quantumly corrupted codeword a short list
containing all messages whose codewords exhibit high ""presence"" in the
quantumly corrupted codeword. Efficient quantum list decoders have been used to
prove a quantum hardcore property of classical codes. However, the code rates
of all known families of efficiently quantum list-decodable codes are,
unfortunately, too small for other practical applications. To improve those
known code rates, we prove that a specific code family of polynomially small
code rate over a fixed code alphabet, obtained by concatenating generalized
Reed-Solomon codes as outer codes with Hadamard codes as inner codes, has an
efficient quantum list-decoding algorithm if its codewords have relatively high
codeword presence in a given quantumly corrupted codeword. As an immediate
application, we use the quantum list decodability of this code family to solve
a certain form of quantum search problems in polynomial time. When the codeword
presence becomes smaller, in contrast, we show that the quantum list
decodability of generalized Reed-Solomon codes with high confidence is closely
related to the efficient solvability of the following two problems: the noisy
polynomial interpolation problem and the bounded distance vector problem.
Moreover, assuming that NP is not included in BQP, we also prove that no
efficient quantum list decoder exists for the generalized Reed-Solomon codes.
