30 galaxies at moderate redshift (z \sim 0.2-0.6) to explore galaxy evolution
and in particular the star formation efficiency, in the redshift range filling
the gap between local and very high-z objects. The CO emission is kinematically
resolved, and about 50% of the total emission found in the 27 arcsec (97 kpc)

some extended emission may be present on large scales (typically 7-15 arcsec).

present measurements in two flares of the energies of the de-excitation lines
of 12C and 16O at 4.4 and 6.1 MeV respectively by the Ge spectrometer SPI on
board INTEGRAL, from which Doppler shifts are derived and compared with those
expected from the recoil of 12C and 16O nuclei which were excited by the
impacts of flare-accelerated ions. An anomalous Doppler measurement (in terms
of recoil theory) has been reported by the Ge spectrometer RHESSI in a flare
near the east limb, and explained by a tilt of the magnetic field lines at the
footpoint of a magnetic loop away from the vertical, and towards the observer.
This might be interpreted to imply a significant difference between the Doppler
shifts on the east and west limbs, if it is a general phenomenon. SPI observed
both east and west limb flares and found no significant difference in Doppler
shifts. We also measured the shapes and fluences of these lines, and their
fluence ratio to the 2.2 MeV line from the capture of flare-generated neutrons.
Analyses of both quantities using thick-target models parametrized by solar
physical and geometric quantities suggest that the two flares studied here also
have magnetic fields tilted towards the observer, though the significance of
the measurements is not high.

directly correlate observed clustering in the data as seen in IRAC color-color

color-color space. We also find that this clustering is positively correlated
with the stars dominating in their contribution to the total bolometric

infancy in the pre-merger phase to the final stage as an elliptical galaxy, as
seen in the observed $3.6 \micron$ and $450 \micron$ band to visually

orbital inclination and progenitor redshift. We find that SMGs are a broader
class of systems than starbursts or quasars. We introduce a simple, heuristic
classification scheme on the basis of the $L_{\rm IR}/L_{\rm x}$ ratios of
these galaxies, which may be interpreted qualitatively as an evolutionary
scheme, as these galaxies evolve in $L_{\rm IR}/L_{\rm x}$ while transiting

E 76, 051401 (2007)","10.1103/PhysRevE.76.051401",,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  Several statistical mechanical theories predict that colloidal suspensions of
highly charged macroions and monovalent microions can exhibit unusual
thermodynamic phase behavior when strongly deionized. Density-functional,
extended Debye-H\""uckel, and response theories, within mean-field and
linearization approximations, predict a spinodal phase instability of charged
colloids below a critical salt concentration. Poisson-Boltzmann cell model
studies of suspensions in Donnan equilibrium with a salt reservoir demonstrate
that effective interactions and osmotic pressures predicted by such theories
can be sensitive to the choice of reference system, e.g., whether the microion
density profiles are expanded about the average potential of the suspension or
about the reservoir potential. By unifying Poisson-Boltzmann and response
theories within a common perturbative framework, it is shown here that the
choice of reference system is dictated by the constraint of global
electroneutrality. On this basis, bulk suspensions are best modeled by
density-dependent effective interactions derived from a closed reference system
in which the counterions are confined to the same volume as the macroions.
Linearized theories then predict bulk phase separation of deionized suspensions
only when expanded about a physically consistent (closed) reference system.
Lower-dimensional systems (e.g., monolayers, small clusters), depending on the
strength of macroion-counterion correlations, may be governed instead by
density-independent effective interactions tied to an open reference system
with counterions dispersed throughout the reservoir, possibly explaining
observed structural crossover in colloidal monolayers and anomalous
metastability of colloidal crystallites.

We show that the problem can be exactly mapped onto an effective tight-binding

two-magnon Green's functions for arbitrary dimension and number of
interactions. We apply this theory to a quasi-one dimensional helimagnet with
ferromagnetic nearest neighbor J1 < 0 and antiferromagnetic next-nearest
neighbor J2 > 0 interactions. An outstanding feature of the excitation spectrum
is the existence of two-magnon bound states. This leads to deviations of the
saturation field Bs from its classical value Bs(classical) which coincides with
the one-magnon instability. For the refined frustration ratio |J2/J1|> 0.374661
the minimum of the two-magnon spectrum occurs at the boundary of the Brillouin
zone. Based on the two-magnon approach, we propose general analytic expressions

``holographically'' induced in the bulk by the universal BMS-invariant state
lambda at infinity scri of M. It is done by means of the correspondence between
observables in the bulk and those on the boundary at null infinity discussed in
previous papers. The induction is possible when some requirements are
fulfilled, in particular the spacetime M and the associated unphysical one are
globally hyperbolic and M admits future time infinity i^+. lambda_M coincides
with Minkowski vacuum if M is Minkowski spacetime. It is now proved that, in
the general case of a curved spacetime M, the state lambda_M enjoys the
following further properties. (1) lambda_M is invariant under the group of
isometries of the bulk spacetime M. (2) lambda_M fulfills a natural
energy-positivity condition with respect to every notion of Killing time (if
any) in the bulk spacetime M: If M admits a complete time-like Killing vector,
the associated one-parameter group of isometries is represented by a
strongly-continuous unitary group in the GNS representation of lambda_M. The
unitary group has positive self-adjoint generator without zero modes in the

Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theories. There exists a natural scale of length which
is determined by the inverse topological mass. We obtain the non-abelian
solution by means of a SU(2) gauge transformation of Dirac magnetic monopole
type solution. In the abelian case, field strength locally determines the gauge
potential up to a closed term via self-duality equation. We introduce a
transformation of the gauge potential using dual field strength which can be
identified with the gauge transformation in the abelian solution. Then we
present Hopf map from S^3 to S^2 including the topological mass. This leads to
a reduction of the field equation onto S^2 using local sections of S^3. The
local solutions possess a composite structure consisting of both magnetic and
electric charges. These naturally lead to topologically massive Wu-Yang
solution which is based on patching up the local potentials by means of a gauge
transformation. We also discuss solutions with different first Chern numbers.
There exist a fundamental scale over which the gauge function is single-valued
and periodic for any integer in addition to the fact that it has a smaller
period. We also discuss Dirac quantization condition. We present a
stereographic view of the fibres in the Hopf map. Meanwhile Archimedes map
yields a simple geometric picture for the Wu-Yang solution. We also discuss

generation of voids, Avinash et al.[K. Avinash, A. Bhattacharjee, and S. Hu,

incorporating the grain drift and by replacing the ion-drag force by that
derived by Khrapak et al., in a spherical configuration. It has been revealed
that the void formation is a threshold phenomenon, i.e., it depends on the
grain size. Furthermore, the void possesses a sharp boundary beyond which the
dust density goes down and may present a corrugated aspect. For higher values
of the grain size, the use of both ion drag forces leads to voids of a same
dimension, though for grains of small sizes the Avinash force drives voids of a
higher dimension.

transduction focusing on the spindle assembly checkpoint where a single

This inhibitory signal switches off rapidly once spindle microtubules have
attached to all kinetochores. This requirement tightly constrains the possible
mechanisms. Here we investigate two possible mechanisms for spindle checkpoint
operation in metazoan cells, both supported by recent experiments. The first
involves the free diffusion and sequestration of cell-cycle regulators. This
mechanism is severely constrained both by experimental fluorescence recovery
data and also by the large volumes involved in open mitosis in metazoan cells.
Using a simple mathematical analysis and computer simulation, we find that this
mechanism can generate the inhibition found in experiment but likely requires a
two stage signal amplification cascade. The second mechanism involves spatial
gradients of a short-lived inhibitory signal that propagates first by diffusion
but then primarily via active transport along spindle microtubules. We propose
that both mechanisms may be operative in the metazoan spindle assembly
checkpoint, with either able to trigger anaphase onset even without support
from the other pathway.
