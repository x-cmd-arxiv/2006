possible to detect X-ray point sources, either embedded in galaxy clusters or
along the cluster line of sight, which could not be resolved by previous
instruments. This now allows studies of source counts in distant cluster
fields. A sample of 18 distant (0.25 < z < 1.01) galaxy clusters from the
Chandra archive were used to analyze the inner region of clusters of galaxies
to check for the presence of any overdensity of X-ray point sources embedded in
the gas diffuse emission. We constructed the logN-logS, in both the soft and
hard energy bands, for the X-ray point sources detected in the central cluster
region (within 1 Mpc)to be compared with the counts of point sources detected
in similarly deep fields without clusters. We find a ~ 2 sigma excess of
cluster region sources at the bright end of the logN-logS. The radial
distribution of the brightest X-ray point sources confirms this excess and
indicates that it is confined to the inner 0.5 Mpc of the cluster region. The
results suggest the possible existence of X-ray sources belonging to the
cluster (most probably AGN, given their 0.5-10 keV luminosity ranging from
10^43 to 10^44 erg/s): on average one every three clusters. The X-ray source
excess found here is much smaller than the excess of radio galaxies found
recently in high-z X-ray selected clusters, possibly due to the higher
sensitivity of the radio observations.

variable (IDV) quasar 0917+624 was known to be strongly variable with amplitude
variations of 10-20% within 0.8 to 1.6 days. During that period it showed
faster variability in the polarized flux and the polarization angle than in
total intensity. However, since 2000 the IDV of this source has almost ceased,
attaining a variability index of only less than a few percent. If interstellar
scintillation was responsible for the IDV in the past, one possible explanation
for the sudden change of the variability mode could be an intrinsic change in
the morphology of the source, such as an increase in the size of the structural
components that are responsible for the scintillation. New jet components
appearing at the jet base could lead to a temporarily larger size of the
scintillating component when compared to the scattering size of the
interstellar medium, causing quenched scintillation. In order to test this
scenario, VLBI observations of 0917+624 from 1999 to 2005 have been analysed.
Here, we summarize first results and discuss them in the framework of the
quenched scintillation model.

dramatically constrains our knowledge of the dissolution processes of stellar

  We present the first results of a new approach to directly detect and
quantify the characteristics of evolved stellar clusters. Using the exceptional
spatial resolution and sensitivity of HST/ACS images to resolve the stellar
content nearby galaxies, we construct colour-magnitude diagrams for the
observed fields. This enable us to separate the younger population likely
present in young clusters from the older stellar content of the star field
background. We utilize a clustering algorithm to assign each star to a group
based on its local spatial density. This novel approach makes use of algorithms
typically applied in N-body and cosmological studies. We test the method and

lost in the star field background. We also detect B-type stars well spread in
the galaxy disk of NGC 1313, probably the result of infant mortality of stellar

jet at different distances from the central power--house and analyse in detail
how the dissipated energy is radiated away. We assume that the location of the
dissipation region is a function of the bulk Lorentz factor Gamma of the jet,
being closer to the center for smaller Gamma. This assumption is naturally
fulfilled in the internal shock scenario. The dissipated energy is partially
used to accelerate electrons and to amplify the magnetic field. This process
creates a source inside the jet (blob). Such blobs may efficiently produce
synchrotron and inverse Compton emission. We find that even if the blobs or
shells responsible for the blazar activity carry the same energy (in bulk
kinetic form), the fact that they move at different Gamma can produce dramatic
variations in different bands, even if the bolometric luminosity is instead
very similar. This is due to the relative importance of the synchrotron,
self-Compton and external Compton radiation processes, which greatly changes by
changing Gamma and the compactness of the source, even if the total radiated
energy is constant. We then find that the jet can produce most of its radiative
output at small distances from the putative black-hole and its accretion disk,
if this implies a low level of emitted MeV-GeV flux. Our findings, which we
apply for illustrative purposes to the blazar 3C 454.3, will be easily testable
by the coming gamma-ray satellite, such as AGILE and GLAST.

observations of PSR B1931+24 performed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and

B1931+24 translating into an upper limit of ~2x10^{31} erg/s on the X-ray

the quasi-periodic intermittent behavior of PSR B1931+24 is due to the presence
of a low mass companion star or gaseous planet, tight with the pulsar in an

characteristics of the neutron star Z sources (the brightest persistent neutron
star LMXBs). These include Z tracks in X-ray color diagrams and typical
variability components detected in the power spectra. XTE J1701-462 is the
first transient Z source and provides unique insights into mass accretion rate
(Mdot) and luminosity dependencies in neutron star LMXBs. As its overall
luminosity decreased, we observed a switch between two types of Z-source
behavior, with most of the branches of the Z-track changing their shape and/or
orientation. We interpret this switch as an extreme case of the longterm
changes seen in the persistent Z sources and suggest that these result from
changes in Mdot. We also suggest that the Cyg-like Z sources (Cyg X-2, GX 5-1,
and GX 340+0) might be more luminous (> 50%) than the Sco-like Z sources (Sco
X-1, GX 17+2, and GX 349+2). Adopting a possible explanation for the behavior
of kHz QPOs, which involves a prompt as well as a filtered response to changes
in Mdot, we propose that changes in Mdot can explain both movement along the Z
track and changes in the shape of the Z track. We discuss some consequences of
this and consider the possibility that the branches of the Z will evolve into
the branches observed in the X-ray color diagrams of the less luminous atoll
sources, but not in a way that was previously suggested.

using Zeeman tomography. Our study is based on orbital-phase resolved optical
flux and circular polarization spectra of the polars EF Eri, BL Hyi, and CP Tuc
obtained with FORS1 at the ESO VLT. An evolutionary algorithm is used to
synthesize best fits to these spectra from an extensive database of
pre-computed Zeeman spectra. The general approach has been described in
previous papers of this series. The results achieved with simple geometries as
centered or offset dipoles are not satisfactory. Significantly improved fits
are obtained for multipole expansions that are truncated at degree l(max)=3 or
5 and include all tesseral and sectoral components with 0<=m<=l. The most
frequent field strengths of 13, 18, and 10MG for EF Eri, BL Hyi, CP Tuc and the
ranges of field strength covered are similar for the dipole and multipole
models, but only the latter provide access to accreting matter at the right
locations on the WD. The results suggest that the field geometries of the WDs
in short-period mCVs are quite complex with strong contributions from
multipoles higher than the dipole in spite of a typical age of the WDs in CVs
in excess of 1 Gyr. It is feasible to derive the surface field structure of an
accreting WD from phase-resolved low-state circular spectropolarimetry of
sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio. The fact that independent information
is available on the strength and direction of the field in the accretion spot
from high-state observations helps in unraveling the global field structure.

Starting from the merger trees of dark matter halos and a model for the
evolution of substructure within the halos, the complex physics of baryons is
modeled with a set of state-of-the-art models that describe the mass, metal and
energy flows between the various components and phases of a galaxy. The
processes of shock-heating and cooling, star formation, feedback, galactic
winds and super-winds, accretion onto BHs and AGN feedback are described by new
models. In particular, the evolution of the halo gas explicitly follows the
thermal and kinetic energies of the hot and cold phases, while star formation
and feedback follow the results of the multi-phase model by Monaco (2004a). The
increased level of sophistication allows to move from a phenomenological
description of gas physics, based on simple scalings with the depth of the DM
halo potential, toward a fully physically motivated one. The comparison of the
predictions of MORGANA with a basic set of galactic data reveals from the one
hand an overall rough agreement, and from the other hand highlights a number of
well- or less-known problems: (i) producing the cutoff of the luminosity
function requires to force the quenching of the late cooling flows by AGN
feedback, (ii) the normalization of the Tully-Fisher relation of local spirals
cannot be recovered unless the dark matter halos are assumed to have a very low
concentration, (iii) the mass function of HI gas is not easily fitted at small
masses, unless a similarly low concentration is assumed, (iv) there is an
excess of small elliptical galaxies at z=0. These discrepancies, more than the
points of agreement with data, give important clues on the missing ingredients
of galaxy formation. (ABRIDGED)

a function of the dark energy field responsible for the present acceleration of

impact of a constant coupling $\delta$ between dark energy and dark matter on
the determination of a redshift dependent dark energy equation of state

analytical expression for the luminosity distance in this case. In particular,
we show that the presence of such a coupling increases the tension between the
cosmic microwave background data from the analysis of the shift parameter in
models with constant $w_{DE}$ and SNIa data for realistic values of the present
dark matter density fraction. Thus, an independent measurement of the present
dark matter density can place constraints on models with interacting dark

as the column density and linewidth distributions over this range, continual
feedback from star formation-driven winds are able to reproduce the
observations, while an early enrichment scenario where a majority of the metals
are injected into the IGM at z>6 is disfavored. The constancy of the C IV
observations results from a rising IGM metallicity content balanced by a
declining C IV ionization fraction due to a 1) decreasing physical densities,
2) increasing ionization background strength, and 3) metals becoming more
shock-heated at lower redshift. Our models predict that ~20x more metals are
injected into the IGM between z=6->2 than at z>6. We show that the median C IV

\~5x10^{38} ergs/s were studied in detail. The spectral distribution of M31
X-ray sources, based on the spectral fitting with a power law model is clearly
bimodal with a main peak corresponding to a photon index Gamma ~ 1.75 and a
shoulder at Gamma ~ 2.0-2.2 extending to the soft spectral region, and shows
clear evolution with source luminosity. The distribution of absorbing columns
towards M31 sources derived from spectral analysis has a peak at
N_H~1.2x10^{21} cm^{-2} extending up to 1.3x10^{22} cm^{-2}, with an average
value of (1.52 +/- 0.02)x10^{21} cm^{-2}. More than 80% of sources observed in
two or more observations show significant variability on the time scales of
days to years. About 50% of the sources in our sample are spectrally variable.
The spectral evolution of a number of sources is correlated with the level of
their X-ray flux, while some sources demonstrate complex patterns of evolution
on the hardness-intensity diagram. Based on the similarity of the properties of
M31 X-ray sources and their Galactic counterparts, we expect most of the X-ray
sources in our sample to be accreting binary systems with neutron star and
black hole primaries. A total of 44 X-ray sources can be identified as probable
X-ray binaries. Combining the results of X-ray analysis with available data at
other wavelengths, we classify 7% and 24% of sources in our sample as,
respectively, probable black hole and neutron star candidates.

proper starting point for an analytical description of these plasmas is kinetic
theory, not fluid equations. The anisotropy of the turbulence is used to
systematically derive a series of reduced analytical models. Above the ion
gyroscale, it is shown rigourously that the Alfven waves decouple from the
electron-density and magnetic-field-strength fluctuations and satisfy the
Reduced MHD equations. The density and field-strength fluctuations (slow waves
and the entropy mode in the fluid limit), determined kinetically, are passively
mixed by the Alfven waves. The resulting hybrid fluid-kinetic description of
the low-frequency turbulence is valid independently of collisionality. Below
the ion gyroscale, the turbulent cascade is partially converted into a cascade
of kinetic Alfven waves, damped at the electron gyroscale. This cascade is
described by a pair of fluid-like equations, which are a reduced version of the
Electron MHD. The development of these theoretical models is motivated by
observations of the turbulence in the solar wind and interstellar medium. In
the latter case, the turbulence is spatially inhomogeneous and the anisotropic
Alfvenic turbulence in the presence of a strong mean field may coexist with
isotropic MHD turbulence that has no mean field.

circumstellar disks in the Tau-Aur and Oph-Sco star formation regions using the
SMA. In the context of a simple model, we use broadband SEDs and submillimeter
visibilities to derive constraints on some basic parameters that describe the
structure of these disks. For the typical disk in the sample we infer a radial
surface density distribution \Sigma ~ r^-p with a median p ~ 0.5, although
consideration of the systematic effects of some of our assumptions suggest that
steeper distributions with p ~ 0.7-1.0 are more reasonable. The distribution of
the outer radii of these disks shows a distinct peak at R_d = 200 AU, with only
a few cases where the disk emission is completely unresolved. Based on these
disk structure measurements, the mass accretion rates, and the typical spectral
and spatial distributions of submillimeter emission, we show that the
observations are in good agreement with similarity solutions for steady
accretion disks that have a viscosity parameter alpha ~ 0.01. We provide new
estimates of the spectral dependence of the disk opacity with a median spectral
index of ~0.7, corrected for optically thick emission. This typical value is
consistent with model predictions for the collisional growth of solids to
millimeter size scales in the outer disk. Although direct constraints on planet
formation in these disks are not currently available, the extrapolated density
distributions inferred here are substantially shallower than those calculated
based on the solar system or extrasolar planets and typically used in planet

physically well-behaved and have fluid velocity $\leq c$ throughout the domain
of interest. Among these solutions, we show via physical arguments and
time-dependent numerical simulations that the minimum-torque solution, i.e.,
the solution with the smallest amount of toroidal field, is the one picked by a
real system. For $\nu \geq 1$, the Lorentz factor of the outflow increases
along a field line as $\gamma \approx M(z/\Rfp)^{(2-\nu)/2} \approx R/R_{\rm
A}$, where $\Rfp$ is the radius of the foot-point of the field line on the disk
and $R_{\rm A}=\Rfp/M$ is the cylindrical radius at which the field line
crosses the Alfven surface or the light cylinder. For $\nu < 1$, the Lorentz
factor follows the same scaling for $z/\Rfp < M^{-1/(1-\nu)}$, but at larger
distances it grows more slowly: $\gamma \approx (z/\Rfp)^{\nu/2}$. For either
regime of $\nu$, the dependence of $\gamma$ on $M$ shows that the rotation of
the disk plays a strong role in jet acceleration. On the other hand, the
poloidal shape of a field line is given by $z/\Rfp \approx
(R/\Rfp)^{2/(2-\nu)}$ and is independent of $M$. Thus rotation has neither a
collimating nor a decollimating effect on field lines, suggesting that
relativistic astrophysical jets are not collimated by the rotational winding up
of the magnetic field.

the range in properties exhibited by the small class. The measured accretion
rates are very low, 0.6-5x10^{-13} Msun/yr, and multiple visits spanning more

becoming increasingly clear that the low-mdot magnetic white dwarf binaries
accrete by nearly complete magnetic capture of the stellar wind from the
secondary star rather than by Roche lobe overflow. The accretion rates
therefore provide some of the first realistic estimates of the total wind loss
rates from M dwarfs. Although one or more of the eight systems known to date
may be interrupted or possibly even extinct Polars, several lines of evidence
suggest that most are pre-Polars whose evolution has not yet brought the
secondaries into contact with their Roche surfaces. Considering the
difficulties of identifying binaries over a wide range in field strength and

few kiloparsec diameter is formed, within which a smaller HeIII region is
embedded. Radiative feedback effect quenches further star-formation within the
halo for a hundred million years. Accretion onto remnant blackholes will be
inefficient. Recombination radiation within the HII region is weak, but
persists for 50 million years. We also follow the thermal and chemical
evolution of the photo-ionized gas in the relic HII region. The gas cools by HD
line cooling down to a few tens Kelvin. At high redshifts (z>10), the minimum
gas temperature is limited by T_CMB. Because of its low temperature, the
characteristic mass of a Jeans-unstable gas clump is ~ 40 Msun, and is
significantly smaller than a typical clump mass for early primordial gas
clouds. We find no evidence of fragmentation by this epoch. Together with the
small cloud mass, this result indicates that massive, rather than very massive,
primordial stars may form in the relic HII region. Such stars might be
responsible for early metal-enrichment of the interstellar medium from which
recently discovered hyper metal-poor stars were born.

by outflow-driven shells in NGC 1333 (induced by an increase in gas pressure
and density due to radiation pressure from the stellar winds, that have
presumably created the dust shell). This kind of evidences provides a more

X-ray obscured QSOs, according to strictly X-ray criteria, i.e. defined as
having large hydrogen column densities (N_H>10^22 cgs) and luminosities
(Lx>10^44 cgs). The surface density of X-ray obscured QSOs is ~210 sq. deg. We
find 18 candidate Compton thick N_H>10^24 cgs sources, of which three have QSO
luminosities (L_x>10^44 cgs). The X-ray obscured QSO comprise a mixed bag of
objects, covering the redshift range z=1.3-4.3. Eight of these show narrow line
optical spectra, two show no obscuration in their optical spectra presenting
Broad Lines, while for the other seven there is only a photometric redshift
available. About half of the X-ray obscured QSOs show high X-ray to optical
flux ratios, X/O>1, and red colours, I-3.6>4. Combination of the X-ray with the
mid-IR 8 or 24 micron flux can be used as an additional diagnostic to sift out
the heavily obscured AGN. All X-ray selected QSOs present red mid-IR colours
and can be easily separated among mid-IR sources, demonstrating that mid-IR
selection provides a powerful tool for the detection of obscured QSOs.

the Universe. The processes leading to both the formation and the evolution of
such stars are discussed by means of a new multi-zone photo-chemical evolution

means of G-dwarf-like diagrams.
  By comparing model predictions with observations, we derive a picture of
galaxy formation in which the higher is the mass of the galaxy, the shorter are
the infall and the star formation timescales. Therefore, the stellar component
of the most massive and luminous galaxies might attain a metallicity Z > Z_sun
in only 0.5 Gyr.
  Each galaxy is created outside-in, i.e. the outermost regions accrete gas,
form stars and develop a galactic wind very quickly, compared to the central
core in which the star formation can last up to ~1.3 Gyr. This finding will be
discussed at the light of recent observations of the galaxy NGC 4697 which

they are very similar to ellipticals and that they formed on a very short

a small central gas reservoir (10^4-10^7 Msun) which may be only partly

better understanding of the involved physical processes is to directly probe
the gravitational potential of the host galaxies, with the hope that the
corresponding sensitive tracers (stars, gas) will deliver convincing evidence
for a kinematic signature associated with the AGN. This is the motivation for
an on-going survey of 50 galaxies, for which the two-dimensional kinematics of
the (neutral, ionised and molecular) gas and stellar components are being
obtained (see Dumas et al., this conference). With only 10 to 15% of Seyfert

this activity is a recurrent (but short) process, and that signatures of recent
gas accretion associated with the onset of the central activity should be
detectable. This paper is a short report on the detection and study of
sigma--drops which we believe are the result of past gas accretion followed by

(temperature, luminosity) trends in normal spectra are surveyed. Then, the
normal reference frame having been established, various categories of peculiar
objects can be distinguished relative to it, which reveal several phenomena of
structural and/or evolutionary significance. Included are CNO anomalies at both
early and late O types, three varieties of rapid rotators, hot and cool Of/WN
transition objects, and the recently discovered second known magnetic O star.
The importance of both optical and UV observations to understand these
phenomena is emphasized; for instance, progress in understanding the structure
of the new O-type magnetic oblique rotator is hampered by the current lack of a
UV spectrograph. While progress in the physical interpretation of these trends
and anomalies has been and is being made, increased attention to modeling the
systematics would accelerate future progress in this author's opinion. Finally,
preliminary results from a Chandra high-resolution survey of OB X-ray spectra

spins of the excited electron pairs of different quasi-momenta. Different
distributions of the quantum Stokes vector of the light lead to either
enhancement or reduction of the collective spin correlations, depending on the

becomes non-classical, the spin correlations exhibit a crossover from being
positive with a $\sim N^2$ ($N$ is average photon number) scaling, to being
negative with $\sim N$ scaling, even when $N$ is not small. Negative spin
correlations mean a preponderance of spin singlets in the optically generated

substantially alters the Mn ion spin state. Its interaction with the gold

significant changes in the electronic and magnetic properties of adsorbed MnP,

low-temperature quench of topological defects (e.g., grain boundaries or
dislocations) which we examined in an earlier work. The low-temperature glass
can account for not only a monotonic decrease in the rotation period as the
temperature is lowered but also explains the peak in the dissipation occurring
near the transition point. Unlike the non-classical rotational inertia
scenario, which depends on the supersolid fraction, the dependence of the
rotational period on external parameters, e.g., the oscillator velocity,
provides an alternate interpretation of the oscillator experiments. Future
experiments might explore this effect.

essential physical concept involved is that simultaneous migration of two
unlike mobile ions in mixed ionic glass is accompanied by expansion or
contraction of the guest-occupied sites with distortion of surrounding glass
matrix; in many cases, an intensity of the local stresses in glass matrix
surrounding ionic sites occupied by foreign ions is much greater than, or at
least comparable to the glass network binding energy. Hence, when the stress
exceeds the breaking threshold, relaxation occurs almost immediately via the
rupture of the bonds in the nearest glass matrix with generation of pairs of
intrinsic structural defects. The specificity of the mechanism of defect
generation leads to the clustering of negatively charged defects, so that
rearranged sites act as high energy anion traps in glass matrix. This results
in the immobilization of almost all minority mobile species and part of
majority mobile species, so mixed mobile ion glass behaves as single mobile ion
glass of much lower concentration of charge carriers. Generation of defects
leads also to the depolymerization of glass network, which in turn results in
the reduction of the glass viscosity and Tg as well as in the compaction of
glass structure (thermometer effect). The magnitude of the mixed mobile ion
effect is defined by the size mismatch of unlike mobile ions, their total and
relative concentrations, the binding energy of the glass-forming network, and
temperature. Although the proposed model is based upon the exploration of
alkali silicate glass-forming system, the approach developed here can be easily
adopted to other mixed ionic systems such as crystalline and even liquid ionic
conductors.

violation of the fluctuation-response relation (FRR) in nonequilibrium Langevin
systems is described. The FRR is a relation between the correlation function of
the fluctuations and the response function of macroscopic variables. Although
it has been established that the FRR holds in equilibrium, physical
significance of violation of the FRR in nonequilibrium systems has been under

related in a simple equality to the rate of energy dissipation into the

the FRR, the FRR violation, and the new equality with regard to a Langevin

biological molecular motor. Furthermore, applications of our result to

If the ground state is a singlet, differential conductance ($G$) displays a

accounted for using the deformation potential approximation. Comparing with
experiments, a deformation potential coupling constant of 14eV is determined
for semiconducting carbon nanotubes. Theory is shown to closely predict the
low-field mobility, on conductance, and on resistance of field-effect
transistors as a function of induced nanotube charge density, diameter, and
temperature. Results indicate that the device conductance is reduced as
multiple subband channels conduct due to strong intersubband scattering.
Comparison with experiment allows identification of the mean free path (Lm) in
semiconducting carbon nanotubes. As the device turns on, Lm is found to
increase significantly. When the device is in the on state, the mean free path
(Lm-ON) varies linearly with tube diameter and inversely with temperature.
Intersubband scattering is found to strongly decrease Lm-ON when a few subbands
are occupied. When 3 subband channels are considered at room temperature, Lm-ON
decreases from 570nm to 200nm for a 4nm diameter tube when intersubband

spectra of S/N junctions involving d-wave cuprate superconductors has been
important in the determination of the phase structure of the superconducting
order parameter. In this context, the involvement of a p-wave superconductor
such as Sr2RuO4 in tunnelling studies is indeed of great importance. We have
recently succeeded in fabricating devices that enable S/N junctions forming at
interfaces between Sr2RuO4 and Ru micro-inclusions in eutectic crystals to be
investigated.3 We have observed a ZBCP and have interpreted it as due to the
Andreev bound state, commonly seen in unconventional superconductors. Also we
have proposed that the onset of the ZBCP may be used to delineate the phase
boundary for the onset of a time reversal symmetry broken (TRSB) state within
the superconducting state, which does not always coincide with the onset of the
superconducting state. However, these measurements always involved two
interfaces between Sr2RuO4 and Ru. In the present study, we have extended the
previous measurements to obtain a deeper insight into the properties of a
single interface between Sr2RuO4 and Ru.

B 76, 195204 (2007).","10.1103/PhysRevB.76.195204",,"cond-mat.mes-hall",,"  We present a general unifying theory for spin polarization decay due to the
interplay of spin precession and momentum scattering that is applicable to both
spin-1/2 electrons and spin-3/2 holes. Our theory allows us to identify and
characterize a wide range of qualitatively different regimes. For strong
momentum scattering or slow spin precession we recover the D'yakonov-Perel
result, according to which the spin relaxation time is inversely proportional
to the momentum relaxation time. On the other hand, we find that, in the
ballistic regime the carrier spin polarization shows a very different
qualitative behavior. In systems with isotropic spin splitting the spin
polarization can oscillate indefinitely, while in systems with anisotropic spin
splitting the spin polarization is reduced by spin dephasing, which is
non-exponential and may result in an incomplete decay of the spin polarization.
For weak momentum scattering or fast spin precession, the oscillations or
non-exponential spin dephasing are modulated by an exponential envelope
proportional to the momentum relaxation time. Nevertheless, even in this case
in certain systems a fraction of the spin polarization may survive at long
times. Finally it is shown that, despite the qualitatively different nature of
spin precession in the valence band, spin polarization decay in spin-3/2 hole
systems has many similarities to its counterpart in spin-1/2 electron systems.

can be recognised by simply running them; the main difficulty is to detect
non-halting programs. Our approach is to have the probability space extend over
both space and time and to consider the probability that a random $N$-bit
program has halted by a random time. We postulate an a priori computable
probability distribution on all possible runtimes and we prove that given an
integer k>0, we can effectively compute a time bound T such that the
probability that an N-bit program will eventually halt given that it has not
halted by T is smaller than 2^{-k}. We also show that the set of halting
programs (which is computably enumerable, but not computable) can be written as
a disjoint union of a computable set and a set of effectively vanishing
probability. Finally, we show that ``long'' runtimes are effectively rare. More
formally, the set of times at which an N-bit program can stop after the time
2^{N+constant} has effectively zero density.

bias-corrected maximum likelihood estimator. The sample median estimator and
the geometric mean estimator are asymptotically (as $k\to \infty$) equivalent

weaker than the classical JL lemma for dimension reduction in $l_2$.
  Asymptotically, both the sample median estimator and the geometric mean

waveforms for the quasi-circular, adiabatic inspiral of spinning binary compact
objects. The performance of amplitude-corrected waveforms is compared with that
of the more commonly used restricted waveforms, in Advanced LIGO and EGO. With
restricted waveforms, the properties of the source can only be extracted from
the phasing. For amplitude-corrected waveforms, the spectrum encodes a wealth
of additional information, which leads to dramatic improvements in parameter
estimation. At distances of $\sim 100$ Mpc, the full PN waveforms allow for
high-accuracy parameter extraction for total mass up to several hundred solar
masses, while with the restricted ones the errors are steep functions of mass,
and accurate parameter estimation is only possible for relatively light stellar
mass binaries. At the low-mass end, the inclusion of amplitude corrections
reduces the error on the time of coalescence by an order of magnitude in
Advanced LIGO and a factor of 5 in EGO compared to the restricted waveforms; at
higher masses these differences are much larger. The individual component
masses, which are very poorly determined with restricted waveforms, become
measurable with high accuracy if amplitude-corrected waveforms are used, with
errors as low as a few percent in Advanced LIGO and a few tenths of a percent
in EGO. The usual spin-orbit parameter $\beta$ is also poorly determined with
restricted waveforms (except for low-mass systems in EGO), but the full
waveforms give errors that are small compared to the largest possible value
consistent with the Kerr bound. This suggests a way of finding out if one or
both of the component objects violate this bound. We also briefly discuss the
effect of amplitude corrections on parameter estimation in Initial LIGO.

a simple superposition of quasi-normal modes, although the fundamental mode is
usually present and often dominates the gravitational-wave signal. We interpret
this as due to backscattering of waves off the non-exponentially decaying part
of the black-hole potential and to the finite spatial extension of the
accreting matter. Our results suggest that the black-hole QNM contributions to

that a detection at the level $r > 0.01$ would falsify slow roll D-brane
inflation. In DBI inflation, detectable tensors may be possible in special
compactifications, provided that $r$ decreases rapidly during inflation. We
also show that for the special case of DBI inflation with a quadratic
potential, current observational constraints imply strong upper bounds on the
five-form flux.

parameterised in terms of a constitutive tensor whose properties can in
principle be determined by experiments in non-inertial (accelerating) frames

establishing some geometric notation, discussion is given to basic concepts of
stress, energy and momentum in the vacuum where the useful notion of a drive
form is introduced in order to associate the conservation of currents involving
the flux of energy, momentum and angular momentum with spacetime isometries.
The definition of the stress-energy-momentum tensor is discussed with
particular reference to its symmetry based on its role as a source of
relativistic gravitation. General constitutive properties of material continua
are formulated in terms of spacetime tensors including those that describe
magneto-electric phenomena in moving media. This leads to a formulation of a
self-adjoint constitutive tensor describing, in general, inhomogeneous,
anisotropic, magneto-electric bulk matter in arbitrary motion. The question of
an invariant characterisation of intrinsically magneto-electric media is
explored. An action principle is established to generate the phenomenological
Maxwell system and the use of variational derivatives to calculate
stress-energy-momentum tensors is discussed in some detail. The relation of
this result to tensors proposed by Abraham and others is discussed in the
concluding section where the relevance of the whole approach to experiments on
matter in non-inertial environments with variable gravitational and
electromagnetic fields is stressed.

further conservation law in the energy space, the finite speed of propagation
and Lorentz transformations to establish a crucial orthogonality property for ""

denote the sphere product $S^{1} \times S^{d - 1}$ if $\epsilon = 0$ and the
twisted $S^{d - 1}$ bundle over $S^{1}$ if $\epsilon = 1$. The main results of
this paper are: (a) if $d \equiv \epsilon$ (mod 2) then $S^{1, d -
1}(\epsilon)$ has a unique minimal triangulation using $2d + 3$ vertices, and
(b) if $d \equiv 1 - \epsilon$ (mod 2) then $S^{1, d - 1}(\epsilon)$ has
minimal triangulations (not unique) using $2d + 4$ vertices. The second result
confirms a recent conjecture of Lutz. The first result provides the first known
infinite family of closed manifolds (other than spheres) for which the minimal
triangulation is unique. Actually, we show that while $S^{1, d - 1}(\epsilon)$
has at most one $(2d + 3)$-vertex triangulation (one if $d \equiv \epsilon$
(mod 2), zero otherwise), in sharp contrast, the number of non-isomorphic $(2d
+ 4)$-vertex triangulations of these $d$-manifolds grows exponentially with $d$
for either choice of $\epsilon$. The result in (a), as well as the minimality
part in (b), is a consequence of the following result: (c) for $d \geq 3$,
there is a unique $(2d + 3)$-vertex simplicial complex which triangulates a
non-simply connected closed manifold of dimension $d$. This amazing simplicial
complex was first constructed by K\""{u}hnel in 1986. Generalizing a 1987 result
of Brehm and K\""{u}hnel, we prove that (d) any triangulation of a non-simply
connected closed $d$-manifold requires at least $2d + 3$ vertices. The result
(c) completely describes the case of equality in (d). The proofs rest on the
Lower Bound Theorem for normal pseudomanifolds and on a combinatorial version
of Alexander duality.

approach to dealing with the multiplicity problem is to restrict attention to
procedures that control the familywise error rate ($FWER$), the probability of
even one false rejection. However, if $s$ is large, control of the $FWER$ is so
stringent that the ability of a procedure which controls the $FWER$ to detect
false null hypotheses is limited. Consequently, it is desirable to consider
other measures of error control. We will consider methods based on control of
the false discovery proportion ($FDP$) defined by the number of false
rejections divided by the total number of rejections (defined to be 0 if there
are no rejections). The false discovery rate proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg
(1995) controls $E(FDP)$. Here, we construct methods such that, for any
$\gamma$ and $\alpha$, $P\{FDP>\gamma \}\le \alpha$. Based on $p$-values of
individual tests, we consider stepdown procedures that control the $FDP$,
without imposing dependence assumptions on the joint distribution of the
$p$-values. A greatly improved version of a method given in Lehmann and Romano
\citer10 is derived and generalized to provide a means by which any sequence of
nondecreasing constants can be rescaled to ensure control of the $FDP$. We also
provide a stepdown procedure that controls the $FDR$ under a dependence
assumption.

multiple tests as an estimation problem under a proper population model, an
error measurement called Erroneous Rejection Ratio (ERR) is introduced and
related to the False Discovery Rate (FDR). ERR is an error measurement similar
in spirit to FDR, and it greatly simplifies the analytical study of error
properties of multiple test procedures. Next an improved estimator of the
proportion of true null hypotheses and a data adaptive significance threshold
criterion are developed. Some asymptotic error properties of the significant
threshold criterion is established in terms of ERR under distributional
assumptions widely satisfied in recent applications. A simulation study
provides clear evidence that the proposed estimator of the proportion of true
null hypotheses outperforms the existing estimators of this important parameter
in massive multiple tests. Both analytical and simulation studies indicate that
the proposed significance threshold criterion can provide a reasonable balance
between the amounts of false positive and false negative errors, thereby
complementing and extending the various FDR control procedures. S-plus/R code

Neyman, and more recently Lehmann and Cox, and attempts a synthesis of their
views in the context of the Probabilistic Reduction (PR) approach. As argued by
Lehmann [11], a major stumbling block for a general approach to statistical
model specification has been the delineation of the appropriate role for
substantive subject matter information. The PR approach demarcates the
interrelated but complemenatry roles of substantive and statistical information
summarized ab initio in the form of a structural and a statistical model,
respectively. In an attempt to preserve the integrity of both sources of
information, as well as to ensure the reliability of their fusing, a purely
probabilistic construal of statistical models is advocated. This probabilistic
construal is then used to shed light on a number of issues relating to
specification, including the role of preliminary data analysis, structural vs.
statistical models, model specification vs. model selection, statistical vs.
substantive adequacy and model validation.

Lorenz introduced a device for measuring inequality in the distribution of

short of the egalitarian situation where everyone has the same income. Gini
introduced a summary measure of inequality that is the average over u of the
difference between the Lorenz curve and its values in the egalitarian case.
More generally, measures of inequality are useful for other response variables
in addition to income, e.g. wealth, sales, dividends, taxes, market share and
test scores. In this paper we show that a generalized van Zwet type dispersion
ordering for distributions of positive random variables induces an ordering on
the Lorenz curve, the Gini coefficient and other measures of inequality. We use
this result and distributional orderings based on transformations of
distributions to motivate parametric and semiparametric models whose regression
coefficients measure effects of covariates on inequality. In particular, we
extend a parametric Pareto regression model to a flexible semiparametric
regression model and give partial likelihood estimates of the regression
coefficients and a baseline distribution that can be used to construct
estimates of the various conditional measures of inequality.

wish of explanation, the two overriding weaknesses of PET camera readout
electronics, namely dead-time and timing resolution, were investigated
analytically and with a Monte-Carlo simulator presently dedicated to this task.
Results have shown there was room left for count rate enhancement through a
huge decrease of the timing resolution well below the nanosecond. The novel
electronics scheme suggested for PET in this paper has been partly inspired by
the long experience led in High Energy Physics where the latter requirement is
compulsory. Its structure entirely pipelined combined to a pixelation of the
whole detector should allow dead-times to be suppressed, while the absence of
devoted timing channel would remove the preponderant contributions to the
timing resolution. To the common solution for timing would substitute an
optimal filtering method witch clearly appears as a good candidate as timing
resolution of a few tens of picoseconds may be achieved provided the shape of
the signal is known and sufficient samples are available with enough accuracy.
First investigations have yield encouraging results as a sampling frequency of
50 MHz with a 7 bits precision appears sufficient to ensure the 500ps
coincidence timing resolution planed. At this point, there will be a baby step
ahead to draw benefice from a TOF implementation to the design and the enormous
noise variance enhancement that would come with.

train in a semi-analytic framework. Employing the Strong-Field Approximation
and saddle-point methods, we make a detailed assessment of the spectra obtained
by modeling the attosecond pulse train by either a monochromatic wave or a
Dirac-Delta comb. These are the two extreme limits of a real train, which is
composed by a finite set of harmonics. Specifically, in the monochromatic
limit, we find the downhill and uphill sets of orbits reported in the
literature, and analyze their influence on the high-harmonic spectra. We show
that, in principle, the downhill trajectories lead to stronger harmonics, and
pronounced enhancements in the low-plateau region. These features are analyzed
in terms of quantum interference effects between pairs of quantum orbits, and
compared to those obtained in the Dirac-Delta limit.

of adipocytes, our group found the presence of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). LPA
is a bioactive phospholipid able to regulate several cell responses via the

that LPA increases preadipocyte proliferation and inhibits adipogenesis via the

by a lysophospholipase D secreted by adipocytes : autotaxin (ATX). Adipocyte

functions which output the adjacent vertices for each vertex. Let i and j be
two given vertices. The first problem consists in estimating the difference
between the number of paths of length m from j to j and those which from i to
j, where m is polylogarithmic in the number of vertices. The scale of the
estimation accuracy is specified by some a priori known upper bound on the
growth of these differences with increasing m. The problem remains BQP-hard for
regular graphs with degree 4.
  The second problem is related to continuous-time classical random walks. The
walk starts at some vertex j. The promise is that the difference of the
probabilities of being at j and at i, respectively, decays with O(exp(-\mu t))
for some \mu>0. The problem is to decide whether this difference is greater
than a exp(-\mu T) or smaller than b exp(-\mu T) after some time instant T,
where T is polylogarithmic and the difference a-b is inverse polylogarithmic in
the number of vertices. Since the probabilities differ only by an exponentially
small amount, an exponential number of trials would be necessary if one tried
to answer this question by running the walk itself.

ranges in which the reflection probability R(E)=|r(E)|^2 is 1. They occur as
the phase phi(E) defined by r(E) = t*(E)/t(E) = 1e^{i 2phi(E)} undergoes a
rapid change of pi radians. During this transition the phase angle exhibits a
Lorentzian profile in that d(phi(E))/dE ~= 1/[(E-E_0)^2+(hbar*gamma/2)^2]. The
energy E_0 identifies the location of a quasi-bound state, gamma measures the
lifetime of this state, and t(E) is a matrix element of the transfer operator.
Methods for computing and measuring these resonances are proposed.

improvement over classical random walks in their spreading rates and mixing
times respectively. Non-unitary quantum walks can provide a useful optimisation
of these properties, producing a more uniform distribution on the line, and
faster mixing times on the cycle. We investigate the interplay between quantum
and random dynamics by comparing the resources required, and examining
numerically how the level of quantum correlations varies during the walk. We
show numerically that the optimal non-unitary quantum walk proceeds such that
the quantum correlations are nearly all removed at the point of the final
measurement. This requires only O(log T) random bits for a quantum walk of T
steps
