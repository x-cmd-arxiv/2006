of distant galaxies and the orientation of foreground galaxies, through the use
of numerical simulations. This shear-ellipticity correlation can mimic a
cosmological weak lensing signal, and is potentially the limiting physical
systematic effect for cosmology with future high-precision weak lensing
surveys. We find that, if uncorrected, the shear-ellipticity correlation could
contribute up to 10% of the weak lensing signal on scales up to 20 arcminutes,
for lensing surveys with a median depth z=1. The most massive foreground
galaxies are expected to cause the largest correlations, a result also seen in
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that the redshift dependence of the
effect is proportional to the lensing efficiency of the foreground, and this
offers prospects for removal to high precision, although with some model
dependence. The contamination is characterised by a weakly negative B-mode,
which can be used as a diagnostic of systematic errors. We also provide more
accurate predictions for a second potential source of error, the intrinsic
alignment of nearby galaxies. This source of contamination is less important,
however, as it can be easily removed with distance information.

the dispersion of discs around stars in high-density young stellar clusters

  METHODS: Two types of simulations were combined -- N-body simulations of the
dynamics of the stars in the ONC and mass loss results from simulations of
star-disc encounters, where the disc mass loss of all stars is determined as a
function of time.
  RESULTS: We find that in the Trapezium, the discs around high-mass stars are
dispersed much more quickly and to a larger degree by their gravitational
interaction than for intermediate-mass stars. This is consistent with the very
recent observations of IC 348, where a higher disc frequency was found around
solar mass stars than for more massive stars, suggesting that this might be a
general trend in large young stellar clusters.

molecular hydrogen by recombination, which essentially takes place on dust
grain surfaces. Analytical approaches to model such a system have hitherto
neglected the spatial aspects of the problem by employing a simplistic version
of the sweeping rate of reactants. We show how these aspects can be accounted
for by a consistent definition of the sweeping rate, and calculate it exactly
for a spherical grain. Two regimes can be identified: Small grains, on which
two reactants almost surely meet, and large grains, where this is very
unlikely. We compare the true sweeping rate to the conventional approximation
and find a characteristic reduction in both regimes, most pronounced for large
grains. These effects can be understood heuristically using known results from
the analysis of two-dimensional random walks. We finally examine the influence
of using the true sweeping rate in the calculation of the efficiency of
hydrogen recombination: For fixed temperature, the efficiency can be reduced
considerably, and relative to that, small grains gain in importance, but the
temperature window in which recombination is efficient is not changed
substantially.

polarization (indicative of the relative orientations of the disks around each

terms of models that treat each disk as an isolated reservoir and those in
which the disks are subject to re-supply from some form of circumbinary

M_dyn=6.9 +/- 0.6 x 10^10 Msun within a typical radius of ~6 kpc, after
excluding AGN. The average dynamical mass is ~2 times larger than the average
stellar mass, and the two agree to within a factor of several for most objects.

young stellar populations and tend to have high H-alpha equivalent widths,
suggesting that they are young starbursts with large gas masses. Rest-frame
optical luminosity and velocity dispersion are correlated with 4 sigma
significance. Using the local empirical correlation between star formation rate
per unit area and gas surface density, we estimate the mass of the gas
associated with star formation, and find a mean gas fraction of ~50% and a
strong decrease in gas fraction with increasing stellar mass. The masses of gas
and stars combined are considerably better correlated with the dynamical masses
than are the stellar masses alone, and agree to within a factor of three for
85% of the sample. The combination of kinematic measurements, estimates of gas

in stellar mass across the sample cannot be fully explained by intrinsic
differences in the total masses of the galaxies, which vary by a factor of ~40;
the remaining variation is due to the evolution of the stellar population and
the conversion of gas into stars. [Abridged]

radiating X-rays with a luminosity of ~1E45 erg/s consistent with a cooling
rate of ~1000-2000 solar masses per year. However, Chandra and XMM-Newton
observations find less than 200 solar masses per year of gas cooling below ~2
keV, a level that is consistent with the cD's current star formation rate of
100-180 solar masses per year. One or more heating agents (feedback) must then
be replenishing the remaining radiative losses. The heat fluxes from supernova
explosions and thermal conduction alone are unable to do so. However, a pair of
X-ray cavities from an AGN outburst has deposited ~1.7E60 erg into the
surrounding gas over the past 40 Myr. The corresponding jet power 1.4E45
erg/sec is enough to offset most of the radiative losses from the cooling gas.
The jet power exceeds the radio synchrotron power by ~4000 times, making this
one of the most radiatively inefficient radio sources known. The large jet
power implies that the cD's supermassive black hole accreted at a mean rate of
  ~0.3 solar masses per year over the last 40 Myr or so, which is a small
fraction of the Eddington accretion rate for a 10E9 solar mass black hole. The
ratio of the bulge growth rate through star formation and the black hole growth
rate through accretion is consistent with the slope of the (Magorrian)
relationship between bulge and central black hole mass in nearby quiescent
galaxies. The consistency between net cooling, heating (feedback), and the
cooling sink (star formation) in this system resolves the primary objection to
traditional cooling flow models. (abridged)

ingredient for stellar interior models. In this paper we critically examine the
basic heuristic assumptions in the model of the Tayler-Spruit dynamo, which
describes how a pinch-type instability of a toroidal magnetic field in
differentially rotating stellar radiative zones may result in large-scale fluid
motion. We agree with prior published work both on the existence of the
instability and its nearly horizontal geometry for perturbations. However, the
approximations in the original Acheson dispersion relation are valid only for
small length scales, and we disagree that the dispersion relation can be
extrapolated to horizontal length scales of order the radius of the star. We
contend that dynamical effects, in particular angular momentum conservation,
limit the maximum horizontal length scale. We therefore present transport
coefficients for chemical mixing and angular momentum redistribution by
magnetic torques that are significantly different from previous published
values. The new magnetic viscosity is reduced by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude
compared to the old one, and we find that magnetic angular momentum transport
by this mechanism is very sensitive to gradients in the mean molecular weight.
The revised coefficients are more compatible with empirical constraints on the
timescale of core-envelope coupling in young stars than the previous ones.
However, solar models including only this mechanism possess a rapidly rotating
core, in contradiction with helioseismic data. (abridged)

the second of the classical X-ray dipper systems to show narrow absorption

the small measured line widths (>~ 500-2000 km s^{-1}), compared to the
expected Keplerian velocities (> 1000 km s^{-1}) of the accretion disk in this
50-min orbital period system, and lack of wavelength shifts (>~ 250 km s^{-1}).
First, the ionized absorber may be stationary. Alternatively, the line
properties may measure the relative size of the emission region. From this
hypothesis, we find that the emission region is constrained to be >~ 0.25 times
the radial extent of the absorber. Our results also imply that the ionized
absorber spans a range of ionization parameters.

be described by only one type of self-collimated jet model. METHODS: We present
analytical kinematic predictions valid soon after the Alfv\'en surface for all
types of steady magnetically self-confined jets. RESULTS: We show that extended
disc winds, X-winds, and stellar winds occupy distinct regions in the poloidal
speed vs. specific angular momentum plane. Comparisons with current
observations of T Tauri jets yield quantitative constraints on the range of
launching radii, magnetic lever arms, and specific energy input in disc and
stellar winds. Implications on the origin of jet asymmetries and disc magnetic
fields are outlined. CONCLUSIONS: We argue that ejection phenomena from
accreting T Tauri stars most likely include three dynamical components: (1) an
outer self-collimated steady disc wind carrying most of the mass-flux in the
optical jet (when present), confining (2) a pressure-driven coronal stellar
wind and (3) a hot inner flow made of blobs sporadically ejected from the
magnetopause. If the stellar magnetic moment is parallel to the disc magnetic
field, then the highly variable inner flow resembles a ""Reconnection X-wind"",
that has been proven to efficiently brake down an accreting and contracting
young star. If the magnetic moment is anti-parallel, then larger versions of
the solar coronal mass ejections are likely to occur. The relative importance
of these three components in the observed outflows and the range of radii
involved in the disc wind are expected to vary with time, from the stage of
embedded source to the optically revealed T Tauri star phase.

it is demonstrated that our model theory can successfully predict the emergence

in this dark halo-like object in terms of the non-trivial energy density of the

in between the end of the adiabatic era and the beginning of the radiative

nonuniform medium is emphasized. This could be of importance in particular for
studying the interaction of supernova remnants (SNRs) with molecular clouds and
therefore for understanding the processes of the cosmic ray production in such
systems. The duration of this subphase - about 70% of SNR age at its beginning
- is almost independent of the density gradient for media with increasing
density and is longer for higher supernova explosion energy and for smaller
density in the place of explosion. It is shown as well that if the density of
the ambient medium decreases then the cooling processes could differ from the
commonly accepted scenario of the ''thin dense radiative shell'' formation.
This property should be studied in the future because it is important for
models of nonspherical SNRs which could be only partially radiative.

content of galaxies are derived from a spectral synthesis method applied to a
volume-limited sample containing more than 60 thousand galaxies extracted from
the DR4 of the SDSS. Mean stellar ages, mean stellar metallicities and stellar
masses are obtained from this method and used to characterise the stellar
populations of galaxies. The environment is defined by the projected local
galaxy density estimated from a nearest neighbour approach. We recover the star
formation--density relation in terms of the mean light-weighted stellar age,
which is strongly correlated with star formation parameters derived from \Ha.
We find that the age--density relation is distinct when we divide galaxies
according to luminosity or stellar mass. The relation is remarkable for
galaxies in all bins of luminosity. On the other hand, only for an intermediate
stellar mass interval (associated to a transition in galaxy properties) the
relation shows a change in galaxy properties with environment. Such distinct
behaviours are associated to the large stellar masses of galaxies with the same
luminosity in high-density environments. In addition, the well known star
formation--density relation results from the prevalence of massive systems in
high-density environments, independently of galaxy luminosity, with the
additional observed downsizing in galaxy formation, in which the star formation
is shifted from massive galaxies at early times to low-mass galaxies as the
universe evolves. Our results support that a natural path for galaxy evolution
proceeds via a nurture way, in the sense that galaxy evolution is accelerated

heavy elements, and for this reason they are suitable objects for the study of
s-process elements. The aim of this work is to quantify the contributions of
the s-, r- and p-processes for the total abundance of heavy elements from
abundances derived for a sample of 26 barium stars. The abundance ratios
between these processes and neutron exposures were studied. The abundances of
the sample stars were compared to those of normal stars thus identifying the
fraction relative to the s-process main component. The fittings of the sigmaN
curves (neutron capture cross section times abundance, plotted against atomic
mass number) for the sample stars suggest that the material from the companion
asymptotic giant branch star had approximately the solar isotopic composition
as concerns fractions of abundances relative to the s-process main component.
The abundance ratios of heavy elements, hs, ls and s and the computed neutron
exposure are similar to those of post-AGB stars. For some sample stars, an
exponential neutron exposure fits well the observed data, whereas for others, a
single neutron exposure provides a better fit. The comparison between barium
and AGB stars supports the hypothesis of binarity for the barium star
formation. Abundances of r-elements that are part of the s-process path in
barium stars are usually higher than those in normal stars,and for this reason,
barium stars seemed to be also enriched in r-elements, although in a lower
degree than s-elements. No dependence on luminosity classes was found in the
abundance ratios behaviour among the dwarfs and giants of the sample barium
stars.

applying a standard mass estimator to samples drawn from 11 random realizations

future mass estimates made under the assumption that the tracer population is

linear response regime, the deviation of the velocity distribution function
from that of the homogeneous cooling state obeys the same linear integral

the fourth cumulant $a_2$. Comparison with computer simulations shows that the
modified approximation significantly improves the estimates for the heat flux
transport coefficients at strong dissipation. In addition, the slight
discrepancies between simulation and the standard first Sonine estimates for
the shear viscosity and the self-diffusion coefficient are also partially
corrected by the modified approximation. Finally, the extension of the modified
first Sonine approximation to the transport coefficients of the Enskog kinetic
theory is presented.

simulated dynamics of the thalamocortical system from the specific perspective
of attempting to maximize the diversity of cortical states. This is achieved by
designing the dynamics such that they favor opposing activity between adjacent
regions, thus promoting dynamic diversity while avoiding widespread activation
or de-activation. The anti-ferromagnetic Ising model with Metropolis dynamics
is adopted and applied to four variations of the large-scale connectivity of
the cat thalamocortical system: (a) considering only cortical regions and
connections; (b) considering the entire thalamocortical system; (c) the same as
in (b) but with the thalamic connections rewired so as to maintain the
statistics of node degree and node degree correlations; and (d) as in (b) but
with attenuated weights of the connections between cortical and thalamic nodes.
A series of interesting findings are obtained, including the identification of
specific substructures revealed by correlations between the activity of
adjacent regions in case (a) and a pronounced effect of the thalamic
connections in splitting the thalamocortical regions into two large groups of
nearly homogenous opposite activation (i.e. cortical regions and thalamic
nuclei, respectively) in cases (b) and (c). The latter effect is due to the
existence of dense connections between cortical and thalamic regions and the
lack of interconnectivity between the latter. Another interesting result
regarding case (d) is the fact that the pattern of thalamic correlations tended
to mirror that of the cortical regions. The possibility to control the level of
correlation between the cortical regions by varying the strength of
thalamocortical connections is also identified and discussed.

almost all models of electroweak symmetry breaking, top either couples strongly
to new particles or its properties are modified in some way. Top is being
studied in detail at the Fermilab Tevatron. Its production cross section has
been measured in a variety of channels; its mass has been determined to better
than 2%, and can be used to constrain the mass of the Higgs. Top quark decays
have been tested and non-standard production mechanisms searched for. Single
top production probes the electroweak properties of top, and has not yet been
observed; searches are now closing in on this process and it should be seen
soon. So far, all of the top quark's properties are consistent with the
Standard Model. However, the data still to come at the Tevatron will increase
the precision of all these measurements, and the enormous statistics available
at the LHC will open up new possibilities such as observation of spin
correlations and perhaps even CP violation in the top sector.

The stars in this universe are able to burn for billions of years, synthesize

a detailed analysis where this hypothetical ""Weakless Universe"" is matched to
our Universe by simultaneously adjusting Standard Model and cosmological
parameters. For instance, chemistry and nuclear physics are essentially
unchanged. The apparent habitability of the Weakless Universe suggests that the
anthropic principle does not determine the scale of electroweak breaking, or
even require that it be smaller than the Planck scale, so long as technically
natural parameters may be suitably adjusted. Whether the multi-parameter
adjustment is realized or probable is dependent on the ultraviolet completion,
such as the string landscape. Considering a similar analysis for the
cosmological constant, however, we argue that no adjustments of other
parameters are able to allow the cosmological constant to raise up even
remotely close to the Planck scale while obtaining macroscopic structure. The
fine-tuning problems associated with the electroweak breaking scale and the
cosmological constant therefore appear to be qualitatively different from the
perspective of obtaining a habitable universe.

electron-positron annihilation at LEP. We demonstrate by a dedicated

Notes, 347 (2008) 248--342",,,"math.GT math.AT",,"  A clear understanding of topology of higher-dimensional objects is important
in many branches of both pure and applied mathematics. In this survey we
attempt to present some results of higher-dimensional topology in a way which
makes clear the visual and intuitive part of the constructions and the
arguments. In particular, we show how abstract algebraic constructions appear
naturally in the study of geometric problems. Before giving a general
construction, we illustrate the main ideas in simple but important particular
cases, in which the essence is not veiled by technicalities.
  More specifically, we present several classical and modern results on the
embedding and knotting of manifolds in Euclidean space. We state many concrete
results (in particular, recent explicit classification of knotted tori). Their
statements (but not proofs!) are simple and accessible to non-specialists. We
outline a general approach to embeddings via the classical van
Kampen-Shapiro-Wu-Haefliger-Weber 'deleted product' obstruction. This approach
reduces the isotopy classification of embeddings to the homotopy classification
of equivariant maps, and so implies the above concrete results. We describe the
revival of interest in this beautiful branch of topology, by presenting new
results in this area (of Freedman, Krushkal, Teichner, Segal, Spiez and the
author): a generalization the Haefliger-Weber embedding theorem below the
metastable dimension range and examples showing that other analogues of this

family of Gaussian mixture models designed for high-dimensional data which
combine the ideas of dimension reduction and parsimonious modeling. These
models give rise to a clustering method based on the Expectation-Maximization

subsequences of length $k$ in a random permutation from $S_n$, the symmetric
group of permutations of $\{1,...,n\}$. In a recent paper [Random Structures
Algorithms 29 (2006) 277--295] we showed that the weak law of large numbers
holds for $Z_{n,k_n}$ if $k_n=o(n^{2/5})$; that is,
\[\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{Z_{n,k_n}}{EZ_{n,k_n}}=1\qquad in probability.\] The
method of proof employed there used the second moment method and demonstrated
that this method cannot work if the condition $k_n=o(n^{2/5})$ does not hold.
It follows from results concerning the longest increasing subsequence of a
random permutation that the law of large numbers cannot hold for $Z_{n,k_n}$ if
$k_n\ge cn^{1/2}$, with $c>2$. Presumably there is a critical exponent $l_0$
such that the law of large numbers holds if $k_n=O(n^l)$, with $l<l_0$, and
does not hold if $\limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{k_n}{n^l}>0$, for some $l>l_0$.
Several phase transitions concerning increasing subsequences occur at $l=1/2$,
and these would suggest that $l_0={1/2}$. However, in this paper, we show that
the law of large numbers fails for $Z_{n,k_n}$ if
$\limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{k_n}{n^{4/9}}=\infty$. Thus, the critical exponent,
if it exists, must satisfy $l_0\in[{2/5},{4/9}]$.

its wide range of application, particularly in policy making decisions. The
variance based on direct sample size of small area estimator is unduly large
and there is a need of constructing model based estimator with low mean squared
prediction error (MSPE). Estimation of MSPE and in particular the bias
correction of MSPE plays the central piece of small area estimation research.
In this article, a new technique of bias correction for the estimated MSPE is
proposed. It is shown that that the new MSPE estimator attains the same level
of bias correction as the existing estimators based on straight Taylor
expansion and jackknife methods. However, unlike the existing methods, the
proposed estimate of MSPE is always nonnegative. Furthermore, the proposed
method can be used for general two-level small area models where the variables
at each level can be discrete or continuous and, in particular, be nonnormal.

equation model which assumes that the additives form branches with an exposed

that the rate of production of ZnO near those branches is proportional to the
height exposed to the solution. This accounts for the production of OH- ions
near the branches and the reactions with Zn++ ions. The steady state solution
shows both species growing with the rate of the branches, and qualitatively
explains their catalytic effect. Subsequently, we propose a more realistic
statistical model for the formation of the hybrid deposits from Zn++ ions, a
hydroxide precursor and eosin in solution. Simple probabilistic rules are used
for reactions of eosin and oxygen, taking into account diffusion from solution
along the same lines of the diffusion-limited aggregation models. The catalytic
effect is represented by the preferencial production of OH- ions near eosin
branches, which form ZnO species. An improvement of the growth rate is possible
only with a rather large diffusion coefficient of eosin in solution compared to
that of hydroxide precursors, in agreement with experimental findings. In the
cases where a series of neighboring eosin clusters competitively grow, the
increase in the growth rate and the high eosin loading observed in the
simulated deposits also agree qualitatively with electrodeposition experiments.

virtue of which, wind speed variations in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL)
exhibit highly irregular fluctuations that persist over a wide range of
temporal and spatial scales. Despite the large and significant body of work on
microscale turbulence, understanding the statistics of atmospheric wind speed
variations has proved to be elusive and challenging. Knowledge about the nature
of wind speed at ABL has far reaching impact on several fields of research such
as meteorology, hydrology, agriculture, pollutant dispersion, and more
importantly wind energy generation. In the present study, temporal wind speed
records from twenty eight stations distributed through out the state of North
Dakota (ND, USA), ($\sim$ 70,000 square-miles) and spanning a period of nearly
eight years are analyzed. We show that these records exhibit a characteristic
broad multifractal spectrum irrespective of the geographical location and
topography. The rapid progression of air masses with distinct qualitative
characteristics originating from Polar regions, Gulf of Mexico and Northern
Pacific account for irregular changes in the local weather system in ND. We
hypothesize that one of the primary reasons for the observed multifractal
structure could be the irregular recurrence and confluence of these three air
masses.

between bases of a pair is modelled by a harmonic potential, which becomes
anharmonic when described in terms of the rotation angles; here we substitute
to this different types of improved potentials, providing a more physical
description of the H-bond mediated interactions between the bases. We focus in
particular on soliton solutions; the Y model predicts the correct size of the
nonlinear excitations supposed to model the ``transcription bubbles'', and this
is essentially unchanged with the improved potential. Other features of soliton
dynamics, in particular curvature of soliton field configurations and the
Peierls-Nabarro barrier, are instead significantly changed.

mechanics, an explanation must be found of the fact that the Hamiltonian, which
is defined to be the operator that generates evolution in time, is bounded from
below. The mechanism that can produce exactly such a constraint is identified
in this paper. It is the fact that not all classical data are registered in the
quantum description. Large sets of values of these data are assumed to be
indistinguishable, forming equivalence classes. It is argued that this should
be attributed to information loss, such as what one might suspect to happen
during the formation and annihilation of virtual black holes.
  The nature of the equivalence classes is further elucidated, as it follows
from the positivity of the Hamiltonian. Our world is assumed to consist of a
very large number of subsystems that may be regarded as approximately
independent, or weakly interacting with one another. As long as two (or more)
sectors of our world are treated as being independent, they all must be
demanded to be restricted to positive energy states only. What follows from
these considerations is a unique definition of energy in the quantum system in
terms of the periodicity of the limit cycles of the deterministic model.

unboundedly with the system size for all universal resource states.
Furthermore, we prove that graph states associated with 2D lattices such as the
hexagonal and triangular lattice are universal, and obtain the first example of

can be quantified either by computing pairwise concurrence or by dividing the
chain into two complementary subsystems. In the latter case the smaller
subsystem is usually a single spin or a block of adjacent spins and the
entanglement differentiates between critical and non-critical regimes. Here we
extend this approach by considering a more general setting: our smaller
subsystem $S_A$ consists of a {\it comb} of $L$ spins, spaced $p$ sites apart.
Our results are thus not restricted to a simple `area law', but contain
non-local information, parameterized by the spacing $p$. For the XX model we
calculate the von-Neumann entropy analytically when $N\to \infty$ and
investigate its dependence on $L$ and $p$. We find that an external magnetic
field induces an unexpected length scale for entanglement in this case.
