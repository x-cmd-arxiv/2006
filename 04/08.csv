which the source is a variable star, simply because most variable stars are
systematically eliminated from microlensing studies. Using observational data
for this event, we show that the intrinsic variability of a microlensed star is
a powerful tool to constrain the nature of the lens by breaking the degeneracy
between the microlens parallax and the blended light. We also present a
statistical test for discriminating the location of the lens based on the
\chi^2 contours of the vector \Lambda, the inverse of the projected velocity.
We find that while SMC self lensing is somewhat favored over halo lensing,
neither location can be ruled out with good confidence.

bursts (GRBs), the decays are rapid, roughly following a power-law in time. It
has been assumed that the afterglow emission in short GRBs is collimated in
jets in the same way as in long GRBs. An achromatic break in a short GRB
afterglow lightcurve would therefore be strong evidence in favour of
collimation in short GRBs. We examine the optical lightcurve of the afterglow
of the short GRB 050709, the only short GRB where a jet break has been claimed
from optical data. We show that (1) the decay follows a single power-law from
1.4 to 19 days after the burst and has a decay index alpha =
1.73_{-0.04}^{+0.11}, (2) that an optical flare at ~10 days is required by the
data, roughly contemporaneous with a flare in the X-ray data, and (3) that
there is no evidence for a break in the lightcurve. This means that so far
there is no direct evidence for collimation in the outflows of short GRBs. The
available limits on the collimation angles in short GRBs now strongly suggest
much wider opening angles than found in long GRBs.

one-dimension across ultraluminous starburst galaxies using interstellar
absorption and emission lines, in Keck II ESI spectra. Blue-shifted absorption
is found along more of the slit than anticipated, exceeding scales of 15 kpc
across several systems. The large velocity gradient measured across some of
these outflows is inconsistent with a flow diverging from the central starburst
-- angular momentum conservation reduces the rotational velocity of an outflow
as it expands. More widespread star formation, likely triggered by the merger,
probably drives these outflows, although some models suggest the collision
itself could generate a wind by shock heating interstellar gas throughout the
disk. Young mergers with separated nuclei present the highest outflow masses,
due mainly to the larger area over which the cool gas can be detected. In a
typical ULIG, the mass carried by the cool phase of the outflow is around
10^8Msun, or a few percent of the total dynamical mass. Assuming the starburst
activity has proceeded at the observed rate for the past 10 Myr, the kinetic
energy of the cool outflows is a few percent of the supernova energy,
consistent with starbursts powering the outflows. The cool wind is expected to
be accelerated by momentum deposition, possibly from radiation pressure as well
as supernovae. Such models imply turn-around radii for the cool outflows of at
least 30 to 90 kpc. This cross-section presents a significant NaI absorption
cross section. If most L > 0.1L* galaxies pass through a luminous starburst
phase, then relics of cool outflows will create a significant redshift-path
density. Galaxy formation models should include this cool phase of the outflow
in addition to a hot wind in feedback models.

to the near-infrared and originates in an outer region of the central accretion

exchange field which is determined by the thicknesses and the exchange fields

each domain with a period inversely proportional to the local exchange field.
While the oscillations have a decreasing amplitude with distance inside the
domain which is attached to the superconductor, they are enhancing in the other
domain and can reach the corresponding normal metal value for a zero effective
exchange field. We also find that the corresponding oscillations in the Fermi
level proximity density of states as a function of the second domain's

the exchange fields induced phases gained by an electron inside the two domains

drivers. We show that BSSN with the coordinate drivers used in recent ""moving
puncture"" binary black hole evolutions is ill-posed at large shifts, and
suggest how to make it strongly hyperbolic for arbitrary shifts. For ADM, NOR
and BSSN with elliptic and parabolic gauge conditions, which cannot be
hyperbolic, we investigate a necessary condition for well-posedness of the

cancels off all contributions to the Higgs mass generated above a scale f.
Radiative corrections induced by the top quark sector lead to a breaking of the
twin sector electroweak symmetry at a scale f ~ TeV. In our sector, below the
scale f, these radiative corrections from the top quark are present but greatly
weakened, naturally allowing a Z boson mass an order of magnitude below f, even
with a top squark mass of order 1 TeV and a messenger scale near the Planck
mass. A sufficient quartic interaction for our Higgs boson arises from the
usual gauge contribution together with a radiative contribution from a heavy
top squark. The mechanism requires the presence of an SU(2)-adjoint superfield,
and can be simply unified. Naturalness in these theories is usually associated
with light winos and sleptons, and is largely independent of the scale of the
colored particles. The assumption of unification naturally predicts the
existence of many exotic fields. The theory often has particles which may be
stable on collider timescales, including an additional color octet superfield.
In the limit that m_SUSY >> f, the mechanism yields a UV completion of the
non-supersymmetric twin Higgs, but with the notable improvement of a tree-level
quartic for the standard model Higgs. In this framework, a successful UV
completion requires the existence of new charged fields well below the scale f.

like an off-shell black hole and evolves toward a large stable black hole. The
off-shell free energy and its derivative ($\beta$-function) are used to show
the off-shell gravity/gauge duality for the process of tachyon condensation.
Further, d=10 Schwarzschild black hole in a cavity is considered for the

A new simplified and revised version of the paper",,,,"math.GM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a new polynomial-time algorithm for linear programming. We further
extend the ideas used in this new linear programming algorithm for nonlinear
programming problems. The new algorithm is based on the idea of treating the
objective function as a parameter. We form a matrix of coefficients, made-up of
the coefficients of the variables defined in the problem itself, and the
coefficients of variables defined newly, for converting inequalities into
equations, namely, slack variables if it is the maximization problem, or,
surplus variables if it is the minimization problem. The system of equations we
use consist of the objective equation and equations obtained from inequalities
defining constraint imposed by the problem. We obtain reduced-row-echelon-form,
R, for this matrix containing only one unknown, namely, the objective function
itself as an unknown parameter, d, say. This matrix in the
reduced-row-echelon-form contains columns (column vectors) corresponding to
basic variables and non-basic variables. If all the entries in the columns
corresponding to non-basic variables in R are already nonnegative then we will
see that we have almost reached to the solution and nothing much is left to be
done. If there are columns corresponding to non-basic variables which contain
some negative entries then we will require to apply suitable row
transformations, at most $m$ in number if there are m rows in R, as we will see
below, to make all the entries in the columns corresponding to non-basic
variables nonnegative. We then proceed to show that the method developed above
for linear programming naturally extends to nonlinear programming problems. For
nonlinear programming problems, we use the technique of Grobner bases, since
Grobner basis is an equivalent of reduced row echelon form for a system of
nonlinear equations.

values in a group $G$. Interpreting a 1--cocycle as a principal bundle, a
connection turns out to be a 1--cochain associated in a suitable way with this
1--cocycle; the curvature of a connection turns out to be its 2--coboundary. We

from the creation and subsequent bifurcation of Poincar\'e heteroclinic cycles.
The problem is central to dynamics: it has to be addressed if, for instance,
one aims at describing the typical orbit behaviour of a typical system, thus
providing a global scenario for the ensemble of dynamical systems - see the
Introduction and [P1, P2]. Here, we shall consider smooth, i.e. $C^\infty$,
one-parameter families of dissipative, meaning non-conservative, surface
diffeomorphisms. An hetereoclinic cycle may appear when the parameter evolves
and an orbit of tangency, say quadratic, is created between stable and unstable
manifolds (lines) of periodic orbits that belong to a basic hyperbolic set. The
key novelty is to allow this basic set, a horseshoe, to have Hausdorff
dimension bigger than one. In the present paper we do assume such a dimension
to be beyond one, but in a limited way, as explicitly indicated in the
Introduction. [A mild non-degeneracy condition on the family of maps is
assumed: at the orbit of tangency the invariant lines, stable and unstable,
cross each other with positive relative speed]. We then prove that most
diffeomorphisms, corresponding to parameter values near the bifurcating one,
are non-uniformly hyperbolic in a neighborhood of the horseshoe and the orbit
of tangency; such diffeomorphisms display no attractors nor repellors in such a
neighborhood. A first precise formulation of our main theorem is at the
Introduction and a more encompassing version at the end of the paper. These
results were announced in [PY3].

a line bundle L on C, we consider the moduli stack of rank 2n vector bundles E
on C endowed with a nowhere degenerate symplectic form $b: E \otimes E \to L$
up to scalars. We prove that this stack is birational to BG_m times an affine
space A^s if n and the degree of L are both odd and C admits a k-rational point
as well as a line bundle of degree 0 whose square is nontrivial. It follows
that the corresponding coarse moduli scheme is rational in this case.

oscillate and then eject low speed fluid away from the wall, has been studied
experimentally, theoretically, and computationally for more than 50 years
because of its importance to the three-dimensional structure of turbulent
boundary layers. We produce five new three-dimensional solutions of turbulent
plane
  Couette flow, one of which is periodic while four others are relative
periodic. Each of these five solutions demonstrates the break-up and
re-formation of near-wall coherent structures.
  Four of our solutions are periodic but with drifts in the streamwise
direction. More surprisingly, two of our solutions are periodic but with drifts
in the spanwise direction, a possibility that does not seem to have been
considered in the literature. We argue that a considerable part of the
streakiness observed experimentally in the near-wall region could be due to
spanwise drifts that accompany the break-up and re-formation of coherent
structures. We also compute a new periodic solution of plane Couette flow that
could be related to transition to turbulence.

best performance when each agent's interaction frequency is linear correlated

more than those with less information, while in the optimal case, each agent
almost has the same average profit. In addition, we investigate the role of
irrational factor and find an interesting symmetrical behavior.

are both members of this class, the latter being the unique minimal rank-one

in fact equivalent to weighted 2-designs in complex projective space. These

tomography.

"quant-ph/0604052","Dmytro Gavinsky","Dmytro Gavinsky","On the Role of Shared Entanglement",,,,,"quant-ph cs.CC",,"  Despite the apparent similarity between shared randomness and shared
entanglement in the context of Communication Complexity, our understanding of
the latter is not as good as of the former. In particular, there is no known
""entanglement analogue"" for the famous theorem by Newman, saying that the
number of shared random bits required for solving any communication problem can
be at most logarithmic in the input length (i.e., using more than O(log n)
shared random bits would not reduce the complexity of an optimal solution).
  In this paper we prove that the same is not true for entanglement. We
establish a wide range of tight (up to a polylogarithmic factor) entanglement
vs. communication tradeoffs for relational problems. The low end is: for any
t>2, reducing shared entanglement from log^t(n) to o(log^{t-2}(n)) qubits can
increase the communication required for solving a problem almost exponentially,
from O(log^t(n)) to \Omega(\sqrt n). The high end is: for any \eps>0, reducing
shared entanglement from n^{1-\eps}log(n) to o(n^{1-\eps}/log(n)) can increase
the required communication from O(n^{1-\eps}log(n)) to
\Omega(n^{1-\eps/2}/log(n)). The upper bounds are demonstrated via protocols
which are exact and work in the \e{simultaneous message passing model}, while
the lower bounds hold for \e{bounded-error protocols}, even in the more
powerful \e{model of 1-way communication}. Our protocols use shared EPR pairs
while the lower bounds apply to any sort of prior entanglement.
  We base the lower bounds on a strong direct product theorem for communication
complexity of a certain class of relational problems. We believe that the
theorem might have applications outside the scope of this work.

can become completely disentangled in a finite time. We study transient
entanglement between two qubits coupled collectively to a multimode vacuum
field and find an unusual feature that the irreversible spontaneous decay can
lead to a revival of the entanglement that has already been destroyed. The
results show that this feature is independent of the coherent dipole-dipole
interaction between the atoms but it depends critically on whether or not the
collective damping is present. We show that the ability of the system to
revival entanglement via spontaneous emission relies on the presence of very
different timescales for the evolution of the populations of the collective
states and coherence between them.
