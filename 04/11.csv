entering the main body of the equatorial circumstellar material, which is
causing a dramatic brightening of the remnant. We recently reported the
observational evidence for this event from our {\it Chandra} data (Park et al.
2005b; P05 hereafter). We present here the temporal evolution of the X-ray
emitting shock parameters and the detailed description of the spectral and
image analysis of SNR 1987A, on which P05 was based. While the remnant becomes
brighter, the softening of the overall X-ray spectrum continues and is enhanced
on around day $\sim$6200 (since the explosion). The two-component shock model
indicates that the electron temperatures have been changing for the last
$\sim$6 yr. The X-ray spectrum is now described by $kT$ $\sim$ 0.3 keV and 2.3
keV thermal plasmas which are believed to characteristically represent the
shock-heated density gradient along the boundary between the H{\small II}
region and the dense inner ring. As the blast wave sweeps through the inner
circumstellar ring shining in X-rays, we expect that the shock parameters
continue to change, revealing the density and abundance structure of the inner
ring. Follow-up {\it Chandra} observations will thus uncover the past history
of the progenitor's stellar evolution. The origin of the relatively faint hard
X-ray emission ($E$ $>$ 3 keV) from SNR 1987A is still unclear (thermal vs.
nonthermal). Considering the continuous brightening of the hard band intensity,
as well as the soft band flux, follow-up monitoring observations will also be
essential to reveal the origin of the hard X-ray emission of SNR 1987A.

invariant, and, on the other hand, halos and voids are recognized as prominent

dark matter distribution as a set of fractal distributions of halos of
different kinds. This model relies on the concept of multifractal as the most
general scaling distribution and on a plausible notion of halo as a singular
mass concentration in a multifractal. Voids arise as complementary to halos,
namely, as formed by regular mass depletions. To provide halos with definite
size and masses, we coarse-grain the dark matter distribution, using the length
given by the lower cutoff to scaling. This allows us to relate the halo mass
function to the multifractal spectrum. Hence, we find that a log-normal model
of the mass distribution nicely fits in this picture and, moreover, the
Press-Schechter mass function can be recovered as a bifractal limit.
  To support our model of fractal distributions of halos, we perform a
numerical study of the distribution produced in cosmological N-body
simulations. In the Virgo L-CDM GIF2 simulation, we indeed find fractal
distributions of halos with various dimensions and a halo mass function of
bifractal type. However, this mass function is not of Press-Schechter's type,
and we interprete it instead as caused by the undersampling of the distribution
at the scale of halos, due to discretization.

the H+ region and PDR. We consider a wide range of physical conditions in the

estimate the fraction of galaxies that are misclassified as stars due to their
compactness. We have spectroscopically identified all objects to B_MGC = 20 mag

data we develop a model of the high surface brightness incompleteness and
estimate that ~1 per cent of galaxies with B_MGC < 20 mag are misclassified as
stars, with an upper limit of 2.3 per cent at 95 per cent confidence. However,
since the missing galaxies are preferentially sub-L* their effect on the faint
end of the luminosity function is substantially amplified: we find that they
contribute ~6 per cent to the total luminosity function in the range -17 < M_B
< -14 mag, which raises the faint end slope alpha by 0.03^{+0.02}_{-0.01}.
Their contribution to the total B-band luminosity density is ~2 per cent.
Roughly half of the missing galaxies have already been recovered through
spectroscopy of morphologically stellar targets selected mainly by colour. We
find that the missing galaxies mostly consist of intrinsically small, blue,
star-forming, sub-L* objects. In combination with the recent results of Driver
et al. (2005) we have now demonstrated that the MGC is free from both high and
low surface brightness selection bias for giant galaxies (M_B <~ -17 mag).

identified by applying unsharp masks to a combined image from three bands (g,
r, i), as well as by subtracting the axisymmetric light distribution of each
galaxy from that image. 14 objects are unambiguous identifications of disks, 10
objects show 'probable disk' features, and 17 objects show 'possible disk'
features. The number fraction of these galaxies, for which we introduce the
term dEdi, reaches more than 50% at the bright end of the dE population, and
decreases to less than 5% for magnitudes B>16. The luminosity function of our
full dE sample can be explained by a superposition of dEdis and ordinary dEs,
strongly suggesting that dEdis are a distinct type of galaxy. This is supported
by the projected spatial distribution: dEdis show basically no clustering and
roughly follow the spatial distribution of spirals and irregulars, whereas
ordinary dEs are distributed similarly to the strongly clustered E/S0 galaxies.
While the flattening distribution of ordinary dEs is typical for spheroidal
objects, the distribution of dEdis is significantly different and agrees with
their being flat oblate objects. We therefore conclude that the dEdis are not
spheroidal galaxies that just have an embedded disk component, but are instead
a population of genuine disk galaxies. Several dEdis display well-defined
spiral arms with grand design features that clearly differ from the flocculent,
open arms typical for late-type spirals that have frequently been proposed as
progenitors of early-type dwarfs. This raises the question of what process is
able to create such spiral arms - with pitch angles like those of Sab/Sb
galaxies - in bulgeless dwarf galaxies. (Abridged)

redshift space. The model is constructed within the framework of the Halo
Occupation Distribution (HOD), which quantifies galaxy bias on linear and non-
linear scales. We model one-halo pairwise velocities by assuming that satellite
galaxy velocities follow a Gaussian distribution with dispersion proportional
to the virial dispersion of the host halo. Two-halo velocity statistics are a
combination of virial motions and host halo motions. The velocity distribution
function (DF) of halo pairs is a complex function with skewness and kurtosis
that vary substantially with scale. Using a series of collisionless N-body
simulations, we demonstrate that the shape of this DF is determined primarily
by the distribution of local densities around a halo pair, and at fixed density
the velocity DF is close to Gaussian and nearly independent of halo mass. We
calibrate a model for the conditional probability function of densities around
halo pairs on these simulations. With this model, the full shape of the halo
velocity DF can be accurately calculated as a function of halo mass, radial
separation, angle, and cosmology. The HOD approach to redshift-space
distortions utilizes clustering data from linear to non-linear scales to break
the standard degeneracies inherent in previous models of redshift-space
clustering. The parameters of the occupation function are well constrained by
real-space clustering alone, separating constraints on bias and cosmology. We
demonstrate the ability of the model to separately constrain Omega_m, sigma_8,
and galaxy velocity bias in models that are constructed to have the same value
of beta at large scales as well as the same finger-of-god distortions at small

demonstrate that this clustering significantly boosts the impact of feedback
processes operating at high redshift. We build a semi-analytical model to
include feedback and clustering simultaneously, and apply this model to the
suppression of star-formation in minihalos due to photoionization. The model is
built on the excursion-set-based formalism of Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga and
Hernquist (2004), which incorporates the clustering of ionizing sources, and
which we here extend to include suppression of star formation in minihalos. We
find that clustering increases the mean HII bubble size by a factor of several,
and it dramatically increases the fraction of minihalos that are suppressed, by
a factor of up to 60 relative to a randomly distributed population. This
enhanced suppression can significantly reduce the electron scattering optical
depth, as required by the three-year data from the Wilkinson Microwave

analysis of the continuum shapes and a comparison of the Seyfert types. We find
that the spectra clearly divide into groups based on their continuum shapes and
spectral features. Some spectral features are clearly related to a starburst
contribution to the IR spectrum, while the mechanisms producing observed
power-law continuum shapes, attributed to an AGN component, may be dust or
non-thermal emission. The infrared spectral types appear to be related to the
Seyfert types. Principal component analysis results suggest that the relative
contribution of starburst emission may be the dominant cause of variance in the
observed spectra. We find that Sy 1's have higher ratios of IR/radio emission
than Sy 2's, as predicted by the unified model if the torus is optically thick

medium (IGM) through the so-called 21 cm forest in spectra of bright
high-redshift radio sources. We first compute the evolution of the mean optical
depth for models that include X-ray heating of the IGM gas, Wouthuysen-Field
coupling, and reionization. Under most circumstances, the spin temperature T_S
grows large well before reionization begins in earnest. As a result, the
optical depth is less than 0.001 throughout most of reionization, and
background sources must sit well beyond the reionization surface in order to
experience measurable absorption. HII regions produce relatively large
""transmission gaps"" and may therefore still be observable during the early
stages of reionization. Absorption from sheets and filaments in the cosmic web
fades once T_S becomes large and should be rare during reionization. Minihalos
can produce strong (albeit narrow) absorption features. Measuring their
abundance would yield useful limits on the strength of feedback processes in
the IGM as well as their effect on reionization.

that there is no self-similar black hole solution surrounded by an exact or

This result also applies for a scalar field with a potential, providing the
universe is decelerating. However, if there is a potential and the universe is
accelerating (as in the quintessence scenario), the result only applies for an
exact Friedmann background. This extends the result previously found in the
stiff fluid case and strongly suggests that accretion onto primordial black

our phenomenological models for the bispectrum in redshift space. Comparison
with simulations shows that our toy models are very successful in modeling
bispectrum of equilateral and isosceles triangles at large scales. In the
second part we compare the monopole of the power spectrum and bispectrum in the
radial and plane-parallel distortion to test the plane-parallel approximation.
We confirm the results of Scoccimarro (2000) that difference of power spectrum
is at the level of 10%, in the reduced bispectrum such difference is as small
as a few percents. However, on the plane perpendicular to the line of sight of
k_z=0, the difference in power spectrum between the radial and plane-parallel
approximation can be more than 10%, and even worse on very small scales. Such
difference is prominent for bispectrum, especially for those configurations of
tilted triangles. The non-Gaussian signals under radial distortion on small
scales are systematically biased downside than that in plane-parallel
approximation, while amplitudes of differences depend on the opening angle of
the sample to the observer. The observation gives warning to the practice of
using the power spectrum and bispectrum measured on the k_z=0 plane as

  Methods: Using a sample of bright stars observed with the HARPS spectrograph,
we examine the shapes of the bisectors of individual strong spectral lines in
summed spectra, comparing with similar studies in the literature. Moreover, we
examine four different quantitative CCF bisector measures for correlations with
radial velocity and stellar parameters.
  Results: We show that CCF bisector measures can be used for quantitative
analysis, employing both the absolute values and the variations. From absolute
values, log g and absolute magnitude can be approximated, and from the
correlations with radial velocity one can distinguish between magnetic
activity, oscillations and orbiting planets as the probable cause of radial
velocity variations. We confirm that different isolated spectral lines show
different bisector shapes, even between lines of the same element, calling for
caution in trying to derive global stellar properties from the bisector of a
CCF. For the active star HR 1362 we suggest from the bisector shape an extra
photospheric heating caused by the chromosphere of several hundred degrees. We

(within the so-called ""multiverse"") where the vacuum energy density takes
different values, has been postulated as an explanation for the low non-zero
value observed for it in our Universe. It is often argued that our existence
pre-selects regions where the cosmological constant is sufficiently small to
allow galaxies like the Milky Way to form and intelligent life to emerge. Here
we propose a simple empirical test for this anthropic argument within the
boundaries of the observable Universe. We make use of the fact that dwarf
galaxies formed in our Universe at redshifts as high as z~10 when the mean
matter density was larger by a factor of ~10^3 than today. Existing technology
enables to check whether planets form in nearby dwarf galaxies and globular
clusters by searching for microlensing or transit events of background stars.
The oldest of these nearby systems may have formed at z~10. If planets are as
common per stellar mass in these descendents as they are in the Milky Way
galaxy, then the anthropic argument would be weakened considerably since
planets could have formed in our Universe even if the cosmological constant was
three orders of magnitude larger than observed. For a flat probability
distribution, this would imply that the probability for us to reside in a
region where the cosmological constant obtains its observed value is lower than
\~10^{-3}. A precise version of the anthropic argument could then be ruled-out
at a confidence level of ~99.9%, which constitutes a satisfactory measure of a
good experimental test.

significantly increasing the known low mass cluster population by about 100
objects. Among the sources without counterpart, ~50% are likely members,
several of which we expect to be previously unknown protostellar objects. We
confirm several previous findings on the X-ray activity of low mass PMS stars:
X-ray luminosity is related to stellar mass, although with a large scatter;
L_X/L_bol is close to but almost invariably below the saturation level, 1e-3. A
comparison between CTTS and WTTS shows several differences: CTTS are on average
less active than WTTS; their emission may also be more time variable and is on
average slightly harder. However, we find evidence in some CTTS of extremely
cool, ~0.1-0.2 keV, plasma which we speculate is heated by accretion shocks. We
conclude that activity in low mass PMS stars, while generally similar to that
of saturated MS stars, may be affected by mass accretion in several ways:
accretion is likely responsible for very soft X-ray emission directly produced
in the accretion shock; it may reduce the average energy output of solar-like
coronae, at the same time making them hotter and more dynamic.

Hamiltonian of the transverse waves contains an additional term of the phonon
spin-orbit interaction arising from the Berry gauge potential in the momentum

waves and corresponds to the field of two `magnetic monopoles' of opposite
signs for phonons of opposite helicities. This leads to the appearance of the
Berry phase in the equation for the polarization evolution and an additional
``anomalous velocity'' term in the ray equations. The anomalous velocity has
the form of the `Lorentz force' caused by the Berry gauge field in momentum
space and gives rise to the transverse transport of waves of opposite
helicities in opposite directions. This is a manifestation of the spin Hall
effect of optical phonons. The effect directly relates to the conservation of
total angular momentum of phonons and also influences reflection from a sharp

spin-1/2. In a certain parameter range of the general model, which is formally
defined in D dimensions, we obtain the exact ground state(s) in the presence of
an external magnetic field for arbitrary values of spin. In this range, the
magnetization remains a constant as a function of the external field, except at
some special values of the field where there is a jump from one plateau to the
next. The plateaus are formed at certain specific fractions of the full
magnetization which are determined by the spin and the lattice. Our general
spin-S result reproduces the known cases for spin-1/2 in various lattices.
Furthermore, we argue that outside the exact regime, the mechanism for the
plateau formation is different. This results in first order phase transitions
along some of the plateaus as the coupling constant is varied. We rigorously
show the existence of such transitions for some particular cases. Finally, we
numerically analyze a spin-1 model in one dimension using exact diagonalization
to obtain its complete phase diagram. It agrees with our analytic results.

dependence of the phonon mean free path on temperature $\it{l}_{\rm ph}\propto

processes which limit phonon free path at high temepratures. For phonons with

connectivity} of short bonds among the surface atoms as well as between core
and surface atoms with inhomogeneous strength in the ground state geometry,
which affects its finite--temperature behavior. By employing {\it ab initio}
density--functional molecular dynamics, we show that this leads to two distinct
features in specific heat curve compared to that of Na$_{55}$: (1) The peak is
shifted by about 100 K higher in temperature. (2) The transition region becomes
much broader than Na$_{55}$. The inhomogeneous distribution of bond strengths
results in a broad melting transition and the strongly connected network of
short bonds leads to the highest melting temperature of 375 K reported among
the sodium clusters. Na$_{57}$, which has one electron less than Na$_{58}$,
also possesses stronger short--bond network compared with Na$_{55}$, resulting
in higher melting temperature (350 K) than observed in Na$_{55}$. Thus, we
conclude that when a cluster has nearly closed shell structure not only
geometrically but also electronically, it show a high melting temperature. Our
calculations clearly bring out the size--sensitive nature of the specific heat
curve in sodium clusters.

acquires non-local terms associated with the trace anomaly, generated by the
quantum fluctuations of massless fields. The local auxiliary field description
of this effective action in four dimensions requires two additional scalar
fields, not contained in classical general relativity, which remain relevant at
macroscopic distance scales. The auxiliary scalar fields depend upon boundary
conditions for their complete specification, and therefore carry global
information about the geometry and macroscopic quantum state of the
gravitational field. The scalar potentials also provide coordinate invariant
order parameters describing the conformal behavior and divergences of the
stress tensor on event horizons. We compute the stress tensor due to the
anomaly in terms of its auxiliary scalar potentials in a number of concrete
examples, including the Rindler wedge, the Schwarzschild geometry, and de
Sitter spacetime. In all of these cases, a small number of classical order
parameters completely determine the divergent behaviors allowed on the horizon,
and yield qualitatively correct global approximations to the renormalized
expectation value of the quantum stress tensor.

any particular model for the dipole-proton cross section and allows one to test
the validity of the assumptions leading to the dipole picture in particular at
low photon virtualities. We conclude that the naive dipole model formula should

generalized light-cones, defined by a quartic norm, invariant and have maximal
rank subgroups of the form H X SL(2,R) such that G/H X SL(2,R) are
para-quaternionic symmetric spaces. We give a unified formulation of the
minimal unitary representations of simple non-compact groups of type A_2, G_2,
D_4, F_4, E_6, E_7, E_8 and Sp(2n,R). The minimal UIRs of Sp(2n,R) are simply
the singleton representations and correspond to a degenerate limit of the
unified construction. The minimal unitary representations of the other
noncompact groups SU(m,n), SO(m,n), SO*(2n) and SL(m,R) are also given
explicitly.
  We extend our formalism to define and construct the corresponding minimal
representations of non-compact supergroups G whose even subgroups are of the
form H X SL(2,R). If H is noncompact then the supergroup G does not admit any
unitary representations, in general. The unified construction with H simple or
Abelian leads to the minimal representations of G(3), F(4) and OSp(n|2,R) (in
the degenerate limit). The minimal unitary representations of OSp(n|2,R) with
the even subgroup SO(n) X SL(2,R) are the singleton representations. We also
give the minimal realization of one parameter family of Lie superalgebras
D(2,1;\sigma).

the variational method, and adiabatic hypothesis. As an application we

  Minsk. 2005. P. 118-133",,,"hep-th",,"  Two known, alternative to each other, forms of the Maxwell's electromagnetic
equations in a moving uniform media are investigated and discussed. Approach
commonly used after Minkowski is based on the two tensors:
  H^{ab} = (D, H /c) and F^{ab} = (E, cB) which transform independently of each
other at Lorentz transitions; relationships between fields change their form at
Lorentz transformations and have the form of the Minkowski equations depending
on the 4-velocity u^{a} of the moving media under an inertial reference frame.
So, the electrodynamics by Minkowski implies the absolute nature of the
mechanical motion. An alternative formalism (Rosen and others) may be developed
in the new variables. This form of the the Maxwell's equations exhibits
symmetry under modified Lorentz transformations in which everywhere instead of
the vacuum speed of light c is used the speed of light in the media, kc . In
virtue of this symmetry we might consider such a formulation of the Maxwell
theory in the media as invariant under the mechanical motion of the reference
frame.In connection with these two theoretical schemes, a point of principle
must be stressed: it might seem well-taken the requirement to perform
Poincare-Einstein clock synchronization in the uniform medias with the help of
real light signals influenced by the media, which leads us to the modified
Lorentz symmetry.

billiard is the motion of a particle when the field of force is absent.
Trajectories of such a motion are geodesics inside the domain; and the particle
reflects from the boundary making the angle of incidence equal the angle of
reflection.
  The billiard motion can happen to be a closed (or periodic) one when the
billiard ball rebounds k times and then gets to the initial position with the
same speed vector as in the beginning. The study of closed billiard
trajectories is due to George Birkhoff who in 1927 proved a lower estimate for
the number of closed billiard trajectories of a certain period k.
  We consider the most general case when the billiard ball reflects from an
arbitrary submanifold of a Euclidean space. We prove Morse inequalities in this
situation and apply them to find a lower estimate for the number of closed
billiard trajectories of any prime period in terms of Betti numbers of the

the unit circle ${\mathbb S}^1$ into $G$, of a suitable class. A differentiable
map $F$ from a manifold $M$ into $\Lambda G$, is said to be of \emph{connection
order $(_a^b)$} if the Fourier expansion in the loop parameter $\lambda$ of the
${\mathbb S}^1$-family of Maurer-Cartan forms for $F$, namely $F_\lambda^{-1}
\dd F_\lambda$, is of the form $\sum_{i=a}^b \alpha_i \lambda^i$. Most
integrable systems in geometry are associated to such a map. Roughly speaking,
the DPW method used a Birkhoff type splitting to reduce a harmonic map into a
symmetric space, which can be represented by a certain order $(_{-1}^1)$ map,
into a pair of simpler maps of order $(_{-1}^{-1})$ and $(_1^1)$ respectively.
Conversely, one could construct such a harmonic map from any pair of
$(_{-1}^{-1})$ and $(_1^1)$ maps. This allowed a Weierstrass type description
of harmonic maps into symmetric spaces. We extend this method to show that, for
a large class of loop groups, a connection order $(_a^b)$ map, for $a<0<b$,
splits uniquely into a pair of $(_a^{-1})$ and $(_1^b)$ maps. As an
application, we show that constant non-zero curvature submanifolds with flat
normal bundle of a sphere or hyperbolic space split into pairs of flat
submanifolds, reducing the problem (at least locally) to the flat case. To
extend the DPW method sufficiently to handle this problem requires a more
general Iwasawa type splitting of the loop group, which we prove always holds
at least locally.

dynamics is defined by dividing the state space into a small number of regions
(typically 2), and considering the relative frequencies of the transitions

the coupled dynamics can be classified into three different phases based on the
synchronization of the variables and the homogeneity of the symbolic dynamics.
Of particular interest is the {\it homogeneous unsynchronized phase} where the
coupled dynamics is in a chaotic unsynchronized state, but exhibits (almost)
identical symbolic dynamics at all the nodes in the network. We refer to this
dynamical behaviour as {\it symbolic synchronization}. In this phase, the local
symbolic dynamics of any arbitrarily selected node reflects global properties
of the coupled dynamics, such as qualitative behaviour of the largest Lyapunov
exponent and phase synchronization. This phase depends mainly on the network
architecture, and only to a smaller extent on the local chaotic dynamical
function. We present results for two model dynamics, iterations of the
one-dimensional logistic map and the two-dimensional H\'enon map, as local
dynamical function.
