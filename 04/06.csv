of opposite-polarity magnetic fields within their polar regions. To explain
these observations, models describing the surface transport of magnetic flux
demand the presence of fast meridional flows. Here, we link sub-surface and
surface magnetic flux transport simulations to investigate (i) the impact of
meridional circulations with peak velocities of <125m/s on the latitudinal
eruption pattern of magnetic flux tubes and (ii) the influence of the resulting
butterfly diagrams on polar magnetic field properties. Prior to their eruption,
magnetic flux tubes with low field strengths and initial cross sections below
about 300km experience an enhanced poleward deflection through meridional
flows. In particular flux tubes which originate between low and intermediate
latitudes within the convective overshoot region are strongly affected. This
latitude-dependent poleward deflection of erupting magnetic flux renders the
wings of stellar butterfly diagrams distinctively convex. The subsequent
evolution of the surface magnetic field shows that the increased number of
newly emerging bipoles at higher latitudes promotes the intermingling of
opposite polarities of polar magnetic fields. The associated magnetic flux
densities are about 20% higher than in the case disregarding the pre-eruptive
deflection, which eases the necessity for fast meridional flows predicted by
previous investigations. In order to reproduce the observed polar field
properties, the rate of the meridional circulation has to be on the order of
100m/s, and the latitudinal range from which magnetic flux tubes originate at
the base of the convective zone (<50degrees) must be larger than in the solar
case (<35degrees).

from Giant Radio Halos (GRHs), synchrotron radio sources extended over Mpc
scales, detected in a growing number of massive galaxy clusters. A promising
possibility to explain these sources is given by ""in situ"" stochastic
reacceleration of relativistic electrons by turbulence generated in the cluster
volume during merger events. Cassano & Brunetti (2005) have recently shown that
the expected fraction of clusters with GRHs and the increase of such a fraction
with cluster mass can be reconciled with present observations provided that a
fraction of 20-30 % of the turbulence in clusters is in the form of
compressible modes. In this work we extend these calculations by including a
scaling of the magnetic field strength with cluster mass. We show that the
observed correlations between the synchrotron radio power of a sample of 17
GRHs and the X-ray properties of the hosting clusters are consistent with, and
actually predicted by a magnetic field dependence on the virial mass of the
form B \propto M^b, with b>0.5 and typical micro Gauss strengths of the average
B intensity. The occurrence of GRHs as a function of both cluster mass and
redshift is obtained. The most relevant findings are that the predicted
luminosity functions of GRHs are peaked around a power P_{1.4 GHz} 10^{24}
W/Hz, and severely cut-off at low radio powers due to the decrease of the
electron reacceleration in smaller galaxy clusters. We expect a total number of
GRHs to be discovered at ~mJy radio fluxes of ~100 at 1.4 GHz. Finally, the
occurrence of GRHs and their number counts at 150 MHz are estimated in view of
the fortcoming operation of low frequency observatories (LOFAR, LWA) and
compared with those at higher radio frequencies.

arise from the same outflow then, in the framework of the standard forward
shock model, the chromaticity of the X-ray light-curve breaks indicates that
they do not arise solely from a mechanism related to the outflow dynamics (e.g.
energy injection) or the angular distribution of the blast-wave kinetic energy
(structured outflows or jets). The lack of a spectral evolution accompanying
the X-ray light-curve breaks shows that these breaks do not arise from the
passage of a spectral break (e.g. the cooling frequency) either. Under these
circumstances, the decoupling of the X-ray and optical decays requires that the
microphysical parameters for the electron and magnetic energies in the forward
shock evolve in time, whether the X-ray afterglow is synchrotron or
inverse-Compton emission. For a steady evolution of these parameters with the
Lorentz factor of the forward shock and an X-ray light-curve break arising from
cessation of energy injection into the blast-wave, the optical and X-ray
properties of the above six Swift afterglows require a circumburst medium with
a r^{-2} radial stratification, as expected for a massive star origin for long
GRBs. Alternatively, the chromatic X-ray light-curve breaks may indicate that
the optical and X-ray emissions arise from different outflows. Neither feature
(evolution of microphysical parameters or the different origin of the optical
and X-ray emissions) were clearly required by pre-Swift afterglows.

wave into an especially dense circumstellar medium. In this paper, we describe
a recent observation of SN1988Z using the ACIS detector on Chandra. We readily
detect SN1988Z, obtaining ~30 net counts which corresponds to a 0.2-2 keV
luminosity of ~3.2x10^39 erg s^-1. The calculated quantiles for the extracted

constant mass loss stellar wind during the ~5000 years before the explosion. If
the circumstellar medium is due to progenitor mass loss, then the mass loss

idealized collapse models of individual galaxies, our cosmological simulations
of the standard Lambda-CDM cosmology show a peak of the cosmic star formation
rate at z~4, with ~10% of the baryons turning into stars. We find that the
majority of stars in present-day massive galaxies formed in much smaller
galaxies at high redshifts, giving them a mean stellar age as old as 10 Gyr,
despite their late assembly times. The hypernova feedback drives galactic
outflows efficiently in low mass galaxies, and these winds eject heavy elements
into the intergalactic medium. The ejected baryon fraction is larger for less
massive galaxies, correlates well with stellar metallicity, and amounts to ~20%
of all baryons in total. The resulting enrichment history is broadly consistent
with the observed abundances of Lyman break galaxies, of damped Lyman alpha
systems, and of the intergalactic medium. The metallicity of the cold gas in
galaxies increases with galaxy mass, which is comparable to observations with a
significant scatter. The stellar mass-metallicity relation of the observed
galaxy population is well reproduced by the simulation model as a result of
mass-dependent galactic winds. However, star formation does not terminate in
massive galaxies at late times in our model, and too few dwarf galaxies are
still forming stars. These problems may be due to a lack of resolution, to
inappropriate modelling of supernova feedback, or to a neglect of other
feedback processes such as active galactic nuclei.

can efficiently generate images of the emerging radiation at arbitrary points

Monte-Carlo codes, Sunrise is capable of propagating a range of wavelengths
simultaneously. This ``polychromatic'' algorithm gives significant improvements
in efficiency and accuracy when spectral features are calculated. Sunrise is
used to study the effects of dust in hydrodynamic simulations of interacting

significant lopsidedness in HI. The mean value of $A_1$ in the inner regions of

twice the average value seen in the field galaxies. Also, the lopsidedness is

increases with the radius as demonstrated in earlier studies, but over a radial
range that is two timeslarger than done in the previous studies. The average
lopsidedness of the halo potential is estimated to be $\sim 10$%, assuming that
the lopsidedness in HI disc is due to its response to the halo asymmetry.

synchrotron, collisional, and inverse Compton losses because they are not
consistent with observational constraints, and we propose that the fading of
the emission is due to the leakage of electrons themselves at each reflection
between the two mirror points of the magnetic structure partially trapping
them. The magnetic structure compatible with both our leakage model and
previous observations is that of a helmet streamer that, as in the solar case,
can occur at the top of the X-ray-emitting, stellar-sized coronal loops of one
of the stars. The streamer may extend up to 20 R and interact with the corona
of the other star at periastron passage, causing recurring flares. The inferred
magnetic field strength at the two mirror points of the helmet streamer is in
the range 0.12 - 125 G, and the corresponding Lorentz factor, gamma, of the
partially trapped electrons is in the range 20 < gamma < 632. We therefore rule
out that the emission could be of gyro-synchrotron nature: the derived high
Lorentz factor proves that the nature of the emission at 90 GHz from this
pre-main binary system is synchrotron radiation.

order 10^{24}-10^{25}cm^{-2} and that it is geometrically thick, in agreement
with the standard `molecular torus' scenario. We discuss which heating
processes may be responsible for maintaining the vertical height of the torus.
We have also resolved the nuclear stellar distribution, and find that within a
few parsecs of the AGN there has been an intense starburst, the most recent
episode of which began ~40Myr ago but has now ceased. The current luminosity of
stars within 30pc of the AGN, ~3x10^9L_sun, is comparable to that of the AGN.
Based on a comparison of the respective size scales, we argue that the star
formation has been occuring in the obscuring torus. Finally, we present the
first derivation of a black hole mass in a Seyfert 1 nucleus from stellar
dynamics which marginally spatially resolve the black hole's sphere of
influence. We apply Schwarzschild orbit superposition models to our full

attention to the input parameters which are often uncertain: the contribution
of the large scale bulge and its mass-to-light ratio; the recent star formation
in the nucleus and its mass-to-light ratio; the contribution of the gas mass to
the potential; and the inclination. Our models yield a 1sigma range for the

density of neutralinos as dark matter in the Universe. The first one is the
usual ``abundance'' criterion which is used to calculate the relic density
after the ``freeze-out'' era. To compute the relic density we used the
numerical public code micrOMEGAs. The second criterion applies the
microcanonical definition of entropy to a weakly interacting and
self-gravitating gas evaluating then the change in the entropy per particle of
this gas between the ``freeze-out'' era and present day virialized structures.
An ``entropy-consistency'' criterion emerges by comparing theoretical and
empirical estimates of this entropy. The main objective of our work is to
determine for which regions of the parameter space in the mSUGRA model are both
criteria consistent with the 2$\sigma$ bounds according to WMAP for the relic
density: $0.0945<\Omega_{CDM}h^2<0.1287$. As a first result, we found that for

component whose equation of state parameter w_eff is taken to be independent of
redshift. Throughout most of the paper we do not allow any massive neutrino
contribution and also the influence of the gravitational waves on the CMB is
taken to be negligible. The analysis is carried out separately for two cases:
(i) using the acoustic scale measurements as presented in H\""utsi (2006), (ii)

the parameters and allows us to determine the low redshift expansion law with

difficulty achieving the necessary high rotation rate. Models that do provide
the necessary angular momentum are discussed, with emphasis on a new single
star model whose rapid rotation leads to complete mixing on the main sequence
and avoids red giant formation. This channel of progenitor evolution also gives
a broader range of masses than previous models, and allows the copious
production of bursts outside of binaries and at high redshifts. However, even
the production of a bare helium core rotating nearly at break up is not, by
itself, a sufficient condition to make a gamma-ray burst. Wolf-Rayet mass loss
must be low, and will be low in regions of low metallicity. This suggests that
bursts at high redshift (low metallicity) will, on the average, be more
energetic, have more time structure, and last longer than bursts nearby. Every
burst consists of three components: a polar jet (~0.1 radian), high energy,
subrelativistic mass ejection (~1 radian), and low velocity equatorial mass
that can fall back after the initial explosion. The relative proportions of
these three components can give a diverse assortment of supernovae and high

galaxies. At lower redshift, even small bursts cause a significant blueing of
their intrinsically redder galaxies. While the burst phase is generally short,
typically a few hundred Myr in normal-mass galaxies, the postburst stage with
its red colors and, in particular the very red ones for early bursts at high
redshift, is much longer, of the order of several Gyr. Even without any dust,
which in the postburst stage is not expected to play an important role anyway,
models easily reach the colors of EROs in the redshift range z=2 through z=0.5
after starbursts at redshifts between 2 and 4. We therefore propose a third
alternative for the ERO galaxies beyond the two established ones of passive
galaxies vs. dusty starbursts: the dust-free post-(strong-)starbursts. A very
first comparison of our models to HDF data with photometric redshifts shows
that almost all of the outliers that could not be described with our chemically
consistent models for undisturbed normal galaxy types E through Sd can now be
explained very well. Galaxies in the redshift range from z=2.5 to z=0.5 that
are redder, and in some cases much redder, than our reddest undisturbed model
for a high-metallicity classical elliptical are well described by
post-starburst models after starbursts at redshifts between 2 and 4. Galaxies
bluer than our bluest low metallicity Sd model, most of which have redshifts
lower than 1, are well explained by ongoing starbursts.

find alternative criteria that can track fundamental changes in the internal

generally accompanied by non-analyticities of the von Neumann (entanglement)
entropy. In particular, the entropy is non-analytic at the Anderson transition,

constants can become time-consuming for systems with large potential energy
barriers. In the present contribution we analyse several different approaches
to this problem. First, we show how the original rate constant prescription
within the discrete path sampling approach can be rewritten in terms of
committor probabilities. Two alternative formulations are then derived in which
the steady-state assumption for intervening minima is removed, providing both a
more accurate kinetic analysis, and a measure of whether a two-state
description is appropriate. The first approach involves running additional
short kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) trajectories, which are used to calculate
waiting times. Here we introduce `leapfrog' moves to second-neighbour minima,
which prevent the KMC trajectory oscillating between structures separated by
low barriers. In the second approach we successively remove minima from the
intervening set, renormalising the branching probabilities and waiting times to
preserve the mean first-passage times of interest. Regrouping the local minima
appropriately is also shown to speed up the kinetic analysis dramatically at
low temperatures. Applications are described where rates are extracted for
databases containing tens of thousands of stationary points, with effective
barriers that are several hundred times kT.

consequence of large size disparity, big and small particles exhibit very
different relaxation times. As previously reported for simple models of
short-ranged attractive colloids and polymer blends, several anomalous dynamic
features are observed: i) sublinear behavior for mean squared displacements,
ii) concave-to-convex crossover for density-density correlators, by varying
temperature or wavevector, iii) logarithmic decay for specific wavevectors of
density-density correlators. These anomalous features are observed over time
intervals extending up to four decades, and strongly resemble predictions of
the Mode Coupling Theory (MCT) for state points close to higher-order MCT
transitions, which originate from the competition between different mechanisms
for dynamic arrest. For the big particles we suggest competition between
soft-sphere repulsion and depletion effects induced by neighboring small
particles. For the small particles we suggest competition between bulk-like
dynamics and confinement, respectively induced by neighboring small particles
and by the slow matrix of big particles. By increasing the size disparity, a
new relaxation scenario arises for the small particles. Self-correlators decay
to zero at temperatures where density-density correlations are frozen. The
behavior of the latters resembles features characteristic of type-A MCT
transitions, defined by a zero value of the critical non-ergodicity parameter.

in a diffusive ferromagnetic contact between two superconductors. In contrast
to the cases of the fully transparent and the low-transparency interfaces, the
current-phase relation is shown to be nonsinusoidal for a finite transparency.
It is demonstrated that even for the nearly fully transparent interfaces the
small corrections due to weak interfacial disorders contribute a small
second-harmonic component in the current-phase relation. For a certain
thicknesses of the ferromagnetic contact and the exchange field this can lead
to a tiny minimum supercurrent at the crossover between 0 and $\pi$ states of
the junction. Our theory has a satisfactory agreement with the recent
experiments in which a finite supercurrent was observed at the transition
temperature. We further explain the possibility for observation of a large
residual supercurrent if the interfaces have an intermediate transparency.

estimate the distribution of classifications, instead of the sole minimal k-way

to all energy functions used for semi-supervised learning. The method is based
on sampling using a Multicanonical Markov chain Monte-Carlo algorithm, and has
a straightforward probabilistic interpretation, which allows for soft
assignments of points to classes, and also to cope with yet unseen class types.
The suggested approach is demonstrated on a toy data set and on two real-life

such algorithms generally assume that the cost per decision is uniform and thus

another cost otherwise. In practice, neither assumption is accurate for
software optimized for today's microprocessors. Such software generally has one
cost for the more likely decision outcome and a greater cost -- often far
greater -- for the less likely decision outcome. This problem and
generalizations thereof are thus applicable to hard coding static decision tree
instances in software, e.g., for optimizing program bottlenecks or for

Seeking to increase the value and reliability of our inference results, we then
focus on validation of inferred AS relationships. We perform a survey with ASs'
network administrators to collect information on the actual connectivity and
policies of the surveyed ASs. Based on the survey results, we find that our new
AS relationship inference techniques achieve high levels of accuracy: we
correctly infer 96.5% customer to provider (c2p), 82.8% peer to peer (p2p), and
90.3% sibling to sibling (s2s) relationships. We then cross-compare the
reported AS connectivity with the AS connectivity data contained in BGP tables.
We find that BGP tables miss up to 86.2% of the true adjacencies of the
surveyed ASs. The majority of the missing links are of the p2p type, which
highlights the limitations of present measuring techniques to capture links of
this type. Finally, to make our results easily accessible and practically
useful for the community, we open an AS relationship repository where we
archive, on a weekly basis, and make publicly available the complete Internet

scale wireless ad-hoc network (WANET), a quantity we call network latency. A
large network latency affects all aspects of data communication in a WANET,
including an increase in delay, packet loss, required processing power and
memory. We consider network management and data routing challenges in WANETs
with scalable network latency. On the physical side, reducing network latency
imposes a significantly higher power and bandwidth demand on nodes, as is
reflected in a set of new bounds. On the protocol front, designing distributed
routing protocols that can guarantee the delivery of data packets within
scalable number of hops is a challenging task. To solve this, we introduce
multi-resolution randomized hierarchy (MRRH), a novel power and bandwidth
efficient WANET protocol with scalable network latency. MRRH uses a randomized
algorithm for building and maintaining a random hierarchical network topology,
which together with the proposed routing algorithm can guarantee efficient
delivery of data packets in the wireless network. For a network of size $N$,
MRRH can provide an average latency of only $O(\log^{3} N)$. The power and
bandwidth consumption of MRRH are shown to be \emph{nearly} optimal for the
latency it provides. Therefore, MRRH, is a provably efficient candidate for
truly large scale wireless ad-hoc networking.

self-intersection, and which families of planar shapes guarantee universal
foldability, where every chain is guaranteed to have a connected configuration

only line segments were known to guarantee universal foldability. We show that
a surprisingly general family of planar shapes, called slender adornments,
guarantees universal foldability: roughly, the distance from each edge along
the path along the boundary of the slender adornment to each hinge should be
monotone. In contrast, we show that isosceles triangles with any desired apex
angle less than 90 degrees admit locked chains, which is precisely the
threshold beyond which the inward-normal property no longer holds.

finite temperature and density in the early Universe prior to BBN. We implement
non-equilibrium field theory methods and linear response to study the
space-time evolution directly from the effective Dirac equation in the medium.
There is a rich hierarchy of time scales associated with transverse and
longitudinal dispersion and coherence. A phenomenon of ``freezing of
coherence'' is a result of a competition between longitudinal dispersion and
the separation of wave-packets of propagating modes in the medium. Near a
resonance the coherence and oscillation time scales are enhanced by a factor
$1/\sin2\theta$ compared to the vacuum. Collisional relaxation via charged and
neutral currents occurs on time scales much shorter than the coherence time
scale and for small vacuum mixing angle, shorter than the oscillation scale.
Assuming that the momentum spread of the initial wave packet is determined by
the large angle scattering mean free path of charged leptons, we find that the
transverse dispersion time scale is the shortest and is responsible for a large
suppression in both the survival and transition probabilities on time scales
much shorter than the Hubble time. For small mixing angle the oscillation time
scale is \emph{longer} than the collisional relaxation scale. The method also
yields the evolution of right-handed wave packets. Corrections to the
oscillation frequencies emerge from wave-packet structure as well as from the
energy dependence of mixing angles in the medium.

Two typical parameterizations of possible in-medium omega spectra are analyzed,
namely (i) a one-peak structure with arbitrary position and width of the peak
and (ii) a structure with two (narrow) peaks, caused by the genuine omega meson
and a resonance-hole branch. The sum rules provide for case (i) a mass-width
correlation and for case (ii) a correlation between the peak heights and the
peak position of the omega branch. It is also analyzed how the obtained results
depend on the size of the relevant four-quark operator evaluated with respect

  Stochastic Volatilty models with extensions","v3. minor typographical change in section 5 and section 7.2",,,,"math.ST math.PR stat.TH",,"  In recent years there have been many proposals as flexible alternatives to
Gaussian based continuous time stochastic volatility models. A great deal of
these models employ positive L\'evy processes. Among these are the attractive
non-Gaussian positive Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes proposed by
Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (BNS) in a series of papers. One current problem
of these approaches is the unavailability of a tractable likelihood based
statistical analysis for the returns of financial assets. This paper, while
focusing on the BNS models, develops general theory for the implementation of
statistical inference for a host of models. Specifically we show how to reduce
the infinite-dimensional process based models to finite, albeit high,
dimensional ones. Inference can then be based on Monte Carlo methods. As
highlights, specific to BNS we show that an OU process driven by an infinite
activity Gamma process, that is an OU-$\Gamma$, exhibits unique features which
allows one to exactly sample from relevant joint distributions. We show that
this is a consequence of the OU structure and the unique calculus of Gamma and
Dirichlet processes. Owing to another connection between Gamma/Dirichlet
processes and the theory of Generalized Gamma Convolutions (GGC) we identify a
large class of models, we call (FGGC), where one can perfectly sample marginal
distributions relevant to option pricing and Monte Carlo likelihood analysis.
This involves a curious result, we establish as Theorem 6.1. We also discuss
analytic techniques and candidate densities for Monte-Carlo procedures which
apply more generally.

amenable on arbitrary closed invariant subsets. Our main results are obtained

from boson in the massless chiral sigma model, where we perform the
Coleman-Weinberg renormalization procedure. This renormalization procedure has
a mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking due to radiative corrections in
$\phi^4$ theory. We apply it to the system of nucleon and bosons with chiral
symmetry where the negative-mass term of bosons does not exist. Spontaneous
chiral symmetry breaking is derived from the contribution of nucleon and boson
loops which generates the masses of nucleon, scalar meson, and vector meson
dynamically. We find that the renormalization scale plays an important role for
the breaking of the symmetry between fermion (nucleon) and boson, and
eventually for the chiral symmetry at the same time. In addition, we find that
the naturalness restores by means of the introduction of the vacuum fluctuation
from both nucleon and boson. Finally we obtain a stable effective potential

with dissipation due to shear viscosity. Comparison of evolution of ideal and
viscous fluid, both initialised under the same conditions e.g. same
equilibration time, energy density and velocity profile, reveal that the
dissipative fluid evolves slowly, cooling at a slower rate. Cooling get still
slower for higher viscosity. The fluid velocities on the otherhand evolve
faster in a dissipative fluid than in an ideal fluid. The transverse expansion
is also enhanced in dissipative evolution. For the same decoupling temperature,
freeze-out surface for a dissipative fluid is more extended than an ideal
fluid. Dissipation produces entropy as a result of which particle production is
increased. Particle production is increased due to (i) extension of the
freeze-out surface and (ii) change of the equilibrium distribution function to
a non-equilibrium one, the last effect being prominent at large transverse
momentum. Compared to ideal fluid, transverse momentum distribution of pion
production is considerably enhanced. Enhancement is more at high $p_T$ than at
low $p_T$. Pion production also increases with viscosity, larger the viscosity,
more is the pion production. Dissipation also modifies the elliptic flow.
Elliptic flow is reduced in viscous dynamics. Also, contrary to ideal dynamics
where elliptic flow continues to increase with transverse momentum, in viscous
dynamics, elliptic flow tends to saturate at large transverse momentum. The
analysis suggest that initial conditions of the hot, dense matter produced in
Au+Au collisions at RHIC, as extracted from ideal fluid analysis can be changed
significantly if the QGP fluid is viscous.

particles in the combined physical plus internal spaces. The importance of this
is that the internal degrees of freedom implicit in Dirac's theory allow a new
classification of elementary particles. An important consequence is the
prediction of a new type of quark. As expected, our theory groups fermions into
doublets, which are then divided into color singlets (leptons) and color
triplets (quarks), and which are then further divided into generation singlets
and generation triplets. If the Pauli exclusion principle for fermions is also
valid within a particle's internal space, then our theory makes two important
predictions. First, we can explain why the widely studied quarks (up, down,
charm, strange, top, bottom) cannot be observed as free states in nature.
Second, we predict the existence of a new quark which can indeed be observed as
a free state in nature, and whose wave function is antisymmetric in internal
space. W. M. Fairbank, a Guggenheim Fellow, has published experimental data
which supports our second prediction.

this system offers a reliable alternative to more traditional rigs

demonstrated by fabricating prolate dielectric microresonators using a
microtapering technique. Such a rig is of interest to a range of fields that
require tapered fiber fabrication such as microcavity-taper coupling, atom
guiding along a tapered fiber, optical fiber sensing and the fabrication of
fused biconical tapered couplers.

open many-body quantum nonlinear bosonic systems for a very general class of
Hamiltonians. We show that non-quadratic (nonlinear) terms in a Hamiltonian
provide a singular ""quantum"" perturbation for observables in some ""mesoscopic""

the dynamical evolution, that grow in time. We argue that even for open quantum
nonlinear systems in the deep quasi-classical region, these quantum effects can
survive after decoherence and relaxation processes take place. We demonstrate
that these quantum effects in open quantum systems can be observed, for
example, in the frequency Fourier spectrum of the dynamical observables, or in
the corresponding spectral density of noise. Estimates are presented for
Bose-Einstein condensates, low temperature mechanical resonators, and nonlinear
optical systems prepared in large amplitude coherent states. In particular, we
show that for Bose-Einstein condensate systems the characteristic time of
deviation of quantum dynamics for observables from the corresponding classical
dynamics coincides with the characteristic time-scale of the well-known quantum
nonlinear effect of phase diffusion.

According to this novel trend, quantum information protocols like quantum

review some mathematical tools relative to CV systems and we consequently
develop the concepts of quantum entanglement and teleportation in the CV
framework, by analogy with the qubit-based approach. Some connections between
teleportation fidelity and entanglement properties of the underlying quantum
