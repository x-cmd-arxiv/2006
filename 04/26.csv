thus they can be used to derive cosmological parameters. Although the continuum
X-ray emission from the intra-cluster gas is optically thin, the optical depth
of resonant lines of ions of heavy elements can be larger than unity. In this
Letter we study the feasibility of deriving distances to clusters of galaxies
by determining the spatial distribution of the intra-cluster gas from X-ray
imaging and the optical depth from resonant emission lines (the XREL method).
We solve the radiative transfer problem for line scattering in the hot
intra-cluster gas using Monte Carlo simulations. We discuss the spatial and
spectral resolutions needed to use the XREL method for accurate determination
of distances, and hence cosmological parameters, and show that accurate
distances will be obtained by applying this technique with the next generation
of high resolution X-ray spectrometers.

smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of galaxy formation. This scheme
can represent a co-spatial mixture of cold and hot ISM components, and is
formulated without scale-dependent parameters. It is thus particularly suited
to studies of cosmological structure formation where galaxies with a wide range
of masses form simultaneously. We also present new algorithms for energy and
heavy element injection by supernovae, and show that together these schemes can
reproduce several important observed effects in galaxy evolution. Both in
collapsing systems and in quiescent galaxies our codes can reproduce the
Kennicutt relation between the surface densities of gas and of star formation.
Strongly metal-enhanced winds are generated in both cases with ratios of
mass-loss to star formation which are similar to those observed. This leads to
a self-regulated cycle for star formation activity. The overall impact of
feedback depends on galaxy mass. Star formation is suppressed at most by a
factor of a few in massive galaxies, but in low-mass systems the effects can be
much larger, giving star formation an episodic, bursty character. The larger
the energy fraction assumed available in feedback, the more massive the
outflows and the lower the final stellar masses. Winds from forming disks are
collimated perpendicular to the disk plane, reach velocities up to 1000 km/s,
and efficiently transport metals out of the galaxies. The asymptotically
unbound baryon fraction drops from >95 per cent to ~30 per cent from the least
to the most massive of our idealised galaxies, but the fraction of all metals
ejected with this component exceeds 60 per cent regardless of mass. Such winds
could plausibly enrich the intergalactic medium to observed levels.

indicating strong cohesion due to self-gravity. The line of nodes of the warp
inside $R_{26.5} ~ 4.5 \Rd$ is straight, while that beyond $R_{26.5}$ generally
forms a loosely-wound, leading spiral in agreement with Briggs's rules. We
focus on the mechanism of the warp and show that the leading spiral arises from
the torques from the misaligned inner disc and its associated inner oblate
halo. The fact that the line of nodes of most warps forms a leading spiral
might imply that the disc mass is significant in the centre. If the line of
nodes can be traced to very large radii in future observations, it may reveal
information on the mass distribution of the outer halo. The warp is not
strongly damped by the halo because the precession rate of the inner disc is
slow and the inner halo generally remains aligned with the inner disc. Thus
even after the imposed quadrupolar perturbation is removed, the warp persists
for a few Gyrs, by which time another infall event can be expected.

formation histories, ages and masses of high redshift galaxies. The focus is on
the Thermally-Pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch (TP-AGB) phase of stellar
evolution, whose treatment is a source of major discrepancy among different
evolutionary population synthesis. In particular, besides the models usually
adopted in the literature, we use models (by Maraston 2005), in which the
contribution of the TP-AGB phase is observationally calibrated and is the
dominant source of near-IR energy for stellar populations in the age range 0.2
to 2 Gyr. We use a sample of high-z galaxies in the HUDF, with spectroscopic
redshifts, and Spitzer IRAC and MIPS photometry from GOODS. We find that the
TP-AGB phase plays a key role in the interpretation of Spitzer data for high-z
galaxies, when the rest-frame near-IR is sampled. When fitting without dust
reddening, the models with the empirically-calibrated TP-AGB phase always
reproduce better the observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Allowing
for dust reddening improves the fits with literature models in some cases. In
both cases, the results from Maraston models imply younger ages by factors up
to 6 and lower stellar masses (by ~60 % on average). The observed strengths of
the MgUV spectral feature compare better to the predicted ones in the case of
the Maraston models, implying a better overall consistency of SED fitting.
Finally, we find that photometric redshifts improve significantly using these
models on the SEDs extending over the IRAC bands. This work provides the first
direct evidence of TP-AGB stars in the primeval Universe.

first form out of hot background gas by thermal instability and later a small
fraction of them grow to virialized clouds of mass M_c >~ 6X10^6 M_sun by
gravitational infall and merging. But these clouds have large angular momentum,
so they would be difficult, if not impossible, to further evolve into globular
clusters. In this paper, through three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations in
a uniformly rotating frame, we explore if the Coriolis force due to rotation in
protogalactic disk regions can hinder binary merging and reduce angular
momentum of the clouds formed. With rotation comparable to the Galactic
rotation at the Solar circle, the Coriolis force is smaller than the pressure
force during the early thermal instability stage. So the properties of clumps
formed by thermal instability are not affected noticeably by rotation, except
increased angular momentum. However, during later stage the Coriolis force
becomes dominant over the gravity, and hence the further growth to
gravitationally bound clouds by gravitational infall and merging is prohibited.
Our results show that the Coriolis force effectively destroys the picture of
cloud formation via TGI, rather than alleviate the problem of large angular
momentum.

bulk motion, such as the absence of the receding blob after the outburst and
the receding blob becomes brighter than the approaching one in XTE J1550-564 .
Moreover the compton scattering of photos from a warped accretion disk may form
a structured jet. And the precession of the structured jet may lead to the
complicated state transitions observed in microquasars like GRS 1915+105.
Applying to AGNs, the model may explain the scales of length and time of the
phenomena proportioning to the mass of the black hole. The new model can be

galaxies, detected in the radio continuum, in Halpha, and in X-rays, are
remarkably well correlated regarding their morphology and spatial extent. In
this work we present new results from a statistical analysis in order to
specify and quantify these phenomenological relations. This is accomplished by
investigating soft X-ray (0.3-2.0keV) luminosities, FIR, radio continuum,
Halpha, B-band, and UV luminosities for a sample of 23 edge-on late-type spiral
galaxies. Typical star formation indicators, such as SFRs, are determined and a
statistical correlation analysis is carried out. We find strong linear
correlations, covering at least two orders of magnitude, between star formation
indicators and integrated (disk+halo) luminosities in all covered wavebands. In
addition to the well established L_FIR/L_1.4GHz-relation, we show new and
highly significant linear dependencies between integrated soft X-ray
luminosities and FIR, radio continuum, Halpha, B-band, and UV luminosities.
Moreover, integrated soft X-ray luminosities correlate well with SFRs and the
energy input into the ISM by SNe. The same holds if these quantities are
plotted against soft halo X-ray luminosities. Only a weak correlation exists
between the dust mass of a galaxy and the corresponding X-ray luminosity. Among
soft X-ray luminosities, baryonic, and HI-gas masses, no significant
correlations are found. There seems to exist a critical input energy by SNe
into the ISM or a SFR threshold for multi-phase halos to show up. It is still
not clear whether this threshold is a physical or an instrument dependent
sensitivity limit. These findings strongly support our previous results, but
conflict with the concept of halos being due to infalling gas from the IGM.

is thus a good starting point for determining the minimal deterministic
presentation, known as the Shannon cover, of an FTCS. We analyze in detail the
Crochemore-Mignosi-Restivo (CMR) construction in the case when the list of
forbidden words defining the FTCS is of size at most two. We show that if the
FTCS is irreducible, then an irreducible presentation for the system can be
easily obtained by deleting a prescribed few states from the CMR presentation.
By studying the follower sets of the states in this irreducible presentation,
we are able to explicitly determine the Shannon cover in some cases. In
particular, our results show that the CMR construction directly yields the
Shannon cover in the case of an irreducible FTCS with exactly one forbidden
word, but this is not in general the case for FTCS's with two forbidden words.

measurements such as delay and received signal strength, which may be difficult
to obtain and often require dedicated equipment. An alternative to such
approaches is to use simple connectivity information, that is, the presence or
absence of a link between any pair of nodes, and to extend it to hop-counts, in
order to obtain an approximate coordinate system. Such an approximation is
sufficient for a large number of applications, such as routing. In this paper,
we propose Jumps, a positioning system for those self-organizing networks in
which other types of (exact) positioning systems cannot be used or are deemed
to be too costly. Jumps builds a multiple coordinate system based solely on
nodes neighborhood knowledge. Jumps is interesting in the context of wireless
sensor networks, as it neither requires additional embedded equipment nor
relies on any nodes capabilities. While other approaches use only three
hop-count measurements to infer the position of a node, Jumps uses an arbitrary
number. We observe that an increase in the number of measurements leads to an
improvement in the localization process, without requiring a high dense
environment. We show through simulations that Jumps, when compared with
existing approaches, reduces the number of nodes sharing the same coordinates,
which paves the way for functions such as position-based routing.

just how large is the expected input to output delay in these systems, i.e.,
once a source sequence has been encoded, what is the expected number of source

In this paper, we derive several new upper bounds on the expected delay for a
memoryless source, which improve upon a known bound due to Gallager. The bounds

provides a natural solution to the so-called mu problem by introducing a new
gauge-singlet superfield S. We realize that a new mechanism of neutrino mass
suppression, based on the R-parity violating bilinear terms mu_i L_i H_u mixing
neutrinos and higgsinos, arises within the NMSSM, offering thus an original
solution to the neutrino mass problem (connected to the solution for the mu
problem). We generate realistic (Majorana) neutrino mass values without
requiring any strong hierarchy amongst the fundamental parameters, in contrast
with the alternative models. In particular, the ratio |mu_i/mu| can reach about
10^-1, unlike in the MSSM where it has to be much smaller than unity. We check
that the obtained parameters also satisfy the collider constraints and internal
consistencies of the NMSSM. The price to pay for this new cancellation-type
mechanism of neutrino mass reduction is a certain fine tuning, which get
significantly improved in some regions of parameter space. Besides, we discuss
the feasibility of our scenario when the R-parity violating bilinear terms have
a common origin with the mu term, namely when those are generated via a VEV of
the S scalar component from the couplings lambda_i S L_i H_u. Finally, we make
comments on some specific phenomenology of the NMSSM in the presence of
R-parity violating bilinear terms.

nonassociative spacetimes. We compute the one-loop self-energy diagrams in the
ordinary path integral quantization scheme with Feynman's prescription, and
find that the Cutkosky rule is satisfied. This property is in contrast with
that of noncommutative field theory, since it is known that noncommutative
field theory with space/time noncommutativity violates unitarity in the above
standard scheme, and the quantization procedure will necessarily become
complicated to obtain a sensible Poincare invariant noncommutative field
theory. We point out a peculiar feature of the non-locality in our
nonassociative field theories, which may explain the property of the unitarity
distinct from noncommutative field theories. Thus commutative nonassociative
field theories seem to contain physically interesting field theories on
deformed spacetimes.

global algebraic geometry. Because of their importance, there has been some
interest in the question of which ideals on a smooth complex variety can be
realized as multiplier ideals. Other than integral closure no local
obstructions have been known up to now, and in dimension two it was established
by Favre-Jonsson and Lipman-Watanabe that any integrally closed ideal is
locally a multiplier ideal. We prove the somewhat unexpected result that
multiplier ideals in fact satisfy some rather strong algebraic properties
involving higher syzygies. It follows that in dimensions three and higher,
multiplier ideals are very special among all integrally closed ideals.

close to a saddle--node bifurcation at which a pair of nontrivial steady states
are born as the dimensionless reaction rate (Damkohler number) is increased,
and, second, for large Damkohler number, far away from the bifurcation. The
main aim is to investigate the initial-value problem and to determine when an
initial condition subject to chaotic stirring will decay to zero and when it
will give rise to a nonzero final state. Comparisons with full PDE simulations
show that the reduced pulse model accurately predicts the threshold amplitude
for a pulse initial condition to give rise to a nontrivial final steady state,

transitions between different levels of complexity (Smith and Szathmary, 1995).
There have been previous workshops on this topic, e.g. (Heylighen et al., 1999;
Lenaerts et al., 2002), but many open questions still remain. Trying to answer
these questions from a general perspective might not immediately produce
concrete answers for the different fields that are interested in this topic.
Consequently, this workshop is organised with a particular focus in mind: The
emergence of complexity through evolutionary mechanisms. Primarily we want to
have a discussion on evolutionary and related dynamics as mechanisms for
producing complexity. Furthermore, we want to bring together historical and
novel research in this context.

cone-of-influence, ie wavelets which extend past either end of a finite
timeseries return transform coefficients which tend to decrease as more of the
wavelet is truncated. These coefficients may be corrected simply by rescaling
the remaining wavelet. The corrected wavelet transform displays no
cone-of-influence and maintains reconstruction as either edge is approached. As
an application and example, we present the corrected wavelet transform of the

magnetic activity, and compare the yearly solar magnetic power with Oerlemans'
glacial global temperature reconstruction.

contrast to previous approaches, we do not rely on a discrete bead-rod model,
but introduce a suitable normal mode decomposition of a continuous space curve.
By means of a perturbation expansion for stiff filaments we derive a closed set
of coupled Langevin equations in mode space for the nonlinear dynamics in two
dimensions, taking into account exactly the local constraint of
inextensibility. The stochastic differential equations obtained this way are
solved numerically, with parameters adjusted to describe the motion of actin
filaments. As an example, we show results for the tumbling motion in shear
flow.

  polarization-insensitive phase modulators","4 pages","Optics Express Vol. 14 p4264-4269 (2006)","10.1364/OE.14.004264",,"quant-ph",,"  We present a design for a quantum key distribution(QKD) system in a Sagnac
loop configuration, employing a novel phase modulation scheme based on
frequency shift, and demonstrate stable BB84 QKD operation with high
interference visibility and low quantum bit error rate (QBER). The phase
modulation is achieved by sending two light pulses with a fixed time delay (or
a fixed optical path delay) through a frequency shift element and by modulating
the amount of frequency shift. The relative phase between two light pulses upon
leaving the frequency-shift element is determined by both the time delay (or
the optical path delay) and the frequency shift, and can therefore be
controlled by varying the amount of frequency shift. To demonstrate its
operation, we used an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) as the frequency-shift
element, and vary the driving frequency of the AOM to encode phase
information.The interference visibility for a 40km and a 10km fiber loop is 96%
and 99%, respectively, at single photon level. We ran BB84 protocol in a 40-km
Sagnac loop setup continuously for one hour and the measured QBER remained
within the 2%~5% range. A further advantage of our scheme is that both phase
and amplitude modulation can be achieved simultaneously by frequency and
amplitude modulation of the AOM's driving signal, allowing our QKD system the
capability of implementing other protocols, such as the decoy-state QKD and the
continuous- variable QKD. We also briefly discuss a new type of Eavesdropping
strategy (""phaseremapping"" attack) in bidirectional QKD system.

  on Feb 14, 2006. The official version of this thesis is available from the
  University of Hull, UK",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Research in quantum games has flourished during recent years. However, it
seems that opinion remains divided about their true quantum character and
content. For example, one argument says that quantum games are nothing but
'disguised' classical games and that to quantize a game is equivalent to
replacing the original game by a different classical game. The present thesis
contributes towards the ongoing debate about quantum nature of quantum games by
developing two approaches addressing the related issues. Both approaches take
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)-type experiments as the underlying physical
set-ups to play two-player quantum games. In the first approach, the players'
strategies are unit vectors in their respective planes, with the knowledge of
coordinate axes being shared between them. Players perform measurements in an
EPR-type setting and their payoffs are defined as functions of the
correlations, i.e. without reference to classical or quantum mechanics.
Classical bimatrix games are reproduced if the input states are classical and
perfectly anti-correlated, as for a classical correlation game. However, for a
quantum correlation game, with an entangled singlet state as input,
qualitatively different solutions are obtained. The second approach uses the
result that when the predictions of a Local Hidden Variable (LHV) model are
made to violate the Bell inequalities the result is that some probability
measures assume negative values. With the requirement that classical games
result when the predictions of a LHV model do not violate the Bell
inequalities, our analysis looks at the impact which the emergence of negative
probabilities has on the solutions of two-player games which are physically
implemented using the EPR-type experiments.

naturally into two pieces. We prove that the part of this boundary which is
contained in the relative interior of M is a smooth manifold.

"quant-ph/0604191","Huw Price","Huw Price","Probability in the Everett World: Comments on Wallace and Greaves","17 pages; no figures; LaTeX",,,,"quant-ph",,"  It is often objected that the Everett interpretation of QM cannot make sense
of quantum probabilities, in one or both of two ways: either it can't make
sense of probability at all, or it can't explain why probability should be
governed by the Born rule. David Deutsch has attempted to meet these
objections. He argues not only that rational decision under uncertainty makes
sense in the Everett interpretation, but also that under reasonable
assumptions, the credences of a rational agent in an Everett world should be
constrained by the Born rule. David Wallace has developed and defended
Deutsch's proposal, and greatly clarified its conceptual basis. In particular,
he has stressed its reliance on the distinguishing symmetry of the Everett
view, viz., that all possible outcomes of a quantum measurement are treated as
equally real. The argument thus tries to make a virtue of what has usually been
seen as the main obstacle to making sense of probability in the Everett world.
In this note I outline some objections to the Deutsch-Wallace argument, and to
related proposals by Hilary Greaves about the epistemology of Everettian QM.
(In the latter case, my arguments include an appeal to an Everettian analogue
of the Sleeping Beauty problem.) The common thread to these objections is that
the symmetry in question remains a very significant obstacle to making sense of
probability in the Everett interpretation.
