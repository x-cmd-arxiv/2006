extremely overabundant relative to every other measured element. This appears
to solve the problem of the stable gas disk, since the carbon overabundance

however, since the overabundance may indicate the gas is produced from material
more carbon-rich than the expected Solar System analogues.

alternative habitable zones, where stellar insolation plays a secondary, or
complementary, role. We investigate the potential extent of stable satellite
orbits around a set of 74 known extrasolar giant planets located beyond 0.6 AU
from their parent stars - where moons should be long-lived with respect to
removal by stellar tides. Approximately 60% of these giant planets can sustain
satellites or moons in bands up to $\sim 0.04$ AU in width. For comparison, the
Galiean satellites extend to $\sim 0.013$ AU. We investigate the stellar
insolation that moons would experience for these exoplanet systems, and the
implications for sublimation loss of volatiles. We find that between 15 and 27%

addition, some 22-28% of all known exoplanets could harbor moons within a

simplified energy balance model is applied to the situation of temperate moons,
maintained by a combination of stellar insolation and tidal heat flow. We
demonstrate that large moons ($>0.1 $M$_{\oplus}$), at orbital radii

the Gemini Multiobject Spectrograph to conduct a deep spectroscopic galaxy
redshift survey in the 5' x 5' field centered on the QSO. This survey is fully
complete for r' < 19.7 and is 73% complete for r' < 21.0. We find three
galaxies at the redshift of the higher-z O VI system (z = 0.14232) including a
galaxy at projected distance rho = 155 kpc. We find no galaxies in the Gemini
field at the redshift of the lower-z O VI absorber (z = 0.06807), which
indicates that the nearest galaxy is more than 195 kpc away or has L < 0.04 L*.
Previous shallower surveys covering a larger field have shown that the z =
0.06807 O VI absorber is affiliated with a group/filament of galaxies, but the
nearest known galaxy has rho = 736 kpc. The z = 0.06807 absorber is notable for
several reasons. The absorption profiles reveal simple kinematics indicative of
quiescent material. The H I line widths and good alignment of the H I and metal
lines favor photoionization and, moreover, the column density ratios imply a
high metallicity: [M/H] = -0.3 +/- 0.12. The z = 0.14232 O VI system is more
complex and less constrained but also indicates a relatively high metallicity.
Using galaxy redshifts from SDSS, we show that both of the PG0953+415 O VI
absorbers are located in large-scale filaments of the cosmic web. Evidently,
some regions of the web filaments are highly metal enriched. We discuss the
origin of the high-metallicity gas and suggest that the enrichment might have
occurred long ago (at high z).

forms in a Pop III object, by focusing on the radiation hydrodynamic (RHD)
feedback brought by ionizing photons as well as H2 dissociating photons. For
the purpose, we perform three-dimensional RHD simulations, where the radiative
transfer of ionizing photons and H2 dissociating photons from a first star is
self-consistently coupled with hydrodynamics based on a smoothed particle
hydrodynamics method. As a result, it is shown that density peaks above a
threshold density can keep collapsing owing to the shielding of H2 dissociating
radiation by an H2 shell formed ahead of a D-type ionization front. But, below
the threshold density, an M-type ionization front accompanied by a shock
propagates, and density peaks are radiation hydrodynamically evaporated by the
shock. The threshold density is dependent on the distance from a source star,
which is $\approx 10^2 cm^{-3}$ for the source distance of 30pc. Taking into
consideration that the extent of a Pop III object is $\approx 100$pc and
density peaks within it have the density of $10^{2-4}$cm$^{-3}$, it is
concluded that the secondary star formation is allowed in the broad regions in

UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS), a seven year sky survey which began in
May 2005, using the UKIRT Wide Field Camera. It is a portfolio of five survey
components covering various combinations of the filter set ZYJHK and H_2. The
Large Area Survey, the Galactic Clusters Survey, and the Galactic Plane Survey
cover approximately 7000 square degrees to a depth of K~18; the Deep
Extragalactic Survey covers 35 square degrees to K~21, and the Ultra Deep
Survey covers 0.77 square degrees to K~23. Summed together UKIDSS is 12 times
larger in effective volume than the 2MASS survey. The prime aim of UKIDSS is to
provide a long term astronomical legacy database; the design is however driven
by a series of specific goals -- for example to find the nearest and faintest
sub-stellar objects; to discover Population II brown dwarfs, if they exist; to
determine the substellar mass function; to break the z=7 quasar barrier; to
determine the epoch of re-ionisation; to measure the growth of structure from
z=3 to the present day; to determine the epoch of spheroid formation; and to
map the Milky Way through the dust, to several kpc. The survey data are being
uniformly processed, and released in stages through the WFCAM Science Archive
(WSA : http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/wsa). Before the formal survey began, UKIRT and
the UKIDSS consortium collaborated in obtaining and analysing a series of small
science verification (SV) projects to complete the commissioning of the camera.
We show some results from these SV projects in order to demonstrate the likely
power of the eventual complete survey. Finally, using the data from the First
Data Release we assess how well UKIDSS is meeting its design targets so far.

Model of the Galaxy, developed in Besancon, is used to calculate the extinction
distribution along different lines of sight. By combining many lines of sight,
the large scale distribution of interstellar material can be deduced. The
Galaxy model is used to provide the intrinsic colour of stars and their
probable distances, so that the near infrared colour excess, and hence the
extinction, may be calculated and its distance evaluated. Such a technique is
dependent on the model used, however we are able to show that moderate changes
in the model parameters result in insignificant changes in the predicted
extinction. This technique has now been applied to over 64000 lines of sight,
each separated by 15 arcmin, in the inner Galaxy (|l|<=100 deg, |b|<=10 deg).
Using our extinction map, we have derived the main characteristics of the large
scale structure of the dust distribution: scale height and warp of the ISM disc
as well as the angle of the dust in the Galactic Bar. This resulting extinction
map will be useful for studies of the inner Galaxy and its stellar populations.

functions to the 3.6 to 8um colour and optical photo-z distribution of galaxy
populations in the ELAIS-N1 and Lockman Fields of SWIRE. For 16,698 sources in
ELAIS-N1 we find our data are best modelled (in the sense of the Bayesian
Information Criterion) by the sum of four Gaussian distributions or modes (C_a,
C_b, C_c and C_d). We compare the fit of our empirical model with predictions
from existing semi-analytic and phenomological models. We infer that our
empirical model provides a better description of the mid-infrared colour
distribution of the SWIRE survey than these existing models. This colour
distribution test is thus a powerful model discriminator and complementary to
comparisons of number counts. We use our model to provide a galaxy
classification scheme and explore the nature of the galaxies in the different
modes of the model. C_a consists of dusty star-forming systems such as ULIRG's.
Low redshift late-type spirals are found in C_b, where PAH emission dominates
at 8um. C_c consists of dusty starburst systems at intermediate redshifts. Low
redshift early-type spirals and ellipticals dominate C_d. We thus find a
greater variety of galaxy types than one can with optical photometry alone.
Finally we develop a new technique to identify unusual objects, and find a
selection of outliers with very red IRAC colours. These objects are not
detected in the optical, but have very strong detections in the mid-infrared.
These sources are modelled as dust-enshrouded, strongly obscured AGN, where the
high mid-infrared emission may either be attributed to dust heated by the AGN
or substantial star-formation. These sources have z_ph ~ 2-4, making them
incredibly infrared luminous, with a L_IR ~ 10^(12.6-14.1) L_sun.

provide another observation that can place further constraints on the GRB
progenitor: measurements telling us about the environments surrounding GRBs.
Current analyses of GRB afterglows suggest that roughly half of long-duration
gamma-ray bursts occur in surroundings with density profiles that are uniform.
We study the constraints placed by this observation on both the classic
``collapsar'' massive star progenitor and its relative, the ``helium-merger''

modifications to the standard Wolf-Rayet mass-loss paradigm are not sufficient
to produce constant density profiles. Although this does not rule out the
standard ``collapsar'' progenitor, it does suggest a deficiency with this

orbital period binaries which contain low-mass(<1.5 Msun) donors and black hole
(>4 Msun) accretors. Evolution of these binaries is determined by nuclear
evolution of the donors and/or orbital angular momentum loss due to magnetic
braking by the stellar wind of the donors and gravitational wave radiation.
According to our model, the estimated total number of this type of black-hole
binaries in the Galaxy is about 10000. If the magnetic braking is described by
the Verbunt & Zwaan formula, the model predicts around 3000 transient systems
with periods >2 hours and around 300 luminous stable systems with periods
between 3 and 8 hours. Several dozens of these bright systems should be above
the RXTE ASM sensitivity limit. The absence of such systems implies that
angular momentum losses are reduced by a factor more than 2 with respect to the
Verbunt & Zwaan prescription. We show that it is unlikely that the transient
behaviour of black-hole short-period X-ray binaries is explained by the evolved
nature of the stellar companion. A substantial fraction of black-hole binaries
with periods >3 hours could be faint with truncated, stable cold accretion
discs as proposed by Menou et al. Most of the semidetached black-hole binaries
are expected to have periods shorter than ~2 hours. Properties of such, still
to be observed, very small mass-ratio (q<0.02) binaries are different from
those of their longer period cousins.

depend on the states in its local neighborhood at time $t-1$, but also on the
memory of its own past states $\sigma_i(t-2),
\sigma_i(t-3),...,\sigma_i(t-\tau),...$. We assume that the weight of this
memory decays proportionally to $\tau^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha \ge 0$ (the
limit $\alpha \to \infty$ corresponds to the usual CA). Since the memory
function is summable for $\alpha>1$ and nonsummable for $0\le \alpha \le 1$, we
expect pronounced %qualitative and quantitative changes of the dynamical
behavior near $\alpha=1$. This is precisely what our simulations exhibit,
particularly for the time evolution of the Hamming distance $H$ of initially
close trajectories. We typically expect the asymptotic behavior $H(t) \propto
t^{1/(1-q)}$, where $q$ is the entropic index associated with nonextensive
statistical mechanics. In all cases, the function $q(\alpha)$ exhibits a
sensible change at $\alpha \simeq 1$. We focus on the class II rules 61, 99 and
111. For rule 61, $q = 0$ for $0 \le \alpha \le \alpha_c \simeq 1.3$, and $q<0$
for $\alpha> \alpha_c$, whereas the opposite behavior is found for rule 111.
For rule 99, the effect of the long-range memory on the spread of damage is
quite dramatic. These facts point at a rich dynamics intimately linked to the
interplay of local lookup rules and the range of the memory. Finite size
scaling studies varying system size $N$ indicate that the range of the
power-law regime for $H(t)$ typically diverges $\propto N^z$ with $0 \le z \le
1$. Similar studies have been carried out for other rules, e.g., the famous

considered as a network of Josephson junctions. The investigated samples belong
to both hole-doped Y1-xPrxBa2Cu3O7-d (x = 0.0, 0.35, and 0.45) and the
electron-doped Sm2-xCexCuO4-d (x = 0.18) systems which display the so-called
double resistive superconducting transition. We have performed several
transport measurements in these compounds including temperature and magnetic
field dependence of the electrical resistance, R(T,H), and I-V characteristics.
Several aspects of the I-V characteristics were quantitatively well described
by the RSJ model. The combined results strongly suggest that dissipation in
granular superconducting samples is a natural consequence of the normal current
flowing in parallel with the supercurrent current.

  Thickness of the Flow",,,"10.1140/epje/e2007-00002-5",,"cond-mat.soft",,"  The flow of dry granular material in a half-filled rotating drum is studied.
The thickness of the flowing zone is measured for several rotation speeds, drum
sizes and beads sizes (size ratio between drum and beads ranging from 47 to
7400). Varying the rotation speed, a scaling law linking mean velocity vs
thickness of the flow, $v\sim h^m$, is deduced for each couple (beads, drum).
The obtained exponent $m$ is not always equal to 1, value previously reported
in a drum, but varies with the geometry of the system. For small size ratios,
exponents higher than 1 are obtained due to a saturation of the flowing zone
thickness. The exponent of the power law decreases with the size ratio, leading
to exponents lower than 1 for high size ratios. These exponents imply that the
velocity gradient of a dry granular flow in a rotating drum is not constant.
More fundamentally, these results show that the flow of a granular material in
a rotating drum is very sensible to the geometry, and that the deduction of the
``rheology'' of a granular medium flowing in such a geometry is not obvious.

investigated rather in different manners. One of common features of both $d$-

and the electronic potential of sodium wires suspended between two sodium
electrodes are obtained from self-consistent density functional theory
calculations. The conductance is calculated within the framework of the
Landauer-B\""utttiker formalism, using the mode-matching technique as formulated
recently in a real-space finite-difference scheme [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{70},
195402 (2004)]. We find a regular even-odd conductance oscillation as a
function of the wire length, where wires comprising an odd number of atoms have
a conductance close to the quantum unit $G_0=e^2/\pi\hbar$, and even-numbered
wires have a lower conductance. The conductance of odd-numbered wires is stable
with respect to geometry changes in the wire or in the contacts between the
wire and the electrodes; the conductance of even-numbered wires is more
sensitive. Geometry changes affect the spacing and widths of the wire
resonances. In the case of odd-numbered wires the transmission is on-resonance,
and hardly affected by the resonance shapes, whereas for even-numbered wires
the transmission is off-resonance and sensitive to the resonance shapes.
Predicting the amplitude of the conductance oscillation requires a
first-principles calculation based upon a realistic structure of the wire and
the leads. A simple tight-binding model is introduced to clarify these results.

this purpose, we propose first a precise semantics for IC satisfaction in a

treated in commercial database management systems. Next, a precise notion of
repair is introduced that privileges the introduction of null values when
repairing foreign key constraints, in such a way that these new values do not
create an infinite cycle of new inconsistencies. Finally, we analyze how to
specify this kind of repairs of a database that contains null values using
disjunctive logic programs with stable model semantics.

from the center of a supernova. Terrestrial neutrino telescopes, such as SNO

the core of a collapsing and exploding star. But the information about the
supernova that a neutrino detector can supply, is restricted by the fact that
little experimental data on the neutrino-nucleus cross sections exists and by
the uncertainties in theoretical calculations. In this letter, we propose a
novel procedure that determines the response of a target nucleus in a
supernova-neutrino detector directly, by using low-energy beta-beams. We show
that fitting 'synthetic' spectra, constructed by taking linear combinations of
beta-beam spectra, to the original supernova-neutrino spectra reproduces the
folded differential cross sections very accurately. Comparing the response in a
terrestrial detector to these synthetic responses provides a direct way to
determine the main parameters of the supernova-neutrino energy-distribution.

expressions for Green's functions and for output power of a SASE FEL are

chirp parameter. Saturation length and power versus energy chirp parameter are
calculated numerically. It is shown that the effect of linear energy chirp on
FEL gain is equivalent to the linear undulator tapering (or linear energy
variation along the undulator). A consequence of this fact is a possibility to
perfectly compensate FEL gain degradation, caused by the energy chirp, by means
of the undulator tapering independently of the value of the energy chirp
parameter. An application of this effect for generation of attosecond pulses

short undulator, placed in front of the main undulator. Gain degradation within

the bunch suffers from this taper and does not lase. Three-dimensional

possibility of significant computational advantages for the simulation of large

that the nonlocality of quantum mechanics has not disappeared -- it has simply
been swept under the rug into the quantum force. In this paper we present a new
formulation of Bohmian mechanics in which the quantum action, S, is taken to be
complex. This leads to a single equation for complex S, and ultimately complex
x and p but there is a reward for this complexification -- a significantly
higher degree of localization. The quantum force in the new approach vanishes
for Gaussian wavepacket dynamics, and its effect on barrier tunneling processes
is orders of magnitude lower than that of the classical force. We demonstrate
tunneling probabilities that are in virtually perfect agreement with the exact
quantum mechanics down to 10^{-7} calculated from strictly localized quantum
trajectories that do not communicate with their neighbors. The new formulation
may have significant implications for fundamental quantum mechanics, ranging

are squeezed in two opposite quadratures in phase space. Various entanglement
conditions are tested for the entangled squeezed state and we study decoherence
models for noise, producing a mixed entangled squeezed state. We briefly
describe a probabilistic protocol for entanglement swapping based on the use of
this class of entangled states and the main features of a general generation
scheme.
