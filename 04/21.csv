unique proton incident energy ranges were determined as 45--49, 145--154,
297--335, and 390--440 MeV. The indirect proton flux measuring tool has been
tested by comparing Solar Energetic Particles (SEP) flux temporal profiles

The SEP flux temporal profiles and proton spectra extracted from the EIT in the

consistent with the related GOES profiles. The four additional EIT extracted

the beat periodicity between the orbital period and the X-ray period, which is

quasi-periodic oscillations, which are typical of the transient phase in

that the application of the Kennicutt star formation law to a galaxy having the
median orbital time at the optical limit of this sample results in a star
formation rate decay with cosmic time similar to that given by the SFRD(z)
evolution. This implies that the SFRD(z) evolution is primarily due to the
secular evolution of galaxies, rather than interactions or mergers. This is
consistent with the morphologies predominantly seen in the SINGG sample.

H-alpha and R-band imaging of a sample of 468 galaxies selected from the HI
Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS). The sample spans three decades in HI mass and
is free of many of the biases that affect other star forming galaxy samples. We
present the criteria for sample selection, list the entire sample, discuss our
observational techniques, and describe the data reduction and calibration
methods. This paper focuses on 93 SINGG targets whose observations have been
fully reduced and analyzed to date. The majority of these show a single
Emission Line Galaxy (ELG). We see multiple ELGs in 13 fields, with up to four
ELGs in a single field. All of the targets in this sample are detected in
H-alpha indicating that dormant (non-star forming) galaxies with M(HI) > ~3e7
M_sun are very rare. A database of the measured global properties of the ELGs
is presented. The ELG sample spans four orders of magnitude in luminosity
(H-alpha and R-band), and H-alpha surface brightness, nearly three orders of
magnitude in R surface brightness and nearly two orders of magnitude in H-alpha
equivalent width (EW). The surface brightness distribution of our sample is
broader than that of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopic sample, the
(EW) distribution is broader than prism-selected samples, and the morphologies
found include all common types of star forming galaxies (e.g. irregular,
spiral, blue compact dwarf, starbursts, merging and colliding systems, and even
residual star formation in S0 and Sa spirals). (abridged)

into the envelope of a 3.0 M_sun star during three epochs of its evolution (Red
Giant Branch, Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB), interpulse AGB). We find that
common envelope evolution can lead to three qualitatively different
consequences: (i) direct ejection of envelope material resulting in a
predominately equatorial outflow, (ii) spin-up of the envelope resulting in the
possibility of powering an explosive dynamo driven jet and (iii) tidal
shredding of the companion into a disc which facilitates a disc driven jet. We
study how these features depend on the secondary's mass and discuss

meanfield Lorentz force and quenching of transport coefficients such as

the meridional flow does not change the character of the flux-transport dynamo
significantly; however it leads to a significant reduction of differential

saturation takes place when the toroidal field at the base of the convection

corresponds to about 0.1 to 0.2% of the solar luminosity. The torsional
oscillations produced through Lorentz force feedback on differential rotation
show a dominant poleward propagating branch with the correct phase relation to

Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) have revised the electron scattering optical
depth downward from tau_es=0.17+0.08-0.07 to tau_es=0.09+/-0.03. This implies a
shift of the effective reionization redshift from z_r~17 to z_r~11. Previous
attempts to explain the high redshift of reionization inferred from the WMAP 1
year data have led to widespread speculation that the sources of reionization
must have been much more efficient than those associated with the star
formation observed at low redshift. This is consistent, for example, with the
suggestion that early star formation involved massive, Population III stars
that early on produced most of the ionizing radiation escaping from halos. It
is therefore tempting to interpret the new WMAP results as implying that we can
now relax those previous high demands on the efficiency of the sources of
reionization and perhaps even turn the argument around as evidence against such
high efficiency. We show that this is not the case, however. The new WMAP
results also find that the primordial density fluctuation power spectrum has a
lower amplitude, sigma_8, and departs substantially from the scale-invariant
spectrum. We show that these effects combine to cancel the impact of the later
reionization implied by the new value of tau_es on the required ionizing
efficiency per collapsed baryon. The delay of reionization is surprisingly well
matched by a comparable delay (by a factor of ~1.4 in scale factor) in the
formation of the halos responsible for reionization.

inflationary models of $\beta \geq -1.8$. The LIGO with its design sensitivity
and the LISA will also be able to test the model of $\beta=-1.9$. We also
examine the constraints on the spectral energy density of relic gravitational

solving the inflationary flow equations. By the first method we obtain a bound

expression of $\Omega_g(k)$ depends on the specific inflationary models and not
well applies for the waves with very high frequencies. The numerical method is
more precise for the waves with high frequencies and applies to any
single-field inflationary model. It gives a bound
$\Omega_g<8.62\times10^{-14}$, which is independent of the inflationary

equation of state function $\omega(z)$. We apply our method to five kinds of
parametrizations of equation of state parameter, where $\omega$ crossing -1 can
exist, and find they all can be realized. At last, we discuss the evolution of
the perturbations of the quintom field, and find the perturbations of the

that the GRBs and the associated supernovae did not occur in these regions, but
several hundreds of parsec away. Considering various scenarios for GRB
progenitors, we do not find any simple explanation of why they should be
preferentially born in regions with low stellar densities. All the examined
GRBs and associated SNe have occurred 400 to 800 pc from very high density
stellar environments including large numbers of WR stars. Such distances can be
travelled through at velocities of 100 km/s or larger, assuming the travel time
to be the typical life time of WR stars. It leads us to suggest that GRB
progenitors may be runaway massive stars ejected from compact massive star
clusters. The ejection from such super star clusters may lead to a spin-up of
these stars, producing the loss of the hydrogen and/or helium envelopes leading
to the origin of the type Ibc supernovae associated with GRBs. If this scenario
applies tocd text/Sc all GRBs, it provides a natural explanation of the very
small fraction of massive stars that emit a GRB at the end of their life. An
alternative to this scenario could be a binary origin for GRBs, but this still
requires an explanation of why it would preferentially occur in low stellar

how efficiently galactic winds can provide an intense and widespread ""seed""

in clusters of galaxies and in the intergalactic medium (IGM). We use
semi-analytic simulations of magnetised galactic winds coupled to high
resolution N-body simulations of structure formation to estimate lower and
upper limits for the fraction of the IGM which can be magnetised up to a
specified level. We find that galactic winds are able to seed a substantial
fraction of the cosmic volume with magnetic fields. Most regions affected by
winds have magnetic fields in the range -12 < Log B < -8 G, while higher seed
fields can be obtained only rarely and in close proximity to wind-blowing
galaxies. These seed fields are sufficiently intense for a moderately efficient
turbulent dynamo to amplify them to the observed values. The volume filling
factor of the magnetised regions strongly depends on the efficiency of winds to
load mass from the ambient medium. However, winds never completely fill the
whole Universe and pristine gas can be found in cosmic voids and regions
unaffected by feedback even at z=0. This means that, in principle, there might
be the possibility to probe the existence of primordial magnetic fields in such

conclusions, with some claiming standard Kroupa-type IMFs, while others have
claimed extreme non-standard IMFs. However, the results appear to be correlated
with the age of the clusters, as older clusters (>80 Myr) all appear to be well
fit by a Kroupa-type IMF whereas younger clusters display significant scatter
in their best fitting IMF. Here we show that this is likely due to the fact
that young clusters are out of virial equilibrium and therefore cannot be used
for such studies. Hence only the older clusters are suitable for IMF studies.
Using only these clusters we find that the IMF does not vary significantly. The
youngest clusters can be used instead to constrain the star-formation
efficiency (SFE) within clusters. We find that the SFE varies between 20 and
60% and we conclude that approximately 60% of young clusters are unbound and

the source lies within NGC 4214 and has an X-ray luminosity of up to 7 e38

donor star with a neutron-star accretor, though a stellar-mass black-hole
accretor cannot be completely excluded. There is no obvious evidence for a
strong stellar wind in the X-ray orbital light curve that would be expected
from a massive He star; thus, the mass of the He star should be <3-4 solar
masses. If correct, this would represent a new class of very luminous X-ray
binary -- perhaps related to Cyg X-3. Other less likely possibilities include a
conventional low-mass X-ray binary that somehow manages to produce such a high

magnetically dominated. The injected magnetic fields, along with their
associated currents, have both poloidal and toroidal components, and they are
not force free. The dynamic expansion driven by the Lorentz force of the
injected fields is studied using 3-dimensional ideal magnetohydrodynamic

compounds based on light elements (these include: most hydrocarbons; nitrogen

metastable substances too, i.e. they do not match the Gibbs' free energy
minimum for a given chemical composition. At moderate temperatures and
pressures, the phase transitions for given metastable phases throughout the
entire experimentally accessible time range are reversible with the equilibrium
thermodynamics laws obeyed. At sufficiently high pressures (1-10 GPa), most of
molecular phases irreversibly transform to more energy efficient polymerized
phases, both stable and metastable. These transformations are not consistent

Problems, or PCSP. Where the usual CSPs from computer science and optimization
have real-valued score functions, and partition functions from physics have
monomials, PCSP has scores that are arbitrary multivariate formal polynomials,
or indeed take values in an arbitrary ring.
  Although PCSP is much more general than CSP, remarkably, all (exact,
exponential-time) algorithms we know of for 2-CSP (where each score depends on
at most 2 variables) extend to 2-PCSP, at the expense of just a polynomial
factor in running time. Specifically, we extend the reduction-based algorithm
of Scott and Sorkin; the specialization of that approach to sparse random
instances, where the algorithm runs in polynomial expected time;
dynamic-programming algorithms based on tree decompositions; and the
split-and-list matrix-multiplication algorithm of Williams.
  This gives the first polynomial-space exact algorithm more efficient than
exhaustive enumeration for the well-studied problems of finding a minimum
bisection of a graph, and calculating the partition function of an Ising model,
and the most efficient algorithm known for certain instances of Maximum
Independent Set. Furthermore, PCSP solves both optimization and counting
versions of a wide range of problems, including all CSPs, and thus enables
samplers including uniform sampling of optimal solutions and Gibbs sampling of
all solutions.

dimensional supergravity as a simultaneous nonlinear realisation based on the
conformal group and an enlarged affine group called G11. The vielbein and the
gauge fields of the theory appear as space-time dependent parameters of the
coset representatives. Inside the corresponding algebra g11 we find the Borel
subalgebra of e7, whereas performing the same procedure for the Borel
subalgebra of e8 we have to add some extra generators. The presence of these
new generators lead to a formulation of gravity including both a vielbein and
its dual. We review the arguments for the conjecture that the final symmetry of
M-theory should be described by a coset space, with the global and the local
symmetry given by the Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebra e11 and its subalgebra
invariant under the Cartan involution, respectively. The pure gravity itself in
D dimensions is argued to have a coset symmetry based on the very extended
algebra A^{+++}_{D-3}. The tensor generators of a very extended algebra are
divided into representations of its maximal finite dimensional subalgebra. The
space-time translations are thought to be introduced as weights in a basic
representation of the Kac-Moody algebra. Some features of the root system of a
general Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebra are reviewed, in particular those related
to even self-dual lattices.

twistors with no helicity. These can be represented within the geometric

constructed from a quantum system of two particles. The realisation takes place
in the multiparticle space-time algebra. This representation allows us to
identify an event with the wave-function for a non-charged Klein-Gordon
particle. A more general point can also be obtained, if the space is
complexified and the twistors have non-zero helicity. In this case, such a
point is no longer an event, but it can be identified with the wave-function
for a charged Klein-Gordon particle. Other spaces of cosmological relevance can
also be constructed using the 2-particle representation of the conformal space,
as is the case for de Sitter and anti-de Sitter spaces. Furthermore, we show
that Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spaces, with and without big bang, are fully
described through two twistors, which are expressed within our formalism in
terms of entities belonging to quantum mechanics: the Dirac matrix $\gamma_0$,
a massless maximally entangled state and its complex conjugate.

  2509-2523","10.1016/j.laa.2007.11.029",,"math.DS",,"  The concepts of paracontracting, pseudocontracting and nonexpanding operators
have been shown to be useful in proving convergence of asynchronous or parallel
iteration algorithms. The purpose of this paper is to give characterizations of
these operators when they are linear and finite-dimensional. First we show that
pseudocontractivity of stochastic matrices with respect to sup-norm is
equivalent to the scrambling property, a concept first introduced in the study
of inhomogeneous Markov chains. This unifies results obtained independently
using different approaches. Secondly, we generalize the concept of
pseudocontractivity to set-contractivity which is a useful generalization with
respect to the Euclidean norm. In particular, we demonstrate non-Hermitian
matrices that are set-contractive for ||.||_2, but not pseudocontractive for
||.||_2 or sup-norm. For constant row sum matrices we characterize
set-contractivity using matrix norms and matrix graphs. Furthermore, we prove
convergence results in compositions of set-contractive operators and illustrate
the differences between set-contractivity in different norms. Finally, we give
an application to the global synchronization in coupled map lattices.

theory"" is no theory at all, but rather a labyrinthic structure of mathematical
procedures and intuitions which get their justification from the fact that
they, at least formally, reproduce general relativity and the standard model of
elementary particle physics as low energy approximations. However, there are
now strong indications that string theory does not only reproduce the dynamics
and symmetries of our standard model, but a plethora of different scenarios
with different low energy nomologies and symmetries. String theory seems to
describe not only our world, but an immense landscape of possible worlds. So
far, all attempts to find a selection principle which could be motivated
intratheoretically remained without success. So, recently the idea that the low
energy nomology of our world, and therefore also the observable phenomenology,
could be the result of an anthropic selection from a vast arena of
nomologically different scenarios entered string theory. Although multiverse
scenarios and anthropic selection are not only motivated by string theory, but
lead also to a possible explanation for the fine tuning of the universe, they
are concepts which transcend the framework defined by the epistemological and
methodological rules which conventionally form the basis of physics as an
empirical science.

and active (unloading) states. We show that an approximate expression of the
packing resistance force as a function of the displacement of the free
retaining wall from the jamming position provides a good description of the
dynamics. We study in detail the scaling of displacements and velocities with
loading parameters. In particular, we find that, for a wide range of
frequencies, the data collapse by scaling the displacements with the inverse
square of frequency, the inverse of the force amplitude and the square of
gravity. Interestingly, compaction occurs during the extension of the packing,
followed by decompaction in the contraction phase. We show that the mean
compaction rate increases linearly with frequency up to a characteristic
frequency and then it declines in inverse proportion to frequency. The
characteristic frequency is interpreted in terms of the time required for the
relaxation of the packing through collective grain rearrangements between two
equilibrium states.

representations, a mathematical model for a physical system that contains both
its quantum and classical aspects. The physically observable system is
associated with the space containing elements fxf for f an element in the
regular representation of a given finite group G. The Hermitian portion of fxf
is the Wigner distribution of f whose convolution with a test function leads to
a mathematical description of the quantum measurement process. Starting with
the Jacobi group that is formed from the semidirect product of the Heisenberg
group with its automorphism group SL(2,F{N}) for N an odd prime number I show
that the classical phase space is the first order term in a series of subspaces
of the Hermitian portion of fxf that are stable under SL(2,F{N}). I define a
derivative that is analogous to a pseudodifferential operator to enable a
treatment that parallels the continuum case. I give a new derivation of the
Schrodinger-Weil representation of the Jacobi group. Keywords: quantum

few mode approximation. This method has already been used to successfully
analyze the vibrational modes in various molecular systems and offers a new
perspective on the dynamics in many particle bosonic systems. We discuss a
system consisting of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a triple well potential.
Such systems correspond to classical Hamiltonian systems with three degrees of
freedom. The semiclassical approach allows a simple visualization of the
eigenstates of the quantum system referring to the underlying classical
dynamics. From this classification we can read off the dynamical properties of
the eigenstates such as particle exchange between the wells and entanglement
without further calculations. In addition, this approach offers new insights
into the validity of the mean-field description of the many particle system by
the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, since we make use of exactly this correspondence
in our semiclassical analysis. We choose a three mode system in order to
visualize it easily and, moreover, to have a sufficiently interesting
structure, although the method can also be extended to higher dimensional
systems.
