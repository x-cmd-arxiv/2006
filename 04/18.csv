redshifts of z = 0.051, 0.060, and 0.071. All clusters of the supercluster are
located in these filaments. We determined the total K_s-band luminosities and
masses for 11 clusters of galaxies within comparable physical regions (within a
radius R_200 close to the virial radius) using a homogeneous method. We
constructed a combined luminosity function for the supercluster in this region,
which can be described by the Schechter function with the following parameters:
M*_K = -24^m.50 and \alpha = -0.98. The infrared luminosities of the clusters
of galaxies correlate with their masses; the M/L_K ratios of the systems
increase with their masses (luminosities), with most of the Ursa Major clusters
of galaxies (particularly the richer ones) closely following the relations
derived previously for a large sample of clusters and groups of galaxies. The
total mass-to-infrared-luminosity ratio is 52 M_{\odot}/L_{\odot} for six Abell
clusters and 49 M_{\odot}/L_{\odot} for all of the clusters, except Anon2.

detected lines to solve for the independent velocity-dependent covering factors
of the continuum and emission-line sources and ionic column densities. This
reveals increasing covering factors in components with greater outflow
velocity. Narrow substructure is revealed in the optical depth profiles,
suggesting the relatively broad absorption is comprised of a series of multiple
components. We perform velocity-dependent photoionization modeling, which
allows a full solution to the C, N, and O abundances, as well as the velocity
resolved ionization parameter and total column density. The absorbers are found
to have supersolar abundances, with [C/H] and [O/H] ~0.5 -- 0.9, and [N/H] ~
1.1 -- 1.3, consistent with enhanced nitrogen production expected from
secondary nucleosynthesis processes. Independent fits to each kinematic
component give consistent results for the abundances. The lowest-ionization
material in each of the strong absorbers is modeled with similar ionization
parameters. Components of higher-ionization (indicated by stronger O VI

QUEST Survey has been searched for significant overdensities that may be debris
from disrupted dwarf galaxies or globular clusters. Away from the major
overdensities, the distribution of these stars is adequately fit by a smooth
halo model, in which the flattening of the halo decreases with increasing
galactocentric distance (Preston et al 1991). This model was used to estimate
the ``background'' of RRLS on which the halo overdensities are overlaid. A
procedure was developed for recognizing groups of stars that constitute
significant overdensities with respect to this background. To test this
procedure, a Monte Carlo routine was used to make artificial RRLS surveys that
follow the smooth halo model, but with Poisson distributed noise in the numbers
of RRLS and, within limits, random variations in the positions and magnitudes
of the artificial stars. The artificial surveys created by this routine were
examined for significant groups in exactly the same way as the QUEST survey.
These calculations provided estimates of the frequencies with which random
fluctuations produce significant groups. In the QUEST survey, there are six
significant overdensities that contain six or more stars and several smaller
ones. The small ones and possibly one or two of the larger ones may be
artifacts of statistical fluctuations, and they need to be confirmed by
measurements of radial velocity and/or proper motion. The most prominent groups
are the northern stream from the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy and a
large group in Virgo. Two other groups lie in the direction of the Monoceros
stream and at approximately the right distance for membership. Another group is
related to the globular cluster Palomar 5.

density-dependent smoothing which allows one to probe the lensing properties of
haloes from the densest regions in the center or in substructures to the
low-density regions in the outskirts. 'Smooth Particle Lensing' has some
promising features. First, the deflection potential, the deflection angles, the
convergence and the shear are direct and separate end-products of the SPL
calculation and can be computed at an arbitrary distribution of points on the
lens plane. Second, this flexibility avoids the use of interpolation or a
finite differentiation procedure on a grid, does not require padding the region
with zeros and focuses the computing power on relevant regions. The SPL
algorithm is tested by populating isothermal spheres and ellipsoids with
particles and then comparing the lensing calculations to the classical
FFT-based technique and analytic solutions. We assess issues related to the
resolution of the lensing code and the limitations set by the simulations
themselves. We conclude by discussing how SPL can be used to predict the impact
of substructures on strong lensing and how it can be generalized to weak
lensing and cosmic shear simulations.

acoustic oscillations in the late-time galaxy distribution. We argue that the
dominant non-linear effect is the differential motion of pairs of tracers
separated by 150 Mpc. These motions are driven by bulk flows and cluster
formation and are much smaller than the acoustic scale itself. We present a
model for the non-linear evolution based on the distribution of pairwise
Lagrangian displacements that provides a quantitative model for the degradation
of the acoustic signature, even for biased tracers in redshift space. The
Lagrangian displacement distribution can be calibrated with a significantly
smaller set of simulations than would be needed to construct a precise power
spectrum. By connecting the acoustic signature in the Fourier basis with that
in the configuration basis, we show that the acoustic signature is more robust
than the usual Fourier-space intuition would suggest because the beat frequency
between the peaks and troughs of the acoustic oscillations is a very small
wavenumber that is well inside the linear regime. We argue that any possible
shift of the acoustic scale is related to infall on 150 Mpc scale, which is
O(0.5%) fractionally at first-order even at z=0. For the matter, there is a
first-order cancellation such that the mean shift is O(10^{-4}). However,
galaxy bias can circumvent this cancellation and produce a sub-percent
systematic bias.

correctable process. By suitable reconstruction of the linear density field,
one can sharpen the acoustic peak in the correlation function or, equivalently,
restore the higher harmonics of the oscillations in the power spectrum. With
this, one can achieve better measurements of the acoustic scale for a given
survey volume. Reconstruction is particularly effective at low redshift, where
the non-linearities are worse but where the dark energy density is highest. At
z=0.3, we find that one can reduce the sample variance error bar on the

exist it is unlikely that they contain an iron core. We propose an alternative

winds: various evidence indicates that currently accepted mass-loss rates,
Mdot, may need to be revised downwards significantly. This is because the most
commonly used mass-loss diagnostics are affected by ``clumping'' (small-scale
density inhomogeneities), influencing our interpretation of observed spectra
and fluxes. Such downward revisions would have dramatic consequences for the
evolution of, and feedback from, massive stars, and thus robust determinations
of the clumping properties and mass-loss rates are urgently needed. Here, we
present a first attempt to constrain the radial stratification of the so-called
clumping factor. To this end, we have analyzed a sample of 19 Galactic O-type
supergiants/giants, by combining data for Halpha, IR, mm and radio fluxes, and
using appropriate analysis methods. Clumping has been included into our
analysis in the ``conventional'' way, by assuming the inter-clump matter to be
void. Because (almost) all our diagnostics depends on the square of density, we
cannot derive absolute clumping factors, but only factors normalized to a
certain minimum. This minimum was usually found to be located in the outermost,
radio-emitting region, i.e., the radio mass-loss rates are the lowest ones,
compared to Mdot derived from Halpha and the IR. The radio rates agree well
with those predicted by theory, but are only upper limits, due to unknown
clumping in the outer wind. Our most important result concerns a (physical)
difference between denser and thinner winds: for denser winds, the innermost
region is more strongly clumped than the outermost one (with a normalized
clumping factor of 4.1+/-1.4), whereas thinner winds have similar clumping
properties in the inner and outer regions.

of the component separation of the microwave sky. Specifically, flat
two-dimensional simulations of the microwave sky comprising all astrophysical

discuss our current results on point source detection by comparing them with
those obtained using the Mexican Hat Wavelet (MHW) technique, which has been
already proven a suitable tool for detecting point sources. By assuming a 5%

Our optical spectrum of lens image A shows an enhancement in the blue emission

line variations which are selectively magnified in image A by microlensing. The

transformations in constraining their mixing under renormalisation. By
employing the Schroedinger functional, a set of non-perturbative
renormalisation conditions can be defined in terms of suitable correlation
functions. As a first step in a fully non-perturbative determination of the
scale-dependent renormalisation factors, we evaluate these conditions in
lattice perturbation theory at one loop. Thereby we verify the expected mixing
patterns and determine the anomalous dimensions of the operators at NLO in the
Schroedinger functional scheme. Finally, by employing twisted-mass QCD it is
shown how finite subtractions arising from explicit chiral symmetry breaking

gauge fields. On this group one can define generalized field strength tensors,
which are transforming homogeneously with respect to the extended gauge
transformations. The generalized field strength tensors allow to construct two
infinite series of gauge invariant quadratic forms. Each term of these infinite
series is separately gauge invariant. The invariant Lagrangian is a linear sum
of these forms and describes interaction of tensor gauge fields of arbitrarily
large integer spins 1,2,.... It does not contain higher derivatives of the
tensor gauge fields, and all interactions take place through three- and
four-particle exchanges with dimensionless coupling constant. The first term in
this sum is the Yang-Mills Lagrangian.
  The invariance with respect to the extended gauge transformations does not
fix the coefficients - the coupling constants - in front of these forms. There
is a freedom to vary them without breaking the extended gauge symmetry. We
demonstrate that by an appropriate tuning of these coupling constants one can
achieve an enhancement of the extended gauge symmetry. This leads to highly
symmetric equations. We present the explicit form of the free equations for the

an expansion in terms of zonal polynomials, one obtain an expansion in powers

Coulombic one we study the classical scattering theory in the low-energy
regime. We construct a (continuous) family of classical orbits parametrized by
initial position $x\in \R^d$, final direction $\omega\in S^{d-1}$ of escape (to
infinity) and the energy $\lambda\geq 0$, yielding a complete classification of
the set of outgoing scattering orbits. The construction is given in the
outgoing part of phase-space (a similar construction may be done in the
incoming part of phase-space). For fixed $\omega\in S^{d-1}$ and $\lambda\geq
0$ the collection of constructed orbits constitutes a smooth manifold that we
show is Lagrangian. The family of those Lagrangians can be used to study the
quantum mechanical scattering theory in the low-energy regime for the class of
potentials considered here. We devote this study to a subsequent paper.

of the system, viz. the distribution of eigenvalues of the one step stability

the burst solutions can be quasi-periodic or travelling wave. The usual
characterizers of bifurcations, i.e. the eigenvalues of the stability matrix
crossing the unit circle, pick up the bifurcation from the synchronized
solution to SI with quasi-periodic bursts but are unable to pick up the
bifurcation of the synchronized solution to SI with TW bursts. Other
characterizers, such as the Shannon entropy of the eigenvalue distribution, and
the rate of change of the largest eigenvalue with parameter are required to
pick up this bifurcation. This feature has also been seen for other
bifurcations in this system, e.g. that from the synchronized solution to kink
solutions. We therefore conjecture that in the case of high dimensional

consider the limit of gases whose relaxation time is extremely fast so that the

velocities obey the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution) after any collision with
the piston. Then by using kinetic theory we derive the collision statistics

investigated the changes in this energy transfer process in broad-band forced
turbulence where an additional perturbation of flow at smaller scales is
introduced. The modulation of the energy dynamics via the introduction of
forcing at smaller scales occurs not only in the forced region but also in a
broad range of length-scales outside the forced bands due to non-local triad
interactions. Broad-band forcing changes the energy distribution and energy
transfer function in a characteristic manner leading to a significant
modulation of the turbulence. We studied the changes in this transfer of energy
when changing the strength and location of the small-scale forcing support. The
energy content in the larger scales was observed to decrease, while the energy
transport power for scales in between the large and small scale forcing regions
was enhanced. This was investigated further in terms of the detailed transfer
function between the triad contributions and observing the long-time statistics
of the flow. The energy is transferred toward smaller scales not only by
wavenumbers of similar size as in the case of large-scale forced turbulence,
but by a much wider extent of scales that can be externally controlled.

amplitude- and phase-modulated femtosecond laser pulses. For this purpose a
perturbative model for the light-matter interaction is developed and combined
with a genetic algorithm for adaptive feedback control of the laser pulse
shapes. The model is applied to the formation of 85Rb2 molecules in a
magneto-optical trap. We find for optimized pulse shapes an improvement for the
formation of ground state molecules by more than a factor of 10 compared to
unshaped pulses at the same pump-dump delay time, and by 40% compared to
unshaped pulses at the respective optimal pump-dump delay time. Since our model
yields directly the spectral amplitudes and phases of the optimized pulses, the
results are directly applicable in pulse shaping experiments.

microtubules (MTs) in a bounded domain is introduced for studying the role of a
cell edge in vivo and analyzing the effect of competition for a limited amount
of tubulin. The model differs from earlier models in that the evolution of MTs
is based on the rates of single unit (e.g., a heterodimer per protofilament)
transformations, in contrast to postulating effective rates/frequencies of
larger-scale changes, extracted, e.g., from the length history plots of MTs.
Spontaneous GTP hydrolysis with finite rate after polymerization is assumed,
and theoretical estimates of an effective catastrophe frequency as well as
other parameters characterizing MT length distributions and cap size are
derived. We implement a simple cap model which does not include vectorial
hydrolysis. We demonstrate that our theoretical predictions, such as steady
state concentration of free tubulin, and parameters of MT length distributions,
are in agreement with the numerical simulations. The present model establishes
a quantitative link between microscopic parameters governing the dynamics of
MTs and macroscopic characteristics of MTs in a closed system. Lastly, we use a
computational Monte Carlo model to provide an explanation for non-exponential
MT length distributions observed in experiments. In particular, we show that
appearance of such non-exponential distributions in the experiments can occur
because the true steady state has not been reached, and/or due to the presence
of a cell edge.

  the Lowest Order","6 pages, 5 figures",,"10.1016/j.optcom.2007.05.057",,"quant-ph",,"  Current proposals focusing on neutral atoms for quantum computing are mostly
based on using single atoms as quantum bits (qubits), while using cavity
induced coupling or dipole-dipole interaction for two-qubit operations. An
alternative approach is to use atomic ensembles as qubits. However, when an
atomic ensemble is excited, by a laser beam matched to a two-level transition
(or a Raman transition) for example, it leads to a cascade of many states as
more and more photons are absorbed^1. In order to make use of an ensemble as a
qubit, it is necessary to disrupt this cascade, and restrict the excitation to
the absorption (and emission) of a single photon only. Here, we show how this
can be achieved by using a new type of blockade mechanism, based on the
light-shift imbalance (LSI) in a Raman transition. We describe first a simple
example illustrating the concept of light shift imbalanced induced blockade
(LSIIB) using a multi-level structure in a single atom, and show verifications
of the analytic prediction using numerical simulations. We then extend this
model to show how a blockade can be realized by using LSI in the excitation of
an ensemble. Specifically, we show how the LSIIB process enables one to treat
the ensemble as a two level atom that undergoes fully deterministic Rabi
oscillations between two collective quantum states, while suppressing
excitations of higher order collective states.

quantum bit (qubit) for quantum communication and quantum computing.
Specifically, we show how to realize a C-NOT gate using the collective qubit
and an easily accessible ring cavity, via an extension of the so-called
Pellizzari scheme. We also describe how multiple, small-scale quantum computers
realized using these qubits can be linked effectively for implementing a
quantum internet. We describe the details of the energy levels and transitions
in 87Rb atom that could be used for implementing these schemes.
