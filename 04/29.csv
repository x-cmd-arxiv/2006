collimated, the scale of these jets and the stellar density at galactic centers
implies that there will be many jet/star interactions, which can mass-load the
jet through stellar winds. Previous work employed modest wind mass outflow
rates, but this does not apply when mass loading is provided by a small number
of high mass-loss stars. We construct a framework for jet mass-loading by
stellar winds for a broader spectrum of wind mass-loss rates than has been
previously considered. Given the observed stellar mass distributions in
galactic centers, we find that even highly efficient (0.1 Eddington luminosity)
jets from supermassive black holes of masses $M_{BH} \la 10^4M_{\odot}$ are
rapidly mass loaded and quenched by stellar winds. For $10^4
M_{\odot}<M_{BH}<10^8 M_{\odot}$, the quenching length of highly efficient jets
is independent of the jet's mechanical luminosity. Stellar wind mass-loading is
unable to quench efficient jets from more massive engines, but can account for
the observed truncation of the inefficient M87 jet, and implies a baryon
dominated composition on scales $\ga 2$ kpc therein even if the jet is
initially pair plasma dominated.

distribution derived from planetary nebulae leads to the establishment of
radial abundance gradients in the galactic disk that are important constraints
to model the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. The radial gradient, well
determined for the solar neighborhood, is examined for distinct regions. For
the galactic anticenter in particular, the observational data confirm results
from galactic evolution models that point to a decreasing in the gradient slope
at large galactocentric distances. The possible time evolution of the radial
gradient is also examined comparing samples of planetary nebulae of different
ages, and the results indicate that a flattening in the gradient occurred,
which is confirmed by some galactic evolution models. The galactic bulge is
another important region whose modeling can be constrained by observational

when stars in a common gravitational potential accrete from a distributed
gaseous component. We show that concerns recently raised on the efficiency of
competitive accretion are incorrect as they use globally averaged properties
which are inappropriate for the detailed physics of a forming stellar cluster.
A full treatment requires a realistic treatment of the cluster potential, the
distribution of turbulent velocities and gas densities. Accreting gas does not
travel at the global virial velocity of the system due to the
velocity-sizescale relation inherent in turbulent gas and due to the lower
velocity dispersion of small-N clusters in which much of the accretion occurs.
Stars located in the gas-rich centres of such systems initially accrete from
low relative velocity gas attaining larger masses before needing to accrete the
higher velocity gas. Stars not in the centres of such potentials, or that enter
the cluster later when the velocity dispersion is higher, do not accrete
significantly and thus retain their low-masses. In competitive accretion, most
stars do not continue to accrete significantly such that their masses are set
from the fragmentation process. It is the few stars which continue to accrete
that become higher-mass stars. Competitive accretion is therefore likely to be
responsible for the formation of higher-mass stars and can explain the mass
distribution, mass segregation and binary frequency of these stars. Global
kinematics of competitive accretion models include large-scale mass infall,
with mean inflow velocities of order 0.5 km/s at scales of 0.5 pc, but infall
signatures are likely to be confused by the large tangential velocities and the
velocity dispersion present.

have indicated that high velocity ejecta interact with a pre-existing red giant
wind, setting up shock systems analogous to those seen in Supernova Remnants.
However, in the previous outburst in 1985, X-ray observations did not commence
until 55 days after the initial explosion. Here we report on Swift observations
covering the first month of the 2006 outburst with the Burst Alert (BAT) and
X-ray Telescope (XRT) instruments. RS Oph was clearly detected in the BAT 14-25
keV band from t=0 to $t\sim6$ days. XRT observationsfrom 0.3-10 keV, started at
3.17 days after outburst. The rapidly evolving XRT spectra clearly show the
presence of both line and continuum emission which can be fitted by thermal
emission from hot gas whose characteristic temperature, overlying absorbing
column, $[N_H]_W$, and resulting unabsorbed total flux decline monotonically
after the first few days. Derived shock velocities are in good agreement with
those found from observations at other wavelengths. Similarly, $[N_H]_W$ is in
accord with that expected from the red giant wind ahead of the forward shock.
We confirm the basic models of the 1985 outburst and conclude that standard
Phase I remnant evolution terminated by $t\sim10$ days and the remnant then
rapidly evolved to display behaviour characteristic of Phase III. Around t=26
days however, a new, luminous and highly variable soft X-ray source began to
appear whose origin will be explored in a subsequent paper.

the cluster. The PDMF was parameterized as a power law in the available
main-sequence mass range of each cluster, typically 0.9 <~ m/M_sun <~ 2.5; its
slope was determined at different positions spanning from the very centre out
to several core radii. The CMDs in the central regions of the clusters were
carefully studied earlier, resulting in accurate age, metallicity, distance
modulus, and reddening values. The slope alpha (where Salpeter is 2.35) was
determined in annuli by following two distinct methods: 1) a power law fit to
the PDMF obtained from the systemic luminosity function (LF); 2) a statistical
comparison between observed and model CMDs. In all clusters, significant mass
segregation is found from the positional dependence of the PDMF slope: alpha <~
1.8 for R <= 1.0 R_core and alpha ~ Salpeter inside R=2~3 R_core (except for
Hodge 14, where alpha ~ Salpeter for R ~ 4 R_core). The results are robust in
the sense that they hold true for both methods used. The CMD method reveals
that unresolved binaries flatten the PDMF obtained form the systemic LF, but
this effect is smaller than the uncertainties in the alpha determination. For
each cluster we estimated dynamical ages inside the core and for the entire
system. In both cases we found a trend in the sense that older clusters have
flatter PDMF, consistent with a dynamical mass segregation and stellar
evaporation.

Heyl (2003), including the regime of delayed mixed bursts. The results are also
consistent with observations of type I X-ray bursts. At accretion rates Mdot <
0.1 Mdot_Edd, thermonuclear He burning via the well-known thin-shell thermal
instability triggers bursts. As Mdot increases, however, the trigger mechanism
evolves from the fast thermal instability to a slowly growing overstability
involving both H and He burning. The competition between nuclear heating via
the beta-limited CNO cycle and the triple-alpha process on the one hand, and
radiative cooling via photon diffusion and emission on the other hand, drives
oscillations with a period approximately equal to the H-burning timescale. If
these oscillations grow, the gradually rising temperature at the base of the
helium layer eventually provokes a thin-shell thermal instability and hence a
delayed mixed burst. For Mdot > 0.25 Mdot_Edd, there is no instability or
overstability, and there are no bursts. Nearly all other theoretical models
predict that bursts should occur for all Mdot < Mdot_Edd, in conflict with both
our results and observations. We suggest that this discrepancy arises from the
assumed strength of the hot CNO cycle breakout reaction 15O(alpha,gamma)19Ne in
these other models. That observations agree much better with the results of
Narayan & Heyl and our two-zone model, both of which neglect breakout
reactions, may imply that the true 15O(alpha,gamma)19Ne cross section is much
smaller than assumed in previous investigations.

X-ray and UV/Optical afterglows by the Swift XRT and UVOT instruments. The
combination of the X-ray and UV/Optical observations provide the most
comprehensive lightcurves to date of a short-hard burst at such an early epoch.
The afterglows exhibit complex structure with different decay indices and
flaring. This behavior can be explained by the combination of a structured jet,
radiative loss of energy, and decreasing microphysics parameters occurring in a
circum-burst medium with densities varying by a factor of approximately two on
a length scale of 10^17 cm. These density variations are normally associated
with the environment of a massive star and inhomogeneities in its windy medium.
However, the mean density of the observed medium (n approximately 10^&#8722;4
cm^3) is much less than that expected for a massive star. Although the collapse
of a massive star as the origin of GRB 060313 is unlikely, the merger of a
compact binary also poses problems for explaining the behavior of this burst.
Two possible suggestions for explaining this scenario are: some short bursts
may arise from a mechanism that does not invoke the conventional compact binary
model, or soft late-time central engine activity is producing UV/optical but no

prominence does not correlate with the total radio luminosity (as does the core
power), but it anti-correlates with the surface brightness of the lobes of
sources, (ii) the energy density (and possibly the internal pressure) in the
lobes is independent of redshift for constant radio luminosity and size of the
sources, (iii) the equipartition magnetic-field strength, transformed into
constant source luminosity and redshift, strongly correlates with the source
size. We argue that this B_{eq} - D correlation reflects a more fundamental
correlation between B_{eq} and the source age, (iv) both the rotation and
depolarisation measures suggest Faraday screens local to the lobes of sources,
however their geometry and the composition of intervening material cannot be
determined from the global polarisation characteristics.

the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick mean field spin glass model for high temperatures,
or equivalently for high external fields. The basic idea was to couple two
different replicas with a quadratic term, trying to push out the two replica
overlap from its replica symmetric value. In the case of zero external field,
our results reproduced the well known validity of the annealed approximation,
up to the known critical value for the temperature. In the case of nontrivial
external field, our method could prove the validity of the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick replica symmetric solution up to a line, which fell
short of the Almeida-Thouless line, associated to the onset of the spontaneous
replica symmetry breaking, in the Parisi Ansatz. Here, we make a strategic
improvement of the method, by modifying the flow equations, with respect to the

fluctuations in the replica symmetric region. As a result, we give a simple
proof that replica symmetry holds up to the critical Almeida-Thouless line, as
expected on physical grounds. Our results are compared with the

We analyze the evolution of the magnetosubband structure as magnetic field
varies and show that it exhibits different features as compared to the case of
a smooth confinement. In particularly, in the hard-wall wire a deep and narrow
triangular potential well (of the width of magnetic length $l_B$) is formed in
the vicinity of the wire boundary. The wave functions are strongly localized in
this well which leads to the increase of the electron density near the edges.
Because of the presence of this well, the subbands start to depopulate from the
central region of the wire and remain pinned in the well region until they are
eventually pushed up by increasing magnetic field. We also demonstrate that the
spin polarization of electron density as a function of magnetic field shows a
pronounced double-loop pattern that can be related to the successive
depopulation of the magnetosubbands. In contrast to the case of a smooth
confinement, in hard-wall wires the compressible strips do not form in the

quantum dots and of crystalline patterns of neutral bosons in harmonic traps.
In a first example, we use calculations for two electrons in an elliptic
quantum dot to show that the electrons can localize and form a molecular dimer.
The calculated singlet-triplet splitting (J) as a function of the magnetic
field (B) agrees with cotunneling measurements, with its behavior reflecting
the effective dissociation of the dimer for large B. Knowledge of the dot shape
and of J(B) allows determination of the degree of entanglement. In a second
example, we study strongly repelling neutral bosons in two-dimensional harmonic
traps. Going beyond the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) mean-field approximation, we show
that bosons can localize and form polygonal-ring-like crystalline patterns. The
total energy of the crystalline phase saturates in contrast to the GP solution,
and its spatial extent becomes smaller than that of the GP condensate.

propagating waves. The total delay times for the evanescent waves can be
negative in an infinite plasma medium even for broad-band pulses. The total
time is, however, positive for broad band pulses in the presence of an
interface when the radiation is detected outside the plasma. We find evidence
of the Hartman effect for pulses when the distance traversed in the plasma is
much smaller than the free space pulse length. We also show that for a negative
refractive index medium(NRM) with $\epsilon(\omega)$ = $\mu(\omega)$ the
reshaping delay for propagating waves is identically zero. The total delay time
in NRM is otherwise dominated by the reshaping delay time, and for broad band

Although no one has ever touched Zeno without refuting him (Whitehead), it will
be our aim to show that, whatever it was that was refuted, it was certainly not
Zeno. The paper is organised in two parts. In the first part we will
demonstrate that upon direct analysis of the Greek sources, an underlying
structure common to both the Paradoxes of Plurality and the Paradoxes of Motion
can be exposed. This structure bears on a correct - Zenonian - interpretation
of the concept of division through and through. The key feature, generally
overlooked but essential to a correct understanding of all his arguments, is
that they do not presuppose time. Division takes place simultaneously. This
holds true for both PP and PM. In the second part a mathematical representation
will be set up that catches this common structure, hence the essence of all
Zeno's arguments, however without refuting them. Its central tenet is an
aequivalence proof for Zeno's procedure and Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis. Some
number theoretic and geometric implications will be shortly discussed.
Furthermore, it will be shown how the Received View on the motion-arguments can
easely be derived by the introduction of time as a (non-Zenonian) premiss, thus
causing their collapse into arguments which can be approached and refuted by
Aristotle's limit-like concept of the potentially infinite, which remained -
though in different disguises - at the core of the refutational strategies that
have been in use up to the present. Finally, an interesting link to Newtonian
mechanics via Cremona geometry can be established.

  This was previously known only for bounded domains R^n, in which case u is
infinity harmonic, that is, a viscosity solution to Delta_infty u = 0. We also
prove the first general uniqueness results for Delta_infty u = g on bounded
subsets of R^n (when g is uniformly continuous and bounded away from zero), and
analogous results for bounded length spaces.
  The proofs rely on a new game-theoretic description of u. Let u^epsilon(x) be
the value of the following two-player zero-sum game, called tug-of-war: fix
x_0=x \in X minus Y. At the kth turn, the players toss a coin and the winner
chooses an x_k with d(x_k, x_{k-1})< epsilon. The game ends when x_k is in Y,
and player one's payoff is
  F(x_k) - (epsilon^2/2) sum_{i=0}^{k-1} g(x_i)
  We show that the u^\epsilon converge uniformly to u as epsilon tends to zero.
Even for bounded domains in R^n, the game theoretic description of
infinity-harmonic functions yields new intuition and estimates; for instance,
we prove power law bounds for infinity-harmonic functions in the unit disk with
boundary values supported in a delta-neighborhood of a Cantor set on the unit

light guidance through waveguide bends is by introducing an equivalent straight
waveguide with refractive index profile modified to account for actual
waveguide bend. Here we revise the commonly used equivalent-index formula,
ending up with its simple extension that enables rigorous treatment of one- and
two-dimensionally confined, uniformly bent waveguides, including tightly coiled
microstructure fibers, curved ridge waveguides and ring microresonators. We
also show that such technique is applicable only to waveguides composed of
isotropic or uniaxially anisotropic materials, with anisotropy axis directed
perpendicular to the curvature plane.

physics requires the presence of classical electromagnetic zero-point
radiation, the restriction to relativistic (Coulomb) scattering systems, and
the use of discrete charge. The contrasting scaling properties of
nonrelativistic classical mechanics and classical electrodynamics are noted,
and it is emphasized that the solutions of classical electrodynamics found in
nature involve constants which connect together the scales of length, time, and
energy. Indeed, there are analogies between the electrostatic forces for groups
of particles of discrete charge and the van der Waals forces in equilibrium
thermal radiation. The differing Lorentz- or Galilean-transformation properties
of the zero-point radiation spectrum and the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum are noted
in connection with their scaling properties. Also, the thermal effects of
acceleration within classical electromagnetism are related to the existence of
thermal equilibrium within a gravitational field. The unique scaling and
phase-space properties of a discrete charge in the Coulomb potential suggest
the possibility of an equilibrium between the zero-point radiation spectrum and
matter which is universal (independent of the particle mass), and an
equilibrium between a universal thermal radiation spectrum and matter where the
matter phase space depends only upon the ratio mc^2/kT. The observations and
qualitative suggestions made here run counter to the ideas of currently
accepted quantum physics.

that both linear and quadratic disturbances produce sizable effects for
long-distance propagation. The quadratic terms are shown to suppress the
correlation of waves with different wave vectors. We examine the intensity
fluctuations of partially coherent beams (beams whose initial spatial coherence
is partially destroyed). Our calculations show that it is possible to
significantly reduce the intensity fluctuations by using a partially coherent
beam. The physical mechanism responsible for this pronounced reduction is
similar to that of the Hanbury-Braun, Twiss effect.

order thermal fluctuation to encompass ""generalized fluctuations"" in any Bose
field, P. E. Gordon has proposed alternative definitions for nth order
coherence and nth order coherent states. The main point of this paper is to
explore some of the physical insights to be gained by extending dualism to
higher orders. Recent experiments have examined aspects of the coherence of
Bose-Einstein condensates. It has been argued that the condensate state is
coherent to (at least) second or third order, but the coherence properties of
Bose-Einstein condensates remain somewhat controversial. Using probability
distributions developed by M. O. Scully and V. V. Kocharovsky et. al., we apply
Gordon's dualistic expression of the coherence conditions to investigate
coherence properties in Bose-Einstein condensation. Via numerical calculations,
we present a graphical survey of wave-like and particle-like fluctuations in
condensed and uncondensed fractions. Near the critical point, we find a very
marked peak in the ratio of nth order wave to nth order particle fluctuations
in the condensate. Not surprisingly, n-point correlations between the positions
of condensate atoms also peak near the critical temperature, and this
apparently mirrors, to higher orders, the well-known relation between the
integral of the 2-point correlation function over a certain volume and the rms
fluctuation in the number of particles in that volume.
