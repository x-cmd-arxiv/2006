rotating, magnetized plasma disk is investigated in the multi-fluid framework.
The disk is threaded by a uniform vertical magnetic field and charge is carried
by electrons and ions only. The inclusion of ion dynamics causes significant
modification to the conductivity tensor in a weakly ionized disk. The parallel,
Pedersen and Hall component of conductivity tensor become time dependent
quantities resulting in the AC and DC part of the conductivity. The
conductivity may change sign leading to the significant modification of the
parameter window in which MRI may operate.
  The effect of ambipolar and Hall diffusion on the linear growth of the MRI is
examined in the presence of time dependent conductivity tensor. We find that
the growth rate in ambipolar regime can become somewhat larger than the
rotational frequency, especially when the departure from ideal MHD is
significant. Further, the instability operates on large scale lengths. This has
important implication for the angular momentum transport in the disk.

ellipticals are very similar to those of normal galaxies. They can be fitted
with a thermal plasma (kT~0.5 keV) plus a power law (photon index of 1.3-1.5)

with L(0.5-10 keV)~10^37-10^40 erg/s. The average cumulative luminosity
functions for sources in spirals and ellipticals are identical to those of
normal galaxies. In the innermost circle of 2.5"" radius in each galaxy we find
an AGN in 12 of the 19 galaxies. The AGNs contribute a median of 60% of the
0.5-10 keV luminosity of the central 2.5"" region, they have luminosities of
10^37-10^39 erg/s (Eddington ratios 10^-8 to 10^-5). The ionizing luminosity of
the AGNs is not enough to power the observed optical emission lines in this
particular sample. Thus, we suggest that the lines are powered either by the
mechanical interaction of an AGN jet (or wind) with the circumnuclear gas, or
by stellar processes, e.g. photoionization by post-AGB stars or young stars.

photometric shape and amount of rotational or anisotropical support in
elliptical galaxies may provide vital clues to how they formed. Elliptical
galaxies appear to fall into two distinct categories based on these parameters:
bright, boxy shaped, with little or no rotation, and less luminous, disky
shaped with significant rotation. One viable formation scenario is the ``Merger
hypothesis,'' in which two disk galaxies merge to form a new elliptical galaxy.
A comparison of the luminosity, photometric shape, and amount of rotation in
advanced merger remnants may shed more light on the possible formation
scenarios of elliptical galaxies. Yet, little observational data exists for
such merger remnants. This paper is the third in a series investigating the
photometric and kinematic properties of a sample of 51 optically selected
advanced merger remnants. Presented here are K-band isophotal shapes and
spatially resolved kinematics for a sub-sample of 37 merger remnants. The
results show that ~ 11% of the sample are boxy, and anisotropically supported
while ~ 47% are disky, and rotationally supported. The remainder of the sample
show variations among expected correlations between shape and rotation. This
may suggest that the isophotal shapes are still ``in flux.'' There does appear
to be a lower limit to the amount of anisotropy observed in the merger
remnants. This may provide an observational diagnostic for discriminating among
formation scenarios in elliptical galaxies.

spin-glass model in a recent Letter (P. Sibani and H.J. Jensen, Europhys.
Lett.69, 563 (2005)). The present system, which lacks quenched randomness,
consists of Ising spins located on a cubic lattice, with each plaquette
contributing to the total energy the product of the four spins located at its
corners. Similarly to our previous findings, energy leaves the system in rare
but large, so called intermittent, bursts which are embedded in reversible and
equilibrium-like fluctuations of zero average. The intermittent bursts, or
quakes, dissipate the excess energy trapped in the initial state at a rate
which falls off with the inverse of the age. This strongly heterogeneous
dynamical picture is explained using the idea that quakes are triggered by
energy fluctuations of record size, which occur independently within a number
of thermalized domains. From the temperature dependence of the width of the
reversible heat fluctuations we surmise that these domains have an exponential
density of states. Finally, we show that the heat flow consists of a
temperature independent term and a term with an Arrhenius temperature
dependence. Microscopic dynamical and structural information can thus be
extracted from numerical intermittency data. This type of analysis seems now
within the reach of time resolved micro-calorimetry techniques.

aggregation. Traditional approaches have been using network theory, and the
theory of random networks. Under that paradigm, every social agent is
represented by a node, and every social interaction is represented by a segment
connecting two nodes. Early work in family interactions, as well as more recent
work in the study of terrorist organizations, shows that network modeling may
be insufficient to describe the complexity of human social structures.
Specifically, network theory does not seem to have enough flexibility to
represent higher order aggregations, where several agents interact as a group,
rather than as a collection of pairs. The model we present here uses a well
established mathematical theory, the theory of simplicial complexes, to address
this complex issue prevalent in interpersonal and intergroup communication. The
theory enables us to provide a richer graphical representation of social
interactions, and to determine quantitative mechanisms to describe the
robustness of a social structure. We also propose a methodology to create
random simplicial complexes, with the purpose of providing a new method to
simulate computationally the creation and disgregation of social structures.
Finally, we propose several measures which could be taken and observed in order
to describe and study an actual social aggregation occurring in interpersonal
and intergroup contexts.

function and the integer programming problem is solved by means of constraint
relaxation techniques. The proposed algorithms are suboptimal due to the
approximate objective function and the constraint relaxation steps. However,
they perform better than the conventional finger selection algorithm, which is
suboptimal since it ignores the correlation between multipath components, and
they can get quite close to the optimal scheme that cannot be implemented in
practice due to its complexity. In addition to the convex relaxation
techniques, a genetic algorithm (GA) based approach is proposed, which does not
need any approximations or integer relaxations. This iterative algorithm is
based on the direct evaluation of the objective function, and can achieve
near-optimal performance with a reasonable number of iterations. Simulation
results are presented to compare the performance of the proposed finger

limit the applicability of the model to energy-momentum scales much below the

study quark matter with Fermi momenta larger than the cutoff. In the present
work an extension of the model to high temperatures and densities recently
proposed by Casalbuoni, Gatto, Nardulli, and Ruggieri is used in connection
with an implicit regularization scheme. This is done by making use of scaling
relations of the divergent one-loop integrals that relate these integrals at
different energy-momentum scales. Fixing the pion decay constant at the chiral
symmetry breaking scale in the vacuum, the scaling relations predict a running
coupling constant that decreases as the regularization scale increases,
implementing in a schematic way the property of asymptotic freedom of quantum
chromodynamics. If the regularization scale is allowed to increase with density
and temperature, the coupling will decrease with density and temperature,
extending in this way the applicability of the model to high densities and
temperatures. These results are obtained without specifying an explicit
regularization. As an illustration of the formalism, numerical results are
obtained for the finite density and finite temperature quark condensate, and to
the problem of color superconductivity at high quark densities and finite
temperature.

left-handed quarks and N_f right-handed quarks which are localized at different

limit which we analyze (corresponding in particular to the large N_c limit of
the gauge theory), the theory undergoes a deconfinement phase transition at a
temperature T_d = 1 / 2 \pi R. For quark separations obeying L > L_c = 0.97 * R
the chiral symmetry is restored at this temperature, but for L < L_c = 0.97 * R
there is an intermediate phase which is deconfined with broken chiral symmetry,
and the chiral symmetry is restored at T = 0.154 / L. All of these phase
transitions are of first order.

canonical volume and ''horizontal'' area forms. As in the classical case, the
Sub-Riemannian minimal surfaces can be defined as the critical points of the
'`horizontal'' area functional. We derive an intrinsic equation for minimal
surfaces associated to a generic Sub-Riemannian structure of co-rank 1 in terms
of the canonical volume form and the ``horizontal'' normal. The presented
construction permits to describe the Sub-Riemannian minimal surfaces in a
generic Sub-Riemannian manifold and can be easily generalized to the case of
non-holonomic vector distributions of greater co-rank.
  The case of contact vector distributions, in particular the $(2,3)$-case, is
studied more in detail. In the latter case the geometry of the Sub-Riemannian
minimal surfaces is determined by the structure of their characteristic points
(i.e., the points where the hyper-surface touches the horizontal distribution)
and characteristic curves. It turns out that the known classification of the
characteristic points of the Sub-Riemannian minimal surfaces in the Heisenberg
group $H^1$ holds true for the minimal surfaces associated to a generic contact
$(2,3)$ distribution. Moreover, we show that in the $(2,3)$ case the
Sub-Riemannian minimal surfaces are the integral surfaces of a certain system
of ODE in the extended state space. In some particular cases the Cauchy problem
for this system can be solved explicitly. We illustrate our results considering
Sub-Riemannian minimal surfaces in the Heisenberg group and the group of

topology, where illicit paths are penalised with an infinite cost, and the
licit ones are measured. Its algebraic counterpart will be 'weighted algebraic
structures', equipped with a sort of directed seminorm.
  In the fundamental weighted category of a generalised metric space,
introduced here, each homotopy class of paths has a weight (or seminorm), which
is subadditive with respect to composition. We also study a more general
setting, spaces with weighted paths, which has finer quotients and strong links
with noncommutative geometry. Weighted homology of weighted cubical sets has
already been developed in a previous work, with similar results.

of both the directed percolation (DP) and non-DP class. STI with synchronized
laminar behaviour belongs to the DP class. The regimes of non-DP behaviour show
spatial intermittency (SI), where the temporal behaviour of both the laminar
and burst regions is regular, and the distribution of laminar lengths scales as
a power law. The regular temporal behaviour for the bursts seen in these
regimes of spatial intermittency can be periodic or quasi-periodic, but the
laminar length distributions scale with the same power-law, which is distinct
from the DP case. STI with traveling wave (TW) laminar states also appears in
the phase diagram. Soliton-like structures appear in this regime. These are
responsible for cross-overs with accompanying non-universal exponents. The
soliton lifetime distributions show power law scaling in regimes of long
average soliton life-times, but peak at characteristic scales with a power-law
tail in regimes of short average soliton life-times. The signatures of each
type of intermittent behaviour can be found in the dynamical characterisers of
the system viz. the eigenvalues of the stability matrix. We discuss the

based on complexity science concepts and theories; this research is focused on
the Great Power war dynamics in the time period 1495 - 1945. According to this
research, the international system has self-organized critical (SOC)
characteristics. A critical point is the attractor of the international system.
The war dynamics of Great Powers can be illustrated by a power law. As a result
of a driving force, the international system is constantly being pushed toward
this critical point. The security dilemma is a booster of this driving force.
Tension and frustration build up in the international system as a result of
various system thresholds, and are periodically discharged through wars. The
SOC characteristics of the international system result in a punctuated
equilibrium dynamic. The punctuations produce new international systems, each
with its specific characteristics. A quantifiable development of the
international system toward a condition of increased stability and reduced
resilience can be observed. In addition to SOC characteristics, the
international system exhibits characteristics of a chaotic system. Chaos, order
and development are closely linked. The SOC dynamics generate a process of
social expansion. It is possible to explain the social integration of Europe
from this perspective.

kind recently made by Anton Zeilinger.

  Complexity","11 pages. Adding an application to quantum encryption schemes and
  correcting editorial errors","Quantum Information and Computation, 8, 0345-0358 (2008)",,,"quant-ph",,"  One of the central issues in the hidden subgroup problem is to bound the
sample complexity, i.e., the number of identical samples of coset states
sufficient and necessary to solve the problem. In this paper, we present
general bounds for the sample complexity of the identification and decision
versions of the hidden subgroup problem. As a consequence of the bounds, we
show that the sample complexity for both of the decision and identification
versions is $\Theta(\log|\HH|/\log p)$ for a candidate set $\HH$ of hidden
subgroups in the case that the candidate subgroups have the same prime order
$p$, which implies that the decision version is at least as hard as the
identification version in this case. In particular, it does so for the
important instances such as the dihedral and the symmetric hidden subgroup
problems. Moreover, the upper bound of the identification is attained by the
pretty good measurement. This shows that the pretty good measurement can
identify any hidden subgroup of an arbitrary group with at most $O(\log|\HH|)$
samples.

physical space and the deformation function of the deformed oscillator algebra
using non-linear coherent states approach. For this purpose, we study
two-dimensional harmonic oscillators on the flat surface and on a sphere by
applying the Higgs modell. With the use of their algebras, we show that the
two-dimensional oscillator algebra on a surface can be considered as a deformed
one-dimensional oscillator algebra where the effect of the curvature of the
surface is appeared as a deformation function. We also show that the curvature
of the physical space plays the role of deformation parameter. Then we
construct the associated coherent states on the flat surface and on a sphere
and compare their quantum statistical properties, including quadrature
squeezing and antibunching effect.

new insights into the nature of the Born rule, and impact on its understanding
