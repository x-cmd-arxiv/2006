galaxies. The energy released by an accreting Black Hole (BH) may be injected
into the ISM through blast waves arising directly from the central engine,
radiation pressure or radiative heating. A scenario is described in which
radiative heating perturbs the methabolism of a star-forming spheroid, leading
to a critical stage where SNe form a cold expanding shell, pushed out of the
galaxy by radiation pressure from the AGN. This mechanism can regulate the
BH--bulge relation to the observed value. However, this relation may be simply
imprinted by the mechanism responsible for the nearly complete loss of angular
momentum of the gas that accretes onto the BH. Using a novel model of galaxy
formation that includes AGNs, we show that models without self-regulation have
problems in reproducing the correct slope of the AGN luminosity function, while
models with winds give a much better fit; however, all these models are almost
indistingishable as far as their predicted BH--bulge relation is concerned.
Finally, we show that the downsizing of the faint AGNs is most likely due to
kinetic feedback in star-forming bulges.

seismic analysis, as it has a rich pulsation spectrum. The richness of its
pulsations, however, poses a fundamental challenge to understanding the
pulsations of these stars, as the mode density is too complex to be explained
only with radial and nonradial low degree (l < 3) p-modes without rotational
splittings. One proposed solution, for the case of PG 0014+067 in particular,
assigns some modes with high degree (l=3). On the other hand, theoretical
models of sdB stars suggest that they may retain rapidly rotating cores, and so
the high mode density may result from the presence of a few rotationally-split
triplet (l=1), quintuplet (l=2) modes, along with radial (l=0) p-modes. To
examine alternative theoretical models for these stars, we need better
frequency resolution and denser longitude coverage. Therefore, we observed this
star with the Whole Earth Telescope for two weeks in October 2004. In this
paper we report the results of Whole Earth Telescope observations of the
pulsating subdwarf B star PG 0014+067. We find that the frequencies seen in PG
0014+067 do not appear to fit any theoretical model currently available;
however, we find a simple empirical relation that is able to match all of the
well-determined frequencies in this star.

its path on the sky is very smooth and uniform, showing no evidence of

different radial annuli around the cluster core, no significant change in the

evidenced by the increasing depletion of the high-mass tail of the stellar mass

of star forming gas in the early Universe achieves statistical robustness, it
is now vital to identify and quantify the sources of systematic error. Because
the nature of optically-selected quasar surveys makes them vulnerable to dust
obscuration, we have undertaken a radio-selected quasar survey for damped Lya
systems to address this bias. We present the definition and results of this
survey. We then combine our sample with the CORALS dataset to investigate the
HI column density distribution function f(N) of damped Lya systems toward
radio-selected quasars. We find that f(N) is well fit by a power-law f(N) = k_1
N^alpha_1, with log k_1 = 22.90 and alpha_1 = -2.18. This power-law is in
excellent agreement with that of optically-selected samples at low N(HI), an
important yet expected result given that obscuration should have negligible
effect at these gas columns. However, because of the relatively small size of
the radio-selected sample, 26 damped Lya systems in 119 quasars, f(N) is not
well constrained at large N(HI) and the first moment of the HI distribution
function, Omega_g, is, strictly speaking, a lower limit. The power-law is steep
enough, however, that extrapolating it to higher column densities implies only
a modest, logarithmic increase in Omega_g. The radio-selected value of Omega_g
= 1.15 x 10^-3, agrees well with the results of optically-selected surveys.
While our results indicate that dust obscuration is likely not a major issue
for surveys of damped Lya systems, we estimate that a radio-selected sample of
approximately 100 damped Lya systems will be required to obtain the precision
necessary to absolutely confirm an absence of dust bias.

variation for X-ray and UV flares. An upper limit of the lag is estimated to be
\~1 min. From a timing analysis for X-ray data, we find that both pulsed and

0.15 - 10 keV. The net increase of pulsed flux to the quiescence is, however,
small and corresponds to about 3 - 4% of the increase in unpulsed flux,
confirming that a flux variation of flare in AE Aqr is dominated by unpulsed

of the quiescence at the beginning of the flare, but the spectrum becomes
harder as the flare advances. Based on these results, we discuss the current

Boolean valued models of set theory by constructing a model of set theory based
on quantum logic represented by the lattice of closed subspaces in a Hilbert
space and showed that appropriate quantum counterparts of ZFC axioms hold in
the model. Here, Takeuti's formulation is extended to construct a model of set
theory based on the logic represented by the lattice of projections in an
arbitrary von Neumann algebra. A transfer principle is established that enables
us to transfer theorems of ZFC to their quantum counterparts holding in the
model. The set of real numbers in the model is shown to be in one-to-one
correspondence with the set of self-adjoint operators affiliated with the von
Neumann algebra generated by the logic. Despite the difficulty pointed out by
Takeuti that equality axioms do not generally hold in quantum set theory, it is
shown that equality axioms hold for any real numbers in the model. It is also
shown that any observational proposition in quantum mechanics can be
represented by a corresponding statement for real numbers in the model with the
truth value consistent with the standard formulation of quantum mechanics, and
that the equality relation between two real numbers in the model is equivalent
with the notion of perfect correlation between corresponding observables
(self-adjoint operators) in quantum mechanics. The paper is concluded with some
remarks on the relevance to quantum set theory of the choice of the implication
connective in quantum logic.

pixels/mm2), self-triggering CMOS analog chip that we have developed as
pixelized charge collecting electrode of a Micropattern Gas Detector. This
device, which represents a big step forward both in terms of size and
performance, is the last version of three generations of custom ASICs of
increasing complexity. The CMOS pixel array has the top metal layer patterned
in a matrix of 105600 hexagonal pixels at 50 micron pitch. Each pixel is
directly connected to the underneath full electronics chain which has been
realized in the remaining five metal and two poly-silicon layers of a 0.18
micron VLSI technology. The chip has customizable self-triggering capability
and includes a signal pre-processing function for the automatic localization of
the event coordinates. In this way it is possible to reduce significantly the
readout time and the data volume by limiting the signal output only to those
pixels belonging to the region of interest. The very small pixel area and the
use of a deep sub-micron CMOS technology has brought the noise down to 50
electrons ENC. Results from in depth tests of this device when coupled to a
fine pitch (50 micron on a triangular pattern) Gas Electron Multiplier are
presented. The matching of readout and gas amplification pitch allows to get
optimal results. The application of this detector for Astronomical X-Ray
Polarimetry is discussed. The experimental detector response to polarized and
unpolarized X-ray radiation when working with two gas mixtures and two
different photon energies is shown. Results from a full MonteCarlo simulation
for several galactic and extragalactic atronomical sources are also reported.

time-dependent Schroedinger equation for the electronic and nuclear motion for
the interaction of intense femtosecond pulses. On these timescales the
rotational motion, even for such light molecules, is frozen. Therefore it is a
reasonable assumption that the nuclear alignment is fixed during the pulse
interaction and that rotation can be neglected. In terms of vibrational
relaxation, and since the nuclei are light, vibration will be important over
femtosecond timescales. Although homonuclear diatomics are IR-inactive, in an
intense field one can create vibrational excitation through continuum coupling.
To show the effect of vibration, consider a first approximation in which the
nuclei are infinitely massive so they maintain their positions at a fixed bond
length of R=2 a.u., throughout the process.

  pulse","2 pages","Annual Report 2004/2005, Central Laser Facility, RAL (2005) 90",,,"physics.atom-ph physics.comp-ph",,"  In our model the electron dynamics are described by a two-state
approximation. This might appear a rough approximation since it neglects
coupling through excited electronic states and ionization channels. However at
high intensity (laser fields equivalent to the Coulomb force) and long
wavelength (photon energy much lower than the ionization potential) the
dissociation process occurs by adiabatic polarization involving the lowest
electronic states. For the experiment in question, with intensities above 10x14
W cm-2 and photon energies of 1.5eV, such an approach is well justified. More
contentious is the neglect of rotational heating (that is molecular
realignment) during the pulse. However, this process is essentially an internal
relaxation and for a 50fs pulse it has a small effect. To calculate the
dissociation spectrum, we have applied discretization methods developed for
photoionization of molecules4) to solve the quantum equations in a dual
configuration and momentum space. Technical details are discussed in the paper
by Peng et al.

Later experiments confirmed these observations. These experiments confirmed the
generation of strong electric fields within the deuterided metals. These
electric fields accelerate the deuterons to keV energies and allow the observed
nuclear fusion. Roman Sioda and I suggested a theoretical description of this
nuclear fusion. Our ""extended micro hot fusion"" scenario explains how nuclear
fusion can be generated over a long time within deuterided metals. Moreover we
predicted the explosion of large pieces of deuterided metals. This article
reviews the ""cold fusion"" work of Steven Jones et al. and discusses the
fracto-fusion scenario. I show that the extended micro hot fusion scenario can
explain the observed neutron emissions, neutron bursts, and heat bursts.

sometimes be used to correct more errors than they can uniquely identify. Such
degenerate codes have long been known, but have remained poorly understood. We
provide a heuristic for designing degenerate quantum codes for high noise
rates, which is applied to generate codes that can be used to communicate over
almost any Pauli channel at rates that are impossible for a nondegenerate code.
The gap between nondegenerate and degenerate code performance is quite large,
in contrast to the tiny magnitude of the only previous demonstration of this
effect. We also identify a channel for which none of our codes outperform the
best nondegenerate code and show that it is nevertheless quite unlike any
channel for which nondegenerate codes are known to be optimal.

the Jordan-Wigner transformation, any spin-1/2 system is always associated with
a fermion system (called counterpart system). The comparison of concurrence and
mode concurrence can be made with the aid of the Marshall's sign rule for the
ground states of spin-1/2 $XXZ$ and spinless fermion chain systems. We observe
that there exists an inequality between concurrence and mode concurrence for
the ground states of the two corresponding systems. The spin-1/2 XY chain
system and its spinless fermion counterpart as a realistic example is discussed
