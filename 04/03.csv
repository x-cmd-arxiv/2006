stages: $p\simeq 0$ at high energy densities and $p\approx -\rho$ at small
ones. In the quartessence models analyzed up to now, the EOS is convex,
implying increasing adiabatic sound speed ($c_{s}^{2}$) as the energy density
decreases in an expanding Universe. A non-negligible $c_{s}^{2}$ at recent
times is the source of the matter power spectrum problem that plagued all
convex (non-silent) quartessence models. Viability for these cosmologies is
only possible in the limit of almost perfect mimicry to $\Lambda$CDM. In this
work we investigate if similarity to $\Lambda$CDM is also required in the class
of quartessence models whose EOS changes concavity as the Universe evolves. We
focus our analysis in the simple case in which the EOS has a step-like shape,
such that at very early times $p\simeq0$, and at late times $p\simeq const<0$.
For this class of models a non-negligible $c_{s}^{2}$ is a transient
phenomenon, and could be relevant only at a more early epoch. We show that
agreement with a large set of cosmological data requires that the transition
between these two asymptotic states would have occurred at high redshift
($z_t\gtrsim38$). This leads us to conjecture that the cosmic expansion history
of any successful non-silent quartessence is (practically) identical to the
$\Lambda$CDM one.

GRB. It was peculiar in many aspects. We show here that the X-ray,
ultraviolet/optical and radio afterglow of GRB 060218 have to be attributed to
different physical processes arising from different emission regions. From the
several components in this burst's afterglow only the radio afterglow can be
interpreted in terms of the common external shock model. We infer from the
radio that the blast wave's kinetic energy was $\sim 10^{50}$ erg and the
circumburst matter had a constant rather than a wind profile. The lack of a
""jet break"" up to 22 days implies that the outflow was wide $\theta_j >1$. Even
though the late X-ray afterglow decays normally it cannot result from an
external shock because of its very steep spectrum. Furthermore, the implied
kinetic energy would have produced far too much radio. We suggest that this
X-ray afterglow could be attributed to a continued activity of the central
engine that within the collapsar scenario could arise from fall-back accretion.
""Central engine afterglow"" may be common in under-luminous GRBs where the
kinetic energy of the blast wave is small and the external shock does not
dominate over this component. Such under-luminous GRBs might be very common but
they are rarely recorded because they can be detected only from short
distances.

is consistent with recent numerical finding that the void and field galaxies
have higher spin parameters than the cluster galaxies. Since the galaxy angular
momentum plays a role of developing a disk-like structure and hindering the

$\delta$ is expected, where $\nu F_{\nu,\gamma}$ and $\nu F_{\nu, \rm syn}$ are

the energy density of soft seed photons \citep{D97}. We estimate the soft
photon energy density in the relativistic blobs contributed by the broad line

The Doppler factors $\delta$ are derived from their radio core and X-ray

gas removal process in them. Recent releases of data from HI Parkes all sky

X-ray emission have allowed us to test this notion. In this paper, we address
the following questions: (a) do galaxies in groups with diffuse X-ray emission
statistically have lower gas content compared to the ones in groups without
diffuse X-ray emission? (b) does HI deficiency vary with the X-ray luminosity
of the loose group in a systematic way? We find that (a) galaxies in groups

lattice gases and 2) an exact diagonalization of finite spin systems of up to
N=30 sites. The considered spin systems exhibit universal behavior which is
determined by a specific hard-core object lattice gas representing the
independent localized magnon states. We test the lattice gas description by
comparing its predictions with the numerical results for low-lying energy
states of finite spin systems. For all frustrated spin systems considered we
find a strong variation of the low-temperature specific heat passing the
saturation field and a maximum in the isothermal entropy at saturation field

cuprates and find, contrary generally accepted lore, that pairing is not
exclusively in the CuO2 layers. Evidence for additional pairing interactions,
that take place outside the CuO2 layers, is found in two different classes of
cuprates, namely the charge reservoir and the chain layer cuprates. The
additional pairing in these layers suppresses fluctuations and hence enhances
Tc. Tcs higher than 100K, are found in the cuprates containing charge reservoir
layers with cations of Tl, Bi, or Hg that are known to be negative-U ions.
Comparisons with other cuprates that have the same sequence of optimally doped
CuO2 layers, but have lower Tcs, show that Tc is increased by factors of two or
more upon insertion of the charge reservoir layer(s). The Tl ion has been shown
to be an electronic pairing center in the model system (Pb,Tl)Te and data in
the literature that suggest it behaves similarly in the cuprates. A number of
other puzzling results that are found in the Hg, Tl, and Bi cuprates can be
understood in terms of negative-U ion pairing centers in the charge reservoir
layers. There is also evidence for additional pairing in the chain layer
cuprates. Superconductivity that originates in the double ""zigzag"" Cu chains
layers that has been recently demonstrated in NMR studies of Pr-247 leads to
the suggestion of a linear, charge 1, diamagnetic quasiparticle formed from a
charge-transfer exciton and a hole. Other properties of the chain layer
cuprates that are difficult to explain using models in which the pairing is
solely confined to the CuO2 layers can be understood if supplementary pairing

bridge representing a molecular level that connects between two free electron

molecular vibrational mode. The latter in turn is coupled to a phonon bath that
represents the thermal environment. We focus on the zero frequency noise
spectrum and study the changes in its behavior under weak and strong
electron-phonon interactions. In the weak coupling regime we find that the
noise amplitude can increase or decrease as a result of opening of an inelastic
channel, depending on distance from resonance and on junction asymmetry. In
particular the relative Fano factor decreases with increasing off resonance
distance and junction asymmetry. For resonant inelastic tunneling with strong
electron-phonon coupling the differential noise spectrum can show phonon
sidebands in addition to a central feature. Such sidebands can be observed when
displaying the noise against the source-drain voltage, but not in noise vs.
gate voltage plots obtained at low source-drain bias. A striking crossover of
the central feature from double to single peak is found for increasing
asymmetry in the molecule-leads coupling or increasing electron-phonon

use of noise data from scanning tunneling microscopy experiments for estimating
the magnitude of the electron-phonon interaction on the bridge is proposed.

amount of memory to store the matrix, but it also means that operations on this

stores only the non-zero elements is generally called sparse.
  Until recently Octave has lacked a full implementation of sparse matrices.
This article address the implementation of sparse matrices within Octave,
including their storage, creation, fundamental algorithms used, their
implementations and the basic operations and functions implemented for sparse

matrix fill-in and reordering for sparse matrix factorization is discussed in

are presented for multiplication and linear algebra operations for various

application of the maximum likelihood method to gravitational waves with

these problems have been based on rather different physical arguments.
Following these investigations, we now find that all these inconsistencies stem
from rank deficiency of the underlying network response matrix. In this paper
we show that the detection of gravitational-wave bursts with a network of

calculations which, in conjunction with Local Parton-Hadron Duality (LPHD),
predict that, due to colour coherence, the multiplicity distribution of

decreases. The expected correlation pattern is indeed observed down to pTcut
approx 1GeV but not at lower transverse momenta. Furthermore, for pcut to 0 GeV

expectation. The Monte Carlo models reproduce well the measurements at large

$\theta_{23}=\frac{\pi}{4}$. In addition it generates another zero mixing angle
and one zero mass difference. We restrict ourselves to type-I See-Saw mechanism

option for resonant leptogenesis. The degeneracy of the right handed neutrino

on the asymptotic expansion of classical statistical averages with respect to a

approximative and a better precision of measurements would induce deviations of
experimental averages from quantum mechanical ones. In this note we present a
natural physical interpretation of $\alpha$ as the time scaling parameter
(between quantum and prequantum times). By considering the Planck time $t_P$ as
the unit of the prequantum time scale we couple our prequantum model with
studies on the structure of space-time on the Planck scale performed in general
relativity, string theory and cosmology. In our model the Planck time $t_P$ is
not at all the {\it ""ultimate limit to our laws of physics""} (in the sense of
laws of classical physics). We study random (Gaussian) infinite-dimensional
fluctuations for prequantum times $s\leq t_P$ and show that quantum mechanical

Hubble expansion rate on the brane depends on the covariantly defined
integrated mass in the bulk, which determines the energy density of the
generalized dark radiation. The Friedmann equation has two branches,
distinguished by the two possible values of the parameter $\ex=\pm 1$. The
branch with $\ex=1$ is characterized by an effective cosmological constant and
accelerated expansion for low energy densities. Another remarkable feature is
that the contribution from the generalized dark radiation appears with a
negative sign. As a result, the presence of the bulk corresponds to an
effective negative energy density on the brane, without violation of the weak
energy condition. The transition from a period of domination of the matter
energy density by non-relativistic brane matter to domination by the
generalized dark radiation corresponds to a crossing of the phantom divide
$w=-1$.

for a sheafification needed for presheaves on a noncommutative space. The
moment space is constructed as a commutative space, approximating the
noncommutative space appearing as a dynamical space, via a stringwise
construction. The main result phrased is purely mathematical, i.e. the
noncommutative stalks of some sheaf on the noncommutative space can be
identified to stalks of some sheaf associated to it on the commutative geometry
(topology) of the moment space. This may be seen as a (partial) inverse to the
deformation--quantization idea, but in fact with a much more precise behaviour
of stalks of sheaves. The method, based on minimal axiomatics necessary to
rephrase continuity principles in terms of partial order (noncommutative
topology) exclusively, leads to the appearance of objects like strings and
(M--)branes. Also, spectral families and observables may be defined and studied
as separated filtrations on the noncommutative topology! We highlight the
relation with pseudo--places and generalized valuation theory. Finally, we hint
at a new notion of ``space'' as a dynamical system of noncommutative topologies
with the same commutative shadow (4 dimensional space--time if you wish) and
variable (but isomorphic) moment spaces, which for special choices may be
thought of as a higher dimensional brane--space.

dynamics, that is in particular crucial in the emergence of polymorphism and
spatial patterns. Recently, biological studies suggest that invasion and
evolution are closely related. Here we model the interplay between space and
evolution starting with an individual-based approach and show the important
role of parameter scalings on clustering and invasion. We consider a stochastic
discrete model with birth, death, competition, mutation and spatial diffusion,
where all the parameters may depend both on the position and on the trait of
individuals. The spatial motion is driven by a reflected diffusion in a bounded
domain. The interaction is modelled as a trait competition between individuals
within a given spatial interaction range. First, we give an algorithmic
construction of the process. Next, we obtain large population approximations,
as weak solutions of nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations with Neumann's
boundary conditions. As the spatial interaction range is fixed, the
nonlinearity is nonlocal. Then, we make the interaction range decrease to zero
and prove the convergence to spatially localized nonlinear reaction-diffusion
equations, with Neumann's boundary conditions. Finally, simulations based on
the microscopic individual-based model are given, illustrating the strong
effects of the spatial interaction range on the emergence of spatial and
phenotypic diversity (clustering and polymorphism) and on the interplay between
invasion and evolution. The simulations focus on the qualitative differences
between local and nonlocal interactions.

there are no `length contraction' or associated 'relativity of simultaneity'
effects in the latter theory. A thought experiment employing four
unsynchronised clocks and a single measuring rod reveals that the physical
basis of the time dilatation effect is a relative velocity transformation law,
not `length contraction'. Time dilatation, which is universal and translation
invariant for all synchronised clocks at rest in any inertial frame, is the

important role in many models of neural impulse generation. Noise is not only
introduced for more realistic simulations but also to account for cooperative
effects between noisy and nonlinear dynamics. Often, this is achieved by a
simple noise term in the membrane equation (current noise). However, there are
ongoing discussions whether such current noise is justified or whether rather
conductance noise should be introduced because it is closer to the natural
origin of noise. Therefore, we have compared the effects of current and
conductance noise in a neuronal model for subthreshold oscillations and action
potential generation. We did not see any significant differences in the model
behavior with respect to voltage traces, tuning curves of interspike-intervals,
interval distributions or frequency responses when the noise strength is
adjusted. These findings indicate that simple current noise can give reasonable
results in neuronal simulations with regard to physiological relevant noise
effects.
