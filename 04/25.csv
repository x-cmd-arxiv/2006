sample objects selected from the Herbig and Bell Catalog based on their spatial
proximity to AS 353. Radial velocities of nine objects were measured from
multi-epoch high-resolution (R~30,000) H-band spectra obtained with NIRSPEC on
Keck II. High-resolution K-band spectra were also obtained for most of the
sample objects. Spectral types and rotational velocities are determined for all
objects in the sample. The multi-epoch H-band spectra were examined for radial
velocity variations in order to detect possible spectroscopic binaries. Eight
of the nine objects have radial velocities that are consistent within the
1-sigma scatter of the sample. From their mean of -8.6 km/s these eight objects
have a standard deviation of 2 km/s, which suggests that the sample stars are
related. The ninth object shows significant radial velocity variations between
epochs, characteristic of a spectroscopic binary. The overall multiplicity of
the sample is high; we observed 13 stars in seven systems, identifying three
new candidate binary components in this project. Many of the spectra reveal
hydrogen emission lines typical of strong accretion processes, indicating that
most of these objects harbor circumstellar disks and are less than a few
million years old. We discuss possible interpretations of the enigmatic pure
emission line spectrum of HBC 684. This work represents the highest spectral
resolution infrared observations to date of these intriguing, nearby young

in the outer regions of the disc, it seems unlikely that these periods can be
communicated efficiently to the disc centre. Here we propose that the massive
outflow observed in SS433 is launched at large radii in the disc, about 1/10 of
the outer disc edge, and that it is this outflow which responds to the
oscillations of the outer disc and determines the direction of the jets. The
massive outflow is launched at large radius because the mass transfer rate is
hyper-Eddington. This implies not only that the total luminosity of SS433
exceeds $\le$ by a considerable factor, but also that the radiative output is
collimated along the outflow. We thus suggest that SS433 is an ultraluminous
X-ray source (ULX) viewed `from the side'. We also suggest that the obscured

small. Therefore K giants would be best suited as references. To confirm this
observationally a radial velocity survey is performed to quantify the level of
intrinsic variability in K giants.
  Aims: From this radial velocity survey we present 34 K giants with an
observed standard deviation of the radial velocity of less than 20 m/s. These
stars are considered ``stable'' and can be used as radial velocity standards.
  Methods: The radial velocity survey contains 179 K giants. All K giants have
a declination between -30 and +65 degrees and visual magnitude of 3-6 mag. The
Coude Auxiliary Telescope (CAT) at UCO/Lick Observatory is used to obtain
radial velocities with an accuracy of 5-8 m/s. The number of epochs for the 34
stable stars ranges from 11 to 28 with a total timespan of the observations
between 1800 and a little over 2200 days.
  Results: The observational results of the 34 ``stable'' stars are shown
together with a discussion about their position in the M_{V} vs. B-V diagram
and some conclusions concerning the radial velocity variability of K giants.
These results are in agreement with the theoretical predictions. K giants in a
certain range of the M_{V} vs. B-V diagram are suitable reference stars.

magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) plasma waves is the dominant process leading to the
formation of the high-energy electron and ion distributions in a variety of
astrophysical systems. Collisions with the waves influence both the
energization and the spatial transport of the particles, and therefore it is
important to treat these two aspects of the problem in a self-consistent
manner. We solve the representative Fokker-Planck equation to obtain a new,
closed-form solution for the time-dependent Green's function describing the
acceleration and escape of relativistic ions interacting with Alfven or
fast-mode waves characterized by momentum diffusion coefficient $D(p)\propto
p^q$ and mean particle escape timescale $t_esc(p) \propto p^{q-2}$, where $p$
is the particle momentum and $q$ is the power-law index of the MHD wave
spectrum. In particular, we obtain solutions for the momentum distribution of
the ions in the plasma and also for the momentum distribution of the escaping
particles, which may form an energetic outflow. The general features of the
solutions are illustrated via examples based on either a Kolmogorov or
Kraichnan wave spectrum. The new expressions complement the results obtained by
Park and Petrosian, who presented exact solutions for the hard-sphere
scattering case ($q=2$) in addition to other scenarios in which the escape
timescale has a power-law dependence on the momentum. Our results have direct
relevance for models of high-energy radiation and cosmic-ray production in

magnetized coronae around black holes.

bispectrum, paying particular attention to a joint analysis with the power
spectrum and their combination with CMB data. We address the covariance
properties of the power spectrum and bispectrum including the effects of beat
coupling that lead to interesting cross-correlations, and discuss how baryon
acoustic oscillations break degeneracies. We show that the bispectrum has
significant information on cosmological parameters well beyond its power in
constraining galaxy bias, and when combined with the power spectrum is more
complementary than combining power spectra of different samples of galaxies,
since non-Gaussianity provides a somewhat different direction in parameter
space. In the framework of flat cosmological models we show that most of the
improvement of adding bispectrum information corresponds to parameters related
to the amplitude and effective spectral index of perturbations, which can be
improved by almost a factor of two. Moreover, we demonstrate that the expected
statistical uncertainties in sigma8 of a few percent are robust to relaxing the
dark energy beyond a cosmological constant.

galaxy, Nc, is often used to infer the galaxy merger rate, however, recent
observational studies suggest that Nc evolves very little with redshift. Here
we use a ""hybrid"" N- body simulation plus analytic substructure model to
predict Nc directly. We identify dark matter subhalos with galaxies and show
that the observed lack of close pair count evolution arises because the high
merger rate per halo at early times is counteracted by a decrease in the number
of halos massive enough to host a galaxy pair. We compare our results to data
compiled from the DEEP2, SSRS2, and the UZC redshift surveys. Observed pair
counts match our predictions if we assume a monotonic mapping between galaxy
luminosity and the maximum circular velocity that each subhalo had when it was
first accreted onto its host halo. This suggests that satellite galaxies are
significantly more resilient to destruction than are dissipationless dark
matter subhalos. We argue that while Nc does not provide a direct measure of
the halo merger rate, it offers a powerful means to constrain the Halo
Occupation Distribution and the spatial distribution of galaxies within halos.
Interpreted in this way, close pair counts provide a useful test of galaxy
formation processes on < 100 kpc scales.

limited by statistical fluctuations in the number of Cosmic Ray initiated air

study the performance of simple event reconstruction methods when applied to

Spitzer (MIPS) instrument 160 micron detectors. We analyzed observations of an
8.5 square degree region in the Lockman Hole, part of the largest low-cirrus
mapping observation with this instrument. We measured the power spectrum of the
CFIB in these observations by fitting a power law to the IR cirrus component,
the dominant foreground contaminant, and subtracting this cirrus signal. The
CFIB power spectrum in the range 0.2 arc min^{-1} <k< 0.5 arc min^{-1} is
consistent with previous measurements of a relatively flat component. However,
we find a large power excess at low k, which falls steeply to the flat
component in the range 0.03 arc min^{-1} <k< 0.1 arc min^{-1}. This low-k power
spectrum excess is consistent with predictions of a source clustering
""signature"". This is the first report of such a detection in the far-IR.

  proceedings of 2005 Lake Hanas International Pulsar Symposium",,,,"astro-ph",,"  I review recent results concerning the shape of drifting subpulse patterns,
and the relationship to model predictions. While a variety of theoretical
models exist for drifting subpulses, observers typically think in terms of a
spatio-temporal model of circulating beamlets. Assuming the model is correct,
geometric parameters have been inferred and animated ""maps"" of the beam have
been made. However, the model makes very specific predictions about the
curvature of the drift bands that have remained largely untested. Work so far
in this area indicates that drift bands tend not to follow the prediction, and
in some cases discontinuities are seen that are suggestive of the superposition
of out of phase drift patterns. Recent polarimetric observations also show that
the drift patterns in the two orthogonal polarisation modes are offset in
phase. In one case the pattern in one of the modes shows a discontinuity
suggesting no less than three superposed, out-of-phase drift patterns! I advise
caution in the interpretation of observational data in the context of overly
simplistic models.

in the context of a high quality spectrum of the same source obtained with the
Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) on XMM-Newton. The data comprise over
955ks of usable exposure time and more than 26000 counts per 50 milliAngstrom

< 22.5 Angstroms) where sharp features due to the astrophysically abundant OVII
may reveal an intervening, warm--hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). We do not
confirm detection of any of the intervening systems claimed to date. Rather, we
detect only three unsurprising, astrophysically expected features down to the
Log(N_i)~14.6 (3 sigma) sensitivity level. Each of the two purported WHIM
features is rejected with a statistical confidence that exceeds that reported
for its initial detection. While we can not rule out the existence of fainter,
WHIM related features in these spectra, we suggest that previous discovery
claims were premature. A more recent paper by Williams et al. claims to have
demonstrated that the RGS data we analyze here do not have the resolution or
statistical quality required to confirm or deny the LETGS detections. We show
that our careful analysis resolves the issues encountered by Williams et al.
and recovers the full resolution and statistical quality of the RGS data. We
highlight the differences between our analysis and those published by Williams

We analyze the pattern of this flow at distances of a fraction of a parsec and
we argue that the net angular momentum of this material is low but
non-negligible, and the initially supersonic disk accretion changes into
subsonic flow with constant angular momentum. Next we estimate the flow
parameters at a distance $R_{BHL}$ from the black hole and we argue that for
the plausible parameter range the accretion flow is non-stationary. The inflow
becomes supersonic at distance of $\sim 10^4 R_g$ but the solution does not
continue below the horizon and the material piles up forming a torus, or a
ring, at a distance of a few up to tens of Schwarzchild radii. Such a torus is
known to be unstable and may explain strong variability of the flow in Sgr A*.
Our considerations show that the temporary formation of such a torus seems to
be unavoidable.
  Our best fitting model predicts a rather large accretion rate of around $4
\cdot 10^{-6} M_{\odot}/yr$ directly on Sgr A*. We argue that magnetic fields
in the flow are tangled and this allows our model to overcome the disagreement

this recombination, bind with electrons in atoms of anomalous isotopes with

this detection by a re-analysis of the original Chandra LETGS spectra, the
analysis of a large set of XMM-Newton RGS spectra of Mrk 421, and additional
Chandra observations. We address the reliability of individual spectral
features belonging to the absorption components, and assess the significance of
the detection of these components. We also use Monte Carlo simulations of
spectra. We confirm the apparent strength of several features in the Chandra
spectra, but demonstrate that they are statistically not significant. This
decreased significance is due to the number of redshift trials that are made
and that are not taken into account in the original discovery paper. Therefore
these features must be attributed to statistical fluctuations. This is
confirmed by the RGS spectra, which have a higher signal to noise ratio than
the Chandra spectra, but do not show features at the same wavelengths. Finally,
we show that the possible association with a Ly-alpha absorption system also
lacks sufficient statistical evidence. We conclude that there is insufficient
observational proof for the existence of the two proposed WHIM filaments
towards Mrk 421, the brightest X-ray blazar on the sky. Therefore, the highly
ionised component of the WHIM still remains to be discovered.

destroy the off-diagonal long range order, duality arguments predict the
formation of a Cooper pair crystal. This effect is thought to be responsible
for the static checkerboard patterns observed recently in various underdoped
cuprate superconductors by means of scanning tunneling spectroscopy. Breaking
of the translational symmetry in such a Cooper pair Wigner crystal may, under
certain conditions, lead to the emergence of low lying transverse vibrational
modes which could then contribute to thermodynamic and transport properties at
low temperatures. We investigate these vibrational modes using a continuum
version of the standard vortex-boson duality, calculate the speed of sound in
the Cooper pair Wigner crystal and deduce the associated specific heat and
thermal conductivity. We then suggest that these modes could be responsible for
the mysterious bosonic contribution to the thermal conductivity recently
observed in strongly underdoped ultraclean single crystals of YBCO tuned across
the superconductor-insulator transition.

us to suggest a constrained network, whereby each node only considers a few
neighboring nodes during encoding and decoding. We term this myopic coding and
calculate achievable rates for myopic coding. We show by examples that, when
nodes transmit at low SNR, these rates are close to that achievable by
omniscient coding, when the network is unconstrained . This suggests that a
myopic view of the network might be as good as a global view. In addition,
myopic coding has the practical advantage of being more robust to topology
changes. It also mitigates the high computational complexity and large

theories on orbifolds. After discussing the Abelian case in the standard
Feynman diagram approach, we extend the analysis to the non-Abelian case by
employing the method of an orbifold-compatible one-loop effective action for a
classical background gauge field. We find that bulk higher derivative and
brane-localised gauge kinetic terms are required to cancel one-loop divergences
of the gauge boson self energy. After their renormalisation we study the
momentum dependence of both the higher derivative coupling h(k^2) and the {\it
effective} gauge coupling g_eff(k^2). For momenta smaller than the
compactification scales, we obtain the 4D logarithmic running of g_eff(k^2),
with suppressed power-like corrections, while the higher derivative coupling is
constant. We present in detail the threshold corrections to the low energy
gauge coupling, due to the massive bulk modes. At momentum scales above the
compactification scales, the higher derivative operator becomes important and
leads to a power-like running of g_eff(k^2) with respect to the momentum scale.
The coefficient of this running is at all scales equal to the renormalised
coupling of the higher derivative operator which ensures the quantum
consistency of the model. We discuss the relation to the similar one-loop
correction in the heterotic string, to show that the higher derivative
operators are relevant in that case too, since the field theory limit of the
one-loop string correction does not commute with the infrared regularisation of
the (on-shell) string result.

introduced by Bars gives a natural generalisation to any dimension of the
formalism of Karabali and Nair which recently led to a new understanding of the
physics of QCD in dimension 2+1. After discussing the kinematics of these
variables, we compute the jacobian between the Yang-Mills and Bars variables
and propose a regularization procedure which preserves a generalisation of
holomorphic invariance. We discuss the construction of the QCD hamiltonian
properly regularized and compute the behavior of the vacuum wave functional
both at weak and strong coupling. We argue that this formalism allows the

problem in combinatorial discrepancy theory. In 1964, Roth proved that if each
integer from 0 to N is coloured red or blue, there is some arithmetic
progression in which the number of reds and the number of blues differ by at
least (1/20) N^{1/4}. In 1996, Matousek and Spencer showed that this estimate
is sharp up to a constant. The analogous question for homogeneous arithmetic
progressions (i.e., the ones containing 0) was raised by Erdos in the 1930s,
and it is still not known whether the discrepancy is unbounded. However, it is
easy to construct partial colourings with density arbitrarily close to 1 such
that all homogeneous arithmetic progressions have bounded discrepancy.
  A related problem concerns the discrepancy of quasi-progressions. A
quasi-progression consists of successive multiples of a real number, with each
multiple rounded down to the nearest integer. In 1986, Beck showed that given
any 2-colouring, the quasi-progressions corresponding to almost all real
numbers in (1, \infty) have discrepancy at least log* N, the inverse of the
tower function. We improve the lower bound to (log N)^{1/4 - o(1)}, and also
show that there is some quasi-progression with discrepancy at least (1/50)
N^{1/6}. Our results remain valid even if the 2-colouring is replaced by a
partial colouring of positive density.

  Bachelor of Science (Pure Mathematics) at The University of Western Australia",,,,"math.CO",,"  A finite linear space is a finite set of points and lines, where any two
points lie on a unique line. Well known examples include projective planes.
This project focuses on linear spaces which admit certain types of symmetries.
Symmetries of the space which preserve the line structure are called
automorphisms. A group of these is called an automorphism group of the linear
space. Two interesting properties of linear spaces are point imprimitivity and
line transitivity. Point imprimitive spaces admit a second structure on the
points aside from the lines, which is also preserved by an automorphism group.
In line transitive spaces, given any two lines, an automorphism can be found
that maps one line to the other.
  Very few point imprimitive, line transitive linear spaces, apart from
projective planes, are known. Such spaces that have been found have been
surprising. One point of interest is whether such spaces are rare and the known
ones are in some sense exceptional, or if there are many such spaces, but
mathematicians have been looking in the wrong places.
  Here we investigate methods to construct a line transitive, point imprimitive
linear space over a given point set and automorphism group. We employ these
methods on two given automorphism groups, both on a set of 451 points. This was
an exceptional situation identified in theoretical work of Praeger and Tuan.
Included in this is the development of an algorithm, written in GAP, an
algebraic programming system, and C, to perform these constructions. This
algorithm is extendible to a wider class of groups.

-(150 - 200)$ MeV at nuclear matter density, that could support such states;
and (ii) the theoretical arguments for a {\it shallow} potential, $V_{\bar

Friedman and Gal in which $\bar K$-nuclear bound states are generated
dynamically across the periodic table, using a RMF Lagrangian that couples the
$\bar K$ to the scalar and vector meson fields mediating the nuclear
interactions. Substantial polarization of the core nucleus is found for light
nuclei, with central nuclear densities enhanced by almost a factor of two. The
binding energies and widths calculated in this dynamical model differ
appreciably from those calculated for a static nucleus. These calculations
provide a lower limit of $\Gamma_{\bar K} \sim 50 \pm 10$ MeV on the width of

considering random and Barab\'asi-Albert (BA) network models with varying
connectivity explored by three types of random walks: traditional, preferential
to untracked edges, and preferential to unvisited nodes. A series of relevant
results are obtained, including the fact that random and BA models with the

efficiency, the identification of linear scaling with the size of the network
of the random walk step at which a given percentage of the nodes/edges is
covered, and the critical result that the estimation of the averaged node

further developments of general relativity. Klein had a peculiar way to
consider the relationship between mathematics and physics, based on his
Erlanger Programm and geometrical modeling of physical phenomena. He was aiming
at a physical foundation for non Euclidean geometry. However, the letters he
wrote to Einstein had no sequel.
  We think that F. Klein's ideas still deserve some attention, as they can be
useful for modeling Maxwell's equations with a radically different approach
than resorting to field theories. One reason for looking for alternatives is
that current field theories use geometry exclusively as a formal technique
thereby inhibiting human intuition from grasping the physical world.
  This article collects cues that we deem relevant for a model of
electromagnetic received signals. In the first two chapters we highlight a few
features of classical physics, namely the trajectories of mass points, and the

genetic and the metabolic network. A motif that occurs very often at this
interface is a negative feedback loop used to regulate the level of the signal
molecules. In this work we use mathematical models to investigate the steady
state and dynamical behaviour of different negative feedback loops. We show, in
particular, that feedback loops where the signal molecule does not cause the
dissociation of the transcription factor from the DNA respond faster than loops
where the molecule acts by sequestering transcription factors off the DNA. We
use three examples, the bet, mer and lac systems in E. coli, to illustrate the
behaviour of such feedback loops.

prey and predator populations. It is assumed that the space of coexistence is
explicitly subdivided in a grid of cells. Each cell can be occupied by only one
individual of each species or can be empty. The system evolves in time
according to a probabilistic cellular automaton composed by a set of local
rules which describe interactions between species individuals and mimic the
process of birth, death and predation. By performing computational simulations,
we found that, depending on the values of the parameters of the model, the
following states can be reached: a prey absorbing state and active states of
two types. In one of them both species coexist in a stationary regime with
population densities constant in time. The other kind of active state is
characterized by local coupled time oscillations of prey and predator
populations. We focus on the self-organized structures arising from
spatio-temporal dynamics of the coexistence. We identify distinct spatial
patterns of prey and predators and verify that they are intimally connected to
the time coexistence behavior of the species. The occurrence of a prey
percolating cluster on the spatial patterns of the active states is also
examined.

show relativity of entanglement with respect to dynamic symmetry and argue
existence of single-particle entanglement. A number of physical examples are
