populations separated in rest-frame color: 68% of red (B-I)_{AB}>0.9 and bright
galaxies showing a strongly decreasing LF slope \alpha=+0.55 \pm 0.21, and 32%

factor 2.7 between z~1 and z~0.6. It may be related to the building-up of
massive elliptical galaxies in the hierarchical scenario. In addition, we

orbital many-body problem is solved by exact diagonalization, either by
optimizing spin configuration at zero temperature, or by using classical
Monte-Carlo for the spin subsystem at finite temperature. In undoped
two-dimensional clusters, a complementary behavior of orbital and spin
correlations is found - the ferromagnetic spin order coexists with alternating
orbital order, while the antiferromagnetic spin order, triggered by t_{2g} spin
superexchange, coexists with ferro-orbital order. With finite crystal field

data analysis methods so that they can apply to functional inputs. A general
way to achieve this goal is to compute projections of the functional data onto
a finite dimensional sub-space of the functional space. The coordinates of the
data on a basis of this sub-space provide standard vector representations of

our previous work, this general approach has been used to define projection

particular that MLPs with functional inputs are universal approximators: they
can approximate to arbitrary accuracy any continuous mapping from a compact

that shows that any mapping from a functional space to R can be learned thanks
to examples by a projection based MLP: the generalization mean square error of

solving nonlinear evolution equations (NLEE), known as soliton equations. As a
basic tool we use the fundamental analytic solutions (FAS) of the Lax operator
L. Then the inverse scattering problem for L reduces to a Riemann-Hilbert
problem. Such construction cab be applied to wide class of Lax operators,
related to the simple Lie algebras g. We construct the kernel of the resolvent
of L in terms of FAS and derive the spectral decompositions of L. Thus we can
solve the relevant classes of NLEE which include the NLS eq. and its
multi-component generalizations, the N-wave equations etc. Using the dressing
method of Zakharov and Shabat we derive the N-soliton solutions of these
equations. We explain that the ISM is a natural generalization of the Fourier
transform method. As appropriate generalizations of the usual exponential
function we use the so-called ""squared solutions"" which are constructed again
in terms of FAS and the Cartan-Weyl basis of the relevant Lie algebra. One can
prove the completeness relations for the ""squared solutions"" which in fact
provide the spectral decompositions of the recursion operator \Lambda. These
decompositions can be used to derive all fundamental properties of the
corresponding NLEE in terms of \Lambda: i) the explicit form of the class of
integrable NLEE; ii) the generating functionals of integrals of motion; iii)
the hierarchies of Hamiltonian structures. We outline the importance of the
classical R-matrices for extracting the involutive integrals of motion.

two-mode squeezed state from an inertial point of view. This setting allows the
use of entanglement measure for continuous variables, which can be applied to
discuss free and bound entanglement from the point of view from non-inertial
observer.
