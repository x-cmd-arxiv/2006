each of which had a well-documented associated supernova, are all faint and
metal-poor compared to the population of local star-forming galaxies. We
quantify this statement by using a previous analysis of star-forming galaxies
(z<0.2) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to estimate the fraction of local
star formation as a function of host galaxy oxygen abundance. We find that only
a small fraction (<25%) of current star formation occurs in galaxies with
oxygen abundance 12+log(O/H)<8.6, i.e., about half that of the Milky Way.
However, all five low-z GRB hosts have oxygen abundance below this limit, in
three cases very significantly so. If GRBs traced local star formation
independent of metallicity, the probability of obtaining such low abundances
for all five hosts would be P~0.1%. We conclude that GRBs trace only
low-metallicity star formation, and that the Milky Way has been too metal rich
to host long GRBs for at least the last several billion years. This result has
implications for the potential role of GRBs in mass extinctions, for searches
for recent burst remnants in the Milky Way and other large galaxies, for
non-detections of late radio emission from local core-collapse supernovae, and
for the production of cosmic rays in the local Universe. We also find that the
isotropic energy release of these five GRBs, E_iso, steeply decreases with
increasing host oxygen abundance, suggesting an upper metallicity limit for
``cosmological'' GRBs at ~0.15 Z_solar. (Abridged)

late-type, bulge-less spirals, we present results from a high-resolution
spectroscopic survey of nine such nuclear star clusters, undertaken with
VLT/UVES. We fit the spectra with population synthesis models and measure
Lick-type indices to determine mean luminosity-weighted ages, which range from
4.1*10^7 to 1.1*10^10 years and are insensitive to assumed metallicity or
internal extinction. The average metallicity of nuclear clusters in late-type
spirals is slightly sub-solar (<Z> = 0.015) but shows significant scatter. The
fits also show that the nuclear cluster spectra are best described by a mix of
several generations of stars. This is supported by the fact that only models
with composite stellar populations yield mass-to-light ratios that match those
obtained from dynamical measurements. The last star formation episode was on
average 34 Myr ago, while all clusters experienced some star formation in the
last 100 Myr. We thus conclude that the nuclear clusters undergo repeated
episodes of star formation. The robustness with respect to possible
contamination from the underlying galaxy disk is demonstrated by comparison to
spectra obtained with HST/STIS. Combining these results with those from Walcher
et al. (2005), we have thus shown that the stellar nuclei of these bulge-less
galaxies are massive and dense star clusters that form stars recurrently until
the present day. This unique set of properties is likely due to the central
location of these clusters in their host galaxies.

underlying galaxy light than is possible with ground-based spectra. To infer
the star formation history, metallicity and dust extinction, we fit weighted
superpositions of single-age stellar population templates to the spectra. The
luminosity-weighted age ranges from 10 Myrs to 10 Gyrs. The stellar populations
of NCs are generally best fit as a mixture of populations of different ages.
This indicates that NCs did not form in a single event, but instead they had
additional star formation long after the oldest stars formed. On average, the
sample clusters in late-type spirals have a younger luminosity-weighted mean
age than those in early-type spirals (log(age/yr) = 8.37+/-0.25 vs.
9.23+/-0.21). The average cluster masses are smaller in late-type spirals than
in early-type spirals (log(M/Msun) = 6.25+/-0.21 vs. 7.63+/-0.24), and exceed
the masses typical of globular clusters. The cluster mass correlates strongly
with both the Hubble type of the host galaxy and the luminosity of its bulge.
The latter correlation has the same slope as the well-known correlation between
supermassive black hole mass and bulge luminosity. The properties of both

limits. We find that for $B$ type polarization of CMB the situation is reversed
and the dominant signal comes from vector modes generated by cosmic strings,
which exceeds the gravity wave signal from both inflation and strings. The
signal can be detected for a broad range of parameter space: future
polarization experiments may be able to detect the string signal down to the
string tension $G\mu=10^{-9}$, although foregrounds and lensing are likely to
worsen these limits. We argue that the optimal scale to search for the string
signature is at $\ell\sim 1000$, but in models with high optical depth the
signal from reionization peak at large scales is also significant. The shape of
the power spectrum allows one to distinguish the string signature from the
gravity waves from inflation, but only with a sufficiently high angular

background, we find that a critical specific intensity of J_UV ~ 0.1 x 10^-21

positive feedback for the halo population. A weaker UV flux stimulates
subsequent star formation inside the fossil HII regions, by enhancing the H_2
molecule abundance. A stronger UV flux significantly delays star-formation by
reducing the gas density, and increasing the cooling time, at the centers of
collapsing halos. At a fixed J_UV, the sign of the feedback also depends
strongly on the density of the gas at the time of UV illumination. Regardless
of the whether the feedback is positive or negative, we find that once the UV

Internal Luminosity Function power-law index and the spectral lag. Several
generalizations are made about time history morphologies: 1) GRBs with long
spectral lags contain fewer pulses that are broader than those found in bursts
with short spectral lags, 2) short-lag bursts with small ILF power-law indices
have many narrow pulses and are highly variable, while long-lag bursts with
small ILF power-law indices are characterized by broad, smooth pulses and have
low variability.
  GRB time history morphologies primarily identify intrinsic rather than
extrinsic characteristics based on correlations with gamma-ray luminosity,
afterglow luminosity, and numbers of pulses. These characteristics result
because internal relativistic effects due to bulk Lorentz factor are larger
than cosmological effects, and because the numbers and shapes of pulses
indicate different efficiencies and forms of GRB energy release.
  Single-pulsed GRBs are characterized either by large ILF power indices
(indicating a range of jet opening angles and Lorentz factors, with a FRED
pulse shape), or they have long lags (large jet opening angles with low Lorentz
factors, with either a FRED pulse shape or an unpeaked, smooth pulse shape).
They also have lower-luminosity afterglows than multi-pulsed GRBs. GRBs with
simple time histories are often associated with Type Ibc supernovae. This
suggests that some single-pulsed GRBs contain single, beamed blast waves that
are similar to and have characteristics that overlap with those of many
supernovae. Such a connection may not exist between multi-pulsed GRBs and
supernovae.

distributions, our code samples random positions for the hot spots across the
disk. The local spot emission is computed as reprocessed radiation coming from
a compact primary source above the disk. The structure of the hot spot and the
anisotropy of the re-emission are taken into account. We compute the fractional
variability spectra expected from such spot ensembles and investigate
dependencies on the parameters describing the radial spot distribution. We
consider the fractional variability F_var with respect to the spectral mean and
also the so-called point-to-point F_pp. Our method includes relativistic
corrections for the curved space-time; the black hole angular momentum is a
free parameter and subject to the fitting procedure. We confirm that the
rms-variability spectra involve intrinsic randomness at a significant level
when the number of flares appearing during the total observation time is too
small. Furthermore, F_var is not always compatible with F_pp. For MCG -6-30-15,
we can reproduce the short-timescale variability and model the suppressed
variability in the energy range of the Kalpha line without any need to
postulate reprocessing farther away from the center. An increasing rate of
energy production by the flares toward the center of the disk, a fast rotation
of the central black hole, and considerable suppression of the primary flare
emission are required. The modeled line remains consistent with the measured
equivalent width of the iron Kalpha line complex.

the surface abundance of light elements since the extension of the convective
envelope is largely affected by the internal opacity value. We analyse the
influence of the adopted solar mixture on the opacity in the convective
envelope of pre-main sequence (PMS) stars and thus on PMS lithium depletion.
The surface Li abundance depends on the relative efficiency of several
processes, some of them still not known with the required precision; this paper
thus analyses one of the aspects of this ``puzzle''. Focusing on PMS evolution,
where the largest amount of Li burning occurs, we computed stellar models for
three selected masses (0.8, 1.0 and 1.2 Msun, with Z=0.013, Y=0.27, alpha=1.9)
by varying the chemical mixture, that is the internal element distribution in
Z. We analysed the contribution of the single elements to the opacity at the
temperatures and densities of interest for Li depletion. Several mixtures were
obtained by varying the abundance of the most important elements one at a time;
we then calculated the corresponding PMS Li abundance evolution. We found that
a mixture variation does change the Li abundance: at fixed total metallicity,
the Li depletion increases when increasing the fraction of elements heavier
than O.

a parallel electric field ${\bf E} = \eta {\bf j}$ which can accelerate runaway
electrons. In order to gain observational predictions we inject electrons
inside the dissipation regions and follow them for several seconds in real
time. Precipitating electrons which leave the simulation system at height $z$ =
0 are associated with hard X rays, and electrons which escape at height $z$
$\sim$ 3$\cdot 10^4$ km are associated with normal-drifting type IIIs at the
local plasma frequency. A third, trapped, population is related to
gyrosynchrotron emission. Time profiles and spectra of all three emissions are
calculated, and their dependence on the geometric model parameters and on
$\eta$ is explored. It is found that precipitation generally preceeds escape by
fractions of a second, and that the electrons perform many visits to the
dissipation regions before leaving the simulation system. The electrons
impacting $z$ = 0 reach higher energies than the escaping ones, and
non-Maxwellian tails are observed at energies above the largest potential drop
across a single dissipation region. Impact maps at $z$ = 0 show a tendency of
the electrons to arrive at the borders of sunspots of one polarity. Although
the magnetograms used here belong to non-flaring times, so that the simulations
refer to nanoflares and `quiescent' coronal heating, it is conjectured that the

a detailed comparison with observations. We have performed 3D high resolution

result of 19 SNe occurring in a moving group, which passed through the present

that evolving superbubbles strongly deviate from idealised self-similar

break through the surrounding shell, which may also help to explain the

with the HI velocity dispersion field, with the location of the CO clouds and
with the distribution of young field stars. The cluster age distribution
supports the idea that clusters formed in the last 1 Gyr of the SMC history in
a roughly continuous way with periods of enhancements. The two super-shells 37A
and 304A detected in the HI distribution are clearly visible in the age
distribution of the clusters: an enhancement in the cluster formation rate has
taken place from the epoch of the shell formation. A tight correlation between
young clusters and the HI intensity is found. The degree of correlation is
decreasing with the age of the clusters. Clusters older than 300 Myr are
located away from the HI peaks. Clusters and associations younger than 10 Myr

of the colliding clouds produces large-scale shear motions which are
superimposed on small-scale turbulence. Generation of the large-scale magnetic

the mean vorticity is caused by the large-scale shear motions of colliding

nonrotating and nonhelical homogeneous turbulence. There is no quenching of the
nonlinear shear-current effect contrary to the quenching of the nonlinear alpha
effect, the nonlinear turbulent magnetic diffusion, etc. During the nonlinear
growth of the mean magnetic field, the shear-current effect only changes its
sign at some value of the mean magnetic field which determines the level of the
saturated mean magnetic field. Numerical study shows that the saturated level
of the mean magnetic field is of the order of the equipartition field
determined by the turbulent kinetic energy. The estimated large-scale magnetic
field for merging protogalactic clouds is about several microgauss, and for

by intrachain charge-transfer photoexcitations are studied in a
quasi-one-dimensional extended Hubbard model with alternating potentials and an
electron-lattice coupling for mixed-stack charge-transfer complexes. For
interchain couplings, we use electron-electron interactions previously
estimated for TTF-CA (TTF=tetrathiafulvalene, CA=chloranil). Photoexcitation is
introduced by a pulse of oscillating electric field. The time-dependent
Hartree-Fock approximation is used for the electronic part, and the classical
approximation for the lattice part. In the ionic-to-neutral transition, the
transferred charge density is a strongly nonlinear function of the
photoexcitation density, which is characterized by the presence of a threshold.
With substantial interchain couplings comparable to those in TTF-CA, the
interchain correlation is strong during the transition. Neutral domains in
nearby chains simultaneously grow even if their nucleation is delayed by
reducing the amplitude of the electric field. With weaker interchain couplings,
the growing processes are in phase only when the amplitude of the electric
field is large. Thus, the experimentally observed, coherent motion of a
macroscopic neutral-ionic domain boundary is allowed to emerge by such
substantial interchain couplings. In the neutral-to-ionic transition, by
contrast, the transferred charge density is almost a linear function of the
photoexcitation density. Interchain electron-electron interactions make the
function slightly nonlinear, but the uncooperative situation is almost
unchanged and consistent with the experimental findings.

with a clear Fermi cut-off was observed at chemically abrupt SrTiO3/LaTiO3
interfaces, indicating that an ``electronic reconstruction'' occurs at the
interface between the Mott insulator LaTiO3 and the band insulator SrTiO3. For
SrTiO3/LaTiO3 interfaces annealed at high temperatures (~ 1000 C), which leads
to Sr/La atomic interdiffusion and hence to the formation of La1-xSrxTiO3-like

reduced whereas the coherent part with a sharp Fermi cut-off is enhanced due to
the spread of charge. These important experimental features are well reproduced
by layer dynamical-mean-field-theory calculation.

coupled to gravity could explain both the galactic and the cosmological dark
components of the universe. Within the framework of Einstein's Relativity we
model static galactic halos by considering the most general action built from
the scalar field and its first derivatives. Although the gravitational
configuration is static, the scalar field may be either static, or homogeneous
and linear in time. In the case of the static scalar field, the models we look
at inevitably posses unphysical negative energies, and we are led to a sort of
no-go result. In the case of the homogeneous scalar field, on the contrary, we
find that compact objects with flat rotational curves and with the mass and the
size of a typical galaxy can be successfully modeled and the Tully-Fisher
relation recovered. We further show that the homogeneous scalar field deduced
from the galactic halo spacetimes has an action compatible with the kinetic
Unified Dark Matter models recently proposed by Scherrer. Therefore, such a
homogeneous kinetic Unified Dark Matter not only may correctly mimic the
galactic dynamics, but could also be used to model the present-day accelerated
expansion in the universe.

gauge group $SU(2)_Z$ whose coupling grows strong at a scale $\Lambda_Z \sim
10^{-3} eV$, a result which is obtained from a simple assumption that its
initial value at some high energy scale $M \sim 10^{16} GeV$ is of the order of
a typical Standard Model (SM) coupling at a similar scale. (This assumption
comes naturally from an embedding of $SU(2)_Z$ and the SM into a grand unified
group $E_6$.) It is found that the proposed model contains a SM lepton-number
violating Yukawa coupling involving a scalar ``messenger field''
${\tilde{\bm{\phi}}}^{(Z)}$ (which carries both $SU(2)_Z$ and electroweak
quantum numbers), a $SU(2)_Z$ fermion $\psi^{(Z)}$ and a SM lepton $l$. The
interference between the tree-level and one-loop decay amplitude for
${\tilde{\bm{\phi}}}^{(Z)} \to \psi^{(Z)} + l$ generates a SM lepton asymmetry
which is subsequently converted into a baryon asymmetry through electroweak
sphaleron processes. This constrains the mass of the messenger field to be less
than $1 TeV$, making it accessible to searches at future colliders: the
``progenitor'' of a net lepton number (and hence a net baryon number) could

The finite density of states implies a discrete energy spectrum, and, in

Therefore, knowledge of the precise energy, and of other commuting conserved
charges, determines the quantum state. In a gravitating theory, all conserved
charges including the energy are given by boundary terms that can be measured
at infinity. Thus, within any theory of quantum gravity, no information can be
lost in black holes with a finite number of states. However, identifying the
state of a black hole from infinity requires measurements with Planck scale
precision. Hence observers with insufficient resolution will experience
information loss.

find that the picture of the representation-independence of the string tension

the process eventually accepts the hypothesis while if the output is different

effective version of the Cover-Koplowitz theorem, beyond computable sequences

that the calculated angular distribution and energy dependence of the cross
sections reproduce the data in a reasonable fashion. The present non-local

threshold systems feature long-range interactions and can be treated as
equilibrium-like systems with dynamics that are statistically stationary over
long time intervals. Recently the equilibrium property of ergodicity was
identified in an earthquake fault system, a natural driven threshold system, by
means of the Thirumalai-Mountain (TM) fluctuation metric developed in the study
of diffusive systems [K.F. Tiampo, J.B. Rundle, W. Klein, J.S. Sa Martins, and

the seismicity of three naturally-occurring earthquake faults networks from a
variety of tectonic settings in an attempt to investigate the range of
applicability of effective ergodicity, using the TM metric and other, related
statistics. Results suggest that, once variations in the catalog data resulting
from technical and network issues are accounted for, all of these natural
earthquake systems display stationary periods of metastable equilibrium and
effective ergodicity that are disrupted by large events. We conclude that a
constant rate of events is an important prerequisite for these periods of
punctuated ergodicity, and that while the level of temporal variability in the
spatial statistics is the controlling factor in the ergodic behavior of seismic
networks, no single statistic is sufficient to ensure quantification of
ergodicity. Specifically, we demonstrate that stationarity, while a necessary
condition, is not sufficient to ensure ergodicity in fault systems.

telescopes with segmented mirrors. In a closed-loop correction cycle these
phase steps have to be measured with the highest possible precision using
natural reference stars, that is with a small number of photons. In this paper
the classical Fisher information of statistics is used for calculating the
Cramer-Rao bound, which determines the limit to the precision with which the
height of the steps can be estimated in an unbiased fashion with a given number
of photons and a given measuring device. Four types of measurement devices are
discussed: a Shack-Hartmann sensor with one small cylindrical lenslet covering
a sub-aperture centred over a border, a modified Mach-Zehnder interferometer, a
Foucault test, and a curvature sensor. The Cramer-Rao bound is calculated for
all sensors under ideal conditions, that is narrowband measurements without
additional noise or disturbances apart from the photon shot noise. This limit
is compared with the ultimate quantum statistical limit for the estimate of
such a step which is independent of the measuring device. For the
Shack-Hartmann sensor, the effects on the Cramer-Rao bound of broadband
measurements, finite sampling, and disturbances such as atmospheric seeing and
detector readout noise are also investigated. The methods presented here can be
used to compare the precision limits of various devices for measuring phase
steps and for optimising the parameters of the devices. Under ideal conditions
the Shack-Hartmann and the Foucault devices nearly attain the ultimate quantum
statistical limits, whereas the Mach-Zehnder and the curvature devices each
require approximately twenty times as many photons in order to reach the same
precision.
