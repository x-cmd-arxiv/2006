moving with near-sonic velocity through the hotter intergalactic gas, require
strong suppression of thermal conductivity across the boundary. This may be due
to magnetic fields tangential to the contact surface separating two plasma
components. We point out that a super-Alfvenic motion of a plasma cloud (a core
of a merging galaxy) through a weakly magnetized intercluster medium leads to
""magnetic draping"", formation of a thin, strongly magnetized boundary layer
with a tangential magnetic field. For supersonic cloud motion, M_s > 1,
magnetic field inside the layer reaches near-equipartition values with thermal
pressure. Typical thickness of the layer is L /M_A^2 << L, where L is the size
of the obstacle (plasma cloud) moving with Alfven Mach number M_A >> 1. To a
various degree, magnetic draping occurs both for sub- and supersonic flows,
random and ordered magnetic fields and it does not require plasma
compressibility. The strongly magnetized layer will thermally isolate the two
media and may contribute to the Kelvin-Helmholtz stability of the interface.
Similar effects occur for radio bubbles, quasi-spherical expanding cavities
blown up by AGN jets; in this case the thickness of the external magnetized
layer is smaller, L /M_A^3 << L.

drops and takes a negative value with a modulus that is significantly larger

on the cone opening angle $\alpha$, the Young-Dupr\'{e} contact angle $\theta$,
the cone radius at the reservoir's level $R_0$ and the capillary length
$\kappa^{-1}$. As $\alpha$ is increased from zero, the meniscus' position
changes continuously until, when $\alpha$ attains a critical value, the
meniscus jumps to the bottom of the capillary. For hydrophilic surfaces the
meniscus jumps to the top. The same liquid height discontinuuity can be
achieved with electrowetting with no mechanical motion. Essentially the same
behavior is found for two tilted surfaces. We further consider capillaries with
periodic radius modulations, and find that there are few competing minima for
the meniscus location. A transition from one to another can be performed by the
use of electrowetting. The phenomenon discussed here may find uses in

a large number of 3D strongly localized states can be produced for the matter
wave, if the effective scattering length describing the interaction of the
matter wave with a trapped atom is of the order of the mean distance between
the trapped particles. Such high values of the effective scattering length can
be obtained by using a Feshbach resonance to adjust the free space

as a result of a violent collisionless relaxation. If the system mixes well
(ergodicity), the QSS can be predicted by the statistical theory of Lynden-Bell
(1967) based on the Vlasov equation. When the initial distribution takes only
two values, the Lynden-Bell distribution is similar to the Fermi-Dirac
statistics. Such distributions have recently been observed in direct numerical
simulations of the HMF model (Antoniazzi et al. 2006). In this paper, we
determine the caloric curve corresponding to the Lynden-Bell statistics in
relation with the HMF model and analyze the dynamical and thermodynamical
stability of spatially homogeneous solutions by using two general criteria
previously introduced in the literature. We express the critical energy and the
critical temperature as a function of a degeneracy parameter fixed by the
initial condition. Below these critical values, the homogeneous Lynden-Bell
distribution is not a maximum entropy state but an unstable saddle point. We
apply these results to the situation considered by Antoniazzi et al. For a
given energy, we find a critical initial magnetization above which the
homogeneous Lynden-Bell distribution ceases to be a maximum entropy state,
contrary to the claim of these authors. For an energy U=0.69, this transition
occurs above an initial magnetization M_{x}=0.897. In that case, the system
should reach an inhomogeneous Lynden-Bell distribution (most mixed) or an
incompletely mixed state (possibly fitted by a Tsallis distribution). Thus, our
theoretical study proves that the dynamics is different for small and large
initial magnetizations, in agreement with numerical results of Pluchino et al.
(2004). This new dynamical phase transition may reconcile the two communities.

a Poincar\'e-invariant regularisation scheme which yields an effective,
nonlocal theory for energies below a cut-off scale. After discussing the
general features and the peculiar advantages of this regularisation scheme for
theories defined in noncommutative spaces, we focus our attention onto the
particular case when the noncommutativity parameter is inversely proportional
to the square of the cut-off, via a dimensionless parameter $\eta$. We work out
the perturbative corrections at one-loop order for a scalar theory with quartic
interactions, where the signature of noncommutativity appears in
$\eta$-dependent terms. The implications of this approach, which avoids the
problems related to UV-IR mixing, are discussed from the perspective of the
Wilson renormalisation program. Finally, we remark about the generality of the
method, arguing that it may lead to phenomenologically relevant predictions,
when applied to realistic field theories.

of Baker functions for special subspaces of $Gr(H)$. The Baker functions are
constructed explicitly for subspaces which yield multisoliton solutions of NLS

fully-connected graphs. It is shown that the surface of the interface between
mutants and non-mutants is crucial in predicting the dynamics of the system.
Network topology has a significant effect on the equilibrium fitness of a
simple population model incorporating multiple mutations and sexual
reproduction. Includes supplementary information.

  Technical Report no. 705","q-bio.PE math.PR",,"  A forward diffusion equation describing the evolution of the allele frequency
spectrum is presented. The influx of mutations is accounted for by imposing a
suitable boundary condition. For a Wright-Fisher diffusion with or without
selection and varying population size, the boundary condition is $\lim_{x
\downarrow 0} x f(x,t)=\theta \rho(t)$, where $f(\cdot,t)$ is the frequency
spectrum of derived alleles at independent loci at time $t$ and $\rho(t)$ is
the relative population size at time $t$. When population size and selection
intensity are independent of time, the forward equation is equivalent to the
backwards diffusion usually used to derive the frequency spectrum, but the
forward equation allows computation of the time dependence of the spectrum both
before an equilibrium is attained and when population size and selection
intensity vary with time. From the diffusion equation, we derive a set of
ordinary differential equations for the moments of $f(\cdot,t)$ and express the
expected spectrum of a finite sample in terms of those moments. We illustrate
the use of the forward equation by considering neutral and selected alleles in
a highly simplified model of human history. For example, we show that
approximately 30% of the expected heterozygosity of neutral loci is
attributable to mutations that arose since the onset of population growth in
roughly the last $150,000$ years.

  Voltage-Gating","Indication of alternative mechanisms",,,,"q-bio.BM q-bio.NC q-bio.SC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An intense controversy has surrounded the mechanism of voltage-gating in ion
channels. We interpreted the two leading models of voltage-gating with respect
to the thermodynamic energetics of membrane insertion of the voltage-sensing
'module' from a comprehensive set of potassium channels. KvAP is an archaeal
voltage-gated potassium channel whose x-ray structure was the basis for
determining the general mechanism of voltage-gating. The free energy of
membrane insertion of the KvAP voltage sensor was revealed to be a single
outlier. This was due to its unusual sequence that facilitated large gating
movements in its native lipid membrane. This degree of free energy was the
least typical of the other voltage sensors, including the Shaker potassium
channel. We inferred that the two leading models of voltage-gating referred to
alternative mechanisms of voltage-gating: each is applicable to an independent
set of ion channels. The large motion of the voltage-sensor during gating
proposed by the KvAP-paddle model of gating is unlikely to be mirrored by the
majority of ion channels whose voltage sensors are not located at the
membrane-cytoplasm interface in the channel closed state.
