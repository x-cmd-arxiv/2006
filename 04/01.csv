surveys in optical and X-ray, we identify three optical/X-ray supernova
remnants. Nearly half of the detected radio sources in these observations are
coincident with known H II regions lying in the spiral arm structures of the
galaxy. We also report on changes in emission from the complex nuclear region,
which has shown variability at 20cm wavelengths. We confirm that the peak radio
emission from the nucleus is not coincident with the known optical center. One
lesser nuclear peak is consistent with the optical/IR nucleus. Previous
dynamical studies of a ``dark'' nuclear mass indicate a possible match to other

survey of dense gas in all the components using the J=2-1 lines of CS and SiO
as tracers of high density gas and shock chemistry. We have detected CS and SiO
emission in all the kinematical components. The gas density and the SiO
abundance of the clouds in non-circular orbits are similar those in the nuclear
ring (GCR). Therefore, in all the kinematical components there are dense clouds
that can withstand the tidal shear. However, there is no evidence of star
formation outside the GCR. The high relative velocity and shear expected in the
dust-lanes along the bar major axis could inhibit the star formation process,
as observed in other galaxies. The high SiO abundances derived in the
non-circular velocity clouds are likely due to the large-scale shocks that
created the dust lanes

HI deficient Virgo spiral galaxy NGC 4522. A carefully chosen model snapshot is
compared with existing VLA HI observations. The model successfully reproduces
the large-scale gas distribution and the velocity field. However it fails to
reproduce the large observed HI linewidths in the extraplanar component, for
which we give possible explanations. In a second step, we solve the induction
equation on the velocity fields of the dynamical model and calculate the large
scale magnetic field. Assuming a Gaussian distribution of relativistic
electrons we obtain the distribution of polarized radio continuum emission
which is also compared with our VLA observations at 6 cm. The observed maximum
of the polarized radio continuum emission is successfully reproduced. Our model
suggests that the ram pressure maximum occurred only ~50 Myr ago. Since NGC
4522 is located far away from the cluster center (~1 Mpc) where the
intracluster medium density is too low to cause the observed stripping if the
intracluster medium is static and smooth, two scenarios are envisaged: (i) the
galaxy moves very rapidly within the intracluster medium and is not even bound
to the cluster; in this case the galaxy has just passed the region of highest
intracluster medium density; (ii) the intracluster medium is not static but
moving due to the infall of the M49 group of galaxies. In this case the galaxy
has just passed the region of highest intracluster medium velocity. This study
shows the strength of combining high resolution HI and polarized radio
continuum emission with detailed numerical modeling of the evolution of the gas

simple analytical calculations that describe the effect that the formation of a
massive star has on its own accretion flow. Within a simple accretion model
that includes angular momentum, that of gas flow on ballistic trajectories
around a star, the increasing ionization of a massive star growing by accretion
produces a three-stage evolutionary sequence. The ionization first forms a
small quasi-spherical HII region gravitationally trapped within the accretion
flow. At this stage the flow of ionized gas is entirely inward. As the
ionization increases, the HII region transitions to a bipolar morphology in
which the inflow is replaced by outflow within a narrow range of angle with
about the bipolar axis. At higher rates of ionization, the opening angle of the
outflow region progressively increases. Eventually, in the third stage, the
accretion is confined to a thin region about an equatorial disk. Throughout
this early evolution, the HII region is of hypercompact to ultracompact size
depending on the mass of the enclosed star or stars. These small HII regions
whose dynamics are dominated by stellar gravitation and accretion are different
than compact and larger HII regions whose dynamics are dominated by the thermal
pressure of the ionized gas.

observed are members of the cluster. The average Fe abundance for these five

the uncertainties related to star-to-star random errors, and the second one the
systematic effects related to the various assumptions made in the analysis.The
overall abundance pattern is quite typical of Globular Clusters, with an excess
of the $\alpha-$elements and of Eu. There is evidence that the stars of NGC
6441 are enriched in Na and Al, while they have been depleted of O and Mg, due
to H-burning at high temperatures, in analogy with extensive observations for
other Globular Clusters: in particular, one star is clearly Na and Al-rich and
O and Mg-poor. We obtained also quite high V abundances, but it is possible
that this is an artifact of the analysis, since similar large V abundances are

based on several statistical methods: kurtosis, maximum absolute temperature,
number of pixels below a given threshold, volume and Higher Criticism. All
these methods detect deviations from Gaussianity in the 3--year data set at a
slightly higher confidence level than in the WMAP 1-year data. These small
differences are mainly due to the new foreground reduction technique and not to
the reduction of the noise level, which is negligible at the scale of the spot.
In order to avoid ""a posteriori"" analyses, we recalculate for the WMAP 3-year

kurtosis tests were the first tests performed with wavelets for the WMAP data.
We obtain that the probability of finding an at least as high deviation in

be extremely flat. Galactic foreground emissions are not likely to be

prominent diffuse 8 micron emission in four of the most luminous galaxies in
the sample (IC 1613, IC 5152, NGC 55, and NGC 3109), low surface brightness
emission from four others (DDO 216, Sextans A, Sextans B, WLM), and no diffuse
emission from the remaining objects. We observe general correlations of the
diffuse 8 micron emission with both the current star formation rate and the
nebular metallicity of the galaxies in our sample. However, we also see
exceptions to these correlations that suggest other processes may also have a
significant effect on the generation of hot dust/PAH emission. These systems
all have evidence for old and intermediate age star formation, thus the lack of
diffuse 8 micron emission cannot be attributed to young galaxy ages. Also, we
find that winds are unlikely to explain the paucity of diffuse 8 micron
emission, since high resolution imaging of the neutral gas in these objects
show no evidence of blowout. Additionally, we propose the lack of diffuse 8
micron emission in low-metallicity systems may be due to the destruction of
dust grains by supernova shocks, assuming the timescale to regrow dust grains
and PAH molecules is long compared to the destruction timescale. The most
likely explanation for the observed weak diffuse 8 micron emission is at least
partly due to a general absence of dust (including PAHs), in agreement with
their low metallicities.

process of quantum fluctuation of vacuum. We apply the Fomin concept to derive
the cosmological observables. We argue that Fomin's idea from his 1973 work, in
contrast to Tryon's one has impact on the current Universe models and the
proposed extension of his theory now can be tested by distant supernovae SNIa.
Fomin's idea of the creation of the Universe is based on the intersection of
two fundamental theories: general relativity and quantum field theory with the
contemporary cosmological models with dark energy. As a result of comparison
with contemporary approaches concerning dark energy, we found out that Fomin's
idea appears in the context of the present acceleration of the Universe
explanation: cosmological models with decaying vacuum. Contemporary it appears
in the form of Ricci scalar dark energy connected with the holographic
principle. We show also that the Fomin model admits the bounce instead of the
initial singularity. We demonstrate that the Fomin model of cosmogenesis can be
falsified and using SNIa data the values of model parameters is in agreement
with observations.

On average, the 1 micron veiling exceeds the level expected from previously
identified sources of excess emission, suggesting the presence of an additional
contributor to accretion luminosity in the star-disk interface region.
Strengths of both lines correlate with veiling, and at Pgamma there is a
systematic progression in profile morphology with veiling. He I 10830 has an
unprecedented sensitivity to inner winds, showing blueshifted absorption below
the continuum in 71% of the CTTS compared to 0% at pgamma. This line is also
sensitive to magnetospheric accretion flows, with redshifted absorption below
the continuum found in 47% of the CTTS compared to 24% at Pgamma. The
blueshifted absorption at 10830 shows considerable diversity in its breadth and
penetration depth into the continuum, indicating that a range of inner wind
conditions exist in accreting stars. We interpret the broadest and deepest blue
absorptions as formed from scattering of the 1 micron continuum by outflowing
gas whose full acceleration region envelopes the star, suggesting radial
outflow from the star. In contrast, narrow blue absorption with a range of
radial velocities more likely arises via scattering of the 1 micron continuum
by a wind emerging from the inner disk. Both stellar and disk winds are
accretion powered since neither is seen in non-accreting WTTS and among the

expected neutron scattering intensities as a function of energy and momentum.
At zero frequency, the satellite peaks of even square-wave stripes are
suppressed by as much as a factor of 34 below the intensity of the main
incommensurate peaks. We further find that at low energy, spin wave cones may
not always be resolvable experimentally. Rather, the intensity as a function of
position around the cone depends strongly on the coupling across the stripe
domain walls. At intermediate energy, we find a saddlepoint at $(\pi,\pi)$ for
a range of couplings, and discuss its possible connection to the ""resonance

high energy, various structures are possible as a function of coupling strength

resistivity is highly current and voltage dependent. An irreversible transition
from high (HR) to a low resistivity (LR) is obtained upon the increase of the
electric field up to a temperature dependent critical value (V_c). The
current-voltage characteristics in the LR regime as well as the lack of a
variation in the magnetization response when V_c is reached indicate the
formation of a non-single connected filamentary conducting path. The
temperature dependence of V_c indicates the existence of a consolute point
where the conducting and insulating phases produce a critical behavior as a
consequence of their separation.

  The Knights models correspond to a new class of kinetically constrained
models which provide the first example of finite dimensional models with an
ideal glass-jamming transition. This is due to the underlying percolation
transition of particles which are mutually blocked by the constraints. This
jamming percolation has unconventional features: it is discontinuous (i.e. the
percolating cluster is compact at the transition) and the typical size of the
clusters diverges faster than any power law when $\rho\nearrow\rho_c$. These
properties give rise for Knight models to an ergodicity breaking transition at
$\rho_c$: at and above $\rho_{c}$ a finite fraction of the system is frozen. In
turn, this finite jump in the density of frozen sites leads to a two step
relaxation for dynamic correlations in the unjammed phase, analogous to that of
glass forming liquids. Also, due to the faster than power law divergence of the
dynamical correlation length, relaxation times diverge in a way similar to the
Vogel-Fulcher law.

even number of electrons support only diamagnetic currents. On the other hand
in the disordered rings, irrespective of realization of the disordered

mesoscopic cylinders the sign of the low-field currents can't be predicted
exactly since it strongly depends on the total number of electrons, $N_e$, and
also on the disordered configurations of the system. From the variation of

dimension of a gauge field. In this article the scalar field has been linked to
the dimension of the Dirac field. Here we get the field equations for the Dirac
field and the scalar field in such a way that both of them appear to be
mutually non-interacting. In this scenario the scalar field appears to be a
natural candidate for the dark matter and the dark radiation.

of the gravitational theory of 1915, the problem, whether its field equations
should admit of phenomenological sources at their right-hand sides, and how
this addition should be done, is expounded by relying on a thread of essential
insights and achievements by Schr\""odinger, Kursunoglu, Lichnerowicz, H\'ely
and Borchsenius. When sources are appended to all the field equations, from the
latter and from the contracted Bianchi identities a sort of
gravoelectrodynamics appears, that totally departs from the so called
Einstein-Maxwell theory, since its constitutive equation, that rules the link
between inductions and fields, is a very complicated differential relation that
allows for a much wider, still practically unexplored range of possible
occurrences. In this sort of theory one can allow for both an electric and a
magnetic four-current, which are not a physically wrong replica of each other,
like it would occur if both these currents were allowed in Maxwell's vacuum.
Particular static exact solutions show that, due to the peculiar constitutive
equation, while electric charges with a pole structure behave according to
Coulomb's law, magnetic charges with a pole structure interact with forces not
depending on their mutual distance. The latter behaviour was already discovered
by Treder in 1957 with an approximate calculation, while looking for ordinary
electromagnetism in the theory. He also showed that in the Hermitian theory
magnetic charges of unlike sign mutually attract, hence they are permanently
confined entities. The exact solutions confirm this finding, already
interpreted in 1980 by Treder in a chromodynamic sense.

description as flows on moduli spaces of D-bundles; in particular, we prove
that the local structure of D-bundles is captured by the full Sato
Grassmannian. The rational, trigonometric, and elliptic solutions of KP are
therefore captured by D-bundles on cubic curves E, that is, irreducible
(smooth, nodal, or cuspidal) curves of arithmetic genus 1. We develop a
Fourier-Mukai transform describing D-modules on cubic curves E in terms of
(complexes of) sheaves on a twisted cotangent bundle over E. We then apply this
transform to classify D-bundles on cubic curves, identifying their moduli
spaces with phase spaces of general CM particle systems (realized through the
geometry of spectral curves in our twisted cotangent bundle). Moreover, it is
immediate from the geometric construction that the flows of the KP and CM
hierarchies are thereby identified and that the poles of the KP solutions are
identified with the positions of the CM particles. This provides a geometric
explanation of a much-explored, puzzling phenomenon of the theory of integrable
systems: the poles of meromorphic solutions to KP soliton equations move

the resonances at high energy. We show that endpoints of the gaps are periodic
or anti-periodic eigenvalues or resonances (real branch points of the Lyapunov
function). We describe the spectrum as functions of $B$. For example, if $B\to
B_{k,m}=\frac{4(\frac{\pi}{2}-\frac{\pi k}{N}+\pi m)}{\sqrt 3 \cos
\frac{\pi}{2N}}, k=1,2,..,N, m\in Z$, then some spectral band shrinkes into a
flat band i.e., an eigenvalue of infinite multiplicity.

through an optical system, accounting for the influence of the electron beam
emittance. On the one hand, image formation with Synchrotron Radiation is
governed by the laws of Statistical Optics. On the other hand, the widely used
Gaussian-Shell model cannot be applied to describe the coherence properties of
X-ray beams from third generation Synchrotron Radiation sources. As a result, a
more rigorous analysis of coherence properties is required. We propose a
technique to explicitly calculate the cross-spectral density of an undulator
source, that we subsequently propagate through an optical imaging system. At
first we focus on the case of an ideal lens with a non-limiting pupil aperture.
Our theory, which makes consistent use of dimensionless analysis, also allows
treatment and physical understanding of many asymptotes of the parameter space,
together with their applicability region. Particular emphasis is given to the
asymptotic situation when the horizontal emittance is much larger than the
radiation wavelength, which is relevant for third generation Synchrotron
Radiation sources. First principle calculations of undulator radiation
characteristics (i.e. ten-dimensional integrals) are then reduced to
one-dimensional convolutions of analytical functions with universal functions
specific for undulator radiation sources. We also consider the imaging problem
for a non-ideal lens in presence of aberrations and a limiting pupil aperture,
which increases the dimension of the convolution from one to three. In
particular we give emphasis to cases when the intensity at the observation
plane can be presented as a convolution of an impulse response function and the
intensity from an ideal lens.

evolution equation depends on the nonextensive parameter q. The exponential,
the logistic, and the Gompertz growth laws are particular cases of the
generalized model. Experimental data of different tumors have been shown to
correspond to all these tumor-growth laws. Recently reported studies suggest
the existence of tumors that follow a power law behavior. Our model is able to
fit also these data for q<1. We show that for q<1, the commonly used
constant-intensity therapy is unable to reduce the tumor size to zero. As is
the case of the Gompertzian tumors, for- q<1 a late-intesification schedule is
needed. However, these tumors with q<1 are even harder to cure than the
Gompertzian ones. While for a Gompertzian tumor a linearly-increasing cell-kill
function is enough to reduce the tumor size to zero following an exponential
decay, in the case of tumors with q<1, the exponential decay is obtained only
with an exponentially increasing cell-kill function. This means that these
tumors would need an even more aggressive treatment schedule. We have shown
that for Gompertzian tumors a logarithmic late-intensification is sufficient
for the asymptotic reduction of the tumor-size to zero. This is not the fastest
way but it is more tolerable for patients. However for the tumors with q<1 we
would need at least a linearly increasing therapy in order to achieve a
similarly effective reduction. When q>1, tumor size can be reduced to zero
using a traditional constant-intensity therapy.

macroscopic width undergoes collisional (Sweet-Parker) reconnection, a narrow
dissipation region forms around the X-line. This dissipation region naturally
becomes narrower during the reconnection process as stronger magnetic fields
are convected toward the X-line. When the dissipation region becomes thinner
than the ion skin depth, resistive magnetohydrodynamics breaks down as the Hall
effect becomes important and the Sweet-Parker solution ceases to exist. A
transition to collisionless (Hall) reconnection ensues, increasing the
reconnection rate by many orders of magnitude in a very short time. Predictions
of the model are consistent with constraints set by observations of solar
flares.

formalized into a network-based algorithm. We study partitions for metabolic
networks of many organisms and find cores of currency metabolites and modular
