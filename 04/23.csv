frequencies below the hydrogen Lyman limit. After redshifting into the closest
resonance, these photons underwent multiple scatterings with atoms. We examine
the effect of these scatterings on the temperature of the neutral intergalactic
medium (IGM). Continuum photons, emitted between the Ly_alpha and Ly_gamma
frequencies, heat the gas after being redshifted into the H Ly_alpha or D
Ly_beta resonance. By contrast, photons emitted between the Ly_gamma and
Ly-limit frequencies, produce effective cooling of the gas. Prior to
reionization, the equilibrium temperature of ~100 K for hydrogen and helium
atoms is set by these two competing processes. At the same time, Ly_beta
resonance photons thermally decouple deuterium from other species, raising its
temperature as high as 10^4 K. Our results have important consequences for the
cosmic 21-cm background and the entropy floor of the early IGM which can affect
star formation and reionization.

techniques such as the supernova distance-redshift relation. By combining the
measured expansion history with the Friedmann equation one determines the
energy density and its time evolution, hence the equation of state of dark
energy. Because these methods rely on the Friedmann equation which has not been
independently tested it is desirable to find alternative methods that work for
both general relativity and other theories of gravity.
  Assuming that sufficiently large patches of a perturbed Robertson-Walker
spacetime evolve like separate Robertson-Walker universes, that shear stress is
unimportant on large scales and that energy and momentum are locally conserved,
we derive several relations between long-wavelength metric and matter
perturbations. These relations include generalizations of the initial-value
constraints of general relativity. For a class of theories including general
relativity we reduce the long-wavelength metric, density, and velocity
potential perturbations to quadratures including curvature perturbations,
entropy perturbations, and the effects of nonzero background curvature. When
combined with the expansion history measured geometrically, the long-wavelength
solution provide a test that may distinguish modified gravity from other
explanations of dark energy.

rotating Wigner molecules in circular dots under high magnetic field, and their
relation to magic angular momenta and quantum-Hall-effect fractional fillings,
is also discussed. Recent calculations for two electrons in an elliptic quantum
dot, using exact diagonalization and an approximate generalized-Heitler-London
treatment, show that the electrons can localize and form a molecular dimer for
screened interelectron repulsion. The calculated singlet-triplet splitting (J)
as a function of the magnetic field (B) agrees with cotunneling measurements;
its behavior reflects the effective dissociation of the dimer for large B.
Knowledge of the dot shape and of J(B) allows determination of two measures of
entanglement (concurrence and von Neumann entropy for indistinguishable
fermions), whose behavior correlates also with the dissociation of the dimer.
The theoretical value for the concurrence at B=0 agrees with the experimental

constructed a classical statistical model inducing quantum field averages. The
phase space consists of square integrable functions, $f(\phi),$ of the
classical bosonic field, $\phi(x).$ We call our model prequantum classical
statistical field-functional theory -- PCSFFT. The correspondence between
classical averages given by PCSFFT and quantum field averages given by QFT is
asymptotic. The QFT-average gives the main term in the expansion of the
PCSFFT-average with respect to the small parameter $\alpha$ -- dispersion of
fluctuations of ""vacuum field functionals.'' The Scr\""odinger equation of QFT
is obtained as the Hamilton equation for functionals, $F(f),$ of classical
field functions, $f(\phi).$ The main experimental prediction of PCSFFT is that
QFT gives only approximative statistical predictions that might be violated in
future experiments.

  -- Takesaki Duality as a Micro-Macro Duality --",,,,"RIMS-1540","math-ph math.MP",,"  After the mathematical notion of ""Micro-Macro Duality"" for understanding
mutual relations between microsopic quantum systems (Micro) and their
macroscopic manifestations (Macro) is explained on the basis of the notion of
sectors and order parameters, a general mathematical scheme is proposed for
detecting the state-structure inside of a sector through measurement processes
of a maximal abelian subalgebra of the algebra of observables. For this
purpose, the Kac-Takesaki operators controlling group duality play essential
roles, which naturally leads to the composite system of the observed system and
the measuring system formulated by a crossed product. This construction of
composite systems will be shown to make it possible for the Micro to be
reconstructed from its observational data as Macro in the light of the Takesaki
duality for crossed products.

limit of the AKNS hierarchy. The singular break-off patterns are universal, not
sensitive to details of the process and can be seen experimentally. We briefly

variables. We compare it with the classical evolution and show that, contrary
to what is commonly found in the literature, the two dynamics do not coincide.
We prove that this divergence is quite general by studying Hamiltonians of the
form $p^2 /2m + V(q)$. Several alternative formulations of Moyal dynamics are
then suggested. We introduce the concept of starfunction and use it to
reformulate the Moyal equations in terms of a system of ordinary differential
equations on the noncommutative Moyal plane. We then use this formulation to
study the semiclassical expansion of Moyal trajectories, which is cast in terms
of a (order by order in $\hbar$) recursive hierarchy of i) first order partial
differential equations as well as ii) systems of first order ordinary
differential equations. The latter formulation is derived independently for
analytic Hamiltonians as well as for the more general case of smooth local
integrable ones. We present various examples illustrating these results.
