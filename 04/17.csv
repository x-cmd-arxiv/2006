rise to high brightness and then fade to obscurity, has been a major part of
modern astrophysics. Well known examples include supernovae and novae. A
byproduct of the Deep Lens Survey was the discovery of three transients which
varied on a timescale of less than an hour. All three had faint and red
counterparts, the brightest of which was identified with an M star. However,
the remaining two showed hints of an extragalactic origin, one had a spatially
extended counterpart and the other appeared in projection on the outskirts of a
bright elliptical galaxy. If these two sources were really of an extragalactic
origin then the two events represent a new class of exotic explosive
transients. We undertook spectroscopic observations with the Keck telescope and
find the two counterparts are also late type Galactic dwarfs. Our main
conclusion is that flares from M dwarfs constitute a dense foreground fog and
dominate over any plausible class of extragalactic fast transients by at least
two orders of magnitude. Overcoming this fog will likely require dedicated
surveys with careful optimization of target field location, filter(s) and
cadence, pre-search imaging to filter out late type dwarfs and a well planned
rapid followup plan.

emission of relativistic astrophysical jets associated with an exchange of
interacting high-energy photons between the jet and the external environment.
Physical processes playing the main role in this mechanism are
electron-positron pair production by photons and the inverse Compton
scattering. This scenario has been studied analytically as well as with
numerical simulations demonstrating that a relativistic jet (with the Lorentz
factor larger than 3--4) moving through the sufficiently dense, soft radiation
field inevitably undergoes transformation into a luminous state. The process
has a supercritical character: the high-energy photons breed exponentially
being fed directly by the bulk kinetic energy of the jet. Eventually particles
feed back on the fluid dynamics and the jet partially decelerates. As a result,
a significant fraction (at least 20 per cent) of the jet kinetic energy is
converted into radiation mainly in the MeV -- GeV energy range. The mechanism
maybe responsible for the bulk of the emission of relativistic jets in active
galactic nuclei, microquasars and gamma-ray bursts.

saves valuable telescope time, a feature that is ideally suited for the

galaxy IC 4329a. The Fe K bandpass is dominated by two resolved peaks at 6.4
keV and 7.0 keV, consistent with neutral or near-neutral Fe K alpha and K beta
emission. There is a prominent redward asymmetry in the 6.4 keV line, which
could indicate emission from a Compton shoulder. Alternatively, models using
dual relativistic disklines are found to describe the emission profile well. A
low-inclination, moderately-relativistic dual-diskline model is possible if the
contribution from narrow components, due to distant material, is small or
absent. A high-inclination, moderately relativistic profile for each peak is
possible if there are roughly equal contributions from both the broad and
narrow components. Combining the XMM-Newton data with RXTE monitoring data, we
explore the time-resolved spectral behavior on time scales from hours to 2
years. We find no strong evidence for variability of the Fe K line flux on any
time scale, likely due to the minimal level of continuum variability. We
detect, at high significance, a narrow absorption line at 7.68 keV. This
feature is most likely due to Fe XXVI K alpha absorption blueshifted to about
0.1c relative to the systemic velocity, suggesting a high-velocity,
highly-ionized outflow component. As is often the case with similar outflows
seen in high-luminosity quasars, the power associated with the outflow
represents a substantial portion of the total energy budget of the AGN. The
outflow could arise from a radiatively-driven disk wind, or it may be in the
form of a discrete, transient blob of ejected material.

coupling model of superconducting pairing in a coarse grained superconducting

well as by local mode energy. We find that local gap value on each patch grows
with the local strength of electron-boson interaction. At the same time local
gap value decreases with the local boson mode energy, an observation consistent
with the tunneling experiments. We argue that features in the tunneling
spectrum due to boson scattering are consistent with experimentally observed

both coupling constant and boson energy could change upon isotope substitution,
we prove that interplay between these two effects can produce results that are

phase diagram of the double-exchange (DE) model with Hund's coupling J_H >0 in
infinite dimensions. In addition to ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic
(AF) phases, the DE model supports a broad class of short-range ordered (SRO)
states with extensive entropy and short-range magnetic order. For any site on
the Bethe lattice, the correlation parameter q of a SRO state is given by the
average q=<sin^2(theta_i/2)>, where theta_i is the angle between any spin and
its neighbors. Unlike the FM (q=0) and AF (q=1) transitions, the transition
temperature of a SRO state (T_{SRO}) with 0<q<1 cannot be obtained from the
magnetic susceptibility. But a solution of the coupled Green's functions in the
weak-coupling limit indicates that a SRO state always has a higher transition
temperature than the AF for all fillings p<1 and even than the FM for 0.26\le p
\le 0.39. For 0.39<p<0.73, where both the FM and AF phases are unstable for
small J_H, a SRO phase has a non-zero T_{SRO} except close to p=0.5. As J_H
increases, T_{SRO} eventually vanishes and the FM dominates. For small J_H, the
T=0 phase diagram is greatly simplified by the presence of the SRO phase. A SRO
phase is found to have lower energy than either the FM or AF phases for 0.26\le
p<1. Phase separation (PS) disappears as J_H-->0 but appears for J_H\neq 0. For
p near 1, PS occurs between an AF with p=1 and either a SRO or a FM phase. The
stability of a SRO state at T=0 can be understood by examining the interacting
DOS,which is gapped for any nonzero J_H in an AF but only when J_H exceeds a
critical value in a SRO state.

model is investigated by using the correlator projection method, which takes
into account momentum dependence of the free energy beyond the dynamical

Lifshitz transitions occur simultaneously with metal-insulator transitions at
large Coulomb repulsion. On the other hand, they are separated each other for
lower Coulomb repulsion, where the phase sandwiched by the Lifshitz and
metal-insulator transitions appears to show violation of the Luttinger sum
rule. Through the metal-insulator transition, quasiparticles retain nonzero
renormalization factor and finite quasi-particle weight in the both sides of
the transition. This supports that the metal-insulator transition is caused not
by the vanishing renormalization factor but by the relative shift of the Fermi
level into the Mott gap away from the quasiparticle band, in sharp contrast
with the original dynamical mean-field theory. Charge compressibility diverges
at the critical end point of the first-order Lifshitz transition at finite
temperatures. The origin of the divergence is ascribed to singular momentum
dependence of the quasiparticle dispersion.

structure of a fer- romagnet (FM) has on the properties of a superconductor
(SC) in bilayers and multilayers of La0.60Ca0.40MnO3/Nb and FePt/Nb proximity
hybrids. Specific experimental protocols that were employed in the performed
magnetization measurements enabled us to directly uncover a generic property of
FM/SC hybrids: in the absence of an external magnetic field, the multidomain
struc- ture of the FM promotes the nucleation of superconductivity, while its
monodomain state strongly suppresses it. Our experimental findings support
recent theoretical studies proposing that when an inhomogeneous exchange field
is offered by the FM to the SC the superconducting pairs are not susceptible to
pair-breaking.

to extend the class of fuzzy sets. The core idea is to see states of a quantum
register as characteristic functions of quantum fuzzy subsets of a given set.
As the real unit interval is embedded in the Bloch sphere, every fuzzy set is
automatically a quantum fuzzy set. However, a generic quantum fuzzy set can be
seen as a (possibly entangled) superposition of many fuzzy sets at once,
offering new opportunities for modeling uncertainty. After introducing the main
framework of quantum fuzzy set theory, we analyze the standard operations of
fuzzification and defuzzification from our viewpoint. We conclude this
preliminary paper with a list of possible applications of quantum fuzzy sets to
pattern recognition, as well as future directions of pure research in quantum

distances. In this paper, we consider braneworlds with two types of additional
curvature couplings, a Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk, and an Einstein-Hilbert
(EH) term on the brane. In the regime where these terms are dominant over the
bulk EH term, linearized gravity becomes weaker at short distances on the

ghosts in the graviton mass spectrum. We find that the ordinary coupling of

new form of the massless HS equations in an extended space involving, besides
extra spinorial coordinates, also a complex scalar one. As solutions to these
equations we recover the massless HS multiplet with fields of all integer and
half-integer helicities, and obtain new multiplets with a non-zero minimal
helicity. The HS multiplets are described by complex wave functions which are
holomorphic in the scalar coordinate and carry an extra U(1) charge q. The
latter fully characterizes the given multiplet by fixing the minimal helicity
as q/2. We construct a twistorial formulation of the master system and present
the general solution of the associate HS equations through an unconstrained

  neural networks","14 pages, 7 figures",,,,"q-bio.NC",,"  We study the effect of competition between short-term synaptic depression and
facilitation on the dynamical properties of attractor neural networks, using
Monte Carlo simulation and a mean field analysis. Depending on the balance
between depression, facilitation and the noise, the network displays different
behaviours, including associative memory and switching of the activity between
different attractors. We conclude that synaptic facilitation enhances the
attractor instability in a way that (i) intensifies the system adaptability to
external stimuli, which is in agreement with experiments, and (ii) favours the
retrieval of information with less error during short--time intervals.

parameters are modified. The resulting irregular behavior, which mimics the
state of attention in which a systems shows a great adaptability to changing
stimulus, is a consequence in the model of short--time presynaptic noise which
induces synaptic depression. We discuss results from both a mean--field

scale much shorter that the one for the neuron dynamics. In our model a
presynaptic noise causes postsynaptic depression as recently observed in
neurobiological systems. This results in a nonequilibrium condition in which
the network sensitivity to an external stimulus is enhanced. In particular, the
fixed points are qualitatively modified, and the system may easily scape from
the attractors. As a result, in addition to pattern recognition, the model is
useful for class identification and categorization.

between two interacting macromolecules are expected to exhibit pair preferences
for types of atoms or residues. Here we quantify these preferences by measuring
the mutual information of contacts for 895 protein-protein interfaces. The
information content is significant and is highest at the atomic resolution. A
simple phenomenological theory reveals a connection between information at
interfaces and the free energy spectrum of association. The connection is
presented in the form of a relation between mutual information and the energy
gap of the native bound state to off-target bound states. Measurement of
information content in designed lattice interfaces show the predicted scaling
behavior to the energy gap. Our theory also suggests that mutual information in
contacts emerges by a selection mechanism, and that strong selection, or high
conservation, of residues should lead to correspondingly high mutual
information. Amino acids which contribute more heavily to information content
are then expected to be more conserved. We verify this by showing a
statistically significant correlation between the conservation of each of the
twenty amino acids and their individual contribution to the information content
at protein-protein interfaces

the required physical resources in the theory of Direct Characterization of
Quantum Dynamics (DCQD) [quant-ph/0601033, quant-ph/0601034] in comparison to
other quantum process tomography (QPT) schemes. Here we argue that Ziman's
comments regarding optimality, quantumness, and the novelty of DCQD are
inaccurate. Specifically, we demonstrate that DCQD is optimal with respect to
both the required number of experimental configurations and the number of
possible outcomes over all known QPT schemes in the 2^{2n} dimensional Hilbert
space of n system and n ancilla qubits. Moreover, we show DCQD is more
efficient than all known QPT schemes in the sense of overall required number of
quantum operations. Furthermore, we argue that DCQD is a new method for
characterizing quantum dynamics and cannot be considered merely as a subclass
of previously known QPT schemes.

an unknown quantum state, e.g. to perform full tomography of this state. We
focus on two apparently simple cases, full tomography of one and two qubit
systems. We analyze and compare those techniques according to two figures of
merit. Our first criterion is the minimisation of the redundancy of the data
acquired during the tomographic process. In the case of two-qubits tomography,
we also analyze this process from the point of view of factorisability, so to
say we analyze the possibility to realise the tomographic process through local
operations and classical communications between local observers. This brings us
naturally to study the possibility to factorize the (discrete) Wigner
distribution of a composite system into the product of local Wigner
distributions. The discrete Heisenberg-Weyl group is an essential ingredient of
our approach. Possible extensions of our results to higher dimensions are
discussed in the last section and in the conclusions.

latter reproduces Snyder algebra. The deformed Poincar\'e transformations
leaving the algebra invariant are identified. It is shown that there exists a
nonzero minimal uncertainty in position (minimal length). The Dirac oscillator
in a 1+1-dimensional space-time described by such an algebra is studied in the
case where $\beta'=0$. Extending supersymmetric quantum mechanical and
shape-invariance methods to energy-dependent Hamiltonians provides exact
bound-state energies and wavefunctions. Physically acceptable states exist for
$\beta < 1/(m^2 c^2)$. A new interesting outcome is that, in contrast with the
conventional Dirac oscillator, the energy spectrum is bounded.
