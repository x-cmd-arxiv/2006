two ways: the direct collapse of the stellar core into a black hole and the
delayed collapse of a black hole caused by fallback in a weak supernova
explosion. In the case of a delayed-collapse black hole, the strong
collapsar-driven explosion overtakes the weak supernova explosion before shock
breakout, and it is very difficult to distinguish this black hole formation

that are very different from the direct collapse scenario. We present
1-dimensional studies of the nucleosynthetic yields from both black hole

can produce centre-bright hard x-ray emission within 20 kyr, and centre-bright
soft x-ray emission within 60 kyr of the supernova event. In a more tenuous
environment, the appearance of a centre-bright structure in hard x-rays is
delayed until about 60 kyr. The soft x-ray emission from such a remnant may not
become centre bright during its observable lifetime. This can explain the
observations that show that mixed-morphology supernova remnants preferentially
occur close to denser, molecular environments. Remnants expanding into denser
environments tend to be smaller, making it easier for thermal conduction to
make larger changes in the temperatures of their hot gas bubbles. We show that
the lower temperatures make it very favorable to use high-stage ions as
diagnostics of the hot gas bubbles in SNRs. In particular, the distribution of
O VIII transitions from shell-bright at early epochs to centre-bright at later

very high redshifts and to constrain the nature of dark energy in a way
complementary to distant type Ia supernovae. However, gravitational lensing
systematically brightens distant GRBs through the magnification bias, in
addition to increasing the dispersions of distance measurements. We investigate
how the magnification bias limits the cosmological usage of GRBs. We perform
Monte-Carlo simulations of Swift GRBs assuming a cosmological constant
dominated universe and then constrain the dark energy equation of state
neglecting gravitational lens effects. The originally assumed model is
recovered with 68% confidence limit even when the dispersion of inferred
luminosities is comparable to that of type Ia supernovae. This implies that the
bias is not so drastic for Swift GRBs as to change constraints on dark energy
and its evolution. However, the precise degree of the bias in cosmological
parameter determinations depends strongly on the shape of the luminosity
function of GRBs. Therefore, an accurate determination of the shape of the

critical points of transonic discs generally do not coincide with the
corresponding sonic points. The collection of such sonic points forms an
axisymmetric hypersurface, generators of which are the acoustic null geodesics,
i.e. the phonon trajectories. Such a surface is shown to be identical with an
acoustic event horizon. The acoustic surface gravity and the corresponding
analogue horizon temperature $T_{AH}$ at the acoustic horizon are then computed
in terms of fundamental accretion parameters. Physically, the analogue
temperature is associated with the thermal phonon radiation analogous to the
Hawking radiation of the black-hole horizon.Thus, an axisymmetric black-hole
accretion disc is established as a natural example of the classical analogue
gravity model, for which two kinds of horizon exist simultaneously. We have
shown that for some values of astrophysically relevant accretion parameters,
the analogue temperature exceeds the corresponding Hawking temperature. We
point out that acoustic {\it white holes} can also be generated for a
multi-transonic black-hole accretion with a shock. Such a white hole, produced
at the shock, is always flanked by two acoustic black holes generated at the
inner and the outer sonic points. Finally, we discuss possible applications of
our work to other astrophysical events which may exhibit analogue effects.

FIR-luminous radio-excess galaxies. Optical emission line diagnostics are used
to determine the dominant source of the ionizing radiation. We find that radio
excess is an excellent indicator of the presence of an active nucleus: the
radio-excess sample contains a much higher fraction of AGN than samples
selected on FIR luminosity alone, or using other criteria such as warm FIR
colors. Several objects have ambiguous classifications and are likely to be
composite objects with mixed excitation. The type of optical spectrum appears
to be associated with the radio-loudness: radio-loud objects may be more `pure'
AGN than radio-intermediate objects. We find strong evidence for interaction
between the radio plasma and the surrounding gas. The jet energy fluxes of the
radio-excess objects, inferred from the [O III] luminosities, are lower than in
powerful radio sources, consistent with our previous results. We conclude that
the jets of radio-intermediate sources are intrinsically weaker than those in
sources with more powerful radio emission. A significant fraction of the sample
spectra show post-starburst stellar continuum, with A-star absorption lines,
consistent with the large fraction of merging or disturbed host galaxies in the
sample. The ages of the radio sources are significantly less than those of A
stars indicating that, if the radio sources are associated with merging
activity, there is a delay between the interaction and the initiation of the
radio activity. (Abridged.)

of LBGs in the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Field by separating a sample of 16,920
galaxies to three magnitude bins in i'-band between 24.5 and 27.5. Our models
fits to data show a possible trend for more luminous galaxies to appear as
satellites in more massive halos. The satellite fraction of galaxies at z=4 in
these magnitude bins is 0.13 to 0.3, 0.09 to 0.22, and 0.03 to 0.14,
respectively, where the 1 sigma ranges account for differences coming from two
different estimates of the z=4 LF from the literature. To jointly explain the
LF and the large-scale linear bias factor of z=4 LBGs as a function of rest-UV
luminosity requires central galaxies to be brighter in UV at z =4 than
present-day galaxies in same dark matter mass halos. Moreover, UV luminosity of
central galaxies in halos with total mass greater than roughly 10^{12} M_sun
must decrease from z=4 to today by an amount more than the luminosity change
for galaxies in halos below this mass. This mass-dependent luminosity evolution
is preferred at more than 3 sigma confidence level compared to a
pure-luminosity evolution scenario where all galaxies decrease in luminosity by
the same amount from z=4 to today. The scenario preferred by the data is
consistent with the ``down-sizing'' picture of galaxy evolution.

this dual classification (optically defined as a NLS1 with radio definition of
a CSS or giga-hertz peaked spectrum (GPS) source). The SED is created from
simultaneous observations at radio (ATCA), optical/NIR (Siding Spring) and
UV/X-ray (XMM-Newton) wavelengths. The X-ray data show evidence of short-term
variability, a possible soft excess, and negligible absorption. Together with
the rest of the SED, the X-ray emission is excessive in comparison to
synchrotron plus synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) models. The SED can be
described with a two component model consisting of extended synchrotron/SSC
emission with Comptonisation in the X-rays, though SSC models with a very high
electron-to-magnetic energy density ratio cannot be excluded either. The peak
emission in the SED appears to be in the near infrared, which can be attributed
to thermal emission from a dusty torus. Analysis of a non-contemporaneous, low
resolution optical spectrum suggests that the narrow-line region (NLR) is much
more reddened than the X-ray emitting region suggesting that the gas-to-dust
ratio in PKS2004-447 may be very different then in our own Galaxy. Long-term
radio monitoring of PKS2004-447 shows a rather constant light curve over nearly
a six month period with the exception of one outburst when the 6.65GHz flux
increased by ~35% over 19 days. In comparison to general samples of GPS
sources, which appear to be X-ray weak, NLS1-CSS/GPS sources possess stronger
X-ray emission relative to radio, and lower intrinsic absorption than GPS

renormalization-group (TD-NRG) approach to nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum
impurity systems is presented. We demonstrate that the method is suitable for
fermionic as well as bosonic baths. A comparison with exact analytical results
for the charge relaxation in the resonant-level model and for dephasing in the
spin-boson model establishes the accuracy of the method. The real-time dynamics
of a single spin coupled to both types of baths is investigated. We use the
TD-NRG to calculate the spin relaxation and spin precession of a single Kondo
impurity. The short- and long-time dynamics is studied as a function of
temperature in the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regimes. The short-time
dynamics agrees very well with analytical results obtained at second order in
the exchange coupling $J$. In the ferromagnetic regime, the long-time spin
decay is described by the scaling variable $x = 2\rho_F J(T) T t$. In the
antiferromagnetic regime it is governed for $T < T_K$ by the Kondo time scale
$1/T_K$. Here $\rho_F$ is the conduction-electron density of states and $T_K$
is the Kondo temperature. Results for spin precession are obtained by rotating
the external magnetic field from the x axis to the z axis.

by the SO(5) dynamical symmetry group. In a weakly non-adiabatic regime the
decoherence, dephasing and relaxation processes affect Kondo tunneling. Each of
these processes is caused by a special type of dynamical gauge fluctuations, so
that one may discriminate between the decoherence in the ground state of a DQD

behavior of the transmission to be independent of the type of connection. As
the amount of dilution is decreased we find sharp variations in transmission.
These variations are the remnants of the resonances at the ordered,
zero-dilution, limit. For particles with energies within 0.25 <= E <= 1.75

20x20, the configurations begin transmitting near p_a = 0.60 with T against p

be totally reflecting except when the amount of dilution is very low and when
the particle has energy close to a resonance value at the ordered limit or when

sources has become available, which offer information on various subjects by
different providers, often in heterogeneous formats. This calls for tools and
methods for building an advanced information-processing infrastructure. One
issue in this area is the selection of suitable information sources in query
answering. In this paper, we present a knowledge-based approach to this
problem, in the setting where one among a set of information sources
(prototypically, data repositories) should be selected for evaluating a user
query. We use extended logic programs (ELPs) to represent rich descriptions of
the information sources, an underlying domain theory, and user queries in a
formal query language (here, XML-QL, but other languages can be handled as
well). Moreover, we use ELPs for declarative query analysis and generation of a
query description. Central to our approach are declarative source-selection
programs, for which we define syntax and semantics. Due to the structured
nature of the considered data items, the semantics of such programs must
carefully respect implicit context information in source-selection rules, and
furthermore combine it with possible user preferences. A prototype
implementation of our approach has been realized exploiting the DLV KR system
and its plp front-end for prioritized ELPs. We describe a representative
example involving specific movie databases, and report about experimental
results.

and neutrino beams. We consider neutrino fluxes from neutron sources, muon
damped sources, and pion sources, where we parameterize the input from these
sources in terms of the flux ratio $R=\phi_\mu/(\phi_e+\phi_\tau)$ which can be
extracted from the muon track to shower ratio in a neutrino telescope. While it
is difficult to obtain any information from this ratio alone, we demonstrate
that the dependence on the oscillation parameters is very complementary to the
one of reactor experiments and neutrino beams. We find that for large values of
$\sin^2 2 \theta_{13}$, a measurement of R with a precision of about 20% or
better may not only improve the measurement of the leptonic CP phase, but also
help the determination of the mass hierarchy. In some cases, early information
on $\delta_{CP}$ may even be obtained from Double Chooz and an astrophysical
flux alone without the help of superbeams. For small values of $\sin^2 2
\theta_{13}$, we find that using the information from an astrophysical neutrino
flux could eliminate the octant degeneracy better than reactor experiments and
beams alone. Finally, we demonstrate that implementing an additional observable

and modulus-mediated supersymmetry breaking. We explore the conditions under
which a mirage ""messenger scale"" is generated near the weak scale and the
little hierarchy problem is solved. We do this by explicitly including the
dynamics of the SUSY-breaking sector needed to cancel the cosmological
constant. The most plausible scenario for generating a low mirage scale does
not readily admit an extra-dimensional interpretation. We also review the
possibilities for solving the mu/Bmu problem in such theories, a potential
hidden source of fine-tuning.

by allowing an arbitrary planar graph to index the decomposition. We prove that
every graph that excludes a fixed graph as a minor has a planar decomposition

  The crossing number of a graph is the minimum number of crossings in a
drawing of the graph in the plane. We prove that planar decompositions are
intimately related to the crossing number. In particular, a graph with bounded
degree has linear crossing number if and only if it has a planar decomposition
with bounded width and a linear number of bags. It follows from the above
result about planar decompositions that every graph with bounded degree and an
excluded minor has linear crossing number.
  Analogous results are proved for the convex and rectilinear crossing numbers.
In particular, every graph with bounded degree and bounded tree-width has
linear convex crossing number, and every $K_{3,3}$-minor-free graph with
bounded degree has linear rectilinear crossing number.

the observed line broadening, indicating that the interaction is suppressed by

time-dependent Schr\""{o}dinger equation of atomic systems interacting with
intense laser pulses. As usual, the angular part of the wave function is
expanded in terms of spherical harmonics. Instead of the usual finite
difference (FD) scheme, the radial coordinate is discretized using the discrete
variable representation which is constructed from the Coulomb wave function.
For an accurate description of the ionization dynamics of atomic systems, the
Coulomb wave function discrete variable representation (CWDVR) method needs
3-10 times less grid points than the FD method. The resultant grid points of
CWDVR distribute unevenly so that one has finer grid near the origin and
coarser one at larger distances. The other important advantage of the CWDVR
method is that it treats the Coulomb singularity accurately and gives a good
representation of continuum wave functions. The time propagation of the wave
function is implemented using the well-known Arnoldi method. As examples, the
present method is applied to the multiphoton ionization of both H and H$^-$ in
intense laser fields. Short-time excitation and ionization dynamics of H by
static electric fields is also investigated. For a wide range of photon
energies and laser intensities, ionization rates calculated using this method
are in excellent agreement with those from other theoretical calculations.
