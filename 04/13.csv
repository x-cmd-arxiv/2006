volume at redshift 5 determined via spectral energy fitting drawn from a sample
of 214 photometrically-selected galaxies with z'<26.5 in the southern GOODS
field. Following procedures introduced by Eyles et al. (2005), we estimate
stellar masses for various sub-samples for which reliable and unconfused
Spitzer IRAC detections are available. A spectroscopic sample of 14 of the most
luminous sources with <z>=4.92 provides a firm lower limit to the stellar mass
density of 1e6 Msun/Mpc^3. Several galaxies in this sub-sample have masses of
order 10^11 Msun implying significant earlier activity occurred in massive
systems. We then consider a larger sample whose photometric redshifts in the
publicly-available GOODS-MUSIC catalog lie in the range 4.4 <z 5.6. Before
adopting the GOODS-MUSIC photometric redshifts, we check the accuracy of their
photometry and explore the possibility of contamination by low-z galaxies and
low-mass stars. After excising probable stellar contaminants and using the z'-J
color to exclude any remaining foreground red galaxies, we conclude that 196
sources are likely to be at z~5. The implied mass density from the unconfused
IRAC fraction of this sample, scaled to the total available, is 6e6 Msun/Mpc^3.
We discuss the uncertainties as well as the likelihood that we have
underestimated the true mass density. Including fainter and quiescent sources
the total integrated density could be as high as 1e7 Msun/Mpc^3. Using the
currently available (but highly uncertain) rate of decline in the star
formationhistory over 5 <z< 10, a better fit is obtained for the assembled mass
at z~5 if we admit significant dust extinction at early times or extend the
luminosity function to very faint limits. [abridged]

days) of the orbiting companion. Using difference image photometry, we are able
to achieve millimagnitude errors in the individual data points. One transit of
this star is well defined in our light curve. This confirms the OGLE detection
and rules out the possibility of a false positive. The measurement of this
transit allows to refine the transit amplitude (A_V=0.006 +/- 0.001 mag), and
the ephemerides for this interesting system, as well as the radius of the
possible orbiting companion (R_P=0.90 +/- 0.09 ~R_J), and the inclination of

between the components of close binaries to the blue straggler population in
M67. First, we followed the evolution of a binary of 1.4M$_\odot$+0.9M$_\odot$.
The synthetic evolutionary track of the binary system revealed that a
primordial blue straggler had a long lifetime in the observed blue straggler
region of color-magnitude diagram. Second, a grid of models for close binary
systems experiencing mass exchange were computed from 1Gyr to 6Gyr in order to
account for primordial blue-straggler formation in a time sequence. Based on
such a grid, Monte-Carlo simulations were applied for the old open cluster M67.
Adopting appropriate orbital parameters, 4 primordial blue stragglers were
predicted by our simulations. This was consistent with the observational fact
that only a few blue stragglers in M67 were binaries with short orbital
periods. An upper boundary of the primordial blue stragglers in the
color-magnitude diagram (CMD) was defined and could be used to distinguish blue
stragglers that were not formed via mass exchange. Using the grid of binary
models, the orbital periods of the primordial BSs could be predicted. Compared
with the observations, it is clear that the mechanism discussed in this work
alone cannot fully predict the blue straggler population in M67. There must be
several other processes also involved in the formation of the observed blue

the $R$-band image of these AGNs with the University of Hawaii 2.2 m telescope.
Thanks to the intrinsic obscuration of nuclear light, we can decompose the
galaxies with a spheroid component and a disk component. The resulting spheroid
luminosities correlate with $L_{\rm 2-10 keV}$; higher (lower) X-ray luminosity
AGNs tend to reside in luminous (less luminous) spheroids. It is also found
that the hosts of luminous AGNs show a large spheroid-to-disk luminosity ratio
($\sim$1), while those of less luminous AGNs spread between 0 and 1. The
correlation between $L_{\rm 2-10keV}$ and spheroid luminosity indicates that
the relation between mass of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) and spheroid
luminosity (BS-relation) at the intermediate redshifts. The BS-relation agrees
with that in the local universe if the Eddington ratio of 0.24 is adopted,
which is a mean value determined from our $ASCA$ type-1 AGN sample at similar

study demonstrates the effectiveness of using type-2 AGNs at high redshifts to

suppression of their density perturbation as compared with those on small

introudced, we find that a significant contribution from the noise-driven
perturbation to the density perturbation is still allowed. It in turn gives
rise to a suppression of the large-scale CMB anisotropy that may be relevant to
the observed low quadrupole in the WMAP CMB anisotropy data. We also briefly

lower value than previously proposed. A model of the nebular spectrum of SN
1994I points toward a slightly larger ejecta mass than that of CO21. The
photospheric spectra show a large abundance of iron-group elements at early
epochs, indicating that mixing within the ejecta must have been significant. We
present an improved light curve model which also requires the presence of 56Ni

thermally averaged hardening, mass ejection, and eccentricity growth rates (H,

orbit integration from initial conditions determined by Monte Carlo techniques.
Three-body interactions create a subpopulation of HVSs on nearly radial,
corotating orbits, with a spatial distribution that is initially highly
flattened in the inspiral plane of the MBHB, but becomes more isotropic with
decreasing binary separation. The degree of anisotropy is smaller for unequal
mass binaries and larger for stars with higher kick velocities. Eccentric MBHBs
produce a more prominent tail of high-velocity stars and break planar symmetry,
ejecting HVSs along a broad jet perpendicular to the semimajor axis. The jet
two-sidedness decreases with increasing binary mass ratio, while the jet
opening-angle increases with decreasing kick velocity and orbital separation.
The detection of a numerous population of HVSs in the halo of the Milky Way by
the next generation of large astrometric surveys like GAIA may provide a unique
signature of the history, nature, and environment of the MBH at the Galactic

$T_C$ in $d=4$, where Gaussian behavior is expected to apply, and in the two
other cases of the $d=2$ model quenched to $T_C$ and to below $T_C$, where
instead deviations from Gaussian behavior are expected to appear. We find that
in the $d=4$ case there is an excellent agreement between the numerical data,
the local scale invariance prediction and the analytical Gaussian
approximation. No logarithmic corrections are numerically detected. Conversely,
in the $d=2$ cases, both in the quench to $T_C$ and to below $T_C$, sizable
deviations of the local scale invariance behavior from the numerical data are
observed. These results do support the idea that local scale invariance might
miss to capture the non Gaussian features of the dynamics. The considerable
precision needed for the comparison has been achieved through the use of a fast
new algorithm for the measurement of the response function without applying the
external field. From these high quality data we obtain $a=0.27 \pm 0.002$ for

result, we obtain an effective single-ion Hamiltonian, where the influence of
the ligands is reduced to the one-particle 'crystal field' acting on

we demonstrate that the noise at finite temperature reveals signatures of

hydrophilic area, and the maximum drop size that remains stable when the slide

scalable and has the potential to significantly improve outcomes in hanging and

theories of data structures. Many problems can be reduced to the satisfiability
of sets of ground literals in theory T. If a sound and complete inference
system for first-order logic is guaranteed to terminate on T-satisfiability
problems, any theorem-proving strategy with that system and a fair search plan
is a T-satisfiability procedure. We prove termination of a rewrite-based
first-order engine on the theories of records, integer offsets, integer offsets
modulo and lists. We give a modularity theorem stating sufficient conditions
for termination on a combinations of theories, given termination on each. The
above theories, as well as others, satisfy these conditions. We introduce
several sets of benchmarks on these theories and their combinations, including
both parametric synthetic benchmarks to test scalability, and real-world
problems to test performances on huge sets of literals. We compare the
rewrite-based theorem prover E with the validity checkers CVC and CVC Lite.
Contrary to the folklore that a general-purpose prover cannot compete with
reasoners with built-in theories, the experiments are overall favorable to the
theorem prover, showing that not only the rewriting approach is elegant and
conceptually simple, but has important practical implications.

  in: FOCS'06, 133--142",,,"cs.DS math.FA",,"  The smoothed analysis of algorithms is concerned with the expected running
time of an algorithm under slight random perturbations of arbitrary inputs.
Spielman and Teng proved that the shadow-vertex simplex method has polynomial
smoothed complexity. On a slight random perturbation of an arbitrary linear
program, the simplex method finds the solution after a walk on polytope(s) with
expected length polynomial in the number of constraints n, the number of
variables d and the inverse standard deviation of the perturbation 1/sigma.
  We show that the length of walk in the simplex method is actually
polylogarithmic in the number of constraints n. Spielman-Teng's bound on the
walk was O(n^{86} d^{55} sigma^{-30}), up to logarithmic factors. We improve
this to O(log^7 n (d^9 + d^3 \s^{-4})). This shows that the tight Hirsch
conjecture n-d on the length of walk on polytopes is not a limitation for the
smoothed Linear Programming. Random perturbations create short paths between
vertices.
  We propose a randomized phase-I for solving arbitrary linear programs, which
is of independent interest. Instead of finding a vertex of a feasible set, we
add a vertex at random to the feasible set. This does not affect the solution
of the linear program with constant probability. This overcomes one of the
major difficulties of smoothed analysis of the simplex method -- one can now
statistically decouple the walk from the smoothed linear program. This yields a
much better reduction of the smoothed complexity to a geometric quantity -- the
size of planar sections of random polytopes. We also improve upon the known
estimates for that size, showing that it is polylogarithmic in the number of
vertices.

a derivation of the missing virtual radiative pQCD correction to these
processes - the real-emission radiative corrections are already available in
the literature. We manifestly implement the unitarity relation, which in the
simplest form requires that upon summing over the virtual and real-emission
corrections the total number of scattered quarks must exactly equal unity. For
the free-nucleon target, the leading jet spectrum is shown to satisfy the
familiar linear Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov leading log(1/x) (LL-1/x)
evolution. For nuclear targets, the nonlinear k_t-factorization for the LL-1/x
evolution of the leading jet sepctrum is shown to exactly match the equally
nonlinear LL-1/x evolution of the collective nuclear glue - there emerges a
unique linear k_t-factorization relation between the two nonlinear evolving
nuclear observables. We argue that within the standard dilute uncorrelated
nucleonic gas treatment of heavy nuclei, in the finite energy range from RHIC

central values of their experimental measurements.

the Workshop ""Physics at TeV Colliders"", Les Houches, France, 2-20 May, 2005.
On the one hand, we performed a variety of experimental and theoretical studies
on standard candles (such as W, Z, and ttbar production), treating them either
as proper signals of known physics, or as backgrounds to unknown physics; we
also addressed issues relevant to those non-perturbative or semi-perturbative
ingredients, such as Parton Density Functions and Underlying Events, whose
understanding will be crucial for a proper simulation of the actual events
taking place in the detectors. On the other hand, several channels for the
production of the Higgs, or involving the Higgs, have been considered in some
detail. The report is structured into four main parts. The first one deals with
Standard Model physics, except the Higgs. A variety of arguments are treated
here, from full simulation of processes constituting a background to Higgs
production, to studies of uncertainties due to PDFs and to extrapolations of
models for underlying events, from small-$x$ issues to electroweak corrections
which may play a role in vector boson physics. The second part of the report
treats Higgs physics from the point of view of the signal. In the third part,
reviews are presented on the current status of multi-leg, next-to-leading order
and of next-to-next-to-leading order QCD computations. Finally, the fourth part
deals with the use of Monte Carlos for simulation of LHC physics.

although depending on the sign of the tension it is either the helicity-0
component of the lightest localized massive tensor of mass $0<m^2 < 2H^2$ for
positive tension, the scalar `radion' for negative tension, or their admixture
for vanishing tension. Because the ghost is gravitationally coupled to the
brane-localized matter, the self-accelerating solutions are not a reliable
benchmark for cosmic acceleration driven by gravity modified in the IR. In
contrast, the normal branch of solutions is ghost-free, and so these solutions
are perturbatively safe at large distance scales. We further find that when the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold symmetry is broken, new tachyonic instabilities, which
are much milder than the ghosts, appear on the self-accelerating branch.
Finally, using exact gravitational shock waves we analyze what happens if we
relax boundary conditions at infinity. We find that non-normalizable bulk
modes, if interpreted as 4D phenomena, may open the door to new ghost-like
excitations.

nu -> -nu, reflecting the parity violation due to non-commutative geometry. In
the continuum and infinite-volume limits, however, the distribution turns out
to be dominated by the topologically trivial sector. This conclusion is
consistent with the instanton calculus in the continuum theory. However, it is
in striking contrast to the known results in the commutative case obtained from
lattice simulation, where the distribution is Gaussian in a finite volume, but
the width diverges in the infinite-volume limit. We also calculate the average

  introduced",,,,"hep-th hep-ph",,"  We propose to realize a mass gap in QCD by not imposing the transversality
condition on the full gluon self-energy, while preserving the color gauge
invariance condition for the full gluon propagator. This is justified by the
nonlinear and nonperturbative dynamics of QCD. None of physical
observables/processes in low-energy QCD will be directly affected by such a
temporary violation of color gauge invariance/symmetry. No
truncations/approximations and no special gauge are made for the regularized
skeleton loop integrals, contributing to the full gluon self-energy, which
enters the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the full gluon propagator. In order to
make the existence of a mass gap perfectly clear the corresponding subtraction
procedure is introduced. All this allows one to establish the general structure
of the full gluon propagator and the gluon Schwinger-Dyson equation in the
presence of a mass gap. It is mainly generated by the nonlinear interaction of
massless gluon modes. The physical meaning of the mass gap is to be responsible
for the large-scale (low-energy/momentum), i.e., nonperturbative structure of
the true QCD vacuum. In the presence of a mass gap two different types of
solutions for the full gluon propagator are possible. The massive solution
leads to an affective gluon mass, which depends on the gauge-fixing parameter
explicitly. This solution becomes smooth at small gluon momentum in the Landau
gauge. The general iteration solution is always severely singular at small
gluon momentum, i.e., the gluons remain massless, and this does not depend on
the gauge choice.

unity, all the remaining seven elements are zero-divisors, the non-trivial ones
forming two distinct sets of three; elementary ('slim') and composite ('fat').
Due to this fact, the line in question is endowed with a very intricate
structure. It contains twenty-seven points, every point has eighteen neighbour
points, the neighbourhoods of two distant points share twelve points and those
of three pairwise distant points have six points in common -- namely those with
coordinates having both the entries `fat' zero-divisors. Algebraically, the
points of the line can be partitioned into three groups: a) the group
comprising three distinguished points of the ordinary projective line of order
two (the 'nucleus'), b) the group composed of twelve points whose coordinates
feature both the unit(y) and a zero-divisor (the 'inner shell') and c) the
group of twelve points whose coordinates have both the entries zero-divisors
(the 'outer shell'). The points of the last two groups can further be split
into two subgroups of six points each; while in the former case there is a
perfect symmetry between the two subsets, in the latter case the subgroups have
a different footing, reflecting the existence of the two kinds of a
zero-divisor. The structure of the two shells, the way how they are
interconnected and their link with the nucleus are all fully revealed and
illustrated in terms of the neighbour/distant relation. Possible applications
of this finite ring geometry are also mentioned.

one needs so-called Malliavin weights and we give explicit formulae valid in
presence of jumps: (a) In a non-degenerate situation, the extended BEL formula
represents possible Malliavin weights as Ito integrals with explicit
integrands; (b) in a hypoelliptic setting we review work of Arnaudon and
Thalmaier [1] and also find explicit weights, now involving the Malliavin
covariance matrix, but still straight-forward to implement. (This is in
contrast to recent work by Forster, Lutkebohmert and Teichmann where weights
are constructed as anticipating Skorohod integrals.) We give some financial
examples covered by (b) but note that most practical cases of poor Monte Carlo
performance, Digital Cliquet contracts for instance, can be dealt with by the
extended BEL formula and hence without any reliance on Malliavin calculus at
all. We then discuss some of the approximations, often ignored in the
literature, needed to justify the use of the Malliavin weights in the context
of standard jump diffusion models. Finally, as all this is meant to improve

information about the space of metrics with positive scalar curvatur1e.
  In particular we prove that, if G contains torsion and M is congruent 3 mod 4
then M admits infinitely many different bordism classes of metrics with
positive scalar curvature. We show that this is true even up to diffeomorphism.
  If G has certain special properties then we obtain more refined information
about the ``size'' of the space of metric of positive scalar curvature, and
these results also apply if the dimension is congruent to 1 mod 4. For example,
if G contains a central element of odd order, then the moduli space of metrics
of positive scalar curvature has infinitely many components, if it is not
empty.
  Some of our invariants are the delocalized eta-invariants introduced by John
Lott. These invariants are defined by certain integrals whose convergence is
not clear in general, and we show, in effect, that examples exist where this
integral definitely does not converge, thus answering a question of Lott.
  We also discuss the possible values of the rho invariants of the Dirac
operator and show that there are certain global restrictions (provided the
scalar curvature is positive).

  (2004) p51",,,"nlin.AO",,"  The issue of how to create open-ended evolution in an artificial system is
one the open problems in artificial life. This paper examines two of the
factors that have some bearing on this issue, using the Tierra artificial life
system.
  {\em Parsimony pressure} is a tendency to penalise more complex organisms by
the extra cost needed to reproduce longer genotypes, encouraging simplification
to happen. In Tierra, parsimony is controlled by the \verb+SlicePow+ parameter.
When full parsimony is selected, evolution optimises the ancestral organism to
produce extremely simple organisms. With parsimony completely relaxed,
organisms grow larger, but not more complex. They fill up with ``junk''. This
paper looks at scanning a range of \verb+SlicePow+ from 0.9 to 1 to see if
there is an optimal value for generating complexity.
  Tierra (along with most ALife systems) use pseudo random number generators.
Algorithms can never create information, only destroy it. So the total
complexity of the Tierra system is bounded by the initial complexity, implying
that the individual organism complexity is bounded. Biological systems,
however, have plenty of sources of randomness, ultimately dependent on quantum
randomness, so do not have this complexity limit. Sources of real random
numbers exist for computers called {\em entropy gatherers} -- this paper
reports on the effect of changing Tierra's pseudo random number generator for
an entropy gatherer.

several interesting observations. We show that there is considerable
correlation between the probe intensities across the array which defy the
independence assumption. While the mechanism behind such correlations is
unclear, we show that scaling behavior and the profiles of perfect match (PM)

of inherent non-stationarities or patchiness in the array devoid of biological

functions we obtain the corresponding wave functions and for the bound states
we also find the energy spectra.

theoretically. It is assumed that the three-level medium is coherently excited
by another laser with an arbitrary photon statistics. It is proved that, under
the specific conditions, the photon statistics of the three-level laser
duplicate the photon statistics of the exciting laser. We call this phenomenon
an induced photon statistics. We suggest to use this to analyze the statistical
properties of a laser involved into a feedback process. Applying this laser for
the coherent pump of a three-level laser, we can follow its photon statistics
by means of direct following the three-level generation. In accordance with [H.
M. Wiseman and G. J. Milburn, Phys. Rev. A, 49, 1350-1366 (1994)], we conclude
that the feedback in itself is unable to generate the non-classical
manifestation in the laser field.

paper, we develop two data post-processing schemes for the decoy-state method
using two-way classical communications. Our numerical simulation (using
parameters from a specific QKD experiment as an example) results show that our
scheme is able to extend the maximal secure distance from 142km (using only
one-way classical communications with decoy states) to 181km. The second scheme
is able to achieve a 10% greater key generation rate in the whole regime of
distances.

mutually orthogonal Latin squares, in their restricted setting that allows only
measurements of projection-valued measures. However, we then cannot find a
solution to the problem when e.g., d=6 or d=10. In contrast to their result, we
show that the King's problem always has a solution for arbitrary levels if we
also allow positive operator-valued measures. In constructing the solution, we
use orthogonal arrays in combinatorial design theory.

consciousness, in contrast to earlier suggestions that consciousness might be
understood starting from quantum theory. The notion of streams of
consciousness, usually restricted to conscious beings, is extended to the
notion of a Universal/Global stream of conscious flow of ordered events. The
streams of conscious events which we experience constitute sub-streams of the
Universal stream. Our postulated ontological character of consciousness also
consists of an operator which acts on a state of potential consciousness to
create or modify the likelihoods for later events to occur and become part of
the Universal conscious flow. A generalized process of measurement-perception
is introduced, where the operation of consciousness brings into existence, from
a state of potentiality, the event in consciousness. This is mathematically
represented by (a) an operator acting on the state of potential-consciousness
before an actual event arises in consciousness and (b) the reflecting of the
result of this operation back onto the state of potential-consciousness for
comparison in order for the event to arise in consciousness. Beginning from our
postulated ontology that consciousness is primary and from the most elementary
conscious contents, such as perception of periodic change and motion, quantum
theory follows naturally as the description of the conscious experience.
