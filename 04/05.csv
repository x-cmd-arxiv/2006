D74 (2006) 084007","10.1103/PhysRevD.74.084007",,"astro-ph",,"  Theories in which gravity is weaker on cosmological scales have been proposed
to explain the observed acceleration of the universe. The nonlinear regime in
such theories is not well studied, though it is likely that observational tests
of structure formation will lie in this regime. A class of alternate gravity
theories may be approximated by modifying Poisson's equation. We have run
N-body simulations of a set of such models to study the nonlinear clustering of
matter on 1-100 Mpc scales. We find that nonlinear gravity enhances the
deviations of the power spectrum of these models from standard gravity. This
occurs due to mode-coupling, so that models with an excess or deficit of
large-scale power (at k < 0.2/Mpc) lead to deviations in the power spectrum at
smaller scales as well (up to k ~ 1/Mpc), even though the linear spectra match
very closely on the smaller scales. This makes it easier to distinguish such
models from general relativity using the three-dimensional power spectrum
probed by galaxy surveys and the weak lensing power spectrum. If the potential
for light deflection is modified in the same way as the potential that affects
the dark matter, then weak lensing constrains deviations from gravity even more
strongly. Our simulations show that even with a modified potential,
gravitational evolution is approximately universal. Based on this, the
Peacock-Dodds approach can be adapted to get an analytical fit for the
nonlinear power spectra of alternate gravity models, though the recent Smith et
al formula is less successful. Our conclusions extend to models with
modifications of gravity on scales of 1-20 Mpc. We also use a way of measuring
projected power spectra from simulations that lowers the sample variance, so
that fewer realizations are needed to reach a desired level of accuracy.

  We find that current data provide slightly tighter constraints on rho_X(z)

in constraining w_X(z). A cosmological constant remains consistent with data,
however, uncertainties remain large for model-independent constraints of dark

formed. Polarization measurements may also detect the signature of a stochastic

experimental concept and the operation of the satellite. Chapter 2 covers the
core cosmological science of the mission, describing the measurements that
Planck will make, what we expect to learn from them about the geometry and
contents of the Universe and about fundamental physics, and the combination of

goodness-of-fit to study the Gaussianity of the Very Small Array (VSA) data.
Out of the 41 published VSA individual pointings dedicated to cosmological
observations, 37 are found to be consistent with Gaussianity, whereas four
pointings show deviations from Gaussianity. In two of them, these deviations
can be explained as residual systematic effects of a few visibility points
which, when corrected, have a negligible impact on the angular power spectrum.
The non-Gaussianity found in the other two (adjacent) pointings seems to be
associated to a local deviation of the power spectrum of these fields with
respect to the common power spectrum of the complete data set, at angular
scales of the third acoustic peak (l = 700-900). No evidence of residual
systematics is found in this case, and unsubstracted point sources are not a
plausible explanation either. If those visibilities are removed, a cosmological
analysis based on this new VSA power spectrum alone shows no differences in the
parameter constraints with respect to our published results, except for the
physical baryon density, which decreases by 10 percent. Finally, the method has
been also used to analyse the VSA observations in the Corona Borealis
supercluster region (Genova-Santos et al. 2005), which show a strong decrement
which cannot be explained as primordial CMB. Our method finds a clear deviation
(99.82%) with respect to Gaussianity in the second-order moment of the
distribution, and which can not be explained as systematic effects. A detailed
study shows that the non-Gaussianity is produced in scales of l~500, and that
this deviation is intrinsic to the data (in the sense that can not be explained
in terms of a Gaussian field with a different power spectrum).

of the anti-correlation between giant planets and terrestrial planets expected

with a realistic range of planetary masses, as a simple model for the initial
conditions prior to scattering, and show that after scattering the surviving
planets reproduce well the known extrasolar planet eccentricities beyond a >
0.5 AU. By tracking the minimum periastron values of all planets during the

formation. We find that scattering affects inner planet formation at orbital
separations less than 50% of the final periastron distance of the innermost
massive planet in approximately 30% of the realizations, and can occasionally
influence planet formation at orbital separations less than 20% of the final

the power spectrum of 21 cm fluctuations from minihalos and show that the
signal decreases rapidly as feedback increases the Jeans mass. We then show
that even a small Lyman-alpha background increases the 21 cm fluctuations of
the diffuse IGM well beyond those of the minihalos; because the mass fraction
in the IGM is much larger, minihalos will lie buried within the IGM signal. The
distinctive signatures of non-linear bias and minihalo structure emerge only at
much smaller scales, well beyond the resolution of any upcoming instruments.
Using simple, but representative, reionization histories, we then show that the

rapidly than T Tauri stars, by roughly a factor of 2. Likewise, Class I disk
accretion rates are only a factor of two larger than those of T Tauri stars,
less than the mass infall rates predicted by envelope models by 1-2 orders of
magnitude. In at least a few cases the discrepancy appears to be caused by T
Tauri stars being misclassified as Class I stars because of their edge-on disk
orientation. Stars where the envelope density and infall velocity have been
determined directly and unambiguously imply that stellar mass is not acquired
in a steady-state fashion, but instead through brief outbursts of enhanced
accretion. If some Class I stars are in fact as old as T Tauri stars,
replenishment may be necessary to sustain the long-lived envelopes, possibly
via continued dynamical interactions with cloud material.

have been identified according to the Postman et al. morphological

tight color-magnitude relation very similar in color, although the two clusters
present different X-ray luminosities and shapes, with RX J0849+4452 being three
times more X-ray luminous and more compact, and having a temperature two times
higher. The elliptical galaxy color-magnitude relations (CMR) in RX J0849+4452

0.012 mag and 0.024 +/- 0.015 mag, respectively, within 2 arcminutes (~1Mpc at
z=1.26) from the cluster X-ray emission centers. Simple modeling of the
scatters using stellar population models from Bruzual and Charlot, gives a mean
luminosity-weighted age t > 2.5 Gyr (z_f > 2.75). S0 galaxies follow the
elliptical CMR; they show larger scatters about the CMR.
  The intrinsic scatter decreases and the CMR slopes are steeper at smaller

cluster elliptical galaxies are already in place at z=1.26, both in the more
evolved cluster RX J0849+4452, and in its less evolved companion RX J0848+4453.

X-ray afterglows of total exposure ~10^7s. We find that most afterglows are
consistent with pure power-laws plus extinction. Significant outliers to the
population exist at the 5-10% level and have anomalously soft, possibly thermal
spectra. Four bursts are singled out via possible detections of 2-5 lines: GRBs
060218, 060202, 050822, and 050714B. Alternatively, a blackbody model with
kT~0.1-0.5 keV can describe the soft emission in each afterglow. The most
significant soft component detections in the full data set of ~2000 spectra
correspond to GRB060218/SN2006aj, with line significances ranging up to
\~20-sigma. A thermal plasma model fit to the data indicates that the flux is
primarily due to L-shell transitions of Fe at ~ solar abundance. We associate
(>4-sigma significant) line triggers in the 3 other events with K-shell
transitions in light metals. We favor a model where the possible line emission
in these afterglows arises from the mildly relativistic cocoon of matter
surrounding the GRB jet as it penetrates and exits the surface of the
progenitor star. The emitting material in each burst is at a similar distance
\~10^12--10^13 cm, a similar density ~10^17 cm^-3, and subject to a similar
flux of ionizing radiation. The lines may correlate with the X-ray flaring. For
the blackbody interpretation, the soft flux may arise from break out of the GRB
shock or plasma cocoon from the progenitor stellar wind, as recently suggested
for GRB060218 (Campana et al. 2006). Due to the low z of GRB060218, bursts
faint in Gamma-rays with fluxes dominated by this soft X-ray component could
outnumber classical GRBs 100-1.

assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) is up to 15% smaller than
in models without this assumption, non-LTE models (NLTE) and that line shapes
vary significantly for the two model types. A comparison with available high
quality microlensing data, capable of tracing H alpha absorption across the
face of one G5III giant, shows that the LTE model that fits the EW best is
about 100K hotter than and the best-fitting NLTE model has a similar Teff as
predicted by the spectral type analysis of the observed star but agree within
the uncertainties of the observationally derived temperature. Neither LTE nor
NLTE models fit the line shape well. We suspect unmodelled chromospheric
emission. Line shape diagnostics suggest lower gravities than derived for the
star and are unacceptable low in the case of the LTE models. We show that EW
alone is insufficient for comparison to stellar model atmospheres, but combined
with a new shape parameter we define is promising. In stellar parameter ranges

counterparts and 47 ``highly ionized'' absorbers without 21 cm emission. 11 of
these high-velocity O VI absorbers are positive-velocity wings (broad O VI
features extending asymmetrically to velocities of up to 300 km/s). The highly
ionized HVC population is characterized by <b(O VI)>=38+/-10 km/s and <log
N_a(O VI)>=13.83+/-0.36. We find that 81% (30/37) of high-velocity O VI
absorbers have clear accompanying C III absorption, and 76% (29/38) have
accompanying H I absorption in the Lyman series. The lower average width of the
high-velocity H I absorbers implies the H I lines arise in a separate, lower
temperature phase than the O VI. We find that the shape of the wing profiles is
well reproduced by a radiatively cooling, vertical outflow. However, the
outflow has to be patchy and out of ionization equilibrium. An alternative
model, consistent with the observations, is one where the highly ionized HVCs
represent the low N(H I) tail of the HVC population, with the O VI formed at
the interfaces around the embedded H I cores. Though we cannot rule out a Local
Group explanation, we favor a Galactic origin. This is based on the recent
evidence that both H I HVCs and the million-degree gas detected in X-ray
absorption are Galactic phenomena. Since the highly ionized HVCs appear to
trace the interface between these two Galactic phases, it follows that highly
ionized HVCs are Galactic themselves. However, the non-detection of
high-velocity O VI in halo star spectra implies that any Galactic high-velocity
O VI exists at z-distances beyond a few kpc.

future asteroseismic space missions. The ""peak tagging"" is an important step in
the analysis of these data to provide estimations of stellar oscillation mode
parameters, i.e., frequencies, rotation rates, and further studies on the
stellar structure.
  Aims: To increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the asteroseismic spectra
computed from time series representative of MOST and CoRoT observations (30-
and 150-day observations).
  Methods: We apply the curvelet transform -- a recent image processing
technique which looks for curved patterns -- to echelle diagrams built using
asteroseismic power spectra. In this diagram the eigenfrequencies appear as
smooth continuous ridges. To test the method we use Monte Carlo simulations of
several sun-like stars with different combinations of rotation rates,
rotation-axis inclination and signal-to-noise ratios.
  Results: The filtered diagrams enhance the contrast between the ridges of the
modes and the background allowing a better tagging of the modes and a better
extraction of some stellar parameters. Monte Carlo simulations have also shown
that the region where modes can be detected is enlarged at lower and higher
frequencies compared to the raw spectra. Even more, the extraction of the mean
rotational splitting from modes at low frequency can be done more easily than
using the raw spectrum.

and a break at t_b = 0.48 +/- 0.03 days after the GRB, provides the best fit of
the optical afterglow decline. This shape is interpreted as due to collimated
emission, for which we determine a jet opening angle theta_{jet} of about 3.2
degrees. An achromatic bump starting around 0.2 d after the GRB is possibly
marginally detected in the optical light curves. Optical spectroscopy shows the
presence of two rest-frame ultraviolet metal absorption systems at z = 1.5216

GRB host galaxy. Analysis of the absorption lines at z = 1.5216 suggests that
the host of this GRB may be a Damped Lyman-alpha Absorber. The optical V-band
afterglow appears polarized, with P= (2.4 +/- 0.6) % and theta = (170 +/- 7)
degrees, suggesting an asymmetric blastwave expansion. An X-ray-to-optical
spectral flux distribution of the GRB 030328 afterglow was obtained at 0.78
days after the GRB and fitted using a broken powerlaw, with an optical spectral
slope beta_{opt} = 0.47 +/- 0.15, and an X-ray slope beta_{X} = 1.0 +/- 0.2.
The discussion of these results in the context of the ""fireball model"" shows

depends on their accretion luminosity and the central black hole mass. Our
studies cover about seven orders of magnitude in accretion luminosity and the
full range of AGN black hole masses. We find that AGNs form two distinct and
well separated sequences on the radio-loudness -- Eddington-ratio plane. The
`upper' sequence is formed by radio selected AGNs, the `lower' sequence
contains mainly optically selected objects. Whereas an apparent `gap' between
the two sequences may be an artifact of selection effects, the sequences
themselves mark the real upper bounds of radio-loudness of two distinct
populations of AGNs: those hosted respectively by elliptical and disk galaxies.
Both sequences show the same dependence of the radio-loudness on the Eddington
ratio (an increase with decreasing Eddington ratio), which suggests that the
normalization of this dependence is determined by the black hole spin. This
implies that central black holes in giant elliptical galaxies have (on average)
much larger spins than black holes in spiral/disc galaxies. This
galaxy-morphology related radio-dichotomy breaks down at high accretion rates
where the dominant fraction of luminous quasars hosted by elliptical galaxies
is radio quiet. This led to speculations in the literature that formation of
powerful jets at high accretion rates is intermittent and related to switches
between two disk accretion modes, as directly observed in some BH X-ray
binaries. We argue that such intermittency can be reconciled with the spin
paradigm, provided that successful formation of relativistic jets by rotating
black holes requires collimation by MHD outflows from accretion disks.

space and time (pulse phase). In addition we give a description of the special
EPIC-pn Burst mode and guidance for data reduction in that mode.
  We analysed spectra for the nebula and pulsar separately in the 0.6-12.0 keV
energy band. All data were processed with the SAS 6.0.0 XMM-Newton Scientific
Analysis System package; models were fitted to the data with XSPEC 11. The high
time resolution of EPIC-pn in its Burst mode (7 micros) was used for a phase
resolved analysis of the pulsar spectrum, after determination of the period
with epoch folding techniques. Data from the Small Window mode were processed
and corrected for pile-up allowing for spectroscopy simultaneously resolved in
space and time.
  The spatial variation of the spectrum over the entire region of the Crab
shows a gradual spectral softening from the inner pulsar region to the outer
nebula region with a variation in photon index, Gamma, from 2.0 to 2.4. Pulse
phase resolved spectroscopy of the Crab Pulsar reveals a phase dependent
modulation of the photon index in form of a significant hardening of the
spectrum in the inter-peak phase from Gamma =1.7 during the pulse peak to Gamma
=1.5.

to starlight. Hot dust and PAH emission is found mostly in high surface

rotating stellar models that have a relatively stiff, $n=1$ polytropic equation
of state and a wide range of rotational energies. This suggests that such
instabilities can arise in neutron stars that are differentially, although not
necessarily rapidly, rotating. The instability seems to be directly triggered
by the presence of a corotation resonance inside the star. Our analysis also
suggests that a resonant cavity resulting from a local minimum in the radial
vortensity profile of the star plays an important role in amplifying the
unstable mode. Hence, it appears as through this instability is closely related
to the so-called ``Rossby wave instability'' \citep{LLCN99} that has been found
to arise in accretion disks. In addition to the one-armed ($m=1$) spiral mode,
we have found that higher-order ($m = 2$ and $m=3$) nonaxisymmetric modes also
can become unstable if corotation points that resonate with the
eigenfrequencies of these higher-order modes also appear inside the star. The
growth rate of each mode seems to depend on the location of its corotation
radius with respect to the vortensity profile (or on the depth of its
corotation radius inside the vortensity well). The existence of such
instabilities makes the stability criterion for differentially rotating neutron
stars non-unique. Also, the gravitational-waves emitted from such unstable
systems generally will not have a monochromatic frequency spectrum.

abundances of the photospheres to other stellar characteristics, without being
concerned by possible different original chemical composition. Furthermore, if
a continuous transition region from the very peculiar to the so called normal
A-F stars exists, it should be possible to detect objects with mild
peculiarities. As a first step of a larger project, an abundance analysis of 5
F-A type stars in the young cluster IC2391 was performed using high resolution
spectra obtained with the UVES instrument of the ESO VLT. Our targets seem to
follow a general abundance pattern: close to solar abundance of the light
elements and iron peak elements, heavy elements are slightly overabundant with
respect to the sun, similar to what was found in previous studies of normal
field A-type stars of the galactic plane. We detected a weakly chemically
peculiar star, HD74044. Its element pattern contains characteristics of CP1 as
well as CP2 stars, enhanced abundances of iron peak elements and also higher

on quantum dot spin-qubits. Mid-size double quantum dots, with an odd number of

illustrate the phase coexistence by considering the distributions of mesoscopic

a non-equilibrium theory in the directed percolation universality class.

$\Lambda$ system for an imperfectly prepared dark state. This is followed by a
slower population loss due to both the detuning of the microwave fields from
the EIT resonance and the existing decoherence mechanisms. We find analytic
expressions for the slow loss rate, with coefficients that depend on the
particular decoherence mechanisms, thereby providing a means to probe,
identify, and quantify various sources of decoherence with EIT. We go beyond
the rotating wave approximation to consider how strong microwave fields can
induce additional off-resonant transitions in the SQC, and we show how these
effects can be mitigated by compensation of the resulting AC Stark shifts.

spaced linear molecular J-aggregates, whose excited states are Frenkel
excitons. The aggregate with the higher (lower) exciton band edge energy is
considered as the donor (acceptor). The celebrated theory of F\""orster
resonance energy transfer (FRET), which relates the transfer rate to the
overlap integral of optical spectra, fails in this situation. We point out that
in addition to the well-known fact that the point-dipole approximation breaks
down (enabling energy transfer between optically forbidden states), also the
perturbative treatment of the electronic interactions between donor and
acceptor system, which underlies the F\""orster approach, in general loses its
validity due to overlap of the exciton bands. We therefore propose a
nonperturbative method, in which donor and acceptor bands are mixed and the
energy transfer is described in terms of a phonon-assisted energy relaxation
process between the two new (renormalized) bands. The validity of the
conventional perturbative approach is investigated by comparing to the
nonperturbative one; in general this validity improves for lower temperature
and larger distances (weaker interactions) between the aggregates. We also
demonstrate that the interference between intraband relaxation and energy
transfer renders the proper definition of the transfer rate and its evaluation
from experiment a complicated issue, which involves the initial excitation
condition.

liquid crystal (LC) into contact with a porous substrate or matrix is
investigated. The DFT used is a combination of the Onsager approximation to
evaluate the excess free energy of the LC fluid and quenched annealed DFT to
evaluate the interaction between the fluid and the porous substrate. When the
fluid alignment far from the substrate is held perpendicular to its surface
there is a thin layer of fluid aligned parallel to the substrate surface for
low matrix densities. For higher matrix densities this director deformation
propagates into the bulk of the fluid. Consideration of a system without
confining walls suggests that for low matrix densities normal alignment is
metastable compared to parallel alignment, while for higher matrix densities it

the calculation of the signature of the horizon, which can be either spacelike,

settles down to a Kerr solution. (iv) We also study the fluxes of energy

chirps in particular, from very noisy data. Chirps are waveforms of the very
general form A(t) exp(i\lambda \phi(t)), where \lambda is a (large) base
frequency, the phase \phi(t) is time-varying and the amplitude A(t) is slowly
varying. Given a set of noisy measurements, we would like to test whether there
is signal or whether the data is just noise. One particular application of note
in conjunction with this problem is the detection of gravitational waves
predicted by Einstein's Theory of General Relativity.
  We introduce detection strategies which are very sensitive and more flexible
than existing feature detectors. The idea is to use structured algorithms which
exploit information in the so-called chirplet graph to chain chirplets together
adaptively as to form chirps with polygonal instantaneous frequency. We then
search for the path in the graph which provides the best trade-off between
complexity and goodness of fit. Underlying our methodology is the idea that
while the signal may be extremely weak so that none of the individual empirical
coefficients is statistically significant, one can still reliably detect by
combining several coefficients into a coherent chain. This strategy is general
and may be applied in many other detection problems. We complement our study
with numerical experiments showing that our algorithms are so sensitive that
they seem to detect signals whenever their strength makes them detectable.

vanishing deficit angle, the specific heat is that of a particle in a flat disk

increases also, and eventually another characteristic temperature (which does
not depend on the deficit angle) arises. When the cone gets sufficiently sharp,
at low and intermediate temperatures the azimuthal degree of freedom is
suppressed. At low temperatures the specific heat varies discontinuously with

review on the main formalism of baryogenesis via leptogenesis through decay of
heavy right-handed Majorana neutrinos, and then calculate the baryon asymmetry
of the universe for known six neutrino mass models viz., three
quasi-degenerate, two inverted and one normal hierarchical models, which are
derived from canonical seesaw formula. The corresponding mass matrices for the
right-handed Majorana neutrino as well as the Dirac neutrino, which are fixed
at the seesaw stage for generating correct light neutrino mass matrices, are
again employed in the calculation of baryogenesis. This procedure removes
possible ambiguity on the choices of Dirac neutrino and right-handed Majorana
mass matrices, and fixes input parameters at the seesaw stage. We find that the
ranges of predictions from both normal hierarchical model and degenerate model
(DegT1A) are almost consistent with the observed baryon asymmetry of the

neutrino masses and mixing angles, and stability under radiative corrections in

doublet models (and particularly in the MSSM) by studying the lineshape of the

degenerate in mass, and their s-channel production would lead to nearly
overlapping resonances. CP-violating effects may connect these two Higgs
bosons, giving origin to one-loop particle mixing, which, due to their mass
proximity, can be resonantly enhanced. The corresponding transition amplitude
contains then CP-even and CP-odd components; besides the signal of
intereference between both amplitudes, leading to a CP-odd asymmetry, we
propose to look for the mixing probability itself, a quantity which, although
CP-even, can originate only from a CP-odd amplitude. We show that, in general,
the effect of such a mixing probability cannot be mimicked by (or be
re-absorbed into) a simple redefinition of the H and A masses in the context of
a CP-conserving model. Specifically, the effects of the CP-mixing are such
that, either the mass-splitting of the H and A bosons cannot be accounted for
in the absence of CP-mixing, and/or the detailed energy dependence of the
produced lineshape is clearly different from the one obtained by redefining the
masses, but not allowing any mixing. This analysis suggests that the detailed
study of the lineshape of this Higgs system may provide valuable information on
the CP nature of the underlying theory.

extended to a two-variable interlace polynomial by the same authors, evokes
many open questions. These include relations between the interlace polynomial
and the Tutte polynomial and the computational complexity of the vertex-nullity

between the two-variable interlace polynomial and the topological Tutte
polynomial of Bollob\'as and Riordan. We define the \gamma invariant as the
coefficient of x^1 in the vertex-nullity interlace polynomial, analogously to
the \beta invariant, which is the coefficient of x^1 in the Tutte polynomial.
We then turn to distance hereditary graphs, and show that graphs in this class
have \gamma invariant of 2^{n+1} when n true twins are added in their
construction. We furthermore show that bipartite distance hereditary graphs are
exactly the class of graphs with \gamma invariant 2, just as the
series-parallel graphs are exactly the class of graphs with \beta invariant 1.
In addition, we show that a bipartite distance hereditary graph arises
precisely as the circle graph of any Euler circuit in the oriented medial graph

to a polynomial system of equations, the first being solved by Elkies in 1988
using the resultant methods of~\Macsyma, with there being a unique rational
nondegenerate solution. For the second case we found that resultants and/or
Gr\""obner bases were not very efficacious. Instead, at the suggestion of
Elkies, we used multidimensional $p$-adic Newton iteration, and were able to
find a nondegenerate solution, albeit over a quartic number field. Due to our
methodology, we do not have much hope of proving that there are no other
solutions. For the third case we found a solution in a nonic number field, but
we were unable to make much progress with the fourth case. We make a few

first order -- i.e. when the subharmonic Melnikov function vanishes
identically. Moreover we can deal as well with the case in which degeneracy
persists to arbitrarily high orders, in the sense that suitable generalisations
to higher orders of the subharmonic Melnikov function are also identically
zero. In general the bifurcation curves are not analytic, and even when they
are smooth they can form cusps at the origin: we say in this case that the
curves are degenerate as the corresponding tangent lines coincide. The
technique we use is completely different from that of Chow and Hale, and it is
essentially based on rigorous perturbation theory.

tilings, the groupoid $\Gmgamma$ is the graph groupoid introduced by Kumjian et

functions that is motivated by probabilistic problems related to continuum
random trees. Indeed it is known since the works of Aldous (1993) and Le Gall
(1991) that a continuous non-negative function $h$ on $[0,1]$ such that
$h(0)=0$ can be seen as the contour process of a compact real tree. This
particular coding of a compact real tree provides additional structures, namely
a root that is the vertex corresponding to $0\in [0,1]$, a linear order
inherited from the usual order on $[0,1]$ and a measure induced by the Lebesgue
measure on $[0,1]$; of course, the root, the linear order and the measure
obtained by such a coding have to satisfy some compatibility conditions. In
this paper, we prove that any compact real tree equipped with a root, a linear
order and a measure that are compatible can be encoded by a non-negative
function $h$ defined on a finite interval $[0, M]$, that is assumed to be
left-continuous with right-limit, without positive jump and such that
$h(0+)=h(0)=0$. Moreover, this function is unique if we assume that the
exploration of the tree induced by such a coding backtracks as less as
possible. We also prove that a measure-change on the tree corresponds to a
re-parametrization of the coding function. In addition, we describe several
path-properties of the coding function in terms of the metric properties of the
real tree.

forms'' for cellular algebras. That is, given a cellular R-algebra A which is
equipped with a family of JM-elements we give a general technique for
constructing orthogonal bases for A, and for all of its irreducible
representations, when the JM-elements separate A. The seminormal forms for A
are defined over the field of fractions of R. Significantly, we show that the
Gram determinant of each irreducible A-module is equal to a product of certain
structure constants coming from the seminormal basis of A. In the non-separated
case we use our seminormal forms to give an explicit basis for a block
decomposition of A.
  The appendix, by Marcos Soriano, gives a general construction of a complete
set of orthogonal idempotents for an algera starting from a set of elements
which act on the algebra in an upper triangular fashion. The appendix shows
that constructions with ""Jucys-Murphy elements""depend, ultimately, on the
Cayley-Hamilton theorem.

region there is not sufficient sunlight over the year to allow for the growth

It is a challenge to reconstruct this geographic shift of the poles in a manner

It as- sumes an additional planet, which must since have disappeared. This is
possible, if it moved in an extremely eccentric orbit and was hot as a result
of tidal work and solar radiation. During a few million years evaporation of
this planet led to a disk-shaped cloud of ions moving around the Sun. This
cloud partially shielded the Earth from the solar radiation, producing the
alteration of cold and warm periods characterizing the Pleistocene. The degree
of shielding is sensitive to the inclination of Earth's orbit, which has a
period of 100000 years. Two cloud structures are discussed. The first is small
and steady. The other builds up to a point where inelastic collisions between
particles induce its collapse The resulting near-periodic time dependence of
the shielding re- sembles that of Dansgaard-Oeschger events. The Pleistocene
came to an end when the additional planet had a close encounter with the Earth,
whereby the Earth suffered a one permil extensional deformation. While this
deformation relaxed to an equilibrium shape in a time of one to several years,
the globe turned relative to the rotation axis: The North Pole moved from

subsequently evaporated. Simple estimates are used here for the

structures with cross-sections of the order of microns ($\mu m$) and lengths of

array of thin beams which, owing to their smallness, can be moved or deflected
easily through the application of low voltages. Since electrostatic forces play
a very major role in maneuvering these devices, a thorough understanding of the
electrostatic properties of these structures is of critical importance,
especially in the design phase of MEMS. In many cases, the electrostatic
analysis of MEMS is carried out using boundary element method (BEM), while the
structural analysis is carried out using finite element method (FEM). In this
paper, we focus on accurate electrostatic analysis of MEMS using BEM. In
particular, we consider the problem of computing the charge distribution and
capacitance of thin conducting plates relevant to the numerical simulation of
MEMS. The reason behind the accuracy of the solver is the fact that it uses
closed-form analytic expressions that are valid seamlessly throughout the
physical domain for computing the influence coefficients. Thus, it is possible
to avoid one of the most serious approximations of the BEM, namely, the
assumption that the effect of a charge distributed over a boundary element can
be approximated by charge located at the centroid of the element. Comparison
with other results available in the literature seems to indicate that the
present results are more accurate than the existing ones.
