We combine 3d radiative transfer calculations and an N-body simulation,
describing structure formation in the intergalactic medium, to detail the
growth of HII regions around high redshift galaxies. Our simulation tracks
1024^3 dark matter particles, in a box of co-moving side length 65.6 Mpc/h.
This large volume allows us to accurately characterize the size distribution of
HII regions throughout most of the reionization process. At the same time, our
simulation resolves many of the small galaxies likely responsible for
reionization. It confirms a picture anticipated by analytic models: HII regions
grow collectively around highly-clustered sources, and have a well-defined
characteristic size, which evolves from a sub-Mpc scale at the beginning of
reionization to R > 10 Mpc towards the end. We present a detailed statistical
description of our results, and compare them with a numerical scheme based on
the analytic model by Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga, and Hernquist. We find that the
analytic calculation reproduces the size distribution of HII regions and the 21
cm power spectrum of the radiative transfer simulation remarkably well. The
ionization field from the simulation, however, has more small scale structure
than the analytic calculation, owing to Poisson scatter in the simulated
abundance of galaxies on small scales. We propose and validate a simple scheme
to incorporate this scatter into our calculations. Our results suggest that
analytic calculations are sufficiently accurate to aid in predicting and
interpreting the results of future 21 cm surveys. In particular, our fast
numerical scheme is useful for forecasting constraints from future 21 cm
surveys, and in constructing mock surveys to test data analysis procedures.

investigated using one- and three-dimensional simulations with periodic and
shearing-periodic boundary conditions in the presence of constant thermal
diffusion and kinematic viscosity coefficients. Consistent with earlier
findings, the flow behavior depends on the average density, <rho>. When
$\bra{\rho}$ is in the range 1-5 x 10^{-24} g cm^{-3} the system is unstable
and segregates into cool and warm phases with temperatures of roughly 100 and
10^4 K, respectively. However, in all cases the resulting average pressure <p>
is independent of <rho> and just a little above the minimum value. For a
constant heating rate of 0.015 erg g^{-1} s^{-1}, the mean pressure is around
24 x 10^{-14} dyn (corresponding to p/k_B ~ K cm^{-3}). Cool patches tend to
coalesce into bigger ones. In all cases investigated there is no sustained
turbulence, which is in agreement with earlier results. Simulations in which
turbulence is driven by a body force show that when rms velocities of between
10 and 30 km/s are obtained, the resulting dissipation rates rates are
comparable to the thermal energy input rate. The resulting mean pressures are
then about 30 x 10^{-14} dyn, corresponding to p/k_B ~ 2170 K cm^{-3}. This is
comparable to the value expected for the Galaxy. Differential rotation tends to
make the flow two-dimensional, that is, uniform in the streamwise direction,
but this does not lead to instability.

of a solar abundance component for emission from the blast-wave, these

blast-wave X-ray emission calculated by evolving realistic SN Ia explosions to
the remnant stage allows us to deduce that one-dimensional delayed detonation
and pulsed delayed detonation models can indeed reproduce the major features of

(2004). An initially steady state accretion disk near a non-rotating
(Schwarzschild) black hole interacts with a ""star"", modeled as an initially
circular region of increased density. Part of the disk is affected by the
interaction. In some cases, a gap develops and shock wave propagates through
the disk. We follow the evolution for order of one dynamical period and we show
how the non-axisymetric density perturbation further evolves and moves
downwards where the material of the disk and the star become eventually
accreted onto the central body.
  When the star perturbs the steady state accretion disk, the disk around the
black hole is destroyed by the effect of perturbation. The perturbed accretion
disk creates a shock wave during the evolution and it loses angular momentum
when the gas hits on the shock waves. Colliding gas with the shock wave is the
one of the basic mechanism of emitting the $X-$rays in the accretion disk. The
series of supernovae occurring in the inner disk could entirely destroy the
disk in that region which leaves a more massive black hole behind, at the
center of galaxies.

Galactic red supergiants (RSGs). Indeed, such a location in the H-R diagram
would be well in the ""Hayashi forbidden zone"" where stars cannot be in
hydrostatic equilibrium. These extraordinary properties, however, rest upon an
assumed effective temperature of 2800-3000 K, far cooler than recent work have
shown RSGs to be. To obtain a better estimate, we fit newly obtained
spectrophotometry in the optical and NIR with the same MARCS models used for
our recent determination of the physical properties of other RSGs; we also use
$V-K$ and $V-J$ from the literature to derive an effective temperatures. We

differential atmospheric refraction and flexure introduce a small drift of the

distribution. For space-based imaging, vibrations, thermal fluctuations and
pointing jitters can modify the PSF core position and flux. These effects need
to be corrected to properly combine the images and obtain optimal
signal-to-noise ratios, accurate relative astrometry and photometry of detected
objects as well as precise detection limits. Usually, one can easily correct
for these effects by using the PSF core, but this is impossible when high
dynamic range observing techniques are used, like coronagrahy with a
non-transmissive occulting mask, or if the stellar PSF core is saturated. We

spectroscopic and resolved populations). A reasonable estimate for the very
low-mass binary fraction is $20 - 25$%. We consider several possible separation
and frequency distributions, including the same one as found for GK stars, a
compressed version of that, a version of the compressed distribution truncated
at 15 AU, and a theoretical distribution which considers the evaporation of
small-N clusters. We conclude that the latter two bracket the observations,
which may mean that these systems form with intrinsically smaller separations
due to their smaller mass, and then are truncated due to their smaller binding
energy. We do not find support for the ``ejection hypothesis'' as their
dominant mode of formation, particularly in view of the similarity in the total
binary fraction compared with slightly more massive stars, and the difficulty
this mechanism has in producing numerous binary systems.

stellar interferometry and estimate the integrated K-band flux originating from
the central 8 AU of the debris disk. We performed precise visibility
measurements at both short (~30 m) and long (~150 m) baselines with the FLUOR
beam-combiner installed at the CHARA Array (Mt Wilson, California) in order to
separately resolve the emissions from the extended debris disk (short
baselines) and from the stellar photosphere (long baselines). After revising
Vega's K-band angular diameter (3.202+/-0.005 mas), we show that a significant
deficit in squared visibility (1.88+/-0.34%) is detected at short baselines
with respect to the best-fit uniform disk stellar model. This deficit can be
either attributed to the presence of a low-mass stellar companion around Vega,
or as the signature of the thermal and scattered emissions from the debris
disk. We show that the presence of a close companion is highly unlikely, as
well as other possible perturbations (stellar morphology, calibration), and
deduce that we have most probably detected the presence of dust in the close
neighbourhood of Vega. The resulting flux ratio between the stellar photosphere
and the debris disk amounts to 1.29+/-0.19% within the FLUOR field-of-view

and interferometric data in order to evaluate the main physical properties of
the inner dust disk. The inferred properties suggest that the Vega system could
be currently undergoing major dynamical perturbations.

in the young universe. Using FORS2 at the ESO VLT and a set of special
interference filters, we identified candidates for high-redshift Lyman-alpha

identifications and to study their spectral properties. The narrow-band
photometry resulted in the detection of 15 likely Lyman-alpha emission

galaxies. In all these cases the presence of Lyman-alpha emission at z = 5.7
was confirmed spectroscopically. The line fluxes of the 15 candidates range
between 3 and 16 * 10^-21 Wm^-2, which corresponds to star-formation rates not
corrected for dust between 1 and 5 Msun/yr. The luminosity function derived for
our photometrically identified objects extends the published luminosity
functions of intrinsically brighter Lyman-alpha galaxies. With this technique
the study of high-redshift Lyman-alpha emission galaxies can be extended to low

we investigate the relaxation to the stable equilibrium $n=\pm 1$ of this

relaxation involves a fast violent relaxation phase followed by a slow
collisional phase as the system goes through a series of quasi-stationary
states. Moreover, in cases where this slow second stage leads to a dynamically
unstable configuration (two peaks with a high mass ratio) it is followed by a
new sequence ``violent relaxation/slow collisional relaxation''. We obtain an
analytical estimate of the relaxation time $t_{2\to \pm 1}$ through the mean
escape time of a particle from its potential well in a bistable system. We find
that the diffusion and dissipation coefficients satisfy Einstein's relation and
that the relaxation time scales as $N e^{1/T}$ at low temperature, in agreement

Galaxies Survey (SINGS). Within the category of nascent starbursts, that we
previously selected by their infrared to radio continuum ratios in large excess
of the average and their hot dust, NGC1377 has the largest infrared excess yet
measured. Optical imaging reveals a morphological distortion suggestive of a
recent accretion event. Infrared spectroscopy reveals a compact and opaque
source dominated by a hot, self-absorbed continuum (tau ~ 20 in the 10 micron
silicate band). We provide physical evidence against non-stellar activity being
the heating source. HII regions are detected through the single [NeII] line,
probing <1% of the ionizing radiation. Not only is the optical depth very high,
but >85% of ionizing photons are suppressed by dust. The only other detected
emission features are molecular hydrogen lines, arguably excited mainly by
shocks, besides photodissociation regions, and weak aromatic bands. The new
observations support our interpretation in terms of an extremely young
starburst (<1 Myr). More generally, galaxies deficient in radio synchrotron are
likely observed within a few Myr of the onset of a starburst and after a long
quiescence, prior to the replenishment of the ISM with cosmic rays. The similar
infrared-radio properties of NGC1377 and some infrared-luminous galaxies
suggest that NGC1377 constitutes an archetype to better understand starburst
evolution. Although rare locally because observed in a brief evolutionary
stage, nascent starbursts may represent a non-negligible fraction of
merger-induced starbursts dominating deep infrared counts. Since they differ
dramatically from usual starburst templates, they bear important consequences
for the interpretation of deep surveys.

the Brillouin zone. Dispersions and lifetimes of the unoccupied states, acting
as the final states in the photoemission process, are determined from a
very-low-energy electron diffraction experiment supported by first-principles
calculations based on a Bloch waves treatment of multiple scattering. The
experimental unoccupied states of TiTe2 feature dramatic non-free-electron
effects such as multiband composition and non-parabolic dispersions. The
valence band layer-perpendicular dispersions are then determined from a
photoemission experiment consistently interpreted on the basis of the
experimental final states to achieve control over the 3-dimensional wavevector.
The experimental results demonstrate the absence of the Te 4pz* Fermi surface
pocket at the Gamma point and significant self-energy renormalization of the
valence band dispersions. Photoemission calculations based on a novel Bloch
waves formalism within the one-step theory reveal limitations of understanding
photoemission from layered materials such as TiTe2 in terms of direct

determinations. Based on the value of the ordering temperature and of the

suppresses the transition temperature in bulk Mn-doped GaAs, due to the
difference between the light and heavy band masses, can stabilize ferromagnetic
order for a single layer of Mn in a GaAs quantum well. This comes at the price
of quantum fluctuations that suppress the ordered moment from that of a fully

is made out of two dynamical components of different nature: a variable
cosmological term, Lambda, and a dynamical ``cosmon'', X, possibly interacting
with Lambda but not with matter -- which remains conserved. We call this
scenario the LXCDM model. One possibility for X would be a scalar field, but it
is not the only one. The overall equation of state (EOS) of the LXCDM model can
effectively appear as quintessence or phantom energy depending on the mixture
of the two components. Both the dynamics of Lambda and of X could be linked to
high energy effects near the Planck scale. In the case of Lambda it may be
related to the running of this parameter under quantum effects, whereas X might
be identified with some fundamental field (say, a dilaton) left over as a
low-energy ``relic'' by e.g. string theory. We find that the dynamics of the
LXCDM model can trigger a future stopping of the Universe expansion and can
keep the ratio rho_D/rho_m (DE density to matter-radiation density) bounded and
of order 1. Therefore, the model could explain the so-called ``cosmological
coincidence problem''. This is in part related to the possibility that the
present value of the cosmological term can be Lambda<0 in this framework (the
current total DE density nevertheless being positive). However, a cosmic halt
could occur even if Lambda>0 because of the peculiar behavior of X as ``Phantom
Matter''. We describe various cosmological scenarios made possible by the

fermions that seemingly do little more than conserve 4-momentum, angular
momentum, lepton number, and lepton flavour in weak interactions. In the last
decade conclusive evidence has demonstrated that the Standard Model's
description of neutrinos does not match reality. We now know that neutrinos
undergo flavour oscillations, violating lepton flavour conservation and
implying that neutrinos have non-zero mass. A rich oscillation phenomenology
then becomes possible, including matter-enhanced oscillation and possibly CP
violation in the neutrino sector. Extending the Standard Model to include
neutrino masses requires the addition of new fields and mass terms, and
possibly new methods of mass generation. In this review article I will discuss
the evidence that has established the existence of neutrino oscillation, and
then highlight unresolved issues in neutrino physics, such as the nature of
three-generational mixing (including CP-violating effects), the origins of
neutrino mass, the possible existence of light sterile neutrinos, and the
difficult question of measuring the absolute mass scale of neutrinos.

starts as a small torus of string length dimension filled with a hot gas of
strings. In such extreme conditions, in addition to the departure from Einstein
gravity which is due to the dilaton, one expects higher curvature corrections
to be relevant. Motivated by this fact, we study the effect of the leading
alpha'^3 corrections in type IIB string theory for this scenario. Within the
assumptions of: weak coupling, adiabatic evolution and thermodynamical
equilibrium, we perturbatively solved the corresponding equations of motion in
two different cases: (i) the isotropic case which is governed by a single scale
factor and (ii) the anisotropic case given by two different scale factors. In
the first case, we consider two regimes (ia) The Hagedorn regime where the
string gas equation of state is that of pressureless dust, and (ib) the
radiation regime. In the second case, (ii), we only considered a radiation-like
equation of state. We found that the inclusion of alpha' corrections affects
the scale factor(s) in opposite way in the Hagedorn and in the radiation
regimes, acting as a driving force for the first one and a damping force for
the second one. This effect is small for reasonable initial conditions and it
is only observed at early times. Morever it is bigger in the Hagedorn regime
than in the radiation regime. We also analyzed the fixed points of the system.
We found that there exists a stable dS fixed point, which does not exist when
the corrections are neglected.

action consists of the dimensionally extended Euler densities. Compared to
other higher order derivative gravity theories, the Lovelock gravity is
attractive since it has a lot of remarkable features such as that there are no
more than second order derivatives with respect to metric in its equations of
motion, and that the theory is free of ghost. Recently in the study of black
string and black brane in the Lovelock gravity, a special class of Lovelock
gravity is considered, which is named pure Lovelock gravity, where only one
Euler density term exists. In this paper we study black hole solutions in the
special class of Lovelock gravity and associated thermodynamic properties. Some
interesting features are found, which are quite different from the
corresponding ones in general relativity.

The effect can be understood in terms of a new type of Maslov index associated

renormalized by employing the theory of conserving approximations, which
results in a thermodynamically consistent approximation that maintains
Hugenholtz-Van Hove theorem and Landau's requirement of quasiparticles. The
approximation is equivalent to the Hartree approximation with {\it effective
masses} and {\it effective coupling constants} of baryons and mesons. The
effective masses and coupling constants are naturally required by
self-consistency of the theory of conserving approximations. The approximation
is applied to nuclear and neutron matter, which suggests that the lower bound
of nuclear compressibility $K \sim 180$ MeV (with the symmetry energy $a_4 =
35.0$ MeV) be required to be consistent with properties of nuclear matter and
the maximum masses of observed hadronic neutron stars ($M_{max} \ge 2.00$

effective masses and coupling constants of baryons and mesons will be important
constraints to examine models of nuclear and neutron matter. The accumulating

will supply significant information in order to testify theoretical consistency

the spatial structure in the MBSG. Interestingly, we found that the frequency
of cooperation of the MBSG on a scale-free network peaks at a specific value of
the payoff parameter. This phenomenon indicates that properly encouraging
selfish behaviors can optimally enhance the cooperation. The memory effects of
individuals are discussed in detail and some non-monotonous phenomena are
observed on both lattices and scale-free networks. Our work may shed some new
light on the study of evolutionary games over networks.

or contact numbers are useful for three-dimensional structure prediction and
helpful for intuitive understanding of the sequence-structure relationship.
Accurate prediction methods will serve as a basis for these and other purposes.
Results: We implemented a program CRNPRED which predicts secondary structures,
contact numbers and residue-wise contact orders. This program is based on a
novel machine learning scheme called critical random networks. Unlike most
conventional one-dimensional structure prediction methods which are based on
local windows of an amino acid sequence, CRNPRED takes into account the whole
sequence. CRNPRED achieves, on average per chain, Q3 = 81% for secondary
structure prediction, and correlation coefficients of 0.75 and 0.61 for contact
number and residue-wise contact order predictions, respectively. Conclusion:
CRNPRED will be a useful tool for computational as well as experimental
biologists who need accurate one-dimensional protein structure predictions.

model for it, in reasonable agreement with experimental observations, has been
proposed by Yakushevich (Y) and developed by several authors; in this, the DNA
subunits made of a nucleoside and the attached nitrogen bases are described by
a single degree of freedom. In this paper we propose and investigate, both
analytically and numerically, a ``composite'' version of the Y model, in which
the nucleoside and the base are described by separate degrees of freedom. The
model proposed here contains as a particular case the Y model and shares with
it many features and results, but represents an improvement from both the
conceptual and the phenomenological point of view. It provides a more realistic
description of DNA and possibly a justification for the use of models which
consider the DNA chain as uniform. It shows that the existence of solitons is a
generic feature of the underlying nonlinear dynamics and is to a large extent
independent of the detailed modelling of DNA. The model we consider supports
solitonic solutions, qualitatively and quantitatively very similar to the Y
solitons, in a fully realistic range of all the physical parameters
characterizing the DNA.

fundamentally different from the case of scalar particles. Intrinsic properties
of fermions (exclusion principle and spin) affect strongly the interaction of
fermions with both Hawking radiation and metric of the spacetime. In particular
we have found the following: first, while the fermion vacuum state seen by the
Rindler observer is an entangled state in which the right and left Rindler
wedge states appear in correlated pairs as in the case of the scalar particles,
the entanglement disappears in the excited state due to the exclusion
principle; second, the spin of the fermion experiences the Winger rotation
under a uniform acceleration; and third, the quantum information of fermions
encoded in spin (entangled state is composed of different spin states but with
the same mode function) is dissipated not by the Hawking radiation but by the
Wigner rotation as the pair approaches the event horizon.

These exhibit a variety of dynamical behaviors, including ballistic motion,

sequential machines (SSMs). Recently, we showed that two QSMs M_1 and M_2 with
n_1 and n_2 states, respectively, are equivalent iff they are
(n_1+n_2)^2--equivalent (Theoretical Computer Science 358 (2006) 65-74).
However, using this result to check the equivalence likely needs exponential
expected time. In this paper, we consider the time complexity of deciding the
equivalence between QSMs and related problems. The main results are as follows:
(1) We present a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding the equivalence between
QSMs, and, if two QSMs are not equivalent, this algorithm will produce an
input-output pair with length not more than (n_1+n_2)^2. (2) We improve the
bound for the equivalence between QSMs from (n_1+n_2)^2 to n_1^2+n_2^2-1, by
employing Moore and Crutchfield's method (Theoretical Computer Science
  237 (2000) 275-306). (3) We give that two MO-1QFAs with n_1 and n_2 states,
respectively, are equivalent iff they are (n_1+n_2)^2--equivalent, and further
obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding the equivalence between two
MO-1QFAs. (4) We provide a counterexample showing that Koshiba's method to
solve the problem of deciding the equivalence between MM-1QFAs may be not
valid, and thus the problem is left open again.

with photons whose wave function propagates in a one-dimensional Kerr-nonlinear
photonic crystal. The photonic crystal causes the incident photons to undergo
Bragg reflection by its periodic structure of dielectric materials and forms
the photonic band structure, namely, the light dispersion relation. This
dispersion relation reduces the group velocity of the wave function of the
photons, so that it enhances nonlinear interaction of the photons. (Because
variation of the group velocity against the wave vector is very steep, we have
to tune up the wavelength of injected photons precisely, however.) If the
photonic crystal includes layers of a Kerr medium, we can rotate the phase of
the wave function of the incident photons by a large angle efficiently. We show
that we can construct the nonlinear sign-shift (NS) gate proposed by Knill,
Laflamme, and Milburn (KLM) by this method. Thus, we can construct the
conditional sign-flip gate for two qubits, which is crucial for quantum
computation. Our NS gate works with probability unity in principle while KLM's
original one is a nondeterministic gate conditioned on the detection of an
auxiliary photon.
