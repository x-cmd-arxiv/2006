have revealed the physical properties of stellar galactic nuclei in nucleated
dwarf galaxies in the Virgo cluster of galaxies. In order to elucidate the
formation processes of nucleated dwarfs, we numerically investigate gas
dynamics, star formation, and chemical evolution within the central 1 kpc of
gas disks embedded within the galactic stellar components of non-nucleated
dwarfs. We find that high density, compact stellar systems can be formed in the
central regions of dwarfs as a result of dissipative, repeated merging of
massive stellar and gaseous clumps developed from nuclear gaseous spiral arms
as a result of local gravitational instability. The central stellar components
are found to have stellar masses which are typically $~$5% of their host dwarfs
and show very flattened shapes, rotational kinematics, and central velocity
dispersions significantly smaller than those of their host dwarfs. We also find
that more massive dwarfs can develop more massive, more metal-rich, and higher
density stellar systems in their central regions, because star formation and
chemical enrichment proceed more efficiently owing to the less dramatic
suppression of star formation by supernovae feedback effects in more massive
dwarfs. Based on these results, we suggest that gas-rich, non-nucleated dwarfs
can be transformed into nucleated ones as a result of dissipative gas dynamics
in their central regions. We discuss the origin of the observed correlations
between physical properties of stellar galactic nuclei and those of their host
galaxies.

polarization toward the nova from the steady continuum polarization components
and H$\alpha$ line emission components. After subtracting the interstellar
polarization component from the observations, we found that the H$\alpha$
emission seen on 2003 October 7 was clearly polarized. In the polarized flux
spectrum, the H$\alpha$ emission had a distinct red wing extending to $\sim
+4900$ km s$^{-1}$ and a shoulder around $+3500$ km s$^{-1}$, showing a
constant position angle of linear polarization $\theta_{\rm *}\simeq
155\arcdeg\pm 15\arcdeg$. This suggests that the nova had an asymmetric outflow
with a velocity of $v_{\rm wind}\simeq 3500$ km s$^{-1}$ or more, which is six
times higher than the expansion velocity of the ionized shell at the same
epoch. Such a high-velocity component has not previously been reported for a
nova in the `moderately fast' speed class. Our observations suggest the
occurrence of violent mass-loss activity in the nova binary system even during
the common-envelope phase. The position angle of the polarization in the
H$\alpha$ wing is in good agreement with that of the continuum polarization
found on 2003 September 26 ($p_{\rm *}\simeq 0.4$--0.6 %), which disappeared
within the following 2 d. The uniformity of the PA between the continuum
polarization and the wing polarization on October 7 suggests that the axis of
the circumstellar asymmetry remained nearly constant during the period of our
observations.

gravitational modes. This gives a phenomenological scale to the dynamical
equations governing the cosmological expansion that must satisfy constraints
consistent with quantum measurability and spatial flatness. Examination of
these constraints for the observed dark energy density establishes a time
interval from the transition to the present, suggesting major modifications
from the thermal equations of state far from Planck density scales. The
assumption that a phase transition initiates the radiation dominated epoch is
shown under several scenarios to produce fluctuations to the CMB of the order
observed. Quantum measurability constraints (eg. uncertainly relations) define
cosmological scales bounded by luminal expansion rates. It is shown that the
dark energy can consistently be interpreted as being due to the vacuum energy
of collective gravitational modes which manifest as the zero-point motions of
coherent Planck scale mass units prior to the UV scale onset of gravitational

the spectral aerosol optical depths (AOD), columnar water vapour content (W),
Total Columnar Ozone (TCO), total number concentration (NT) of near surface
aerosols, mass concentration of black carbon (MB), aerosol mass loading (MT),
and Global Solar Radiation. Based on these measured parameters, we present the

second-harmonic and fundamental beams is retrieved, as a function of the
absolute orientation of the nonlinear emitters. Sensitivity down to
approximately 3.2 photon/s in the spatio-temporal mode of the local oscillator
is obtained. This value is high enough to efficiently detect the coherent
second-harmonic emission from a single KTiOPO4 crystal of sub-wavelength size.

increased energy absorption rate, in stark contrast to the momentum
localization generally observed. These resonances occur when the scaled
Planck's constant hbar=(r/s)*4pi, for any integers r and s. However only the
hbar=r*2pi resonances are easily observable. We have observed high-order
quantum resonances (s>2) utilizing a sample of low temperature, non-condensed
atoms and a pulsed optical standing wave. Resonances are observed for
hbar=(r/16)*4pi r=2-6. Quantum numerical simulations suggest that our
observation of high-order resonances indicates a larger coherence length than
expected from an initially thermal atomic sample.

components follow the CUE ensemble of random matrices, of relevance to
quantized chaotic systems that violate time-reversal symmetry. However, as the
algorithm tracks the evolution of a single state, it is possible to employ
other operators, in particular it is possible that the generic quantum chaos
found above becomes of a nongeneric kind such as is found in the quantum cat
maps, and in toy models of the quantum bakers map.
