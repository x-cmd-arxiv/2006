Gamma-ray Repeaters (SGRs) are magnetars, i.e. neutron stars with extremely
high surface magnetic fields ($B > 10^{14}$ G). The origin of these high
magnetic fields is uncertain, but a popular hypothesis is that magnetars are
born with an initial spin period not much exceeding the convective overturn
time (~3ms), which results in a powerful dynamo action, amplifying the seed
magnetic field to $> ~10^{15}$ G. Part of this rotation energy is then expected
to power the supernova through rapid magnetic braking. It is therefore possible
that magnetars creation is accompanied by supernovae that are an order of
magnitude more energetic than normal supernovae, provided their initial spin
period is ~1 ms. However, we list here evidence that the explosion energies of
these supernova remnants associated with AXPs and SGRs -- Kes 73 (AXP 1E
1841-045), CTB 109 (AXP 1E2259+586) and N49 (SGR 0526-66) -- are close to the
canonical supernova explosion energy of $10^{51}$~erg, suggesting an initial
spin period of > ~5ms.
  We therefore do not find evidence that magnetars are formed from rapidly
rotating proto-neutron stars, allowing for the possibility that they descend
from stellar progenitor with high magnetic field cores, and we discuss the
merits of both formation scenarios.
  In an appendix we describe the analysis of XMM-Newton observations of Kes 73
and N49 used to derive the explosion energies for these remnants.

$R_1$ appears near the low-density limit region, which is due to the
contamination of Si X line at 50.703 \AA . Using the emission measure
distribution (EMD) model derived by Audard et al. (2001) for Capella and
emissivities calculated with APEC model by Smith et al. (2001), we successfully
estimate contributions of Fe XVI lines at 50.367 \AA and 50.576 \AA (73% and
62%, respectively). A comparison between observed ratios and theoretical
predictions constrains the electron densities (in logarithmic) for Procyon to
be 8.61$^{+0.24}_{-0.20}$ cm$^{-3}$, while for $\alpha$ Cen A$&$B, Capella and

respectively. The comparison of our results with those constrained by the
triplet of He-like carbon shows a good agreement. For normal stars, our results
display a narrow uncertainty, while for active stars, a relatively larger
uncertainty, due to the contamination from Fe XVI lines, is found. Another
possible reason may be that the determination of the continuum level, since the
emission lines of Si X become weak for the active stars. For $\epsilon$ Eri, an
electron density in the C V forming region was estimated firstly through Si X

observation carried out in 1998, reaching a level of ~ 10^34 erg/s, the lowest
ever observed in this source. The spectral analysis reveals the presence of a
significant excess at low energies over the main power-law spectral component.
The soft excess can be described by a black-body spectrum with a temperature of
about 1 keV and an emitting region with a radius of ~ 140 m. Although the
current data do not permit to ascertain whether the soft excess is pulsed or
not, its properties are consistent with emission from the neutron star polar
cap. This is the third detection of a soft excess in a low luminosity (~ 10^34

a higher temperature and a smaller surface area than in the high luminosity

a large set of cluster parameters, including variations in the stellar IMF, the
intrinsic cluster mass, and mean mass density. Gas-dynamical models coupled
with the Cambridge stellar evolution tracks allow us to derive a scheme to
recover the real cluster mass given measured half-light radius, one-dimensional
velocity dispersion and age. We monitor the evolution with time of the ratio of
real to apparent mass through the parameter eta. When we compute eta for rich
star clusters, we find non-monotonic evolution in time when the IMF stretches
beyond a critical cutoff mass of 25.5 solar mass. We also monitor the rise of
color gradients between the inner and outer volume of clusters: we find trends
in time of the stellar IMF power indices overlapping well with those derived
for the LMC cluster NGC 1818 at an age of 30 Myr. We argue that the core region
of massive Antennae clusters should have suffered from much segregation despite
their low ages. We apply these results to a cluster mass function, and find
that the peak of the mass distribution would appear to observers shifted to

The CMB anisotropies may carry a signature of this very early Universe

constraints on the parameters of the noncommutative inflation model. In this
paper we analyze the noncommutative chaotic inflation model by means of the
WMAP three year results. We show that the noncommutative chaotic inflation

reasonable range of $e$-folding number $N$, provided that the value of $p$ in
the potential $V(\phi)\propto \phi^p$ is enhanced roughly to $p\sim 12-18$.
Applying a likelihood analysis to the WMAP results, we find the best-fit values

advantage of the hyperfine structure (HFS) affecting the \ion{Ba}{ii} resonance
line of the odd isotopes. The fractional abundance of the odd isotopes of Ba is
derived from a requirement that Ba abundances from the resonance line $\lambda

The results are based on NLTE line formation and analysis of high resolution (R

that the fraction of the odd isotopes of Ba grows toward the lower Ba abundance

This indicates the higher contribution of the $r-$process to barium in the
thick disk stars compared to the solar system matter. The obtained fraction
increases with the [Eu/Ba] abundance ratio growth in agreement with
expectations. A significant fraction of the \emph{even} isotopes of Ba found in
old Galactic stars (the thick disk stars), $\sim67$%, is in contrast to the

Kurtz, Churchwell & Wood (1994) radio ultracompact (UC) HII region surveys. We
detected a total of 155 sub-mm clumps associated with the IRAS point sources
and identified three distinct types of object: ultracompact cm-wave sources
that are not associated with any sub-mm emission (sub-mm quiet objects), sub-mm
clumps that are associated with ultracompact cm-wave sources (radio-loud
clumps); and sub-mm clumps that are not associated with any known ultracompact
cm-wave sources (radio-quiet clumps). 90% of the sample of IRAS point sources
were found to be associated with strong sub-mm emission. We consider the sub-mm
colours, morphologies and distance-scaled fluxes of the sample of sub-mm clumps
and show that the sub-mm quiet objects are unlikely to represent embedded UC
HII regions unless they are located at large heliocentric distances. Many of
the 2.5 arcmin SCUBA fields contain more than one sub-mm clump, with an average
number of companions (the companion clump fraction) of 0.90. The clumps are
more strongly clustered than other candidate HMPOs and the mean clump surface
density exhibits a broken power-law distribution with a break at 3 pc. We
demonstrate that the sub-mm and cm-wave fluxes of the majority of radio-loud
clumps are in excellent agreement with the standard model of ultracompact HII
regions. We speculate on the nature of the radio-quiet sub-mm clumps and,
whilst we do not yet have sufficient data to conclude that they are in a pre-UC
HII region phase, we argue that their characteristics are suggestive of such a
stage.

Jpn. 75, 044603 (2006)","10.1143/JPSJ.75.044603",,"cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  This paper presents a conserving gapless mean-field theory for weakly
interacting Bose gases. We first construct a mean-field Luttinger-Ward
thermodynamic functional in terms of the condensate wave function $\Psi$ and
the Nambu Green's function $\hat{G}$ for the quasiparticle field. Imposing its
stationarity respect to $\Psi$ and $\hat{G}$ yields a set of equations to
determine the equilibrium for general non-uniform systems. They have a
plausible property of satisfying the Hugenholtz-Pines theorem to provide a
gapless excitation spectrum. Also, the corresponding dynamical equations of
motion obey various conservation laws. Thus, the present mean-field theory
shares two important properties with the exact theory: ``conserving'' and
``gapless.'' The theory is then applied to a homogeneous weakly interacting
Bose gas with s-wave scattering length $a$ and particle mass $m$ to clarify its
basic thermodynamic properties under two complementary conditions of constant
density $n$ and constant pressure $p$. The superfluid transition is predicted
to be first-order because of the non-analytic nature of the order-parameter
expansion near $T_{c}$ inherent in Bose systems, i.e., the Landau-Ginzburg
expansion is not possible here. The transition temperature $T_{c}$ shows quite
a different interaction dependence between the $n$-fixed and $p$-fixed cases.
In the former case $T_{c}$ increases from the ideal gas value $T_{0}$ as
$T_{c}/T_{0}= 1+ 2.33 an^{1/3}$, whereas it decreases in the latter as
$T_{c}/T_{0}= 1- 3.84a(mp/2\pi\hbar^{2})^{1/5}$. Temperature dependences of
basic thermodynamic quantities are clarified explicitly.

very general equations (that also apply to other systems, like Bose-Condensed
gases) describing light in a disordered non-linear medium and through some
approximations we relate them to a mean-field spin-glass-like model. The model
is solved by the replica method, and replica-symmetry breaking phase transition
is predicted. The transition describes a mode-locking process in which the
phases of the modes are locked to random (history and sample-dependent) values.
The results are based on very general theory, and embrace a variety of physical

minimal length in the automorphic orbit of a given element of a free group. The
classical algorithm of Whitehead that solves the problem depends exponentially
on the group rank. Moreover, it can be easily shown that exponential blowout
occurs when a word of minimal length has been reached and, therefore, is
inevitable except for some trivial cases.
  In this paper we introduce a deterministic Hybrid search algorithm and its
stochastic variation for solving the Whitehead minimization problem. Both
algorithms use search heuristics that allow one to find a length-reducing
automorphism in polynomial time on most inputs and significantly improve the
reduction procedure. The stochastic version of the algorithm employs a
probabilistic system that decides in polynomial time whether or not a word is
minimal. The stochastic algorithm is very robust. It has never happened that a
non-minimal element has been claimed to be minimal.

term is interpreted as a particular rank-reduced transform. Moreover, terms in
${\mathcal T}_p$ are represented as a combination of three operations
${\mathcal F}_k$, ${\mathcal Q}_k$ and ${\boldsymbol{\phi}}_k$ with
$k=1,...,p$. The prime idea is to determine ${\mathcal F}_k$ separately, for
each $k=1,...,p$, from an associated rank-constrained minimization problem
similar to that used in the Karhunen--Lo\`{e}ve transform. The operations
${\mathcal Q}_k$ and ${\boldsymbol{\phi}}_k$ are auxiliary for finding
${\mathcal F}_k$. The contribution of each term in ${\mathcal T}_p$ improves
the entire transform performance. A corresponding unconstrained nonlinear

Gal3p, Gal80p and Gal4p determines the transcriptional status of the genes
required for galactose utilization. After an increase in galactose
concentration, galactose molecules bind onto Gal3p. This event leads via Gal80p
to the activation of Gal4p, which then induces GAL3 and GAL80 gene
transcription. Here we propose a qualitative dynamic model, whereby these
molecular interaction events represent the first two stages of a functional
feedback loop that closes with the capture of activated Gal4p by newly
synthesized Gal3p and Gal80p, decreasing transcriptional activation and
creating again the protein complex that can bind incoming galactose molecules.
Based on the differential time scales of faster protein interactions versus
slower biosynthetic steps, this feedback loop functions as a derivative filter
where galactose is the input step signal, and released Gal4p is the output
derivative signal. One advantage of such a derivative filter is that GAL genes
are expressed in proportion to the cellular requirement. Furthermore, this
filter adaptively protects the cellular receptors from saturation by galactose,
allowing cells to remain sensitive to variations in galactose concentrations
rather than to absolute concentrations. Finally, this feedback loop, by
allowing phosphorylation of some active Gal4p, may be essential to initiate the
subsequent long-term response.

protocol for verifying non-membership in finite groups. Under plausible
group-theoretic assumptions, we give a QCMA protocol for the same problem. Even

  Journ.Phys.A",,"10.1088/0305-4470/39/31/019",,"quant-ph math-ph math.MP",,"  We obtain lower and upper bounds on the heat kernel and Green functions of
the Schroedinger operator in a random Gaussian magnetic field and a fixed
scalar potential. We apply stochastic Feynman-Kac representation, diamagnetic
upper bounds and the Jensen inequality for the lower bound. We show that if the
covariance of the electromagnetic (vector) potential is increasing at large
distances then the lower bound is decreasing exponentially fast for large
distances and a large time.
