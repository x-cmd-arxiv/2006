imprint in the galaxy power spectrum. We evolve this imprint to low redshift
and use the Fisher-matrix formalism to assess the effect on parameter
estimation. We show that a combination of low- (z=0.3) and high- (z=3) redshift
galaxy surveys can constrain the size of cosmological HII regions during
reionization. This imprint can also cause confusion when using baryon
oscillations or other features of the galaxy power spectrum to probe the dark
energy. We show that when bubbles are large, and hence detectable, our ability
to constrain w can be degraded by up to 50%. When bubbles are small, the
imprint has little or no effect on measuring dark-energy parameters.

of NGC 1291 is heated via a dynamical process. In this scenario, the gas from
the outer gas-rich ring loses energy through bar-driven shocks and falls to the
centre. Heating of the gas to X-ray temperatures comes from the high velocity
that it reaches ($\approx$ 700 \kms) as it falls to the bottom of the potential
well. This would explain why the stellar metallicity in the bulge region is
around solar while the hot gas metallicity is around 0.1 solar. We carried out
an observational test to check this hypothesis by measuring the metallicity of
HII regions in the outer ring to check whether they matched the hot gas
metallicity. For this purpose we obtained medium resolution long slit
spectroscopy with FORS1 on the ESO VLT at Paranal and obtained the
metallicities using emission line ratio diagnostics. The obtained metallicities
are compatible with the bulge stellar metallicities but very different from the
hot-gas metallicity. However, when comparing the different time-scales, the gas
in the ring had time enough to get enriched through stellar processes,
therefore we cannot rule out the dynamical mechanism as the heating process of
the gas. However, the blue colours of the outer ring and the dust structures in
the bar region could suggest that the origin of the X-ray hot gas is due to the
infall of material from further out.

based on the UV continuum slope, we find excellent agreement between the
indicators, with <SFR_Ha> = 31 Msun/yr and <SFR_UV> = 29 Msun/yr. The agreement
between the indicators suggests that the UV luminosity is attenuated by an
typical factor of ~4.5 (with a range from no attenuation to a factor of ~100
for the most obscured object in the sample), in good agreement with estimates
of obscuration from X-ray, radio and mid-IR data. The H-alpha luminosity is
attenuated by a factor of ~1.7 on average, and the maximum H-alpha attenuation
is a factor of ~5. In agreement with X-ray and mid-IR studies, we find that the
SFR increases with increasing stellar mass and at brighter K magnitudes, to
<SFR_Ha> ~ 60 Msun/yr for galaxies with K<20; the correlation between K
magnitude and SFR is much stronger than the correlation between stellar mass
and SFR. All galaxies in the sample have SFRs per unit area Sigma_SFR in the
range observed in local starbursts. We compare the instantaneous SFRs and the
past average SFRs as inferred from the ages and stellar masses, finding that
for most of the sample, the current SFR is an adequate representation of the
past average. There is some evidence that the most massive galaxies (M_star
>10^11 Msun) have had higher SFRs in the past.

of ordinary Type Ibc SNe by many orders of magnitude. The essential physical
process that causes a dying star to produce a GRB or XRF, and not just an SN,
remains the crucial open question. Here we present radio and X-ray observations
of XRF 060218 (associated with SN 2006aj), the second nearest GRB identified
to-date, which allow us to measure its total energy and place it in the larger
context of cosmic explosions. We show that this event is 100 times less
energetic but ten times more common than cosmological GRBs. Moreover, it is
distinguished from ordinary Type Ibc SNe by the presence of 10^48 erg coupled
to mildly-relativistic ejecta, along with a central engine (an accretion-fed,
rapidly rotating compact source) which produces X-rays for weeks after the
explosion. This suggests that the production of relativistic ejecta is the key
physical distinction between GRBs/XRFs and ordinary SNe, while the nature of
the central engine (black hole or magnetar) may distinguish typical bursts from
low-luminosity, spherical events like XRF 060218.

depends critically on the shape of the stellar IMF at the low-mass end. These
faint stars contribute significantly to the mass, but insignificantly to the
luminosity and color of a stellar system. In Bell & de Jong (2001) we used
rotation curves to normalize the relation, but rotation curves provide only an
upper limit to the stellar masses in a system. Here we compare stellar and
dynamical masses for a range of stellar systems in order to constrain the mass
normalization of stellar population models. We find that the normalization of
Bell & de Jong (2001) should be lowered by about 0.05-0.1 dex in M/L. This is
consistent with a Kroupa (2001), Chabrier (2003) or a Kennicutt (1983) IMF, but

galaxies in the SPH simulation become satellites in larger groups, they retain
local dark matter concentrations (SPH subhalos) whose mass is typically five
times their baryonic mass. The more massive subhalos of the SPH simulation have
corresponding subhalos of similar mass and position in the DM simulation; at
lower masses, there is fairly good correspondence, but some DM subhalos are in
different spatial positions and some suffer tidal stripping or disruption. The
halo occupation statistics of DM subhalos -- the mean number of subhalos,
pairs, and triples as a function of host halo mass -- are very similar to those
of SPH subhalos and SPH galaxies. Gravity of the dissipative baryon component
amplifies the density contrast of subhalos in the SPH simulation, making them
more resistant to tidal disruption. Relative to SPH galaxies and SPH subhalos,
the DM subhalo population is depleted in the densest regions of the most
massive halos. The good agreement of halo occupation statistics between the DM
subhalo and SPH galaxy populations leads to good agreement of their two-point
correlation functions and higher order moments on large scales. The depletion
of DM subhalos in dense regions depresses their clustering at R<1 Mpc/h. In
these simulations, the ""conversation"" between dark matter and baryons is mostly
one-way, with dark matter dynamics telling galaxies where to form and how to
cluster, but the ""back talk"" of the baryons influences small scale clustering

directly from the rotational velocity curve without extra assumptions. We
simplify the standard application of the model. Since most velocity curves are

tail. The numerical procedure and the extrapolation are tested with a known toy
mass density and shown to reconstruct it with a good precision if r_{max}
includes a sufficient part of the velocity curve. Mass density curves are
calculated for Milky Way and NGC 3198. We vary the extent of the flat part of

Contamination by neighbouring emission lines seems a likely culprit. Our data
reveal a number of new features: Doppler tomograms show emission at low

feature is seen in the Balmer lines near the line centres at the time of

The He II 4686.75 A line emission is dominated by the gas stream/disc impact
region. Two distinct spots are seen in Doppler maps, the first being very
narrow and showing a velocity close to that of the accretion disc in the impact
region, and the second much broader and located between the velocities of the

weak spiral structure. We find no evidence of stream-disc overflow in the

evidence of a puzzle in the mass of U Gem's white dwarf. The mass donor is
clearly seen in the Doppler maps, with emission concentrated towards its poles,
and mainly on the side facing the white dwarf. This suggests irradiation with
shielding by the disc from which we estimate an H/R ratio between 0.15 and

Independent age determinations are possible by using infrared spectra (5-21
microns), which we have obtained with the Infrared Spectrograph on the Spitzer
Observatory. This age indicator is based on the collective mass loss rate of
stars, where mass loss from AGB stars produces a silicate emission feature at
9-12 microns. This feature decreases more rapidly than the shorter wavelength
continuum as a stellar population ages, providing an age indicator. From
observations of 30 nearby early-type galaxies, 29 show a spectral energy
distribution dominated by stars and one has significant emission from the ISM
and is excluded. The infrared age indicators for the 29 galaxies show them all
to be old, with a mean age of about 10 Gyr and a standard deviation of only a
few Gyr. This is consistent with the ages inferred from the values of M/L_B,
but is inconsistent with the ages derived from the optical line indices, which
can be much younger. All of these age indicators are luminosity-weighted and
should be correlated, even if multiple-age components are considered. The
inconsistency indicates that there is a significant problem with either the
infrared and the M/L_B ages, which agree, or with the ages inferred from the

The northeast-southwest bipolar outflow driven by IRAS 4A was studied by
combining the H2 images with SiO maps published previously. The SiO-H2 outflows
are continuous on the southwestern side but show a gap on the northeastern
side. The southwestern outflow lobe curves smoothly, and the position angle
increases with the distance from the driving source. The base and the outer tip
of the northeastern outflow lobe are located at positions opposite to the
corresponding parts of the southwestern lobe. This point-symmetry suggests that
the outflow axis may be drifting or precessing clockwise in the plane of the
sky and that the cause of the axis drift may be intrinsic to the outflow
engine. The axis drift model is supported by the asymmetric lateral intensity
profile of the SiO outflow. The axis drift rate is about 0.011 deg yr-1. The
middle part of the northeastern outflow does not exactly follow the point
symmetry because of the superposition of two different kinds of directional
variability: the axis drift of the driving source and the deflection by a dense
core. The axis drift model provides a good explanation for the large deflection
angle of the northeastern outflow. Other H2 emission features around the IRAS 4
region are discussed briefly. Some of them are newly found outflows, and some
are associated with outflows already known before.

of magnetism for this compound includes a degenerate ground state, using
thermodynamic probes to determine the excitation energy between the ground and
excited states is challenging. An estimate of the excitation energy between the
ground and excited states based on magnetic susceptibility measurements is
roughly ~28 meV. INS measurements of this compound are likewise challenging
since inter- and intramolecular vibrational modes associated with the organic
ligands are at frequencies similar to the magnetic excitations. However, by
measuring a non-magnetic analog, i.e. ligands only, as well as the temperature
dependence of the excitations in the magnetic system, we are able to determine
the excitation energy as being approximately 36.5 meV at T = 10 K, with a
gradual softening to 32 meV with increasing temperature. We emphasize the
consideration of ligand/lattice based excitations while interpreting magnetic
excitations of such nanomagnetic systems containing organic molecules while
underscoring the importance of INS in determining the magnetic excitation

into the AMGA Metadata Catalog, which is part of the gLite software stack being
developed for the EGEE project. Implementing these mechanisms in the catalog
itself has the advantages of not requiring any special support from the

  Radcliffe Publishing, Oxford. 2007.",,,"cs.CC cond-mat.other",,"  The science of complexity is based on a new way of thinking that stands in
sharp contrast to the philosophy underlying Newtonian science, which is based
on reductionism, determinism, and objective knowledge. This paper reviews the
historical development of this new world view, focusing on its philosophical
foundations. Determinism was challenged by quantum mechanics and chaos theory.
Systems theory replaced reductionism by a scientifically based holism.
Cybernetics and postmodern social science showed that knowledge is
intrinsically subjective. These developments are being integrated under the
header of ""complexity science"". Its central paradigm is the multi-agent system.
Agents are intrinsically subjective and uncertain about their environment and
future, but out of their local interactions, a global organization emerges.
Although different philosophers, and in particular the postmodernists, have
voiced similar ideas, the paradigm of complexity still needs to be fully
assimilated by philosophy. This will throw a new light on old philosophical
issues such as relativism, ethics and the role of the subject.

an optical gain with two peaks: an RSE optical resonance at around 4 kHz and a
radiation pressure induced optical spring at around 41 Hz. We have developed a
reliable procedure for acquiring lock and establishing the desired optical

in both the theory and practical implementation of the more complex optical

different values for the constants k and $\gamma$ many known solutions are
rediscovered. Further the current acceleration of the universe has led us to
investigate higher dimensional gravity theory, which is able to explain
acceleration from a theoretical view point without the need of introducing dark
energy by hand. We argue that the terms containing higher dimensional metric
coefficients produce an extra negative pressure that apparently drives an
acceleration of the 3D space, tempting us to suggest that the accelerating
universe seems to act as a window to the existence of extra spatial dimensions.
Interestingly the 5D matter field remains regular while the \emph{effective}
negative pressure is responsible for the inflation. Relaxing the assumptions of
two equations of state we also present a class of solutions which provide early
deceleration followed by a late acceleration in a unified manner. Interesting
to point out that in this case our cosmology apparently mimics the well known
quintessence scenario fuelled by a generalised Chaplygin-type of fluid where a
smooth transition from a dust dominated model to a de Sitter like one takes
place.

evidences to show that saddle-point calculation for high-energy closed string

an SL(2,R) subgroup of the conformal group, we can assign a conformal dimension

strict omega-categories to provide an armoury of well behaved technical
devices, such as joins and Gray tensor products, which will be used to study
these the weak omega-category theory of these structures in a series of

constructing a Quillen model structure on the category of stratified simplicial
sets whose fibrant objects are the weak complicial sets. As a simple corollary
of this work we provide an independent construction of Joyal's model structure
on simplicial sets for which the fibrant objects are the quasi-categories.

standard Skyrme effective force (SSEF) using exactly the same set of the data
as employed to determine the parameters of the GSEF. We find that the GSEF
yields larger values for the neutron skin thickness which are closer to the
recent predictions based on the isospin diffusion data. The Skyrme parameters
so obtained are employed to compute the strength function for the isoscalar
giant monopole, dipole and quadrupole resonances. It is found that in the case
of GSEF, due to the the larger value of the nucleon effective mass the values
of centroid energies for the isoscalar giant resonances are in better agreement

the (microscopic) level of description of the available model, and the
(macroscopic) level at which one would like to observe and analyze the system.
For this type of problems, an ``equation-free'' framework has recently been
proposed. Using appropriately initialized microscopic simulations, one can
build a coarse-grained time-stepper to approximate a time-stepper for the
unavailable macroscopic model. Here, we show how one can use this
coarse-grained time-stepper to compute coarse-grained traveling wave solutions
of a lattice Boltzmann model. In a moving frame, emulated by performing a
shift-back operation after the coarse-grained time-step, the traveling wave
appears as a steady state, which is computed using an iterative method, such as
Newton--GMRES. To accelerate convergence of the GMRES procedure, a macroscopic
model-based preconditioner is used, which is derived from the lattice Boltzmann
model using a Chapman--Enskog expansion. We illustrate the approach on a

more basic than others in the literature. Here a frame is based on a set of
real and of complex numbers and a space time as a 4-tuple of the real numbers.
There are many isomorphic frames as there are many isomorphic sets of real
numbers. Each frame is suitable for construction of all physical theories as
mathematical structures over the real and complex numbers. The organization of
the frames into a field of frames is based on the representations of real and
complex numbers as Cauchy operators defined on complex rational states of
finite qubit strings. The structure of the field is based on noting that the
construction of real and complex numbers as Cauchy operators in a frame can be
iterated to create new frames coming from a frame. Gauge transformations on the
rational string states greatly expand the number of quantum frames as, for each
gauge U, there is one frame coming from the original frame. Forward and
backward iteration of the construction yields a two way infinite frame field
with satisfying properties. There is no background space time and there are no
real or complex numbers for the field as a whole. Instead these are relative
concepts associated with each frame in the field. Extension to include qukit
strings for different k bases, is described as is the problem of reconciling
the frame field to the existence of just one frame with one background space
time for the observable physical universe.

which is described by a new pseudopotential with averaged relativistic effects,

are performed for both the ionic species Fr$\_2^+$, RbFr$^+$, CsFr$^+$ and the
corresponding neutral, through the CIPSI quantum chemistry package where we
used new extended gaussian basis sets for Rb, Cs, and Fr atoms. As no

electron transfer yielding a Cs$^+$Fr$^-$ arrangement, while in all other mixed
alkali pairs the electron is transferred towards the lighter species. Finally
the perturbative treatment of the spin-orbit coupling at large distances
predicts that in contrast with Rb$\_2$ and Cs$\_2$, no double-well excited
