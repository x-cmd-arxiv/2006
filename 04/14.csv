gravitational-wave signal detectable by the satellite LISA. The rate of
supermassive-black-hole mergers is intimately connected to the halo merger
rate, and the extended Press-Schechter formalism is often employed when
calculating the rate at which these events will be observed by LISA. This
merger theory is flawed and provides two rates for the merging of the same pair
of haloes. We show that the two predictions for the LISA
supermassive-black-hole-merger event rate from extended Press-Schechter merger
theory are nearly equal because mergers between haloes of similar masses
dominate the event rate. An alternative merger rate may be obtained by
inverting the Smoluchowski coagulation equation to find the merger rate that
preserves the Press-Schechter halo abundance, but these rates are only
available for power-law power spectra. We compare the LISA event rates derived
from the extended Press-Schechter merger formalism to those derived from the
merger rates obtained from the coagulation equation and find that the extended
Press-Schechter LISA event rates are thirty percent higher for a power spectrum
spectral index that approximates the full Lambda-CDM result of the extended
Press-Schechter theory.

4636. This giant elliptical galaxy is claimed to be extremely dark matter
dominated, according to X-ray observations. Using the VLT with FORS2/MXU, we
obtained velocities for 174 globular clusters. The clusters have projected
galactocentric distances in the range 4 to 70 kpc, the overwhelming majority
lie within 30 kpc. We find some indication for a rotation of the red
(metal-rich) clusters about the minor axis. Out to a radius of 30 kpc, we find
a roughly constant projected velocity dispersion for the blue clusters of ~200
km/s. The red clusters exhibit a distinctly different behavior: at a radius of
about 13 kpc, the velocity dispersion drops by ~50 km/s to about 170 km/s which
then remains constant out to a radius of 30 kpc.
  Using only the blue clusters as dynamical tracers, we perform Jeans-analyses
for different assumptions of the orbital anisotropy. Depending on the
anisotropy and the adopted M/L-values, we find that the dark matter fraction
within one effective radius can vary between 20% and 50% with most a probable
range between 20% and 30%. A main source of uncertainty is the ambiguity of the
velocity dispersion in the outermost bin.
  Although the dark halo mass still cannot be strongly constrained, NGC 4636
does not seem to be extremely dark matter dominated. The derived circular
velocities are also consistent with Modified Newtonian Dynamics.

universe and our galaxy, because they are produced generically during inflation
in cosmologically interesting amounts. The most attractive model for the origin
of superheavy dark matter (SHDM) is gravitational production at the end of
inflation. The observed cosmological density of dark matter determines the mass
of the SHDM particle as $m_X=$(a few)$\:\times 10^{13}$ GeV, promoting it to a
natural candidate for the source of the observed ultra-high energy cosmic rays
(UHECR). After a review of the theoretical aspects of SHDM, we up-date its
predictions for UHECR observations: no GZK cutoff, flat energy spectrum with
$dN/dE\approx 1/E^{1.9}$, photon dominance and galactic anisotropy. We analyze
the existing data and conclude that SDHM as explanation for the observed UHECRs
is at present disfavored but not yet excluded. We calculate the anisotropy
relevant for future Auger observations that should be the conclusive test for
this model. Finally, we emphasize that negative results of searches for SHDM in
UHECR do not disfavor SHDM as a dark matter candidate. Therefore, UHECRs
produced by SHDM decays and with the signatures as described should be searched
for in the future as subdominant effect.

profile of the AU Mic disk by performing the inversion of the near-IR and
visible scattered light brightness profiles measured by Liu (2004a) and Krist
et al. (2005), respectively. We discuss the grain properties by analysing the
blue color of the disk in the visible (Krist et al. 2005) and by fitting the
disk spectral energy distribution. We show that irrespective of the mean
scattering asymmetry factor of the grains, most of the emission arises from an
asymmetric, collisionally-dominated region that peaks close to the surface
brightness break around 35 AU. The elementary scatterers at visible wavelengths
are found to be sub-micronic, but the inferred size distribution underestimates
the amount of large grains, resulting in too low sub-millimeter emissions
compared to the observations. From our inversion procedure, we find that the V-
to H-band scattering cross sections ratio increases outside 40 AU, in line with
the observed color gradient of the disk. We show that a standard, solar-like
stellar wind generates a pressure force onto the dust particles that behaves
much like a radiation pressure force. With an assumed Mdot ~ 300 Mdot_sun, the
wind pressure overcomes the radiation pressure and this effect is enhanced by
the stellar flares. This explains the similarity between the Beta Pic and AU
Mic brightness profiles. In both cases, the color gradient beyond 120 AU for
Beta Pic and 35 AU for AU Mic, is believed to be a direct consequence of the

comparison of the gas column density through the torus to the maximum possible
optical depth to the stars implies the torus is a clumpy medium. The coronal
lines show asymmetric profiles with a spatially compact narrow component and a

Hydrogen/first Helium ionization instability strip is more sensitive to $g$
than $Y$. We find that (for solar composition envelopes), relative to a
fiducial WD mass $0.6 M_\odot$, the blue edge for a $0.4 M_\odot$ He core WD
shifts downward by $\approx 1000 {\rm K}$, while that for a massive $\approx
1.2 M_\odot$ WD shifts upward by $\approx 2000 {\rm K}$. The second Helium
ionization instability strip exhibits strong dependences on both $g$ and $Y$.
Surprisingly, increasing $Y$ by only 10% relative to solar creates an
instability strip near $15,000 {\rm K}$. Hence CV's below the period gap with
evolved donor stars of $Y\ga 0.4$ may have an ""intermediate"" instability strip
well outside of the isolated DA and DB variables. This ""intermediate""
instability strip also occurs for low mass He WD with solar composition
envelopes. The lack of pulsations in CV's with $T_{\rm eff}$ in the pure
Hydrogen ZZ Ceti instability strip is also easily explained.

breaks, is similar to those commonly observed in Swift observations of long

the first clear case of strong energy injection in the external shock of a

a power-law decay index of ~2. We interpret this as a jet break, with important
implications for models of short GRBs, since it requires collimation of the

total jet kinetic energy of E_jet ~(1-5) x 10^{49} erg. Combined with the lack
of a jet break in GRB 050724, this suggests a wide range in jet collimation in
short GRBs, with at least some having collimation similar to that found in long

Thick-target radioisotope yields are provided in tabular form, which can be
used to predict fluxes of all of the major delayed lines at any time after a
gamma-ray flare. The brightest delayed line for days after the flare is found
to be the 511 keV positron-electron annihilation line resulting from the decay
of several beta+ radioisotopes. After ~2 days however, the flux of the 511 keV

Einstein's general relativity all these observations can be explained by the

Because the nature of this dark energy is unknown, it was proposed some
alternative scenario to explain the current accelerating Universe. The key
point of this scenario is to modify the standard FRW equation instead of
mysterious dark energy component. The standard approach to constrain model
parameters, based on the likelihood method, gives a best-fit model and
confidence ranges for those parameters. We always arbitrary choose the set of
parameters which define a model which we compare with observational data.
Because in the generic case, the introducing of new parameters improves a fit
to the data set, there appears the problem of elimination of model parameters
which can play an insufficient role. The Bayesian information criteria of model
selection (the AIC and BIC) are dedicated to promotion a set of parameters
which should be incorporated to the model. We divide class of all accelerating
cosmological models into two groups according to the two types of explanation
acceleration of the Universe. Then the Bayesian framework of model selection is
used to determine the set of parameters which gives preferred fit to the SNIa
data. We find a few of flat cosmological models which can be recommend by both
the Bayes factor and Akaike information criterion.

range images show fan-shaped outflow structure in which we detect 18 stars and
several blobs of diffuse emission. We interpret the misalignment of various
outflow axes in the context of a disk precession model, including numerical
hydrodynamic simulations of the molecular emission. The precession period is
approx. 280 years and its half-opening angle is 40 degrees. A possible
triggering mechanism is non-coplanar tidal interaction of an (undiscovered)
close companion with the circumbinary protostellar disk. Our observations
resolve the nearby massive protostar NGC 7538 IRS2 as a close binary with
separation of 195 mas. We find indications for shock interaction between the
outflow activities in IRS1 and IRS2. Indications of outflow precession have
been discovered to date in a number of massive protostars, all with large
precession angles 20--45 degrees. This might explain the difference between the
outflow widths in low- and high-mass stars and add support to a common
collimation mechanism.

system (including the defect), we discriminate between the cases where the
defect is irrelevant and those where it acts as a bottleneck and induces
various novel phases (called {\it bottleneck phases}). Contrary to the simple
TASEP in the presence of inhomogeneities, many scenarios emerge and translate
into rich underlying phase-diagrams, the topological properties of which are
discussed.

self-energy, and time-dependent exact-exchange within time-dependent

give rise to identical excitonic effects in solids; these effects are
drastically overestimated for semiconductors. They are partially compensated by
the usual overestimation of the quasiparticle band gap within Hartree-Fock. The
physics that lacks in these approaches can be formulated as screening. We show
that the introduction of screening in TD-EXX indeed leads to a formulation that
is equivalent to previously proposed functionals derived from Many-Body

pendular state (i.e. the state where the liquid phase is discontinuous) as a
function of water content. Sand and glass beads were wetted and tested in a
direct shear cell and under various confining pressures. In parallel, we
carried out three-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations by using an
explicit equation expressing capillary force as a function of interparticle
distance, water bridge volume and surface tension. We show that, due to the
peculiar features of capillary interactions, the major influence of water
content over the shear strength stems from the distribution of liquid bonds.
This property results in shear strength saturation as a function of water
content. We arrive at the same conclusion by a microscopic analysis of the
shear strength. We propose a model that accounts for the capillary force, the
granular texture and particle size polydispersity. We find fairly good
agreement of the theoretical estimate of the shear strength with both
experimental data and simulations. From numerical data, we analyze the
connectivity and anisotropy of different classes of liquid bonds according to
the sign and level of the normal force as well as the bond direction. We find
that weak compressive bonds are almost isotropically distributed whereas strong
compressive and tensile bonds have a pronounced anisotropy. The probability
distribution function of normal forces is exponentially decreasing for strong
compressive bonds, a decreasing power-law function over nearly one decade for
weak compressive bonds and an increasing linear function in the range of
tensile bonds. These features suggest that different bond classes do not play
the same role with respect to the shear strength.

Gd-pnictides is reported. The calculations were performed using a
full-potential linear muffin-tin orbital (LMTO) method within the so-called
LSDA+U approach, which adds Hubbard-U correlation effects to specified narrow
bands in a mean-field approach to the local spin density approximation (LSDA).
Here both the Gd 4f and 5d states are subject to such corrections. The U(f)
values were determined semi-empirically by using photo-emission and inverse
photoemission data for GdP, GdAs, GdSb and GdBi. In contrast to U(f) which
represents narrow band physics, U(d) represents a quasiparticle self-energy
correction of the LSDA gap underestimate. The U(d) value was adjusted using
optical absorption data for semiconducting GdN above its Curie temperature.
Below the Curie temperature, however, in the ferromagnetic state, the gap
becomes almost zero. The other Gd pnictides are found to have a small overlap
of the conduction band at the X point and the valence band at the Gamma point
in the majority-spin channel. A small gap opens in the spin-minority channel of
GdP and GdAs, which are thus half-metallic. This spin-minority gap closes in
semimetallic GdSb and GdBi. While GdN is found to be ferromagnetic, the other
Gd-pnictides are found to be antiferromagnetic, with ordering along [111]. From
calculations with different magnetic configurations, a Heisenberg model with
first and second nearest neighbor exchange parameters is extracted. The
Heisenberg model is then used to predict Curie-Weiss and N'eel temperatures and
critical magnetic fields within mean field and compared with experimental data.
The trends are found to be in good agreement with the experimental data.

scalar couplings are not proportional to the Yukawa couplings when the F-term
of the U-moduli contribution is non-zero. Consequently, the lepton flavor
violating decay processes are generated. Only other sources of flavor
violations in this model are the Dirac neutrino Yukawa coupling and the
Majorana couplings. The observed fermion mixings are realized from the ``almost

scalar field $X$ are examined, assuming that the damped coherent oscillation of
the scalar once dominates the energy of the universe. The coupling of the
scalar field to a gravitino pair is estimated both in spontaneous and explicit
supersymmetry breaking scenarios, with the result that it is proportional to
the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field in general. Cosmological
constraints depend on whether the gravitino is stable or not, and we study each
case separately. For the unstable gravitino with $M_{3/2} \sim$ 100GeV--10TeV,
we obtain not only the upper bound, but also the lower bound on the reheating
temperature after the $X$ decay, in order to retain the success of the big-bang
nucleosynthesis. It is also shown that it severely constrains the decay rate
into the gravitino pair. For the stable gravitino, similar but less stringent
bounds are obtained to escape the overclosure by the gravitinos produced at the
$X$ decay. The requirement that the free-streaming effect of such gravitinos
should not suppress the cosmic structures at small scales eliminates some
regions in the parameter space, but still leaves a new window of the gravitino
warm dark matter. Implications of these results to inflation models are
discussed. In particular, it is shown that modular inflation will face serious
cosmological difficulty when the gravitino is unstable, whereas it can escape
the constraints for the stable gravitino. A similar argument offers a solution
to the cosmological moduli problem, in which the moduli is relatively heavy
while the gravitino is light.

this phenomenon completely. Therefore, we consider time-dependent overcritical

scale cannot be described by means of the weak-field approximation, as in the
standard procedure for ordinary GUT cosmic strings. As suggested by string
theories, at this extreme energies, gravity may be transmitted by some kind of
scalar field (usually called the {\it dilaton}) in addition to the tensor field
of Einstein's theory of gravity. It is then permissible to tackle the issue
regarding the dynamics of supermassive cosmic strings within this framework.
With this aim we obtain the gravitational field of a supermassive screwed
cosmic string in a scalar-tensor theory of gravity. We show that for the
supermassive configuration exact solutions of scalar-tensor screwed cosmic
strings can be found in connection with the Bogomol'nyi limit. We show that the
generalization of Bogomol'nyi arguments to the Brans-Dicke theory is possible
when torsion is present and we obtain an exact solution in this supermassive
regime, with the dilaton solution obtained by consistency with internal
constraints.

evaluation of the multi-dimensional phase space integral. This, in particular,
allows to avoid the commonly employed soft photon approximation (SPA), as well
as to incorporate final-state thermal enhancement factors. % during the
hadronic stage of the fireball. Both improvements are shown to result in an
appreciable increase of the photon production rate over previous hadronic
calculations. Upon convolution over a thermal fireball we find an improvement

influence of both Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal and in-medium effects on ""$\sigma$""

the transition from hadrons to quarks and gluons has behavior similar to

magnitude of relativistic effects increases with the incoming neutron energy

decrease the nonrelativistic breakup cross section. In some regions of the
breakup phase-space dynamical boost effects are important. For a number of

cryopreservation of proteins and other biological samples. We report systematic
measurements of critical cryoprotective agent (CPA) concentrations required for
vitrification during plunge cooling from T=295 K to T=77 K in liquid nitrogen.
Measurements on fourteen common CPAs including alcohols (glycerol, methanol,
isopropanol), sugars (sucrose, xylitol, dextrose, trehalose), PEGs (ethylene
glycol, PEG 200, PEG 2 000, PEG 20 000), glycols (DMSO, MPD), and salt (NaCl)
were performed for volumes ranging over four orders of magnitude from ~nL to 20
mkL, and covering the range of interest in protein crystallography. X-ray
diffraction measurements on aqueous glycerol mixtures confirm that the
polycrystalline-to-vitreous transition occurs within a span of less than 2% w/v
in CPA concentration, and that the form of polycrystalline ice (hexagonal or
cubic) depends on CPA concentration and cooling rate. For most of the studied
cryoprotectants, the critical concentration decreases strongly with volume in
the range from ~5 mkL to ~0.1 mkL, typically by a factor of two. By combining
measurements of the critical concentration versus volume with cooling time
versus volume, we obtain the function of greatest intrinsic physical interest:
the critical CPA concentration versus cooling rate during flash cooling. These
results provide a basis for more rational design of cryoprotective protocols,
and should yield insight into the physics of glass formation in aqueous
mixtures.

To compute Holevo capacity, Voronoi diagrams in the Bloch ball with respect to
the quantum divergence have been used as a powerful tool. These diagrams
basically treat mixed quantum states corresponding to points in the interior of
the Bloch ball. Due to the existence of logarithm in the quantum divergence,
the diagrams are not defined on pure quantum states corresponding to points on
the two-dimensional sphere. This paper first defines the Voronoi diagrams for
pure quantum states on the Bloch sphere by the Fubini-Study distance and the
Bures distance. We also introduce other Voronoi diagrams on the sphere obtained
by taking a limit of Voronoi diagrams for mixed quantum states by the quantum
divergences in the Bloch ball. These diagrams are shown to be equivalent to the
ordinary Voronoi diagram on the sphere.
