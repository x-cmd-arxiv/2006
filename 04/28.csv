present-day cosmic structure arose during the first instants of creation, where
weak ripples were imposed on the otherwise uniform and rapidly expanding
primordial soup. Over 14 billion years of evolution, these ripples have been
amplified to enormous proportions by gravitational forces, producing
ever-growing concentrations of dark matter in which ordinary gases cool,
condense and fragment to make galaxies. This process can be faithfully mimicked
in large computer simulations, and tested by a variety of observations that
probe the history of the Universe starting from just 400,000 yr after the Big

supernovae, and if all new supernovae are detectable at this sensitivity, a
resulting estimate of the supernova rate in the Arp 220 system is 4 +/- 2 per
year. The implied star formation rate is sufficient to power the entire
observed far-infrared luminosity of the galaxy. The two nuclei of Arp 220
exhibit striking similarities in their radio properties, though the western
nucleus is more compact, and appears to be ~3 times more luminous than the
eastern nucleus. There are also some puzzling differences, and differential
free-free absorption, synchrotron aging and expansion losses may all be playing

described by a power-law distribution is assumed, the mass of the most massive
star cluster in a galaxy (M_max) is the result of the size-of-sample (SoS)
effect. This implies a dependence of M_max on the total number of star clusters
(N). The SoS effect also implies that M_max within a cluster population
increases with equal logarithmic intervals of age. This is because the number
of clusters formed in logarithmic age intervals increases (assuming a constant
cluster formation rate). This effect has been observed in the SMC and LMC.
Based on the maximum pressure (P_int) inside molecular clouds, it has been
suggested that a physical maximum mass (M_max[phys]) should exist. The theory
predicts that M_max[phys] should be observable, i.e. lower than M_max that
follows from statistical arguments, in big galaxies with a high star formation
rate. We compare the SoS relations in the SMC and LMC with the ones in M51 and
model the integrated cluster luminosity function (CLF) for two cases: 1) M_max
is determined by the SoS effect and 2) M_max=M_max[phys]=constant. The observed
CLF of M51 and the comparison of the SoS relations with the SMC and LMC both
suggest that there exists a M_max[phys] of 5*10^5 M_sun in M51. The CLF of M51
looks very similar to the one observed in the ``Antennae'' galaxies. A direct
comparison with our model suggests that there M_max[phys]=2*10^6 M_sun.

insensitive to redshift, consistent with predictions. By combining the existing
X-ray, near-infrared and radio measurements, we derive estimates for the

indicate that GRB 050904 was an unusally energetic burst (10**52 erg). More

structure is particularly striking in the eastern arm where we suggest the
filaments are outer edges of a series of plasma-filled, buoyant bubbles whose
ages differ by ~6 x 10^6 years. These X-ray structures may be influenced by
magnetic filamentation. At hard energies (3.5-7.5 keV), we detect a nearly
circular ring of outer radius 2.8' (13 kpc) which provides an unambiguous
signature of a weak shock, driven by an outburst from the SMBH. The density
rise in the shock is ~1.3 (Mach number, M~1.2). The observed spectral hardening
in the ring corresponds to a temperature rise T_shock / T_0 ~ 1.2, or M~1.2, in
agreement with the Mach number derived independently from the gas density.
Thus, for the first time, we detect gas temperature and density jumps
associated with a classical shock in the atmosphere around a supermassive black
hole. We also detect two additional surface brightness edges and pressure
enhancements at radii of ~0.6' and ~1'. The ~0.6' feature may be
over-pressurized thermal gas surrounding the relativistic plasma in the radio
cocoon, the ``piston'', produced by the current episode of AGN activity. The
over-pressurized gas is surrounded by a cool gas shell. The ~1' feature may be
an additional weak shock from a secondary outburst. In an earlier episode, the

even though halos and disks may assemble simultaneously. We further demonstrate
the validity of the simple approximation for $\Lambda$CDM halos with isotropic
velocity distributions using three-dimensional N-body simulations. This result
is easily understood: an isotropic velocity distribution in a cuspy halo
requires more circular orbits than radial orbits. Conversely, the approximation
is poor in the extreme case of a radial orbit halo. It overestimates the
response a core dark matter halo, where radial orbit fraction is larger.
Because no astronomically relevant models are dominated by low-angular momentum
orbits in the vicinity of the disk and the growth time scale is never shorter

of the DIG. Using two independent methods, a vertical gradient in azimuthal
velocity is found to be present in the northeast quadrant of the halo, with
magnitude approximately 15-18 km/s/kpc, in agreement with results from HI
observations. The kinematics of the DIG suggest that this gradient begins at
approximately 1 kpc above the midplane. In another part of the halo, the
southeast quadrant, the kinematics are markedly different, and suggest rotation
at about 175 km/s, much slower than the disk but with no vertical gradient. We
utilize an entirely ballistic model of disk-halo flow in an attempt to

is best fitted by a thermal plasma plus power-law model but with high intrinsic

current star formation, whilst the hard power-law component may originate in
unresolved X-ray binary sources. The intrinsic luminosity of this residual disc
emission may exceed Lx ~ 6e38 ergs/s (0.3-6 keV). A comparison with other

full range of SMGs. However, observed temperature evolution of T_d ~ (1+z) is
also plausible and could result from selection effects. From the observed
luminosity-temperature (L-T) relation, L ~ T_obs^(2.82+-0.29), we derive
scaling relations for dust mass versus dust temperature, and we identify
expressions to inter-relate the observed quantities. These suggest that
measurements at a single wavelength, in the far-infrared, submillimeter or
radio wave bands, might constrain dust temperatures and far-infrared
luminosities for most SMGs with redshifts at z ~ 0.5--4.

the disk, and (c) magnetic field perpendicular to the disk. Outflows with
velocities, at least, 10 km/s are driven by the protoplanets in both magnetized
disk models, while outflow does not appear in unmagnetized disk model.
Tube-like outflows along the azimuthal direction of the protoplanetary disk
appear in model with magnetic field being parallel to the disk. In this model,
the magnetically dominated regions (i.e., density gap) are clearly contrasted
from other regions and spiral waves appear near the protoplanet. On the other
hand, in model with magnetic field being perpendicular to the disk, outflows
are driven by a protoplanet with cone-like structure just as seen in the
outflow driven by a protostar. Magnetic field lines are strongly twisted near
the protoplanet and the outflows have well-collimated structures in this
model.These outflows can be landmarks for searching exo-protoplanets in their
formation stages. Our results indicate that the accretion rate onto the
protoplanet tend to have a larger value than that expected from previous
hydrodynamical calculations, since a fraction of the angular momentum of
circum-planetary disk is removed by outflows, enhanced non-axisymmetric
patterns caused by magnetic field, and magnetic braking. Possible implications
for observation are also briefly discussed.

such a smaller separation, high-quality phase-referencing can be achieved.
Furthermore, a subsequent more-sophisticated calibration can relocate array's
focus to a hypothetical point much closer to the target; a higher quality of
phase referencing is available. Our demonstrative observations with strong
radio sources have proved the capabilities of BPR in terms of image dynamic
ranges and astrometric reproducibility. The image dynamic range on a target has
been improved with a factor of about six compared to that of normal
phase-referencing; the resultant position difference of target's emission

a He-rich donor in an UCXB. Interestingly, the C/O spectrum of 4U 1626-67 shows
both similarities as well as marked differences from the optical C/O spectrum

the peak of its 2003 X-ray outburst and do not confirm the detection of Halpha
emission as was claimed in the literature. The peak spectra do show strong C or
N emission around 4640A, as has also been detected in other UCXBs. We discuss
the implications of our findings for our understanding of the formation of

obtained at the INT telescope. We combine galaxy velocity and position
information to select 68 cluster members, determine global dynamical
properties, and detect possible substructures. The investigation of the
dynamical status is also performed by using X-ray data stored in the Chandra
archive. We compute the line-of-sight (LOS) velocity dispersion of galaxies,
sigma_v=1334 km s^-1, in agreement with the high average X-ray temperature
T_X=10.2 keV recovered from Chandra data. Assuming that the cluster is in
dynamical equilibrium and mass follows the galaxy distribution, we find that
A697 is a very massive cluster obtaining M(<R_max=0.75 Mpc h^-1)=9.5x10^14
solar masses h^-1 and M(<R_vir=3.85 Mpc h^-1)=4.5x10^15 solar masses h^-1 for

elongation of the X-ray emission, and the presence of small-size substructures
in the central region. Our results suggest that we are looking at a cluster

  Revision of the English grammar",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20064959",,"astro-ph",,"  At the end of March 2004, the blazar S5 0716+714 underwent an optical
outburst that prompted for quasi-simultaneous target-of-opportunity
observations with the INTEGRAL and XMM-Newton satellites. In this paper, we
report the results of the XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL OMC data analysis. The X-ray
spectrum is well-represented by a concave broken power-law model, with the
break at about 2 keV. In the framework of the synchrotron self-Compton model,
the softer part of the spectrum, which is described by a power law of index
$\alpha \simeq 1.8$ ($f_\nu \propto \nu^{-\alpha}$), is probably due to
synchrotron emission, while the harder part of the spectrum, which has $\alpha
\simeq 1$, is due to inverse Compton emission. The blazar shows the long and
short-term variability typical of low-frequency peaked BL Lac (LBL): the former
is manifested by a gradual decrease in the optical flux from the peak as
observed by ground telescopes at the end of March 2004, while the latter is
characterized by soft X-ray and optical flares on time scales from a few
thousand seconds to few hours. We can follow spectral variations on sub-hour
time scales and study their correlation with the flux variability. We find
evidence that the peak energy of the time-resolved spectra is increasing with
flux. The modeling of the spectral energy distribution compared with archival
observations suggests that the long-term variability (from outburst to
quiescence or viceversa) could be due to a change in the injected power, while
the short-term variability (flares) could be explained with changes in the
slope of the distribution of the electrons.

directly related to galactic HI emission. It is demonstrated that at least
three classes of such components can be distinguished. The narrowest Gaussians
mostly represent stronger random noise peaks in profiles and some still
uncorrected radio-interferences. Many of slightly wider weak Gaussians are
caused by increased uncertainties near the profile edges and with the still
increasing width the baseline problems become dominating among weak components.
Statistical criteria are given for separation of the parameter space regions,
most likely populated with the problematic components from those where the
Gaussians are with higher probability describing the actual Milky Way HI
emission. The same analysis is applied to the Leiden/Argentina/Bonn survey
(LAB). It is demonstrated that the selection criteria for dividing the
parameter space are to a great extent independent of the particular survey in
use. The presence of the baseline problems in the LDS is indicated by the
peculiarities of the distribution of the widest Gaussians in the sky. A similar
plot for the northern part of the LAB demonstrates considerably lower numbers
of spurious components, but there are still problems with the southern part of
the LAB. The strange characteristics of the observational noise in the southern

investigated. The models that better reproduce all the observed lines are those
where the clump is formed, at least partially, before the advent of the

non-dissociative shock and the consequent release of the icy mantle together

obtained as part of SINGS. The galaxy morphology is very different shortward
and longward of ~5 microns: short-wavelength imaging shows an underlying red
stellar population, with the central super star cluster (SSC) dominating the
luminosity; longer-wavelength data reveals warm dust emission arising from two
off-nuclear regions offset by ~250 pc from the SSC. These regions show little
extinction at optical wavelengths. The galaxy has a relatively low global dust
mass (~2E5 solar masses, implying a global dust-to-gas mass ratio ~2--4 times
lower than the Milky Way average). The off-nuclear dust emission appears to be
powered by photons from the same stellar population responsible for the
excitation of the observed H Alpha emission; these photons are unassociated
with the SSC (though a contribution from embedded sources to the IR luminosity
of the off-nuclear regions cannot be ruled out). Low-resolution IRS
spectroscopy shows moderate-strength PAH emission in the 11.3 micron band in
the eastern peak; no PAH emission is detected in the SSC or the western dust
emission complex. There is significant diffuse 8 micron emission after scaling
and subtracting shorter wavelength data; the spatially variable PAH emission
strengths revealed by the IRS data suggest caution in the interpretation of
diffuse 8 micron emission as arising from PAH carriers alone. The metallicity
of NGC 1705 falls at the transition level of 35% solar found by Engelbracht and
collaborators; the fact that a system at this metallicity shows spatially
variable PAH emission demonstrates the complexity of interpreting diffuse 8
micron emission. A radio continuum non-detection, NGC 1705 deviates
significantly from the canonical far-IR vs. radio correlation. (Abridged)

1991 by Wakker & van Woerden (WvW). We use the Leiden/Argentine/Bonn all sky
21-cm line survey and decompose the profiles into Gaussian components. We find
a well defined multi-component structure for most of the HVC complexes. The
cold HVC phase has lines with typical velocity dispersions of sigma = 3 km/s
and exists only within more extended broad line regions, typically with sigma =
12 km/s. The motions of the cores relative to the envelopes are characterized
by Mach numbers M = 1.5. The center velocities of the cores within a HVC
complex have typical dispersions of 20 km/s. Remarkable is the well defined
two-component structure for some prominent HVC complexes in the outskirts of
the Milky Way: Complex H, the Magellanic Stream and the Leading Arm. There
might be some indications for an interaction between HVCs and disk gas at
intermediate velocities. This is possible for complex H, M, C, WB, WD, WE, WC,
R, G, GCP, and OA, but not for complex A, MS, ACVHV, EN, WA, and P.
Conclusions: The line widths, determined by us, imply that estimates of HVC
masses, as far as derived from the WvW database, need to be scaled up by a
factor 1.4. Correspondingly, guesses for the external pressure of a confining
coronal gas need to be revised upward by a factor of 2. The HVC multi-phase
structure implies in general that currently the halo pressure is significantly

secondary electrons and positrons, which can be just slightly deflected by
extragalactic magnetic fields before they emit secondary gamma-rays via inverse
Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons. Secondary gamma-rays
emitted toward an observer on the Earth can be detected as extended emission
around initially point source. Energy dependent angular size of extended

astrobiological interest that has been tentatively identified in interstellar
ices and in cometary coma, has been studied in laboratory under simulated
astrophysical conditions such as ion irradiation at low temperature.
  Aims. To evaluate the abundances of formamide observed in space or in
laboratory, the integrated absorbances for all the principal IR features of
frozen amorphous pure formamide deposited at 20 K were measured. Further
evidence that energetic processing of ices occurring in space is extremely
relevant both to astrochemistry and to astrobiology has been found, showing
that new molecular species are synthesized by ion irradiation at a low
temperature.
  Methods. Pure formamide were deposited at 20 K and IR transmission spectra
measured for different ice thicknesses. The ice thickness was derived by
looking at the interference pattern (intensity versus time) of a He-Ne laser
beam reflected at an angle of 45 deg by the vacuum-film and film-substrate
interfaces. Samples of formamide ice were irradiated with 200 keV H+ ions and
IR spectra recorded at different ion fluences.
  Results. New molecules were synthesized among which are CO, CO2, N2O,
isocyanic acid (HNCO), and ammonium cyanate (NH4+OCN-). Some of these species
remain stable after warming up to room temperature.

parallel alignment of the liquid crystal molecules at their surfaces and, for
sufficiently strong anchoring, will generate a pair of defects at the poles of

will, in turn, affect the shape of the colloids. In this study we will focus on
elliptical soft colloids and determine how their equilibrium shapes depend on
the elastic constants of the liquid crystal, the anchoring strength, the
surface tension and the size of the colloids. A shape diagram is obtained
analytically, by minimizing the Frank elastic free energy, in the limit of
small eccentricities. The analytical results are verified, and generalized to
arbitrary eccentricities, by numerical minimization of an appropriate Landau
free energy. The latter is required for an adequate description of the
topological defects when the liquid crystal correlation length is comparable to
the size of the colloidal particles.

quantum dots is highly anisotropic due to the interplay of the Bychkov-Rashba

strongly with the interdot coupling due to the cyclotron effects on the

due to anisotropic spin hot spots which otherwise cause giant enhancement of
the rate at useful magnetic fields and interdot couplings. Conditions for the

superconducting clusters embedded in the antiferromagnetic matrix. Our work is
motivated by a series of recent angle-resolved photoemission experiments, which
have significantly enhanced our understanding of the electronic structure in
single-layer cuprates, and we show that those results can be fully reproduced
once a reasonable set of parameters is chosen and disorder is properly taken
into account. Close to half-filling, many nominally hole-rich and
superconducting sites have comparatively large excitation gaps due to the
ubiquitous proximity of the insulating phase. No other competing states or any
further assumptions are necessary to account for a satisfying description of
the underdoped phase, including the notorious pseudogap, which emerges as a
natural consequence of a mixed-phase state. Close to optimal doping, the
resulting gap distribution mirrors the one found in tunneling experiments. The
scenario presented is also compelling because the existence of an optimal
doping is intrinsically linked to the presence of electronic inhomogeneity, as
is the transition from the highly mysterious to the rather conventional nature
of the metallic state above $T_c$ in the overdoped regime. The phase diagram
that emerges bears strong similarity to the canonical cuprate phase diagram, it
explains quantitatively the rapid loss of long-range antiferromagnetic order,
and also provides for a ``superconducting fluctuating'' regime just above $T_c$
as recently proposed in the context of resistance measurements. Implications

helpful in identifying various design trade-offs for the robots and be a useful

  Robotics, March 2006, Volume 25, pp. 225-242",,,,"cs.RO cs.MA",,"  Dynamic task allocation is an essential requirement for multi-robot systems
operating in unknown dynamic environments. It allows robots to change their
behavior in response to environmental changes or actions of other robots in
order to improve overall system performance. Emergent coordination algorithms
for task allocation that use only local sensing and no direct communication
between robots are attractive because they are robust and scalable. However, a
lack of formal analysis tools makes emergent coordination algorithms difficult
to design. In this paper we present a mathematical model of a general dynamic
task allocation mechanism. Robots using this mechanism have to choose between
two types of task, and the goal is to achieve a desired task division in the
absence of explicit communication and global knowledge. Robots estimate the
state of the environment from repeated local observations and decide which task
to choose based on these observations. We model the robots and observations as
stochastic processes and study the dynamics of the collective behavior.
Specifically, we analyze the effect that the number of observations and the
choice of the decision function have on the performance of the system. The
mathematical models are validated in a multi-robot multi-foraging scenario. The
model's predictions agree very closely with experimental results from
sensor-based simulations.

instabilities can be avoided by assuming strict de Sitter invariance of the
quantum states of the linearized fluctuations. We furthermore show that quantum
anomalies do not block the invariance requirement. This invariance constraint
applies to the entire spectrum of states, from the vacuum to the excited states

(as in the recent construction by Kachru {\it et al}). The phenomenology
depends on the so-called modular weights which, in turn, depend on the location
of various fields in the extra dimensions. We find that the model with zero
modular weights gives mass spectra characterized by very light top squarks
and/or tau sleptons, or where M_1\sim -M_2 so that the bino and wino are
approximately degenerate. The top squark mass can be in the range required by
successful electroweak baryogenesis. The measured relic density of cold dark
matter can be obtained via top squark co-annihilation at low \tan\beta, tau
slepton co-annihilation at large \tan\beta or via bino-wino coannihilation.
Then, we typically find low rates for direct and indirect detection of
neutralino dark matter. However, essentially all the WMAP-allowed parameter
space can be probed by experiments at the CERN LHC, while significant portions
may also be explored at an e^+e^- collider with \sqrt{s}=0.5--1 TeV. We also
investigate a case with non-zero modular weights. In this case,
co-annihilation, A-funnel annihilation and bulk annihilation of neutralinos are
all allowed. Results for future colliders are qualitatively similar, but
prospects for indirect dark matter searches via gamma rays and anti-particles
are somewhat better.

application of the theory of operator algebras to wavelet theory. The concrete

the usual definition in the frame literature, but it is easily equivalent to
the usual definition. Because of this compression relationship between frames
and bases, the unitary system approach to wavelets (and more generally:
wandering vectors) is perfectly adaptable to frame theory. The use of the local
commutant is along the same lines as in the wavelet theory. Finally, we discuss
constructions of frames with special properties using targeted decompositions
of positive operators, and related problems.

optical processes of the second-order are studied. The analytical results
concern both the simplified autonomous model and the extended nonautonomous
model, including the pump and damping mechanism. The nonlinearity in the
coexisting solutions of the autonomous system is in concealed frequencies
depending on the initial conditions. In the solutions of the nonautonomous
system the nonlinearity is convoluted in amplitudes. The neighbourhood of
periodic solutions is studied numerically, mainly in phase portraits. As a
result of disturbance, for example detuning, the periodic solutions are shown
to escape to other states, periodic, quasiperiodic (beats) or chaotic. The
chaotic behavior is indicated by the Lypunov exponents. We also investigate
selected aspects of synchronization (unidirectional or mutual) of two identical
systems being in two different coexisting states. The effects of quenching of
oscillations are shown. In the autonomous system the quenching is caused by a
change in frequency, whereas in the nonautonomous one by a change in amplitude.
The quenching seems very promising for design of some advanced signal
processing.

equipartition, heat conduction and other fundamental processes in extended

new phenomenon of planar chiral circular conversion dichroism, which in some
aspects resembles the Faraday effect in magnetized media, but does not require
the presence of a magnetic field for its observation. It results from the
interaction of an electromagnetic wave with a planar chiral structure patterned
on the sub-wavelength scale, and manifests itself in asymmetric transmission of
circularly polarized waves in the opposite directions through the structure and
elliptically polarized eigenstates. The new effect is radically different from
conventional gyrotropy of three-dimensional chiral media.

"q-bio/0604034","Jean-Michel Claverie","Jean-Michel Claverie (IGS)","Virus evolution : the emergence of new ideas (and re-emergence of old
  ones)","submitted",,,,"q-bio.PE",,"  Reputed intractable, the question of the origin of viruses has long been
neglected. In the modern literature 'Virus evolution' has come to refer to
study more akin to population genetics, such as the world-wide scrutiny on new
polymorphisms appearing daily in the H5N1 avian flu virus [1], than to the
fundamental interrogation: where do viruses come from? This situation is now
rapidly changing, due to the coincidence of bold new ideas (and sometimes the
revival of old ones), the unexpected features exhibited by recently isolated
spectacular viruses [2] (see at URL: www.giantvirus.org), as well as the steady
increase of genomic sequences for 'regular' viruses and cellular organisms
enhancing the power of comparative genomics [3]. After being considered
non-living and relegated in the wings by a majority of biologists, viruses are
now pushed back on the center stage: they might have been at the origin of DNA,
of the eukaryotic cell, and even of today's partition of biological organisms
into 3 domains of life: bacteria, archaea and eukarya. Here, I quickly survey
some of the recent discoveries and the new evolutionary thoughts they have
prompted, before adding to the confusion with one interrogation of my own: what
if we totally missed the true nature of (at least some) viruses?

  demography cycles","26 pages, 6 figures",,,,"q-bio.PE",,"  We develop the qualitative theory of the solutions of the McKendrick partial
differential equation of population dynamics. We calculate explicitly the weak
solutions of the McKendrick equation and of the Lotka renewal integral equation
with time and age dependent birth rate. Mortality modulus is considered age
dependent. We show the existence of demography cycles. For a population with
only one reproductive age class, independently of the stability of the weak
solutions and after a transient time, the temporal evolution of the number of
individuals of a population is always modulated by a time periodic function.
The periodicity of the cycles is equal to the age of the reproductive age
class, and a population retains the memory from the initial data through the
amplitude of oscillations. For a population with a continuous distribution of
reproductive age classes, the amplitude of oscillation is damped. The
periodicity of the damped cycles is associated with the age of the first
reproductive age class. Damping increases as the dispersion of the fertility
function around the age class with maximal fertility increases. In general, the
period of the demography cycles is associated with the time that a species
takes to reach the reproductive maturity.

Phys. 125, 044514 (2006)","10.1063/1.2216702",,"quant-ph",,"  Decoherence-Free Subsystems (DFS) are a powerful means of protecting quantum
information against noise with known symmetry properties. Although Hamiltonians
theoretically exist that can implement a universal set of logic gates on DFS
encoded qubits without ever leaving the protected subsystem, the natural
Hamiltonians that are available in specific implementations do not necessarily
have this property. Here we describe some of the principles that can be used in
such cases to operate on encoded qubits without losing the protection offered
by the DFS. In particular, we show how dynamical decoupling can be used to
control decoherence during the unavoidable excursions outside of the DFS. By
means of cumulant expansions, we show how the fidelity of quantum gates
implemented by this method on a simple two-physical-qubit DFS depends on the
correlation time of the noise responsible for decoherence. We further show by
means of numerical simulations how our previously introduced ""strongly
modulating pulses"" for NMR quantum information processing can permit
high-fidelity operations on multiple DFS encoded qubits in practice, provided
that the rate at which the system can be modulated is fast compared to the
correlation time of the noise. The principles thereby illustrated are expected
to be broadly applicable to many implementations of quantum information
processors based on DFS encoded qubits.

functions via three local networks supplemented by a classical communication.
With these functions, they are able to determine the set of negativities
