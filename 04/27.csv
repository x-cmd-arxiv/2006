global star formation history (SFH). Using direct observational estimates of
the SFH, along with standard assumptions about the initial mass function (IMF),
we calculate the total extragalactic background radiation and the observed
stellar density today. We show that plausible SFHs allow a significant range in
each quantity, but that their ratio is very tightly constrained. Current
estimates of the stellar mass and extragalactic background are difficult to
reconcile, as long as the IMF is fixed to the Salpeter slope above 1 Msun. The
joint confidence interval of these two quantities only agrees with that
determined from the allowed range of SFH fits at the 3-sigma level, and for our
best-fit values the discrepancy is about a factor of two. Alternative energy
sources that contribute to the background, such as active galactic nuclei
(AGN), Population III stars, or decaying particles, appear unlikely to resolve
the discrepancy. However, changes to the IMF allow plausible solutions to the
background problem. The simplest is an average IMF with an increased
contribution from stars around 1.5--4 Msun. A ``paunchy'' IMF of this sort
could emerge as a global average if low mass star formation is suppressed in
galaxies experiencing rapid starbursts. Such an IMF is consistent with
observations of star-forming regions, and would help to reconcile the fossil
record of star formation with the directly observed SFH.

in galaxy groups due to the relatively low density of the intragroup medium and
the small velocity dispersions of groups. To test this assumption, we obtained
Chandra X-ray data of the starbursting spiral NGC 2276 in the NGC 2300 group of
galaxies, a candidate for a strong galaxy interaction with hot intragroup gas.
The data reveal a shock-like feature along the western edge of the galaxy and a
low-surface-brightness tail extending to the east, similar to the morphology
seen in other wavebands. Spatially resolved spectroscopy shows that the data
are consistent with intragroup gas being pressurized at the leading western
edge of NGC 2276 due to the galaxy moving supersonically through the intragroup
medium at a velocity ~850 km/s. Detailed modelling of the gravitational
potential of NGC 2276 shows that the resulting ram-pressure could significantly
affect the morphology of the outer gas disc but is probably insufficient to
strip large amounts of cold gas from the disc. We estimate the mass loss rates
due to turbulent viscous stripping and starburst outflows being swept back by
ram pressure, showing that both mechanisms could plausibly explain the presence
of the X-ray tail. Comparison to existing HI measurements shows that most of
the gas escaping the galaxy is in a hot phase. With a total mass loss rate of
roughly 5 M_Sun/yr, the galaxy could be losing its entire present HI supply
within a Gyr. This demonstrates that the removal of galactic gas through
interactions with a hot intragroup medium can occur rapidly enough to transform
the morphology of galaxies in groups. Implications of this for galaxy evolution
in groups and clusters are briefly discussed.

developed a method to estimate the PSF delivered by an AO system in the case

transfer function (MTF) of several key components of the imaging system. The
power spectrum of the image, even a dense star field, can then be used to

that the method yields reasonable fit parameters and a useful approximation to

m_gal, and stellar mass-to-light ratio M/L_I. A simultaneous match of the VL
and RL zero points with adiabatic contraction requires low-c halos, but this
model has V_2.2~1.8 V_vir (where V_2.2 and V_vir are the circular velocity at
2.2 disk scale lengths and the virial radius, respectively) which will be
unable to match the luminosity function (LF). Similarly models without
adiabatic contraction but standard c also predict high values of V_2.2/V_vir.
Models in which disk formation induces an expansion rather than the commonly
assumed contraction of the dark-matter halos have V_2.2~1.2 V_vir which allows
a simultaneous fit of the LF. This may result from non-spherical, clumpy gas
accretion, where dynamical friction transfers energy from the gas to the dark
matter. This model requires low lam_gal and m_gal values, contrary to naive
expectations. However, the low lam_gal is consistent with the notion that disk
galaxies predominantly survive in halos with a quiet merger history, while a
low m_gal is also indicated by galaxy-galaxy lensing. The smaller than expected
scatter in the RL relation, and the lack of correlation between the residuals
of the VL and RL relations, respectively, imply that the scatter in lam_gal and
in c need to be smaller than predicted for LCDM halos, again consistent with
the idea that disk galaxies preferentially reside in halos with a quiet merger
history.

M_sun/Mpc^3 (co-moving), which is 0.2--1.1% of the present-day value. The
prospect of detecting the progenitors of the most massive galaxies at yet
higher redshifts is explored: a deep, wide-field near-IR survey using our
current technology could possibly result in positive detections at z > 7. We
also investigate the implication of our results for reionzation, and find that
the progenitors of the galaxies comparable to those in our sample, even in the
most optimized (probably unrealistic) scenario, cannot sustain the reionization
for a period longer than ~ 2 million years. Thus most of the photons required

a way that magnesium over abundances ([Mg/Fe]>0.2 dex) are essentially observed
only in the stars whose orbits lie almost entirely within the solar circle. At
the same time, the range of metallicities in magnesium-poor stars is displaced
from (-0.5<[Fe/H]<+0.3 dex) to (-0.7<[Fe/H]<+0.2 dex) as their orbital radii
increase. This behavior suggests that, first, the star formation rate decreases
with increasing Galactocentric distance and, second, there was no star
formation for some time outside the solar circle while this process was
continuous within the solar circle. The decrease in the star formation rate
with increasing Galactocentric distance is responsible for the existence of a
negative radial metallicity gradient (grad_{R}[Fe/H]=(-0.05 \pm 0.01) kpc^{-1})
in the disk, which shows a tendency to increase with decreasing age. At the
same time the relative magnesium abundance exhibits no radial gradient. We have
confirmed the existence of a steep negative vertical metallicity gradient

vertical gradient in relative magnesium abundance (grad_Z [Mg/Fe]=(0.13 \pm

they may offer an additional significant effect. A much longer timescale is
associated with shock breakout luminosity observed in the soft X-ray (~10^3 s)

emitted during the light curve phase of supernovae (~10^7 s). Here we
generalize our atmospheric computations to include a broad range of peak photon
energies and investigate the effect of burst duration while holding total
fluence and other parameters constant. The results can be used to estimate the
probable impact of various kinds of ionizing events (such as short GRBs, X-ray
flashes, supernovae) upon the terrestrial atmosphere. We find that the ultimate
intensity of atmospheric effects varies only slightly with burst duration from
10^-1 s to 10^8 s. Therefore, the effect of many astrophysical events causing
atmospheric ionization can be approximated without including time development.
Detailed modeling requires specification of the season and latitude of the
event. Harder photon spectra produce greater atmospheric effects for spectra
with peaks up to about 20 MeV, because of greater penetration into the
stratosphere.

numerous HII regions and associated clusters in MO. In UV, MO resembles the
radio-aligned, rest-frame UV morphologies in many high redshift radio galaxies
(HzRGs), also thought to be caused by jet-induced star formation. MO's stellar
population is dominated by a 7.5 Myr-old, 1.9E7 solar mass instantaneous burst,
with current star formation rate 0.52 solar masses per year (concentrated
upstream from where the HI column density is high). This is unlike the
jet-induced star formation in Centaurus A, where the jet interacts with
pre-existing cold gas; in MO the HI may have cooled out of a warmer, clumpy
intergalactic or interstellar medium as a result of jet interaction, followed
by collapse of the cooling clouds and subsequent star formation (consistent
with numerical simulations). Since the radio source that triggered star
formation in MO is much less luminous, and therefore more common, than powerful
HzRGs, and because the environment around MO is not particularly special in
terms of abundant dense, cold gas, jet-induced star formation in the early
universe might be even more prevalent than previously thought.

not necessarily require the complete exhaustion of the neutral gas reservoir.
Most likely, an intense burst of star formation consumed the dense molecular
clouds, which are the sites of massive star formation. This effectively stops
star formation, even though copious amounts of diffuse neutral gas remain. The

formation. This may indicate that some E+As are observed in the inactive phase

find that the plane-parallel evaporation front is unstable under corrugational

instability is analogous to the Darrieus-Landau instability in combustion
front. The growth rate of the instability is proportional to the speed of the
evaporation flow and the corrugation wavenumber for modes with wavelength much
longer than the thickness of the front, and it is suppressed at scales
approximately equal to the thickness of the front. The timescale of the
instability is smaller than the cooling timescale of the warm neutral medium

content of early-type galaxies. The goal of the series is to set constraints on
the evolutionary status of these objects.
  Methods: In this paper we describe the details of the galaxy sample, the
observations, and the data reduction. Line-strength indices and velocity
dispersions sigma are measured in 98 early-type galaxies drawn from different
environments, and the relation of the indices with the velocity dispersion
analysed in detail.
  Results: The present sample indicates that some of the index-sigma relations
depend on galaxy environment. In particular, the slope of the relation between
Balmer lines and sigma is steeper for galaxies in the Virgo cluster, small
groups, and in the field than for galaxies in the Coma cluster. In several
indices there is also a significant offset in the zero point between the
relations defined by the different subsamples. The slopes of the index-sigma
relation for the Virgo and low-density environment galaxies are explained by a
variation of both age and metallicity with velocity dispersion, as previously
noted in other studies. For the galaxies in the Coma cluster, however, the
relation of the indices with sigma only requires a variation of the abundance
along the sigma sequence. In agreement with other studies we find that the
models that better reproduce the slopes are those in which the alpha elements
vary more than the Fe-peak elements along the sigma sequence, while, at a given
sigma, older galaxies show an higher alpha/Fe ratio.
  Conclusions: The results can be explained assuming that galaxies in the Coma
cluster have experienced a truncated star formation and chemical enrichment
history compared to a more continuous time-extended history for their
counterparts in lower density environments.

SSP age and metallicity than their counterparts in high density environments,
with a tendency for lower sigma galaxies to be younger. Early-type galaxies in
low-density environments appear on average ~1.5 Gyr younger and more metal rich
than their counterparts in high density environments. The sample of low-density
environment galaxies shows an age metallicity relation in which younger
galaxies are found to be more metal rich, but only when metallicity is measured
with a Fe-sensitive index. Conversely, there is no age-metallicity relation
when the metallicity is measured with a Mg sensitive index. The
mass-metallicity relation is only appreciable for the low-density environment
galaxies when the metallicity is measured with a Mg-sensitive index and not
when the metallicity is measured with other indicators. On the contrary, this
relation exists for the high-density environment galaxies independently of the
indicator used to measure the metallicity. This suggests a dependence of the
mass-metallicity relation on the environment of the galaxies. Our data favour a
scenario in which galaxies in low density environments have suffered a more
extended star formation history than the galaxies in the Coma cluster, which
appear to host more homogenous stellar populations.

sample of 82 early-type galaxies in different environments,including the

with the predictions of different galaxy formation models. We explore the
behaviour of individual chemical species by deriving the metallicity gradient
with different indicators.We find that the strength of the metallicity gradient
inferred from stellar population models depends on the specific Lick index
employed. In particular, metallicity gradients obtained with CN2 and C4668
combined with Hb are steeper than when measured using Ca4227 or Fe4383. The
correlation of the metallicity gradients with other parameters also depends on
the specific index employed. If the metallicity gradient is obtained using CN2
and Mgb then it correlates with the central age of the galaxies. On the
contrary, if Fe4383 or Ca4227 are used, the metallicity gradient correlates
with the velocity dispersion gradient.This may suggests that several mechanism
have helped to set the age and metallicity gradients in early-type galaxies.
While we do not find any correlation between the metallicity gradient and the
central velocity dispersion for galaxies in low-density environments, we find a
marginal correlation between the metallicity gradient and the mass for galaxies
in the centre of the Coma cluster. We also find a trend for which galaxies in
denser environments show a steeper metallicity gradient than galaxies in less
dense environments.We interpret these results in light of the different models
to explain the differences between galaxies as a function of environment.

free-fall onto a central mass point. The density distribution is not
spherically symmetric but depends on the mass loading of magnetic field lines,
which can be obtained by matching our inner solution to an outer collapse
solution previously computed by Allen, Shu & Li. The concentration of magnetic
field trapped by the central mass point under field-freezing, independent on
the details of the starting state, creates a split monopole configuration where
the magnetic field strength increases as the inverse square of the distance
from the center. Under such conditions, the inflow eventually becomes
subalfvenic and the outward transfer of angular momentum by magnetic braking
very efficient, thus preventing the formation of a centrifugally supported
disk. Instead, the azimuthal velocity of the infalling gas decreases to zero at
the center, and the gas spirals into the star. Therefore, the dissipation of
dynamically important levels of magnetic field is a fundamental requisite for
the formation of protoplanetary disks around young stars.

reaction of the Lorentz force on the accretion flow. In quasi steady-state, and
assuming the resistivity coefficient to be spatially uniform, the problem is
analytically soluble in terms of Legendre's polynomials and confluent
hypergeometric functions. The dissipation of the magnetic field occurs inside a
region of radius inversely proportional to the mass of the central star (the
``Ohm radius''), where the magnetic field becomes asymptotically straight and
uniform. In our solution, the magnetic flux problem of star formation is
avoided because the magnetic flux dragged in the accreting protostar is always
zero. Our results imply that the effective resistivity of the infalling gas
must be higher by several orders of magnitude than the microscopic electric
resistivity, to avoid conflict with measurements of paleomagnetism in
meteorites and with the observed luminosity of regions of low-mass star
formation.

Andreev reflection dominates in weakly doped graphene, when the Fermi wave

noise. We include the electron-electron interaction and the finite length of
the SWNT within the inhomogeneous Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) model and
treat the non-equilibrium effects due to an applied bias voltage within the
Keldysh approach. In low-frequency transport properties, the TLL effect is
apparent mainly via power-law characteristics as a function of bias voltage or
temperature at energy scales above the finite level spacing of the SWNT. The
FP-frequency is dominated by the non-interacting spin mode velocity due to two
degenerate subbands rather than the interacting charge velocity. At higher
frequencies, the excess noise is shown to be capable of resolving the
splintering of the transported electrons arising from the mismatch of the
TLL-parameter at the interface between metal reservoirs and SWNT. This dynamics
leads to a periodic shot noise suppression as a function of frequency and with
a period that is determined solely by the charge velocity. At large bias
voltages, these oscillations are dominant over the ordinary FP-oscillations
caused by two weak backscatterers. This makes shot noise an invaluable tool to
distinguish the two mode velocities in the SWNT.

dependent 7Li and 2H NMR spectra gives evidence for a coupling of ion and
polymer dynamics. 2H NMR spectra for various salt concentrations reveal a
strong slow down of the polymer segmental motion when the salt content is
increased. The 2H NMR line shape further indicates that the segmental motion is
governed by dynamical heterogeneities. While the width of the distribution of
correlation times G(log tau) is moderate for low and high salt content, an
extremely broad distribution exists for an intermediate salt concentration 15:1
PPO-LiClO4. For the latter composition, a weighed superposition of two spectral
components, reflecting the fast and the slow polymer segments of the
distribution, describes the 2H NMR line shape over a broad temperature range.
Analysis of the temperature dependent relative intensity of both spectral
components indicates the existence of a continuous rather than a discontinuous
distribution G(log tau). Such continuous distribution is consistent with
gradual fluctuation of the local salt concentration and, hence, of the local
environments of the polymer segments, whereas it is at variance with the
existence of large salt-depleted and salt-rich domains featuring fast and slow
polymer dynamics, respectively. Finally, for all studied mixtures PPO-LiClO4,
the 2H NMR line shape strongly depends on the echo delay in the applied
echo-pulse sequence, indicating that the structural relaxation of the polymer
segments involves successive rotational jumps about small angles gamma<20
degree.

groups, aimed at the eventual observation of Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals
(EMRIs) with gravitational wave detectors. EMRIs are binary systems in which
one of the objects is much more massive than the other, and which are in a
state of dynamical evolution that is dominated by the effects of gravitational
radiation. Although these systems are highly relativistic, with the smaller
object moving relative to the larger at nearly light-speed, they are well
described by perturbative calculations which exploit the mass ratio as a
natural small parameter. I review the use of such approximations to generate
waveforms needed by data analysis algorithms for observation. I also briefly
review the status of developing the data analysis algorithms themselves.
Although this article is almost entirely a review of previous work, it includes
(as an appendix) a new analytical estimate for the time over which the
influence of radiation on the binary itself is observationally negligible.

that only one simultaneity choice, the one possessing continuous time, gives
rise, via the general relativistic equation of motion, to the correct Newtonian
limit Coriolis acceleration. In addition, the widely dispersed argument
purporting Lorentz contraction in rotation and the concomitant curved surface

it is incomplete in a more general applicability sense, because it does not

of instantaneous 3-space in relativistic theories leads to a reformulation of
their kinematical basis emphasizing the role of non-inertial frames centered on
an arbitrary accelerated observer. In special relativity the exigence of
predictability implies the adoption of the 3+1 point of view, which leads to a
well posed initial value problem for field equations in a framework where the
change of the convention of synchronization of distant clocks is realized by
means of a gauge transformation. This point of view is also at the heart of the
canonical approach to metric and tetrad gravity in globally hyperbolic
asymptotically flat space-times, where the use of Shanmugadhasan canonical
transformations allows the separation of the physical degrees of freedom of the
gravitational field (the tidal effects) from the arbitrary gauge variables.
Since a global vision of the equivalence principle implies that only global
non-inertial frames can exist in general relativity, the gauge variables are
naturally interpreted as generalized relativistic inertial effects, which have
to be fixed to get a deterministic evolution in a given non-inertial frame. As
a consequence, in each Einstein's space-time in this class the whole
chrono-geometrical structure, including also the clock synchronization
convention, is dynamically determined and a new approach to the Hole Argument
leads to the conclusion that ""gravitational field"" and ""space-time"" are two
faces of the same entity. This view allows to get a classical scenario for the
unification of the four interactions in a scheme suited to the description of
the solar system or our galaxy with a deperametrization to special relativity
and the subsequent possibility to take the non-relativistic limit.

conservation. Magnetic moments and electric and magnetic radii are extracted

An almost infinitesimal vacuum energy is only the simplest candidate for a
cosmologically significant nearly homogeneous exotic energy density with
negative pressure, generically called Dark Energy. If general relativity is
assumed to be also valid on cosmological scales, the existence of such a dark
energy component that dominates the recent universe is now almost inevitable.

relativity has to be modified on distances comparable to the Hubble scale. It
will turn out that observational data are restricting theoretical speculations
more and more. Moreover, some of the recent proposals have serious defects on a

quantify systematic uncertainties of the generators, used in the interpretation
of the data, is becoming pressing. The PHOTOS Monte Carlo program is often used
for the simulationof experimental, selection-sensitive, QED radiative
corrections in decays of Z bosons and other heavy resonances and particles.
Thanks to its complete phase-space coverage it is possible, with no
approximations for any decay channel, to implement the matrix-element. The
present paper will be devoted to those parts of the next-to-leading order
corrections for Z decays which are normally missing in PHOTOS. The analytical
form of the exact and truncated (standard) kernel used in PHOTOS will be
explicitly given. The correction, being the ratio of the exact to the
approximate kernel, can be activated as an optional contribution to the
internal weight of PHOTOS.
  To calculate the weight, the information on the effective Born-level Z/gamma*
couplings and even directions of the incoming beams, is needed. A universal
implementation would have made the PHOTOS solution less modular and less
convenient for the users. That is why, for the time being, we will keep the
correcting weight as an extra option, available for special tests only.
  We will quantify the numerical effect of the approximation with the help of a
multitude of distributions. The numerical size of the effect is in general
below 0.1%; however, in some corners of the phase-space (well defined and
contributing less than 0.5% to the total rate), it may reach up to about 20% of
their relative size.

modifications allowed to users. $W/Z$ + 1 jet events are generated using an
ME-based event generator at the tree level. The divergence at low $p_{T}$ is
suppressed by using the Sudakov form factor. PS is added with an appropriate
consideration for PS-ME matching. The simulation for the $W$ + 1 jet production
shows a smooth matching with the $W$ + 0 jet simulation at low $p_{T}$s. The
$Z$ + 1 jet simulation in the Tevatron Run I condition well reproduces the
experimental measurement on the $p_{T}$ spectrum of $Z$.

to study the properties of strings arising in brane inflation. Whilst the

effects of gravitation on cosmic strings arising in supergravity. Fermion zero
modes are a common feature of cosmic strings, and generically occur in
supersymmetric models. The corresponding massless currents can give rise to
stable string loops (vortons). The vorton density in our universe is strongly
constrained, allowing many theories with cosmic strings to be ruled out. We
investigate the existence of fermion zero modes on cosmic strings in
supergravity theories. A general index theorem for the number of zero modes is
derived. We show that by including the gravitino, some (but not all) zero modes
disappear. This weakens the constraints on cosmic string models. In particular,
winding number one cosmic D-strings in models of brane inflation are not
subject to vorton constraints. We also discuss the effects of supersymmetry
breaking on cosmic D-strings.

chain of Beisert, Dippel and Staudacher (BDS). This generalises to all orders

<= n <= 8 are represented well as powers of the Reynolds number, Re, in the
range 380 <= Re <= 5725, where Re is based on the periodic box length L_x.
These low-Reynolds-number flows give no hint of scaling in the inertial range
even when extended self-similarity is applied. Yet, the DNS scaling exponents
of velocity gradients agree well with those deduced, using a recent theory of
anomalous scaling, from the scaling exponents of the longitudinal structure
functions at infinitely high Reynolds numbers. This suggests that the
asymptotic state of turbulence is attained for the velocity gradients at far
lower Reynolds numbers than those required for the inertial range to appear. We
discuss these findings in the light of multifractal formalism. Our numerical
studies also resolve the crossover of the velocity gradient statistics from the
Gaussian to non-Gaussian behaviour that occurs as the Reynolds number is

this text remains self- sufficient. The questions asked following these studies
will be answered. The consistency of these developments in addition to the
experimental results, enable to strongly support the existence of a preferred
aether frame and of the anisotropy of the one-way speed of light in the Earth
frame. The theory demonstrates that the apparent invariance of the speed of
light results from the systematic measurement distortions entailed by length
contraction, clock retardation and the synchronization procedures with light
signals or by slow clock transport. Contrary to what is often believed, these
two methods have been demonstrated to be equivalent by several authors [1]. The
compatibility of the relativity principle with the existence of a preferred
aether frame and with mass-energy conservation is discussed and the relation
existing between the aether and inertial mass is investigated. The experimental
space-time transformations connect co-ordinates altered by the systematic
measurement distortions. Once these distortions are corrected, the hidden
variables they conceal are disclosed. The theory sheds light on several points
of physics which had not found a satisfactory explanation before. (Further
important comments will be made in ref [1d]).

use, after discretization of the equations that cast the problem in the form of
a generalized eigenvalue problem, the incomplete Arnoldi-Chebyshev method. This
method preserves the banded structure sparsity of matrices of the algebraic
eigenvalue problem and thus decreases memory use and CPU-time consumption.
  The errors that affect computed eigenvalues and eigenvectors are due to the
truncation in the discretization and to finite precision in the computation of
the discretized problem. In this paper we analyze those two errors and the
interplay between them. We use as a test case the two-dimensional eigenvalue
problem yielded by the computation of inertial modes in a spherical shell. This
problem contains many difficulties that make it a very good test case. It turns
out that that single modes (especially most-damped modes i.e. with high spatial
frequency) can be very sensitive to round-off errors, even when apparently good
spectral convergence is achieved. The influence of round-off errors is analyzed
using the spectral portrait technique and by comparison of double precision and
extended precision computations. Through the analysis we give practical recipes
to control the truncation and round-off errors on eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

simultaneous recording of action potentials from many neurons in awake and

recording from multiple brain sites using single wire electrodes. However, in
densely packed neural structures such as the human hippocampus, a single
electrode can record the activity of multiple neurons. Thus, analytic
techniques that differentiate action potentials of different neurons are
required. Offline spike sorting approaches are currently used to detect and
sort action potentials after finishing the experiment. Because the
opportunities to record from the human brain are relatively rare, it is
desirable to analyze large numbers of simultaneous recordings quickly using
online sorting and detection algorithms. In this way, the experiment can be
optimized for the particular response properties of the recorded neurons. Here
we present and evaluate a method that is capable of detecting and sorting
extracellular single-wire recordings in realtime. We demonstrate the utility of
the method by applying it to an extensive data set we acquired from
chronically-implanted depth electrodes in the hippocampus of human epilepsy
patients. This dataset is particularly challenging because it was recorded in a
noisy clinical environment. This method will allow the development of
closed-loop experiments, which immediately adapt the experimental stimuli
