a single constant equation of state (EOS) $p=-p_0$ ($p_0>0$) reproduces the

dissipative effect, and the cosmological constant in a unique framework and the
Friedmann equations can be analytically solved. Especially, we find a relation
between the EOS parameter and the renormalizable condition of a scalar field.
We develop a completely numerical method to perform a $\chi^2$ minimization to
constrain the parameters in a cosmological model directly from the Friedmann
equations, and employ the SNe data with the parameter $\mathcal{A}$ measured
from the SDSS data to constrain our model. The result indicates that the
dissipative effect is rather small in the late-time Universe.

free-particle Schrodinger equation as the basis of a new approximation method -
the free-particle approximation - that is similar in spirit to the successful
adhesion model. In this paper we test the free-particle approximation by
appealing to a planar collapse scenario and find that our results are in
excellent agreement with those of the Zeldovich approximation, provided care is
taken when choosing a value for the effective Planck constant in the theory. We
also discuss how extensions of the free-particle approximation are likely to
require the inclusion of a time-dependent potential in the Schrodinger
equation. Since the Schrodinger equation with a time-dependent potential is
typically impossible to solve exactly, we investigate whether standard
quantum-mechanical approximation techniques can be used, in a cosmological
setting, to obtain useful solutions of the Schrodinger equation. In this paper
we focus on one particular approximation method: time-dependent perturbation
theory (TDPT). We elucidate the properties of perturbative solutions of the
Schrodinger equation by considering a simple example: the gravitational
evolution of a plane-symmetric density fluctuation. We use TDPT to calculate an
approximate solution of the relevant Schrodinger equation and show that this
perturbative solution can be used to successfully follow gravitational collapse
beyond the linear regime, but there are several pitfalls to be avoided.

coupled to a Poisson equation describing Newtonian gravity. It has recently
been shown that, in the quasi-linear regime, the Schrodinger equation can be
reduced to the exactly solvable free-particle Schrodinger equation. The
free-particle Schrodinger equation forms the basis of a new approximation
scheme -the free-particle approximation - that is capable of evolving
cosmological density perturbations into the quasi-linear regime. The
free-particle approximation is essentially an alternative to the adhesion model
in which the artificial viscosity term in Burgers' equation is replaced by a
non-linear term known as the quantum pressure. Simple one-dimensional tests of
the free-particle method have yielded encouraging results. In this paper we
comprehensively test the free-particle approximation in a more cosmologically
relevant scenario by appealing to an N-body simulation. We compare our results
with those obtained from two established methods: the linearized fluid approach
and the Zeldovich approximation. We find that the free-particle approximation
comprehensively out-performs both of these approximation schemes in all tests
carried out and thus provides another useful analytical tool for studying
structure formation on cosmological scales.

possibility that the optical flash may arise from the internal shock. We find
that, under certain circumstance, the optical flash of GRB990123 and GRB060111b
can really be explained by the internal shock. For GRB041219a, the prompt
optical emission was correlated with the gamma-ray emission, we explain this
feature also in the internal shock scenario, the optical emission is the low
energy extension of the gamma-ray emission, and we can restrict its redshift
$z\sim 0.2$. As for GRB050904, we have shown in previous paper that the optical
flash was produced by synchrotron radiation and the X-ray flare was produced by
the synchrotron-self-Compton mechanism. Therefore we conclude that the early
optical flash of GRBs can usually come from the internal shock. Meanwhile since
the condition to produce the optical flash is not easily satisfied, so the
optical flash like GRB990123 should not be common in GRBs. In addition, we also
discussed the synchrotron-self-Compton effect in the internal shock model, and
find that for different values of parameters, there would be soft gamma-ray
(100 KeV), hard gamma-ray (10 MeV) and GeV flare accompanying the optical
flash. For GRB like GRB990123, a GeV flare with fluence about 10^{-8} erg

1.65 +/- 0.15 mag and distance = 2900 +/- 400 pc. The turn off age of the

(42%) was found to have NIR excess and their location in the diagram was used
to identify them as intermediate mass pre-MS stars. The isochrone fits to
pre-MS stars in the optical colour-magnitude diagram showed that the turn-on
age of the cluster is 0.3 - 3 Myr. This indicates that there has been a recent
episode of star formation in the vicinity of the cluster. Slit-less spectra
were used to identify 27 stars which showed H-alpha in emission in the field of
the cluster, of which 6 are new identifications. All these stars were found to
show NIR excess and located closer to the region populated by Herbig Ae/Be
stars in the (J-H) vs (H-K) diagram. Slit spectra of 25 stars were obtained in
the region 3700A - 9000A. The spectral features were found to be very similar
to those of Herbig Be stars. Those stars were found to be more reddened than
the main sequence stars by 0.4 mag on an average. Thus the emission line stars
found in this cluster are more similar to the Herbig Be type stars where the

worse synchronizability than the uncoupled case (C=0). On the other hand, the

consequence of the spontaneous $D$-parity breaking on the neutrino masses. Than
we study the lepton asymmetry in various cases, from the decay of right handed
neutrino as well as the triplet Higgs, depending on their relative masses they
acquire from the symmetry breaking pattern. The leptogenesis bound on their
masses are discussed by taking into account the low energy neutrino oscillation
data. It is shown that a TeV scale leptogenesis is viable if there are
additional sources of CP violation like domain wall originating from the
spontaneous $D$-parity violation.

edge at zero. This paper identifies a pair of unitary groups that satisfy the
von Neumann--Weyl anti-commutation relations and leave invariant certain
subspaces of $L^2(0,\infty)$ which are invariant for operators with Jacobi

coefficient extracted from finite nuclei provides a constraint on the nuclear
symmetry energy. This approach also yields the neutron skin of a finite nucleus
through its relationship with the volume and surface symmetry terms and the
Coulomb energy coefficient. The description of nuclear matter from the
isoscalar and isovector components of the density dependent M3Y effective
interaction provide a value of the symmetry energy that is consistent with the
empirical value of the symmetry energy extracted from measured atomic masses
and with other modern theoretical descriptions of nuclear matter.

part of the nuclear symmetry energy, provided that both the freeze-out

represent the population structure by a contact-graph where vertices represent

representation for the mixing matrix allowing an intuitive understanding of the
mixing patterns and the analytical calculations. Using an iterative approach I
obtain recursive equations for the probability distribution of the outbreak
size as a function of time. I demonstrate that the expected outbreak size and
its progression in time are determined by the largest eigenvalue of the
reproductive number matrix and the characteristic distance between agents on
the contact-graph. Finally, I discuss the impact of intervention strategies to
halt epidemic outbreaks. This work provides both a qualitative understanding

trees covering a wide range of phylogenetic distances. Amino acid sequences
were evolved along the trees and input to the tested methods; from their
calculated distances we infered trees whose topologies we compared to the
reference trees.
  We find our pattern-based method statistically superior to all other tested
alignment-free methods on this dataset. We also demonstrate the general
advantage of alignment-free methods over an approach based on automated
alignments when sequences violate the assumption of collinearity. Similarly, we
compare methods on empirical data from an existing alignment benchmark set that
we used to derive reference distances and trees. Our pattern-based approach
yields distances that show a linear relationship to reference distances over a
substantially longer range than other alignment-free methods. The pattern-based
approach outperforms alignment-free methods and its phylogenetic accuracy is
statistically indistinguishable from alignment-based distances.

genome-based large-scale metabolic networks is essential for studying possible
relations between structure and functionality of metabolic networks.
Topological analysis of graph models has often been applied to study the
structural characteristics of complex metabolic networks.In this work,
metabolic networks of 75 organisms were investigated from a topological point
of view. Network decomposition of three microbes (Escherichia coli, Aeropyrum
pernix and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) shows that almost all of the sub-networks
exhibit a highly modularized bow-tie topological pattern similar to that of the
global metabolic networks. Moreover, these small bow-ties are hierarchically
nested into larger ones and collectively integrated into a large metabolic
network, and important features of this modularity are not observed in the
random shuffled network. In addition, such a bow-tie pattern appears to be
present in certain chemically isolated functional modules and spatially
separated modules including carbohydrate metabolism, cytosol and mitochondrion
respectively. The highly modularized bow-tie pattern is present at different
levels and scales, and in different chemical and spatial modules of metabolic
networks, which is likely the result of the evolutionary process rather than a
random accident. Identification and analysis of such a pattern is helpful for
understanding the design principles and facilitate the modelling of metabolic
networks.

  remarks","New J.Phys.8:236,2006","10.1088/1367-2630/8/10/236",,"quant-ph hep-th",,"  The Casimir effect, reflecting quantum vacuum fluctuations in the
electromagnetic field in a region with material boundaries, has been studied
both theoretically and experimentally since 1948. The forces between dielectric
and metallic surfaces both plane and curved have been measured at the 10 to 1
percent level in a variety of room-temperature experiments, and remarkable
agreement with the zero-temperature theory has been achieved. In fitting the
data various corrections due to surface roughness, patch potentials, curvature,
and temperature have been incorporated. It is the latter that is the subject of
the present article. We point out that, in fact, no temperature dependence has
yet been detected, and that the experimental situation is still too fluid to
permit conclusions about thermal corrections to the Casimir effect.
Theoretically, there are subtle issues concerning thermodynamics and
electrodynamics which have resulted in disparate predictions concerning the
nature of these corrections. However, a general consensus has seemed to emerge
that suggests that the temperature correction to the Casimir effect is
relatively large, and should be observable in future experiments involving
surfaces separated at the few micrometer scale.

effects the bound-state energy eigenvalues.

analogous inequality weaker by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$. The proof of this
``Tsirel'son inequality'' is geometrical and rests on the possibility of
associating a Hilbert space to any strongly positive quantal measure. These
results lead both to a {\it question}: ``Does a joint measure follow from some
quantal analog of `screening off'?'', and to the {\it observation} that
non-contextual hidden variables are viable in histories-based quantum
mechanics, even if they are excluded classically.
