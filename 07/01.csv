spectra of highly luminous, compact mid-infrared sources in the Large
Magellanic Cloud. Sources were selected on the basis of infrared colors and 8
micron (MSX) fluxes indicative of highly evolved, intermediate- to high-mass
stars with current or recent mass loss at large rates. We determine the
chemistry of the circumstellar envelope from the mid-IR continuum and spectral
features and classify the spectral types of the stars. In the sample of 60
sources, we find 21 Red Supergiants (RSGs), 16 C-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch
(AGB) stars, 11 HII regions, 4 likely O-rich AGB stars, 4 Galactic O-rich AGB
stars, 2 OH/IR stars, and 2 B[e] supergiants with peculiar IR spectra. We find
that the overwhelming majority of the sample AGB stars (with typical IR
luminosities ~1.0E4 L_sun) have C-rich envelopes, while the O-rich objects are
predominantly luminous RSGs with L_IR ~ 1.0E5 L_sun. We determine mean
bolometric corrections to the stellar K-band flux densities and find that for
carbon stars, the bolometric corrections depend on the infrared color, whereas
for RSGs, the bolometric correction is independent of IR color. Our results
reveal that objects previously classified as PNe on the basis of IR colors are
in fact compact HII regions with very red IRS spectra that include strong
atomic recombination lines and PAH emission features. We demonstrate that the
IRS spectral classes in our sample separate clearly in infrared color-color
diagrams that use combinations of 2MASS data and synthetic IRAC/MIPS fluxes
derived from the IRS spectra. On this basis, we suggest diagnostics to identify
and classify, with high confidence levels, IR-luminous evolved stars and HII
regions in nearby galaxies using Spitzer and near-infrared photometry.

elongated structures in a given image. The method is based on the computation
of a local estimator of the elongation. The estimation of the local elongation
proceed in two steps: first the local orientation of the structure is computed,
then in the next step, a rotation is performed, and the marginal distributions
are used to compute the elongation. This procedure allows the computation of
the local elongation at each point in the image. Then, using a threshold on the
elongation map the elongated structures are identified and re-constructed using
connectivity criteria. Finally a catalogue of elongated structures is produced,
and the properties of each object are computed, allowing the selection of
potential arc candidates. The final selection of the arc candidates is
performed by visual inspection of multi-color images of a small number of
objects. This method is a general tool that may be applied not only to
gravitational arcs, but to all problems related to the mapping and measurement
of elongated structures, in an image, or a volume.

types Sa--Sd with well-exposed broadband WFPC2 images. The detection frequency
of delineated, periodic feathers in this sample is 20% (45 of 223). This work
is consistent with Lynds (1970), who concluded that feathers are common in
prototypical Sc galaxies; we find that feathers are equally common in Sb
galaxies. Sb--Sc galaxies without clear evidence for feathers either had poorer
quality images, or flocculent or complex structure. We did not find clearly
defined feathers in any Scd--Sd galaxy. The probability of detecting feathers
was highest (83%) for spirals with well-defined primary dust lanes (PDLs; the
lanes which line the inner edge of an arm); well-defined PDLs were only noted
in Sab--Sc galaxies. Consistent with earlier work, we find that neighboring
feathers tend to have similar shapes and pitch angles. OB associations are
often found lining feathers, and many feathers transition to the stellar
substructures known as spurs (Elmegreen 1980). We find that feathers are
coincident with interarm filaments strikingly revealed in Spitzer 8 micron
images. Comparison with CO 1-0 maps of NGC 0628 and NGC 5194 from BIMA SONG
shows that feathers originate at the PDL coincident with gas surface density
peaks. Contrary to the appearance at 8 microns, the CO maps show that gas
surface density in feathers decreases rapidly with distance from the PDL. Also,
we find that the spacing between feathers decreases with increasing gas surface
density, consistent with formation via a gravitational instability.

targets in this sample is essentially constant for all targets, while the
leakage diminishes with the square of the distance. This means that the stellar
leakage has an effect on the integration time only for the nearby stars, while
for the more distant targets its influence decreases significantly. We assess
the impact of different array configurations and nulling profiles and identify
the stars for which the detection efficiency can be maximized.

with infrared data from PAIRITEL and radio to gamma-ray data from the
literature. For the first time, we can test the constancy of microphysical
parameters in the internal-external shock paradigm and carefully trace the flow
of energy from the GRB to the surrounding medium. KAIT data taken <~1 minute
after the start of GRB051111 and coinciding with the fading gamma-ray tail of
the prompt emission indicate a smooth re-injection of energy into the shock. No
color change is apparent in observations beginning ~1.5 minutes after the GRB
and lasting for the first hour after the burst. There are achromatic flux
modulations about the best-fit model at late (t~10^4 s) times, possibly due to
variations in the external density. We find that the host-galaxy extinction is
well fit by a curve similar to that ofthe Small Magellanic Cloud. Low visual
extinction, A_V~0.2 mag, combined with high column densities determined from
the X-ray and optical spectroscopy (N_H> 10^21 cm^-2), indicate a low
dust-to-metals ratio and a possible over-abundance of the light metals. An
apparent small ratio of total to selective extinction (R_V~2) argues against
dust destruction by the GRB. Time constancy of both the IR/optical/UV spectral
energy distribution and the soft X-ray absorption suggests that the absorbing
material is not local to the GRB.

the range 1e4-1e7 Msun, the relaxation induces the formation of a steep density
cusp around the MBH and strong mass segregation. Using a spherical stellar
dynamical Monte-Carlo code, we simulate the long-term relaxational evolution of

concentration of stellar black holes to the immediate vicinity of the MBH.

currently limited by speckle noise. To efficiently attenuate this noise, a
technique called simultaneous spectral differential imaging (SSDI) can be used.
This technique consists of acquiring simultaneously images of the field of view
in several adjacent narrow bands and in combining these images to suppress
speckles. Simulations predict that SSDI can achieve, with the acquisition of
three wavelengths, speckle noise attenuation of several thousands. These
simulations are usually performed using the Fraunhofer approximation, i.e.
considering that all aberrations are located in the pupil plane. We have
performed wavefront propagation simulations to evaluate how out-of-pupil-plane
aberrations affect SSDI speckle noise attenuation performance. The Talbot
formalism is used to give a physical insight of the problem; results are
confirmed using a proper wavefront propagation algorithm. We will show that
near-focal-plane aberrations can significantly reduce SSDI speckle noise
attenuation performance at several lambda/D separation. It is also shown that
the Talbot effect correctly predicts the PSF chromaticity. Both differential
atmospheric refraction effects and the use of a coronagraph will be discussed.

compare them with the observed optical flux. Then the best fit time lag and its
error are determined by chi-squared values. We find that time lags between

derivations of \mbox{{\cal A}}, is constructed. The eigenvalue equation for the
Einstein operator plays the role of the generalized Einstein's equation. The
algebra \mbox{{\cal A}}, when suitably represented in a bundle of Hilbert
spaces, is a von Neumann algebra \mathcal{M} of random operators representing
the quantum sector of the model. The Tomita-Takesaki theorem allows us to
define the dynamics of random operators which depends on the state \phi . The
same state defines the noncommutative probability measure (in the sense of
Voiculescu's free probability theory). Moreover, the state \phi satisfies the
Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition, and can be interpreted as describing a
generalized equilibrium state. By suitably averaging elements of the algebra
\mbox{{\cal A}}, one recovers the standard geometry of spacetime. We show that
any act of measurement, performed at a given spacetime point, makes the model
to collapse to the standard quantum mechanics (on the group G). As an example
we compute the noncommutative version of the closed Friedman world model.
Generalized eigenvalues of the Einstein operator produce the correct components

three distinctive signatures: a decisive power suppression at small scales,
oscillations around the scales that cross the horizon when the inflaton
potential jumps and stepwise decrease in the scalar spectral index. All three
properties result from features in the inflaton potential. Cascade inflation
realizes assisted inflation in heterotic M-theory and is driven by
non-perturbative interactions of N M5-branes. The features in the inflaton
potential are generated whenever two M5-branes collide with the boundaries. The
derived small-scale power suppression serves as a possible explanation for the
dearth of observed dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way halo. The oscillations,
furthermore, allow to directly probe M-theory by measurements of the spectral
index and to distinguish cascade inflation observationally from other string

situations where predictors and response are observed after being distorted by
a multiplicative factor. The distorting factors are unknown functions of an
observable covariate, where one specific distorting function is associated with
each predictor or response. The dependence of both response and predictors on
the same confounding covariate may alter the underlying regression relation
between undistorted but unobserved predictors and response. We consider a class
of highly flexible adjustment methods for parameter estimation in the
underlying regression model, which is the model of interest. Asymptotic
normality of the estimates is obtained by establishing a connection to varying
coefficient models. These distribution results combined with proposed
consistent estimates of the asymptotic variance are used for the construction
of asymptotic confidence intervals for the regression coefficients. The
proposed approach is illustrated with data on serum creatinine, and finite
sample properties of the proposed procedures are investigated through a
simulation study.

$t_{k+m}\neq 0$. According to B. Dubrovin \cite{D}, $M_{k,m}$ can be equipped
with a semi-simple Frobenius structure. In this paper we prove that the
corresponding descendant and ancestor potentials of $M_{k,m}$ (defined by A.
Givental) satisfy Hirota quadratic equations (HQE for short).
  Let $\mathcal{C}_{k,m}$ be the orbifold obtained from $\mathbb{P}^1$ by
cutting small discs $D_1\simeq \{|z|\leq \epsilon\}$ and
$D_2\simeq\{|z^{-1}|\leq \epsilon\}$ around $z=0$ and $z=\infty$ and gluing
back the orbifolds $D_1/\mathbb{Z}_k$ and $D_2/\mathbb{Z}_m$ in the obvious
way. We show that the orbifold quantum cohomology of $\mathcal{C}_{k,m}$
coincides with $M_{k,m}$ as Frobenius manifolds. Modulo some
yet-to-be-clarified details, this implies that the descendant (respectively the
ancestor) potential of $M_{k,m}$ is a generating function for the descendant
(respectively ancestor) orbifold Gromov--Witten invariants of
$\mathcal{C}_{k,m}$.
  There is a certain similarity between our HQE and the Lax operators of the
Extended bi-graded Toda hierarchy, introduced by G. Carlet in \cite{car}.
Therefore, it is plausible that our HQE characterize the tau-functions of this
hierarchy and we expect that the Extended bi-graded Toda hierarchy governs the
Gromov--Witten theory of $\mathcal{C}_{k,m}.$
