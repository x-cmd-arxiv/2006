are presented, obtained from day -3 to day +413 with respect to the B-band
maximum. The photometric evolution is characterised by a comparatively slow
post-maximum decline of the light curves. The peaks in redder bands are
significantly delayed relative to the bluer bands, the I-band maximum occurring
8.4 days later than that in B. With an absolute peak magnitude of -18.02 in the
V band the SN can be considered fairly bright, but not exceptional. This also
holds for the U through I bolometric light curve, where SN 2004aw has a
position intermediate between SNe 2002ap and 1998bw. Spectroscopically SN
2004aw provides a link between a normal Type Ic supernova like SN 1994I and the
group of broad-lined SNe Ic. The spectral evolution is rather slow, with a
spectrum at day +64 being still predominantly photospheric. The shape of the
nebular [O I] 6300,6364 line indicates a highly aspherical explosion. Helium
cannot be unambiguously identified in the spectra, even in the near-infrared.
Using an analytical description of the light curve peak we find that the total
mass of the ejecta in SN 2004aw is 3.5-8.0 M_Sun, significantly larger than in
SN 1994I, although not as large as in SN 1998bw. The same model suggests that
about 0.3 M_Sun of {56}Ni has been synthesised in the explosion. No connection
to a GRB can be firmly established.

likely that pions, and hence TeV neutrinos, are produced; (2) As a general
point, neutrinos should be a better probe of the highest energies than gamma
rays, due to increasing detector efficiency; and (3) For several specific
sources, the detection prospects for km^3 neutrino telescopes are very good,
about 1-10 events/year, with low atmospheric neutrino background rates above
reasonable energy thresholds. Such signal rates, as small as they may seem,
will allow neutrino telescopes to powerfully discriminate between models for
the Galactic TeV sources, with important consequences for our understanding of
cosmic-ray production.

two locally-normalized supernova spectra are presented. Locally-normalized
spectra are obtained by dividing a spectrum by the same spectrum smoothed over
a wavelength interval relatively large compared to line features, but
relatively small compared to continuum features. DIFF1 essentially measures the
mean relative difference between the line patterns of locally-normalized
spectra and DIFF2 is DIFF1 minimized by a relative logarithmic wavelength shift
between the spectra: the shift is effectively an artificial relative Doppler
shift. Both DIFF1 and DIFF2 measure the physical similarity of line formation,
and thus of supernovae. DIFF1 puts more weight on overall physical similarity
of the supernovae than DIFF2 because the DIFF2 shift compensates somewhat for
some physical distinction in the supernovae. Both tests are useful in ordering
supernovae into empirical groupings for further analysis. We present some

powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses in excess of billion
solar masses. SMBHs, therefore, seem to have already existed when the Universe
was less than 1 Gyr old, and the bulk of galaxy formation still has to take
place. We investigate in this paper to which extent accretion and dynamical
processes influence the early growth of SMBHs. We assess the impact of (i)
black hole mergers, (ii) the influence of the merging efficiency and (iii) the
negative contribution due to dynamical effects which can kick black holes out
of their host halos (gravitational recoil). We find that if accretion is always
limited by the Eddington rate via a thin disc, the maximum radiative efficiency
allowed to reproduce the LF at z=6 is of order 12%, when the adverse effect of
the gravitational recoil is taken into consideration. Dynamical effects cannot
be neglected in studies of high-redshift SMBHs. If black holes can accrete at
super-critical rate during an early phase, reproducing the observed SMBH mass
values is not an issue, even in the case that the recoil velocity is in the
upper limits range, as the mass ratios of merging binaries are skewed towards
low values, where the gravitational recoil effect is very mild. We propose that
SMBH growth at early times is very selective, and efficient only for black
holes hosted in high density peak halos.

function in low-mass star-forming regions is typically best fit by a lognormal
distribution, while that in high-mass star-forming regions is better fit by a
double power law. A single power law clump mass distribution is ruled out in
all cases. Fitting all of the regions with a double power law, we find the mean
power law exponent at the high-mass end of each mass function is alpha_high =
-2.4+/-0.1, consistent with the Salpeter result of alpha = -2.35. We find no
region-to-region trend in alpha_high with the mass scale of the clumps in a
given region, as characterized by their median mass. Similarly, non
non-parametric tests show that the shape of the clump mass function does not
change much from region to region, despite the obvious changes in the intrinsic
mass scale. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that the clump mass
distribution is determined by a highly stochastic process, such as turbulent
fragmentation. It may also suggest that the data reduction and analysis
techniques strongly affect the shape of the derived mass function.

  content from the previous one",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We study the stability of a spherically symmetric density profile. We analyze
the case of a collisionless system with a power-law profile given by rho propto
r^-alpha, in the Newtonian regime using the Jeans equation. The Jeans equation
is mathematically identical to the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium as long
as p_J = rho sigma^2 is regarded as the pressure counterpart for ordinary gas,
where sigma is the local velocity dispersion. Since a self-gravitating
collisionless system is at best metastable, if it is treated statistical
mechanically, the dynamical equilibrium described by the Jeans equation will
have a shorter life time than the thermodynamically stable equilibrium for
ordinary gas. Here we take a heuristic approach, using the pressure
counterpart, p_J. From the requirement that p_J > 0 or the normalcy of the
formal EOS, p_J = p_J(rho) obtained by eliminating r, we find the following
heuristic stability criterion. For 0 < alpha < 1, p_J < 0, the density profile
is unstable. We interpret this profile to be a transient one evolving toward a
flat-top profile, which seems to be the final product with absolute stability.
For 1<alpha <3, the profile is dynamically stable. It is an interesting
coincidence that dark matter halo profiles obtained by cosmological N-body
simulations, fall into this category. For 3<alpha, p_J<0. We suspect that such
a steep profile is in the process of collapsing toward r=0.

significantly ``contaminated'' by the FIR emission from background galaxies. We

linear correlation of the radial extent of gaseous halos on the size of the
actively star-forming parts of the galaxy disks. Data of a larger sample of 22
galaxies indicate that the threshold energy input rate into the disk ISM per
unit surface area for the creation of a gaseous halo depends on the mass
surface density of the galaxy, in the sense that a higher threshold must be
surpassed for galaxies with a higher surface density. Because of the good
prediction of the existence of a radio halo from these two parameters, we
conclude that they are important, albeit not the only contributors. The
compactness of the SF-related energy input is also found to be a relevant
factor. Galaxies with relatively compact SF distributions are more likely to
have gaseous halos than others with more widespread SF activity. These results
quantify the so-called ""break-out"" condition for matter to escape from galaxy
disks, as used in all current models of the interstellar medium and first

  We propose that the optical (g-r) colour and infrared log(L_{24}/L_{3.6})

ratio. The (g-r) colour is found to be sensitive to the bulge-to-disk ratio for
disk-dominated galaxies, whereas the log(L_{24}/L_{3.6}) colour is more
sensitive for bulge-dominated systems.
  We identify ~18% (195 sources) of our sample as having red optical colours
and infrared excess. Typically, the infrared luminosities of these galaxies are
found to be at the high end of star-forming galaxies with blue optical colours.
Using emission line diagnostic diagrams, 78 are found to have an AGN
contribution, and 117 are identified as star-forming systems. The red (g-r)
colour of the star-forming galaxies could be explained by extinction. However,
their high optical luminosities cannot. We conclude that they have a
significant bulge component.

correspond to ~13% of the total number density of our sample. In addition,
these systems contribute ~13% of the total optical luminosity density, and 28%

Our study is motivated by the possibility that the gravitational-wave driven

neutron stars, eg. in low-mass X-ray binaries, and the fact that a viscous
Ekman layer at the core-crust interface provides an efficient damping mechanism
for these oscillations. We review various approaches to the problem and carry
out an analytic calculation of the effects due to the Ekman layer for a rigid
crust. Our analytic estimates support previous numerical results, and provide
further insight into the intricacies of the problem. We add to previous work by
discussing the effect that compressibility and composition stratification have
on the boundary layer damping. We show that, while stratification is
unimportant for the r-mode problem, composition suppresses the damping rate by
about a factor of two (depending on the detailed equation of state).

X-ray spectral fits with thermal models. In four cases the redshift is
consistent with z=0.4. We have computed the angular correlation function of the
sources in the S and H bands, finding best fit correlation angles
theta_0=5.2+/-3.8 arcsec and theta_0=12.8+/-7.8 arcsec respectively. A rough
estimate of the present-day correlation length r_0 can be obtained inverting

of extinction. A visual search of a ~30 square-degree area centered on this
radio galaxy on images of the NIR DENIS survey (IJK) revealed 83 galaxies
(including two AGNs) and 39 possible candidates. Of these, 49 are also listed
in the 2MASS Extended Source Catalog 2MASX. Taking the IRAS/DIRBE extinction
values (Schlegel et al. 1998) at face value, the absorption in the optical

detections with other systematic surveys, we conclude that this search is
highly complete up to the detection limits of the DENIS survey and certainly
surpasses any automatic galaxy finding algorithm applied to crowded areas. The
NIR galaxy colours from the 7"" aperture were used as a probe to measure total
Galactic extinction. A comparison with the IRAS/DIRBE Galactic reddening maps
suggests that the IRAS/DIRBE values result in a slight overestimate of the true
extinction at such low Galactic latitudes; the inferred extinction from the
galaxy colours corresponds to about 87% of the IRAS/DIRBE extinctions. Although
this determination still shows some scatter, it proves the usefulness of NIR
surveys for calibrating the IRAS/DIRBE maps in the extinction range of 2m < A_B

region of the merging galaxy cluster A3921 (z=0.094). We investigated the
effects of the major merger between two sub-clusters on the star formation (SF)
and radio emission properties of the confirmed cluster members. The origin of
SF and the nature of radio emission in cluster galaxies was investigated by
comparing their radio, optical and X-ray properties. We also compared the radio
source counts and the percentage of detected radio galaxies with literature
data. We detected 17 radio sources above the flux density limit of 0.25
mJy/beam in the central field of A3921, among which 7 are cluster members. 9
galaxies with star-forming optical spectra were observed in the collision
region of the merging sub-clusters. They were not detected at radio
wavelengths, giving upper limits for their star formation rate significantly
lower than those typically found in late-type, field galaxies. Most of these
star-forming objects are therefore really located in the high density part of
the cluster, and they are not infalling field objects seen in projection at the
cluster centre. Their SF episode is probably related to the cluster collision
that we observe in its very central phase. None of the galaxies with
post-starburst optical spectra was detected down our 2$\sigma$ flux density
limit, confirming that they are post-starburst and not dusty star-forming
objects. We finally detected a narrow-angle tail (NAT) source associated with
the second brightest cluster galaxy (BG2), whose diffuse component is a partly
detached pair of tails from an earlier period of activity of the BG2 galaxy.

so that the energy route to thermodynamics becomes useless. This problem can be
avoided by taking an interaction potential that reduces to the HS one in
certain limits. In this paper the square-shoulder (SS) potential characterized
by a hard-core diameter $\sigma'$, a soft-core diameter $\sigma>\sigma'$ and a
shoulder height $\epsilon$ is considered. The SS potential becomes the HS one
if (i) $\epsilon\to 0$, or (ii) $\epsilon\to\infty$, or (iii)
$\sigma'\to\sigma$ or (iv) $\sigma'\to 0$ and $\epsilon\to\infty$. The
energy-route equation of state for the HS fluid is obtained in terms of the
radial distribution function for the SS fluid by taking the limits (i) and
(ii). This equation of state is shown to exhibit, in general, an artificial
dependence on the diameter ratio $\sigma'/\sigma$. If furthermore the limit
$\sigma'/\sigma\to 1$ is taken, the resulting equation of state for HS
coincides with that obtained through the virial route. The necessary and

properties of metallic atomic-sized contacts. These histograms show a peak
structure, which is characteristic of the type of metal under investigation.
Despite the enormous progress in the understanding of the electronic transport
in metallic nanowires, the origin of this peak structure is still a basic open
problem. In the present work we tackle this issue, extending our theoretical
analysis of Au conductance histograms [Dreher et al., PRB 72, 075435 (2005)] to
different types of metals, namely, Ag, Pt and ferromagnetic Ni. We combine
classical molecular dynamics simulations of the breaking of nanocontacts with
conductance calculations based on a tight-binding model. This combination gives
us access to crucial information such as contact geometries, strain forces,
minimum cross-sections, the conductance, transmissions of the individual
conduction channels and, in the case of Ni, the spin polarization of the
current. We shall also briefly discuss investigations of Al atomic-sized
contacts. From our analysis we conclude that the differences in the histograms
of these metals are due to (i) the very different electronic structures, which
means different atomic orbitals contributing to the transport, and (ii) the
different mechanical properties, which in a case like Pt lead to the formation
of special structures, namely monoatomic chains. Of particular interest are
results for Ni that indicate the absence of any conductance quantization, and
show how the current polarization evolves (including large fluctuations) from
negative values in thick contacts to even positive values in the tunneling
regime after rupture of the contact. Finally, we also present a detailed
analysis of the breaking forces of these metallic contacts.

that magnetic excitations play a fundamental role in the superconducting

are doped into the antiferromagnetic parent compounds. Indeed, a sharp magnetic
excitation termed ""resonance"" has been observed by neutron scattering in a
number of hole-doped materials. The resonance is intimately related to
superconductivity, and its interaction with charged quasi-particles observed by
photoemission, optical conductivity, and tunneling suggests that it plays a
similar role as phonons in conventional superconductors. However, the relevance
of the resonance to high-Tc superconductivity has been in doubt because so far
it has been found only in hole-doped materials. Here we report the discovery of
the resonance in electron-doped superconducting Pr0.88LaCe0.12CuO(4-delta) (Tc

5.8kBTc (kB is the Boltzmann's constant) for all high-Tc superconductors

vector tau = (0,1/2, 1/2), corresponding to a parallel spin alignment along the

  A finite Knight shift at the $^{125}$Te site was observed for pure
Na2Cu2TeO6.
  The negative hyperfine coupling constant $^{125}A_{tr}$ is an evidence for
the existence of a superexchange pathway of the Cu-O-Te-O-Cu bond. It turned
out that both the Na deficiency and Zn impurities induce a Curie-type magnetism
in the uniform spin susceptibility in an external magnetic field of 1 T, but
only the Zn impurities enhance the low-temperature $^{23}$Na nuclear
spin-lattice relaxation rate whereas the Na deficiency suppresses it. A spin
glass behavior was observed for the Na-deficient samples but not for the
Zn-substituted samples. The dynamics of the unpaired moments of the doped holes
are different from that of the spin vacancy in the spin-gapped Cu2TeO6 planes.

to the analysis of associated magnetic and superconducting instabilities. In
addititon quantum phase transitions are investigated. Special emphasis is given
to the partial localisation of 5f electrons in U compounds and its consequences
for unconventional superconductivity. Wigner crystallisation in the homogeneous
electron gas and its generalisation to 4f pnictide and 3d oxide materials is
covered extensively. We analyse simultaneous charge order and lattice
instabilities in geometrically frustrated V-oxide spinels. Using a spinless
fermion model we also discuss the emergence of fractional charges in the
frustrated pyrochlore or checkerboard lattice. Finally we focus on the
signature of strong electronic correlations in high-energy excitations.

retrieval. It has also been applied as a model of cognitive processing and
word-meaning acquisition. This dual importance of LSA derives from its capacity
to modulate the meaning of words by contexts, dealing successfully with
polysemy and synonymy. The underlying reasons that make the method work are not
clear enough. We propose that the method works because it detects an underlying
block structure (the blocks corresponding to topics) in the term by document
matrix. In real cases this block structure is hidden because of perturbations.
We propose that the correct explanation for LSA must be searched in the
structure of singular vectors rather than in the profile of singular values.
Using Perron-Frobenius theory we show that the presence of disjoint blocks of
documents is marked by sign-homogeneous entries in the vectors corresponding to
the documents of one block and zeros elsewhere. In the case of nearly disjoint
blocks, perturbation theory shows that if the perturbations are small the zeros
in the leading vectors are replaced by small numbers (pseudo-zeros). Since the
singular values of each block might be very different in magnitude, their order
does not mirror the order of blocks. When the norms of the blocks are similar,
LSA works fine, but we propose that when the topics have different sizes, the
usual procedure of selecting the first k singular triplets (k being the number
of blocks) should be replaced by a method that selects the perturbed Perron
vectors for each block.

isotropic fluid spheres have been developed over the last five years. A
different and somewhat simpler algorithm is discussed here, as well as
algorithms for anisotropic fluid spheres. The second and third problems are
somewhat more speculative in nature and address the nature of black hole
entropy. Specifically, the second problem looks at the genericity of the
so-called quasinormal mode conjecture introduced by Hod, while the third
problem looks at the near-horizon structure of a black hole in hope of gaining
an understanding of why so many different approaches yield the same entropy. A
method of finding the asymptotic QNM structure is found based on the Born
series, and serious problems for the QNM conjecture are discussed. The work in
this thesis does not completely discount the possibility that the QNM
conjecture is true. New results released weeks before this thesis was finished
showed that the QNM conjecture was flawed. Finally, the near-horizon structure
of a black hole is found to be very restricted, adding credence to the ideas
put forward by Carlip and Solodukhin that the black hole entropy is related to
an inherited symmetry from the classical theory.

When $J_p=0$, by means of a construction of a special class of limiting Gibbs
measures, it is shown how these equations are related with the surface energy
of the Hamiltonian. This relation reduces the problem of describing the limit
Gibbs measures to find of solutions of a nonlinear functional equation.
Moreover, the set of ground states of the one-level model is completely
described. Using this fact, one finds Gibbs measures (pure phases) associated
with the translation-invariant ground states. The critical temperature is
exactly found and the phase diagram is presented. The free energies

stability of linear time-delay systems by computing solutions to an
operator-theoretic version of the Lyapunov inequality via semidefinite

overconvergent Shintani lifting. The classical Shintani map is the

space of cusp forms of half-integral weight. Glenn Stevens proved in [St1] that
there is Lamda-adic lifting of this map to the Hida family of ordinary cusp
forms of integral weight and consequently constructed Lamda-adic modular eigen
form of half-integral weight. The natural thing to do is generalizing his
result to non-ordinary finite slope case, i.e. Coleman p-adic analytic family
of overconvergent cusp forms of finite slope. For this we will use a slope h
decomposition of compact supported cohomology with values in overconvergent
distribution, which can be interpreted as a cohomological description of
Coleman p-adic family, and define the p-adic Hecke algebra for the slope h part
of this cohomology. Then we follow the idea of [St1] in the ordinary case. We
also describe Hecke operators explicitly on q-expansion of universal

stratified, two-dimensional flow governed by the Boussinesq equations. As is
known, intially smooth density (or temperature) profiles develop into fronts in
the very early stages of evolution. This results in a frontally dominated
$k^{-1}$ potential energy spectrum. The fronts, initially characterized by a
relatively simple geometry, spontaneously develop into severely distorted
sheets that possess structure at very fine scales, and thus there is a transfer
of energy from large to small scales. It is shown here that this process
culminates in the establishment of a $k^{-5/3}$ kinetic energy spectrum,
although its scaling extends over a shorter range as compared to the $k^{-1}$
scaling of the potential energy spectrum. The establishment of the kinetic
energy scaling signals the onset of enstrophy decay which proceeds in a mildly
modulated exponential manner and possesses a novel self-similarity.
Specifically, the self-similarity is seen in the time invariant nature of the
probability density function (\pdf{}) associated with the normalized vorticity
field. Given the rapid decay of energy at this stage, the spectral scaling is
transient and fades with the emergence of a smooth, large-scale, very slowly
decaying, (almost) vertically sheared horizontal mode with most of its energy
in the potential component -- i.e. the Pearson-Linden regime.

hypotheses target the core-mantle boundary (CMB) as a major source of natural
radionuclides and therefore of radiogenic heat. A typical scale of the
processes that take place at the CMB is about 200km. To observe these processes
from the surface requires an angular resolution of about 3 degrees. EARTH aims
at creating a high-resolution 3D-map of the radiogenic heat sources in the
interior of the Earth. It will thereby contribute to a better understanding of
a number of geophysical phenomena observed at the surface of the Earth. This
condition requires a completely different approach from the monolithic detector
systems as e.g. KamLAND.

physics, the estimated count rates, and the first initial results from Monte
Carlo simulations and laboratory experiments. The Monte Carlo simulations
indicate that the large volume telescope should consist of detector modules
each comprising a very large number of detector units, with a cross section of
roughly a few square centimetres. The signature of an antineutrino event will
be a double pulse event. One pulse arises from the slowing down of the emitted
positron, the other from the neutron capture. In laboratory experiments small

becomes proportional to the barrier width. Taking the point of view that
complex potentials imply non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and are as such fraught
with conceptual pit-falls particularly in connection to problems involving time
evolution, we have constructed a two-channel model which does not suffer from
such maladies in order to examine this issue. We find that the conclusions
arrived at by the earlier authors need to be qualified.

additive and convex. Our bound can be interpreted as the capacity of a channel
for high-fidelity quantum communication when assisted by a family of channels
that have no capacity on their own. This family of assistance channels, which
we call symmetric side channels, consists of all channels mapping symmetrically
to their output and environment. The bound seems to be quite tight, and for
degradable quantum channels it coincides with the unassisted channel capacity.
Using this symmetric side channel capacity, we find new upper bounds on the
capacity of the depolarizing channel. We also briefly indicate an analogous
notion for distilling entanglement using the same class of (one-way) channels,
yielding one of the few entanglement measures that is monotonic under local
operations with one-way classical communication (1-LOCC), but not under the
more general class of local operations with classical communication (LOCC).

and associated wavefunctions) are obtained if some potential parameters are
assigned specific values. We introduce a new class in which exact solutions are
obtained at a given energy for a special set of values of the potential
parameters. To obtain a larger solution space one varies the energy over a
discrete set (the spectrum). A unified treatment that includes the standard as
well as the new class of quasi-exactly solvable problems is presented and few
examples (some of which are new) are given. The solution space is spanned by
discrete square integrable basis functions in which the matrix representation
of the Hamiltonian is tridiagonal. Imposing quasi-exact solvability constraints
result in a complete reduction of the representation into the direct sum of a
finite and infinite component. The finite is real and exactly solvable, whereas
the infinite is complex and associated with zero norm states. Consequently, the
whole physical space contracts to a finite dimensional subspace with
normalizable states.

Our scheme is achieved without any type of measurement, does not use the cavity
mode as the data bus and only requires a very short resonant interaction of the
SQUID-cavity system. As an application of the QCPG operation, we also propose a
scheme for generating the cluster states of many SQUIDs.
