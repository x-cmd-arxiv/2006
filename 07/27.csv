would have been classified as 'dark' in the absence of deep, rapid ground-based
optical imaging with the 2-m robotic Faulkes Telesscope (FTN). Our
multiwavelength analysis reveals an X-ray light curve typical of many Swift
long GRBs (3-segments plus flare). Its optical afterglow, however, was already
fainter than the detection limit of the UVOT within 100s of the burst. Optical
imaging in BVRi' filters with the FTN began 2.75 minutes after the burst and
resulted in the detection of the optical afterglow at 5.3 minutes, with a UKIRT
K-band identification at ~45 mins. R and i'-band light curves are consistent
with a single power law decay in flux, F(t) prop t^-a where a=0.43+/-0.08, or a
2-segment light curve with a steep decay a_1 <0.88, flattening to a_2 ~ 0.31,
with evidence for rebrightening at i' band. Deep VLT R-band imaging at ~12 days
reveals a faint, extended object (R ~23.5 mag) at the location of the
afterglow. Although the brightness is compatible with the extrapolation of the
a_2 slow decay, significant flux is likely due to a host galaxy. This implies
that the optical light curve had a break before 12 days, akin to what observed
in the X-rays. We derive a maximum photometric redshift z<3.2 for GRB 060108
and a best-fitting optical-to-X-ray SED at 1000 s after the burst consistent
with a power law with index beta_OX = 0.54 and a small amount of extinction.
The unambiguous detection at B-band and the derived photometric redshift rule
out a high redshift as the reason for the optical faintness of GRB 060108.
Instead, the hard opt/X-ray spectral index confirms it as one of the
optically-darkest bursts detected and with modest host extinction explains the
UVOT non-detection (abridged).

kpc bubbles to ~1.5 kpc bubbles lying nearly orthogonal to them and a ~1 kpc
radio jet lying orthogonal to the kpc-scale bubble. To explain the complex
morphology, we first consider a scenario in which the radio structures are the
result of superwinds ejected by a nuclear starburst. However, recent Spitzer
observations of Mrk 6 provide an upper limit to the star formation rate (SFR)
of ~5.5 M_sun/yr, an estimate much lower than the SFR of ~33 M_sun/yr derived
assuming that the bubbles are a result of starburst winds energized by
supernovae explosions. Thus, a starburst alone cannot meet the energy
requirements for the creation of the bubbles in Mrk 6. We show that a single
plasmon model is energetically infeasible, and we argue that a jet-driven
bubble model while energetically feasible does not produce the complex radio
morphologies. Finally, we consider a model in which the complex radio structure
is a result of an episodically-powered precessing jet that changes its
orientation. This model is the most attractive as it can naturally explain the
complex radio morphology, and is consistent with the energetics, the spectral
index and the polarization structure. Radio emission in this scenario is a
short-lived phenomenon in the lifetime of a Seyfert galaxy which results due to
an accretion event.

estimate the effects of improving the CMB parameters and H_0 on the EOS of Dark
Energy (DE). First we assume that the additional data does not improve
significantly, but decrease the error on H_0 by a factor <~10. Second, we allow
improved additional data but current H_0 errors (i.e., the DE Task Force case).
In the 1st scenario, improvements of the CMB parameters hardly change the
accuracy of the EOS and Omega_tot, unless H_0 can be measured with an accuracy
of a few %. We find that a combination of moderate improvements for both H_0
and other data significantly constrains the evolution of dark energy, but at a
reduced cost. We review several methods (and their strengths and weaknesses)
that might yield extra-galactic distances with errors of about 1%. We review:
the Velocity Field method, two Maser methods, two Light Echo techniques, the
Binary Star method, and the Rotational Parallax (RP) technique. Because these
methods substantially rely on geometry rather than astrophysics or cosmology,
their results are quite robust. We focus on the advantages of the RP technique
which can provide single-step, bias-free distances to nearby spirals. These
distances can be used to improve the zero-point for other methods which in turn
allow for a much improved H_0 errors. Achieving an accuracy of ~2% in the

a quick decrease in the wind mass-loss rate. The nova evolutions are
approximately scaled by the time of break. Once the time of break is

star X-ray binary Circinus X-1 made at 1.4 and 2.5 GHz with the Australia

be seen as a result of the interaction between the jet from the system and the
interstellar medium and it is likely that we are actually looking toward the
central X-ray binary system through the jet-powered radio lobe. The study of
the nebula thus offers a unique opportunity to estimate for the first time
using calorimetry the energetics of a jet from an object clearly identified as
a neutron star. An extensive discussion on the energetics of the complex is
presented: a first approach is based on the minimum energy estimation, while a
second one employs a self-similar model of the interaction between the jets and
the surrounding medium. The results suggest an age for the nebula of \leq 10^5
years and a corresponding time-averaged jet power \geq 10^{35} erg s^{-1}.
During periodic flaring episodes, the instantaneous jet power may reach values
of similar magnitude to the X-ray luminosity.

located behind the first intersection with the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm

arm at a distance of 3-4 kpc. The spectra obtained with UVES on the Very Large
Telescope (VLT) cover a full orbit of the system, including periastron passage,
from which we derive the radial-velocity curve of the B hypergiant. The
measured radial-velocity amplitude is 10 +/-3 km/s yielding a mass ratio q =
0.046 +/- 0.014. The absence of an X-ray eclipse results in a lower limit to
the mass of Wray 977 of 39 Msun. An upper limit of 53 Msun is derived for the
mass of Wray 977 adopting a maximum neutron star mass of 2.5 Msun. The
``spectroscopic'' mass of Wray 977 is 43 +/- 10 Msun, consistent with the range
in mass derived from the binarity constraints. The mass of the neutron star is
1.85 +/- 0.6 Msun. Time series of spectral lines formed in the dense stellar
wind indicate the presence of a gas stream trailing the neutron star in its
orbit. The long-term behaviour of the H alpha equivalent width exhibits strong
variations in wind strength; the sampling of the data is insufficient to
conclude whether a relation exists between wind mass-loss rate and pulsar spin
period.

(tau=0.1, which corresponds to 0.1% of the total dust mass), hot (T~400K)
non-grey component close to the starburst (scale size 10pc) and a large scale,
colder grey component (100pc, 75K) with a much larger column (tau=10). The
simulations also show that starburst galaxies can be powered by massive star
formation. The parameters for this star forming region are difficult to
determine, since the IR continuum luminosity is only sensitive to the total UV
input. Therefore, there is a degeneracy between the total starburst mass and
the initial mass function (IMF) slope. A less massive star formation with a
shallower IMF will produce the same amount of OB stars and therefore the same
amount of irradiating UV flux. Assuming the stars are formed according to a
Salpeter IMF (Psi(M) ~ M^-2.35), the star formation region should produce 10^9
Msun of stars (either in one instantaneous burst, or in a continuous process)

density reached a maximum value and then monotonically and slowly decreased

phosphorus atoms the calculated dependencies of carrier concentration agree
well with the experimental data for both temperatures regardless of the

band superconductor in which the bands' contributions to the Fermi surface have
very different topologies. We calculate $\sigma(\omega)$ by calculating a
memory function which has been recently used to analyze $\sigma(\omega)$ of
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$. In our calculations the two components of
the Fermi surface are described by parameterizations of de Haas--van Alphen
data. We use a phonon spectrum which is a fit to neutron scattering data. By
including the momentum dependence of the Fermi surface good agreement is found
with the experimentally determined strong-coupling features which can be
described by a broad peak at around 4.5 meV and a narrower higher peak around 8
meV of equal height. The calculated features are found to be dominated by
scattering between states within the third band. By contrast scattering between
states in the second band leads to strong-coupling features in which the height
of the high energy peak is reduced by $\sim 50%$ compared to that of the low
energy peak. This result is similar to that in the conventional isotropic
(momentum independent) treatment of superconductivity. Our results show that it
is important to use realistic models of the bandstructure and phonons, and to
avoid using momentum averaged quantities, in calculations in order to get
quantitatively accurate results.

The analysis first discusses the whole series of isolated MCp$_2$ molecules,
where M = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, and Os. The series presents a rich range
of electronic and magnetic behaviors due to the interplay between the crystal
field interaction and Hund's rules, as the occupation of the $d$ shell
increases. The article then shows how many of these interesting properties can
also be seen when MCp$_2$ molecules are linked together to form periodic
chains. It is argued that encapsulation of the chains inside carbon nanotubes,
that is exothermic for radii larger than 4.5 \AA, provides the missing
mechanical stability and electrical isolation. The structural stability, charge
transfer, magnetic and electronic behavior of the ensuing chains, as well as
the modification of the electrostatic potential in the nanotube wall produced
by the metallocenes as thoroughly discussed. We argue that the full devices can
be characterized by two doped, strongly correlated Hubbard models whose mutual
hybridization is almost negligible. The charge transferred from the chains
produces a strong modification of the electrostatic potential in the nanotube
walls, which is amplified in case of semiconducting and endothermic nanotubes.

employing quantum physics in technology. Ultra-cold atom gases have opened an
exciting laboratory in which to explore many-particle systems that are not
accessible in conventional atomic or solid state physics. It appears promising
that optical trapping of cold bosonic or fermionic atoms will make construction
of devices with unprecedented precision possible in the future, thereby
allowing experimenters to make their samples much more ""clean"", and hence more
coherent. Trapped atomic quantum gases may thus provide an interesting
alternative to the quantum dot nanostructures produced today. Optical lattices
created by standing laser waves loaded with ultra-cold atoms are an example of
this. They provide a unique experimental setup to study artificial crystal
structures with tunable physical parameters. Here we demonstrate that a
two-dimensional optical lattice loaded with repulsive, contact-interacting
fermions shows a rich and systematic magnetic phase diagram. Trapping a few (N
=< 12) fermions in each of the single-site minima of the optical lattice, we
find that the em shell structure in these quantum wells determines the
magnetism. In a shallow lattice, the tunneling between the lattice sites is
strong, and the lattice is non-magnetic. For deeper lattices, however, the
shell-filling of the single wells with fermionic atoms determines the
magnetism. As a consequence of Hund's first rule, the interaction energy is
lowered by maximizing the number of atoms of the same species. This leads to a
systematic sequence of non-magnetic, ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
phases.

other hand, when the width of the input pulses is small, the generated pulse
train exhibits much lower frequencies, analogous to those observed in the motor
neural system. Our experimental set up allows us to explore, systematically and
continuously, the transition between these two regimes, while at the same time
demonstrate that coincidence detection in quadratic nonlinear systems has
functionalities similar to those observed in the nervous system.

$F$- and a $H$-center. In well agreement with common understanding the
$F$-center results in being accompanied by a small lattice distortion whereas
the $H$-center is accompanied by a very large lattice deformation. Opposite to
the common understanding the additional positive charge in the charge center
results rather to be localized on a F$_4^{3-}$ complex than on a
F$_2^-$-complex. From the ground states of the charge centers we derive binding
energies, diffusion barriers and agglomeration energies for $M$-center
formation. These microscopic quantities are of fundamental interest to
understand the dynamic processes which are initiated if the crystals interact
with extreme intense deep ultra violet radiation. We further derive the

better performance than suggested by the proofs in Tardos' original paper. In
particular, the length of the codewords can be significantly reduced.
  First we generalize the proofs of the false positive and false negative error
probabilities with the following modifications: (1) we replace Tardos'
hard-coded numbers by variables and (2) we allow for independently chosen false
positive and false negative error rates. It turns out that all the
collusion-resistance properties can still be proven when the code length is
reduced by a factor of more than 2.

colluder strategy forces the content owner to employ the longest code. Using a
gaussian approximation for the probability density functions of the
accusations, we show that the required false negative and false positive error
rate can be achieved with codes that are a factor 2 shorter than required for

principle and formulated in the Einstein conformal frame yield a cosmological
term which varies with time. Moreover, they break the conservation of the
energy--momentum tensor for matter, generating the interaction between matter
and dark energy. Unlike phenomenological models of interacting dark energy,
$f(R)$ gravity derives such an interaction from a covariant Lagrangian which is
a function of a relativistically invariant quantity (the curvature scalar $R$).
We derive the expressions for the quantities describing this interaction in
terms of an arbitrary function $f(R)$, and examine how the simplest
phenomenological models of a variable cosmological constant are related to
$f(R)$ gravity. Particularly, we show that $\Lambda c^2=H^2(1-2q)$ for a flat,
homogeneous and isotropic, pressureless universe. For the Lagrangian of form
$R-1/R$, which is the simplest way of introducing current cosmic acceleration
in $f(R)$ gravity, the predicted matter--dark energy interaction rate changes

that, if the properties of the $\kappa$-Minkowski differential calculus are

energy-momentum charges. Our derivation also exposes the fact that an apparent
source of physical ambiguity in the description of the Hopf-algebra rules of

choice of conventions and in particular does not affect the formulas for the

are in the Higgs phase, we find domain walls (kinks) and vortices as the only
elementary solitons. Stable monopoles and instantons can exist as composite
solitons with vortices attached. Webs of walls are also found as another
composite soliton. The moduli space of all these elementary as well as
composite solitons are found in terms of the moduli matrix. The total moduli
space of walls is given by the complex Grassmann manifold SU(Nf)/[SU(Nc)x
SU(Nf-Nc) x U(1)] and is decomposed into various topological sectors
corresponding to boundary conditions specified by particular vacua. We found
charges characterizing composite solitons contribute negatively (either
positively or negatively) in Abelian (non-Abelian) gauge theories. Effective
Lagrangians are constructed on walls and vortices in a compact form. The power

parameter equal to the ratio of the electron and ion masses. If the magnetic
field is not nearly perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation, this
allows us to use a multiple-scale expansion to demonstrate the existence and
nature of nonlinear wave solutions. Such solutions are found to have a rapid
oscillation of constant amplitude superimposed on the underlying large-scale
variation. The approximate equations for the large-scale variation are obtained
by making an adiabatic approximation and in one limit, new explicit solitary
pulse solutions are found. In the case of a perpendicular magnetic field,
conditions for the existence of solitary pulses are derived. Our results are

full-wave simulations of the cylindrical version of this cloaking structure
using ideal and nonideal (but physically realizable) electromagnetic parameters
in an effort to understand the challenges of realizing such a structure in
practice. The simulations indicate that the performance of the electromagnetic
cloaking structure is not especially sensitive to modest permittivity and
permeability variations. This is in contrast to other applications of
engineered electromagnetic materials, such as subwavelength focusing using
negative refractive index materials. The cloaking performance degrades smoothly
with increasing loss, and effective low-reflection shielding can be achieved
with a cylindrical shell composed of an eight (homogeneous) layer approximation
of the ideal continuous medium.

when making decisions to go by their daily lives. These decisions affect their
fitness and there is therefore an evolutionary pressure to try making the right
choices. In many instances individuals will make their own choices and the
behaviour of the group will be a democratic integration of all decisions.
However, in some instances it can be advantageous to follow the choice of a few
individuals in the group if they have more information regarding the situation
that has arisen. Here I provide early evidence that decisions about shifts in
activity states in a population of bottlenose dolphin follow such a decision
making process. This unshared consensus is mediated by a non-vocal signal which
can be communicated globally within the dolphin school. These signals are
emitted by individuals that tend to have more information about the behaviour
of potential competitors because of their position in the social network. I
hypothesise that this decision making process emerged from the social structure
of the population and the need to maintain mixed-sex schools.

Archaeological evidence, radiocarbon dates and genetic markers are consistent
with the spread of farming from a source in the Near East. However, farming was
less important in the East; the Eastern and Western Neolithic have distinct
signatures. We use a population dynamics model to suggest that this distinction
can be attributed to the presence of two waves of advance, one from the Near
East, and another through Eastern Europe. Thus, we provide a quantitative
