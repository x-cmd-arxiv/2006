R_e ~ L^0.88, is steeper than that for the bulk of the early-type galaxy
population, for which R_e ~ L^0.68. In addition, although BCGs are hardly
offset from the Fundamental Plane defined by the bulk of the early-type
population, they show considerably smaller scatter. The larger than expected
sizes of BCGs, and the increased homogeneity, are qualitatively consistent with
models which seek to explain the colors of the most massive galaxies by
invoking dry dissipationless mergers, since dissipation tends to reduce the
sizes of galaxies, and wet mergers which result in star formation would tend to
increase the scatter in luminosity at fixed size and velocity dispersion.
Furthermore, BCGs define the same g-r color-magnitude relation as the bulk of
the early-type population. If BCGs formed from dry mergers, then BCG
progenitors must have been red for their magnitudes, suggesting that they
hosted older stellar populations than typical for their luminosities. Our
findings have two other consequences. First, the R_e-L relation of the
early-type galaxy population as a whole (i.e., normal plus BCG) exhibits some
curvature. Some of this curvature must be a consequence of the fact that an
increasing fraction of the most luminous galaxies are BCGs. The second
consequence is suggested by the fact that, despite following a steeper
size-luminosity relation, BCGs tend to define a tight relation between
dynamical mass R_e sigma^2/G and luminosity. As consequence, we find that BCGs
define a shallower sigma-L relation than the bulk of the early-type galaxy
population.

analysis of the H$\alpha$ emission line yields the first radial velocity
solution for EF Eri, leading to a spectroscopic ephemeris for the binary and,
using the best available white dwarf mass of 0.6M${\odot}$, a mass estimate for
the secondary of 0.055M${\odot}$. For a white dwarf mass of 0.95M${\odot}$, the
average for magnetic white dwarfs, the secondary mass increases to
0.087M${\odot}$. At EF Eri's orbital period of 81 minutes, this higher mass
secondary could not be a normal star and still fit within the Roche lobe. The
source of the Balmer and other emission lines is confirmed to be from the
sub-stellar secondary and we argue that it is due to stellar activity. We
compare EF Eri's emission line spectrum and activity behavior to that recently
observed in AM Her and VV Pup and attributed to stellar activity. We explore
observations and models originally developed for V471 Tau, for the RS CVn

secondary in EF Eri and similar systems is unlikely and, in polars, the
magnetic field interaction between the two stars (with a possible tidal

activity on the secondary near the sub-stellar point of the white dwarf.

help to constrain the origin of the radio emission in such faint radio sources
and may be fundamental in understanding eventual links to the optical light. We
study the spectral index behaviour of sources that were found in the 1.4 GHz

Array we observed at 5 GHz part of the region covered by the sub-mJy ATESP
survey. In particular we imaged a one square degree area for which deep optical
imaging in UBVRIJK is available. In this paper we present the 5 GHz survey and

properties of the sample will be the subject of a following paper. The 5 GHz
survey has produced a catalogue of 111 radio sources, complete down to a (6
sigma) limit S_lim(5 GHz)~0.4 mJy. We take advantage of the better spatial
resolution at 5 GHz (~2 arcsec compared to ~8 arcsec at 1.4 GHz) to infer radio
source structures and sizes. The 5 GHz source counts derived by the present
sample are consistent with those reported in the literature, but improve
significantly the statistics in the flux range 0.4< S(5 GHz)<1 mJy. The ATESP
sources show a flattening of the 1.4-5 GHz spectral index with decreasing flux
density, which is particularly significant for the 5 GHz selected sample. Such
a flattening confirm previous results coming from smaller samples and is
consistent with a flattening of the 5 GHz source counts occurring at fluxes

missing mass problems (galaxies, clusters of galaxies, gravitational collapse
in structure formation,...). However the physical nature of the Dark Matter
itself is still unknown. Alternatively, it has been proposed that apparent
dynamical evidence of dark matter is due to a modification of Newtons's law of
gravitation. Here we revisit the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) theories at
the scale of galaxy clusters. Using hydrodynamical simulations, we derived
quantities such as the density and the temperature of the ICM. We compared
those MOND simulated predictions to high quality X-ray density and temperature
profiles observed down to ~0.5 the virial radius. If the density profiles seems
in acceptable agreement, the simulated temperature show a constant increase
with the radius whereas the observed profiles show a flat to a mild decrease
shape down to ~0.5 Rvirial . We also computed the dynamical MOND mass for 8
X-ray clusters observed with XMM-Newton. If the MOND mass helps to lower the
discrepancy with the baryonic mass by ~20%, still ~80% of the mass in clusters
is unaccounted by baryons. In order to solve this problem and to reconcile MOND
with clusters observations, we investigated the possibility of an added dark
baryonic component. We assumed a component of massive neutrinos to fill the
remaining discrepancy between the observed MOND dynamical mass and the baryonic
mass. This led us to derive a tied observational lower limit for the neutrino
mass, m_nu > 1.06 eV.

initially selected as promising candidates of galaxies at z~7, but have
subsequently been dismissed and identified as Galactic brown dwarfs through a
detailed analysis of their morphology and Spitzer colors, as well as through
spectroscopic information. As a consequence, we conclude that there are no

Our non detection of galaxies at z~7 provides clear evidence for a strong
evolution of the luminosity function between z=6 and z=7, i.e. over a time

significant decline of the total star formation rate at z=7, which must be less
than 40% of that at z=3 and 40-80% of that at z=6. We also derive an upper
limit to the ionizing flux at z=7, which is only marginally consistent with
that required to completely ionize the Universe.

no trends with distance were reported due to the significant measurement
uncertainties for many sightlines. By considering only the highest quality

the interstellar N/O ratio with distance. Toward the seven stars within $\sim$
500 pc of the Sun, the weighted mean N/O ratio is 0.217 $\pm$ 0.011, while for
the six stars further away the weighted mean value (N/O = 0.142 $\pm$ 0.008) is
curiously consistent with the current Solar value (N/O =
0.138$^{+0.20}_{-0.18}$). It is difficult to imagine a scenario invoking
environmental (e.g., dust depletion, ionization, etc.) variations alone that
explains this abundance anomaly. Is the enhanced nitrogen abundance localized
to the Solar neighborhood or evidence of a more widespread phenomenon? If it is
localized, then recent infall of low metallicity gas in the Solar neighborhood
may be the best explanation. Otherwise, the N/O variations may be best
explained by large-scale differences in the interstellar mixing processes for
AGB stars and Type II supernovae.

range of volumes at different mass resolution, we calculate the abundance of
haloes of mass 10^{5-12} Msun/h. This enables us to predict accurately the

particular, we focus on the small mass haloes (>~10^{5.5-6} Msun/h) likely to
harbour population III stars where gas cools by molecular hydrogen emission,
early galaxies in which baryons cool by atomic hydrogen emission at a virial
temperature of ~10^4K (10^{7.5-8} Msun/h), and massive galaxies that may be
observable at redshift ~10. When we combine our data with simulations that
include high mass halos at low redshift, we find that the best fit to the halo
mass function depends not only on linear overdensity, as is commonly assumed in
analytic models, but also upon the slope of the linear power spectrum at the
scale of the halo mass. The Press-Schechter model gives a poor fit to the halo
mass function in the simulations at all epochs; the Sheth-Tormen model gives a
better match, but still overpredicts the abundance of rare objects at all times
by up to 50%. Finally, we consider the consequences of the recently released
WMAP 3-year cosmological parameters. These lead to much less structure at high

substantial mid-infrared excesses. Our spectra, from ESO's Very Large Telescope
and New Technology Telescope, show that four of the targets have spectral types
in the ~M9-L1 range, and three of those also exhibit H_alpha. Their
luminosities are consistent with masses of ~5-15 M_{Jupiter} according to
models of Chabrier, Baraffe and co-workers, thus placing these four objects
among the lowest mass brown dwarfs known to be surrounded by circum-sub-stellar
disks. Our findings bolster the idea that free-floating planetary mass objects
could have infancies remarkably similar to those of Sun-like stars and suggest
the intriguing possibility of planet formation around primaries whose masses
are comparable to those of extra-solar giant planets. Another target appears to
be a brown dwarf (~M8) with prominent H_alpha emission, possibly arising from
accretion. The sixth candidate is likely a background source, underlining the
need for spectroscopic confirmation.

three dimensional calculations of planets embedded in gaseous protoplanetary
disks. They provide estimates of the planet migration timescale that can be
compared to analytical predictions. While these predictions can result in
extremely short migration timescales for cores of a few Earth masses, recent
numerical calculations have given an unexpected outcome: the torque acting on
planets with masses between 5 M_Earth and 20 M_Earth is considerably smaller
than the analytic, linear estimate. These findings motivated the present work,
which investigates existence and origin of this discrepancy or ``offset'', as
we shall call it, by means of two and three dimensional numerical calculations.
We show that the offset is indeed physical and arises from the coorbital
corotation torque, since (i) it scales with the disk vortensity gradient, (ii)
its asymptotic value depends on the disk viscosity, (iii) it is associated to
an excess of the horseshoe zone width. We show that the offset corresponds to
the onset of non-linearities of the flow around the planet, which alter the
streamline topology as the planet mass increases: at low mass the flow
non-linearities are confined to the planet's Bondi sphere whereas at larger
mass the streamlines display a classical picture reminiscent of the restricted
three body problem, with a prograde circumplanetary disk inside a ``Roche
lobe''. This behavior is of particular importance for the sub-critical solid
cores (M <~ 15 M_Earth) in thin (H/r <~0.06) protoplanetary disks. Their
migration could be significantly slowed down, or reversed, in disks with
shallow surface density profiles.

results of a time series analysis performed on the X-ray light curve obtained

days earlier. Intense variability, with amplitude as large as 40% of the total

well represented as a combination of oscillations at a set of discrete

16 day time interval between the two observations. We suggest that a periods in
the power spectrum of both light curves at the frequency of 0.75 mHz and its
first harmonic are related to the spin period of the white dwarf in the system,
and that other observed frequencies are signatures of nonradial white dwarf
pulsations. A possible signal with a 24000 sec period is also found in the
XMM-Newton light curve: a cycle and a half are clearly identified. This period
is consistent with the 24278 s periodicity discovered in the optical light
curve of the source and thought to be the orbital period of the nova binary

have previously been attributed to separate circumstellar shells expelled
during its recurrent outbursts, result in fact from a superposition of a wide
absorption line and a narrow central emission line. The CO line doubling
returns over subsequent pulsation cycles, where the superposed line emission
assumes its largest intensity near phases of maximum light. We find that the
morphology and behavior of the CO band closely resemble the remarkable
""line-splitting phenomenon"" also observed in optical low-excitation atomic
lines. Based on radiative transport calculations we present a simplified model
of the near-IR CO emission emerging from cooler atmospheric layers in the
immediate vicinity of the photosphere. We speculate that the kinetic
temperature minimum in our model results from a periodical pulsation-driven
shock wave. We further discuss a number of alternative explanations for the
origin of the ubiquitous emission line spectrum, possibly due to a
quasi-chromosphere or a steady shock wave at the interface of a fast expanding
wind and the ISM. We present a number of interesting spectroscopic similarities
between Rho Cas and other types of cool variable supergiants such as the RV Tau

region. The radial X-ray profile is described by a sum of 3-beta components
with core radii about 2, 10, and 160 kpc, respectively. We studied radial
distributions of temperature and metal abundance with joint spectral fit for
the Chandra and XMM-Newton data, and two temperatures were required in the
inner r< 2' (35 kpc) region. The sharp drop of temperature at r about 5'
implies the gravitational mass density even lower than the gas density,
suggesting the gas may not be in hydrostatic equilibrium. Fe and Si abundances
are 1-2 solar at the center and drop to about 0.1 solar at r about 10'. O
abundance is less than 0.5 solar and shows a flatter profile. Observed metal
distribution supports the view that iron and silicon are produced by type Ia
supernova in the central galaxy, while galactic winds by type II supernova have
caused wide distribution of oxygen. The supporting mechanism of the cavity is
discussed. Pressure for the sum of electrons and magnetic field is too low to
displace the hot group gas, and the required pressure due to high energy
protons are nearly 700 times higher than the electron pressure. This leaves the
origin of the cavities a puzzle, and we discuss other possible origins of the

with a power law dependence of force on displacement between particles with
viscous dissipation is considered and compared to the corresponding long wave

neighboring particles is included in the discrete model to investigate its
influence on the shape of steady shock profiles. The critical viscosity
coefficient is obtained from the long-wave approximation for arbitrary values
of the exponent n and denotes the transition from an oscillatory to a monotonic
shock profile in stronly nonlinear systems. The expression for the critical
viscosity coefficient converges to the known equation for the critical
viscosity in the weakly nonlinear case. Values of viscosity based on this
expression are comparable to the values obtained in the numerical analysis of a
discrete particle lattice with a Herzian contact interaction corresponding to n
= 3/2. An initial disturbance in a discrete system approaches a stationary
shock profile after traveling a short distance that is comparable to the width
of the leading pulse of a stationary shock front. The shock front width is
minimized when the viscosity is equal to its critical value.

multiple scattering regime have been previously studied using diffusion
approximation. However, similar understanding in the low-order (sub-diffusion)
scattering regime is not complete due to difficulties in tracking photons that
undergo very few scatterings events. Recent developments in low-coherence
enhanced backscattering (LEBS) overcome these difficulties and enable probing
photons that travel very short distances and undergo only a few scattering
events. In LEBS, enhanced backscattering is observed under illumination with
spatial coherence length L_sc less than the scattering mean free path l_s. In
order to understand the mechanisms of photon propagation in LEBS in the
subdiffusion regime, it is imperative to develop analytical and numerical
models that describe the statistical properties of photon trajectories. Here we
derive the probability distribution of penetration depth of LEBS photons and
report Monte Carlo numerical simulations to support our analytical results. Our
results demonstrate that, surprisingly, the transport of photons that undergo
low-order scattering events has only weak dependence on the optical properties
of the medium (l_s and anisotropy factor g) and strong dependence on the
spatial coherence length of illumination, L_sc, relative to those in the
diffusion regime. More importantly, these low order scattering photons
typically penetrate less than l_s into the medium due to low spatial coherence
length of illumination and their penetration depth is proportional to the
one-third power of the coherence volume (i.e. [l_s \pi L_sc^2 ]^1/3).

  Wellington",,,,"gr-qc",,"  The crucial role played by pressure in general relativity is explored in the
mathematically simple context of a static spherically symmetric geometry. By
keeping all pressure terms, the standard formalisms of rotation curve and
gravitational lensing observations are extended to a first post-Newtonian
order. It turns out that both post-Newtonian formalisms encode the
gravitational field differently. Therefore, combined observations of rotation
curves and gravitational lensing of the same galaxy can in principle be used to
infer both the density and pressure profile of the galactic fluid.
  The newly introduced post-Newtonian formalism might allow us to make
inferences about the equation of state of dark matter. While the Cold Dark
Matter paradigm is currently favoured in the astrophysics and cosmology
communities, the formalism presented herein offers an unprecedented way of
being able to directly observe the equation of state.
  In a logically distinct analysis, I investigate the effects of negative
pressure in compact objects, motivated by the recently introduced gravastar
model. I find that gravastar like objects can in principle mimic the external
gravitational field of a black hole. Unlike a black hole, however, gravastars
neither exhibit a pathological curvature singularity at the origin nor do they
posess an event horizon. Instead they are mathematically well defined
everywhere. Finally, another exotic option is considered as a mathematical
alternative to black holes: The anti-gravastar, which is characterized by a
core that has a negative mass-energy density.

D3-brane experiences a force due to its interaction with D-branes wrapping
certain four-cycles. We compute this interaction, as a correction to the warped
four-cycle volume, using explicit throat backgrounds in supergravity. This
amounts to a closed-string channel computation of the loop corrections to the
nonperturbative superpotential that stabilizes the volume. We demonstrate for
warped conical spaces that the superpotential correction is given by the

general form proposed by Ganor. Our approach automatically provides a solution
to the problem of defining a holomorphic gauge coupling on wrapped D7-branes in

cosmological inflation models in which the inflaton is modeled by a D3-brane

We give a new proof for the circle case, based on Hamiltonian methods, which

for black holes in 2-torus compactifications, where there are three real

The strain tensor encodes the change in size and shape of the 2-torus as the

$1.66\pm 0.04$. This value can also be interpreted as the value of mean reduced
ratio of probabilities for muon capture by helium-3 and deuterium atoms.

recent INDRA Au+Au experiments at GSI in the energy range between 60 AMeV and
150 AMeV. It turns out that in this energy region the transition toward a
participant-spectator scenario takes place. The large Au+Au system displays in
the simulations as in the experiment simultaneously dynamical and statistical
behavior which we analyze in detail: The composition of fragments close to
midrapidity follows statistical laws and the system shows bi-modality, i.e. a
sudden transition between different fragmentation pattern as a function of the
centrality as expected for a phase transition. The fragment spectra at small
and large rapidities, on the other hand, are determined by dynamics and the
system as a whole does not come to equilibrium, an observation which is
confirmed by FOPI experiments for the same system.

lattice Boltzmann method. To this purpose, the bending rigidity and the elastic
modulus of isotropic dilation are introduced and incorporated with the lattice
Boltzmann simulation, and the membrane-flow interactions on both sides of the
membrane are carefully examined. We find that the static biconcave shape of an
erythrocyte is quite stable and can effectively resist the pathological changes
on their membrane. Further, our simulation results show that in shear flow, the
erythrocyte will be highly flattened and undergo tank tread-like motion. This
phenomenon has been observed by experiment very long time ago, but it has
feazed the boundary integral and singularity methods up to the present. Because
of its intrinsically parallel dynamics, this lattice Boltzmann method is
expected to find wide applications for both single and multi-vesicles
suspension as well as complex open membranes in various fluid flows for a wide
range of Reynolds numbers.

first three techniques are the most widespread and universal, with the best

analysis of solid samples, the leading roles are now conquered by laser-induced
breakdown and laser ablation mass spectrometry, and the related techniques with
transfer of the laser ablation products into inductively-coupled plasma.
Advances in design of diode lasers and optical parametric oscillators promote
developments in fluorescence and ionization spectrometry and also in absorption
techniques where uses of optical cavities for increased effective absorption
pathlength are expected to expand. Prospects for analytical instrumentation are
seen in higher productivity, portability, miniaturization, incorporation of
advanced software, automated sample preparation and transition to the
multifunctional modular architecture. Steady progress and growth in
applications of plasma- and laser-based methods are observed. An interest
towards the absolute (standardless) analysis has revived, particularly in the
emission spectrometry.

single DNA molecules as a model system. Stable curved DNA patterns with spans
about one micron were generated by using of water flows, and observed by Atomic
Force Microscopy. By rigorously comparing the numerical simulation results with
these patterns, it is suggested that the form of the macroscopic hydrodynamic
equation still works quantitatively well on the fluid flows at the nanoscale.
The molecular effects, however, are still apparent that the effective viscosity
of the adjacent water is considerably larger than its bulk value. Our
observation is also helpful to understand of the dynamics of biomolecules in
solutions from nanoscale to microscale.

biological networks is presented. The theory is based on multispecies
replicator dynamics equivalent to the Lotka-Volterra equation, with diverse
interspecies interactions. Various RSA patterns observed in nature are derived
from a single parameter related to productivity or maturity of a community. The
abundance distribution is formed like a widely observed left-skewed lognormal
distribution. It is also found that the ``canonical hypothesis'' is supported
in some parameter region where the typical RSA patterns are observed. As the
model has a general form, the result can be applied to similar patterns in
other complex biological networks, e.g. gene expression.

reduced the background pressure during the ion loading process by a factor of 2

temperatures are low enough that the ions immediately form crystals. It is also
possible to observe the trapping region with a CCD camera during ion creation,
allowing specific ion number loading with high probability.

what exactly is the `realism' in `local realism' supposed to mean? Carefully
surveying several possible meanings, we argue that all of them are flawed in
one way or another as attempts to point out a second premise (in addition to
locality) on which the Bell inequalities rest, and (hence) which might be
rejected in the face of empirical data violating the inequalities. We thus
suggest that the phrase `local realism' should be banned from future
discussions of these issues, and urge physicists to revisit the foundational
questions behind Bell's Theorem.
