cross-correlation of a sample of 36 optically-selected,
spectroscopically-identified quasars from the SDSS and 16 more found in the
DEEP2 survey with the full DEEP2 galaxy sample over scales 0.1 < r_p < 10
Mpc/h. The clustering amplitude is found to be similar to the auto-correlation
function of DEEP2 galaxies, with a relative bias of b=0.89 +/-0.24 between
quasars and DEEP2 galaxies at z~1. No significant dependence is found on scale,
quasar luminosity, or redshift over the ranges we probe here. The clustering
amplitude errors are comparable to those from significantly larger quasar
samples, such as the 2dF QSO Redshift Survey. This results from the statistical
power of cross-correlation techniques, which exploit the fact that galaxies are
much more numerous than quasars. We also measure the local environments of
quasars using the 3rd-nearest-neighbor surface density of surrounding DEEP2
galaxies. Quasars are found in regions of similar mean overdensity as blue
DEEP2 galaxies; they differ in environment from the red DEEP2 galaxy population
at 2 sigma significance. Our results imply that quasars do not reside in
particularly massive dark matter halos at these redshifts, with a mean dark
matter halo mass of M_200 ~ 3 10^12 solar masses in a concordance LCDM
cosmology.

a number of frequencies ranging from ~600 MHz to 15 GHz using both the GMRT and
the VLA. They reveal the structure of the bipolar bubbles of non-thermal, radio
emission which are along the minor axis of the galaxy and extend up to ~1.1 and
1.5 kpc on the northern and southern sides respectively. Features in the radio
bubbles appear to overlap with filaments of H_alpha emission. The
high-resolution observations reveal a compact source, likely to be associated
with the nucleus of the galaxy, and a possible radio jet towards the
south-west. We have compiled a representative sample of galaxies with bubbles
of non-thermal radio emission and find that these are found in galaxies with an
AGN.
  The HI observations with the GMRT show two peaks of emission on both ends of
the stellar-bar and depletion of HI in the central region of the galaxy. We
also detect HI in absorption against the central radio peak at the systemic
velocity of the galaxy. The HI-absorption spectrum also suggests a possible
weak absorption feature blue-shifted by ~120 km/s, which requires confirmation.
A similar feature has also been reported from observations of CO in emission,
suggesting that the circumnuclear starburst and nuclear activity affect the
kinematics of the atomic and molecular gas components, in addition to the

group selection, and even the most recent catalogs of groups built from
redshift-space selection should suffer from projections and infalling galaxies.
The cosmo-dynamical evolution of groups from initial Hubble expansion to
collapse and virialization leads to a fundamental track (FT) in
virial-theorem-M/L vs crossing time. The increased rates of mergers, both
direct and after dynamical friction, in groups relative to clusters, explain
the higher fraction of elliptical galaxies at given local number density in
X-ray selected groups, relative to clusters, even when the hierarchical
evolution of groups is considered. Galaxies falling into groups and clusters
should later travel outwards to typically 2 virial radii, which is somewhat
less than the outermost radius where observed galaxy star formation
efficiencies are enhanced relative to field galaxies of same morphological
type. An ongoing analysis of the internal kinematics of X-ray selected groups
suggests that the radial profiles of line of sight velocity dispersion are
consistent with isotropic NFW distributions for the total mass density, with
higher (lower) concentrations than LambdaCDM predictions in groups of high
(low) mass. The critical mass, at M200 ~ 10^13 M_sun is consistent with
possible breaks in the X-ray luminosity-temperature and Fundamental Plane
relations. The internal kinematics of groups indicate that the M-T relation of
groups should agree with that extrapolated from clusters with no break at the
group scale. The analyses of observed velocity dispersion profiles and of the
FT both suggest that low velocity dispersion groups (compact and loose, X-ray
emitting or undetected) are quite contaminated by chance projections.

more robust than used in the official analysis of the COBE TOD. The technique
extends the statistical concept of rejecting the null hypothesis to image
reconstruction by asking if the TOD is consistent with no anisotropies outside
the galactic band. If it is assumed that the instrumentation noise is ideal, as
appears to be the case in the official analysis, the null hypothesis can be
rejected to 28 sigma, a highly significant detection. However, the official
analysis presents no information supporting the ideal noise assumption to the
level required to reject the null hypothesis. The interaction of COBE's
calibration error of roughly 3.0% with the brightest regions of the galactic
band in combination with the reconstruction algorithm may have introduced
artefacts roughly of the size and spectral signature of the 10ppm anisotropies
reported by COBE. Data from follow up missions have similar problems with
calibration errors that may have resulted in similar sky maps to COBE. It is
pointed out that either a few hours of repetitive circular scans using the WMAP
satellite or the single beam antenna of the soon-to-be-launched Planck
satellite should provide definitive evidence as to the existence or non
existence of the 10ppm anisotropies without the use of image reconstruction.

associated with an X-ray source. All the O-type stars are detected in the X-ray
domain as soft and reasonably strong emitters. In the 0.5-10.0 keV band, their
X-ray luminosities scale with their bolometric luminosities as $\log
L_\mathrm{X} - \log L_\mathrm{bol}=-6.912\pm0.153$. Such a scaling law holds in
the soft (0.5-1.0 keV) and intermediate (1.0-2.5 keV) bands but breaks down in
the hard band. While the two colliding wind binaries in our sample clearly
deviate from this scheme, the remaining O-type objects show a very limited
dispersion (40% or 20% according to whether `cool' dwarfs are included or not),
much smaller than that obtained from previous studies. At our detection
threshold and within our sample, the sole identified mechanism that produces
significant modulations in the O star X-ray emission is related to wind
interaction. The intrinsic X-ray emission of non-peculiar O-type stars seems
thus constant for a given star and the level of its X-ray emission is
accurately related to the its luminosity or, equivalently, to its wind
properties. Among B-type stars, the detection rate is only about 25% in the
sub-type range B0-B4 and remains mostly uniform throughout the different
sub-populations while it drops significantly at later sub-types. The associated
X-ray spectra are harder than those of O-type stars. Our analysis points
towards the detected emission being associated with a physical PMS companion

scales larger than a few Mpc, AGN have almost the same clustering amplitude as
the control sample. This demonstrates that AGN host galaxies and inactive
galaxies populate dark matter halos of similar mass.On scales between 100kpc
and 1Mpc,AGN are clustered more weakly than the control galaxies. We use mock
catalogues constructed from high-resolution N-body simulations to interpret
this anti-bias, showing that the observed effect is easily understood if AGN
are preferentially located at the centres of their dark matter halos. On scales
less than 70 kpc, AGN cluster marginally more strongly than the control sample,
but the effect is weak. When compared to the control sample, we find that only
one in a hundred AGN has an extra neighbour within a radius of 70 kpc. This
excess increases as a function of the accretion rate onto the black hole, but
it does not rise above the few percent level. Although interactions between
galaxies may be responsible for triggering nuclear activity in a minority of
nearby AGN, some other mechanism is required to explain the activity seen in
the majority of the objects in our sample. (abridged)

to resolve the circumstellar material around the Herbig Ae star HR 5999,
providing the first direct measurement of its angular size, and to derive
constraints on the spatial distribution of the dust. A set of ten spectrally
dispersed (8-13 micron) interferometric measurements of HR 5999 was obtained.
The characteristic size of the emission region depends on the projected
baseline length and position angle, and it ranges between ~ 5-15
milliarcseconds (Gauss FWHM), corresponding to remarkably small physical sizes
of ~ 1-3 AU. To derive constraints on the geometrical distribution of the dust,
we compared our interferometric measurements to 2D, frequency-dependent
radiation transfer simulations of circumstellar disks and envelopes. For disk
models with radial power-law density distributions, the relatively weak but
very extended emission from outer disk regions (>~ 3 AU) leads to model
visibilities that are significantly lower than the observed visibilities,
making these models inconsistent with the MIDI data. Disk models in which the
density is truncated at outer radii of ~ 2-3 AU, on the other hand, provide
good agreement with the data. A satisfactory fit to the observed MIDI
visibilities of HR 5999 is found with a model of a geometrically thin disk that
is truncated at 2.6 AU and seen under an inclination angle of 58 degr. Neither
models of a geometrically thin disk seen nearly edge-on, nor models of
spherical dust shells can achieve agreement between the observed and predicted
visibilities. The reason why the disk is so compact remains unclear; we
speculate that it has been truncated by a close binary companion.

constant magnetic field, so strong that the electron Larmour length is much
shorter than its Compton length. The standard Coulomb law is modified due to
the vacuum polarization by the external magnetic field. Only mode-2 photons
mediate the static interaction. The corresponding vacuum polarization
component, taken in the one-loop approximation, grows linearly with the
magnetic field. Thanks to this fact a scaling regime occurs in the limit of
infinite magnetic field, where the potential is determined by a universal
function, independent the magnetic field. The scaling regime implies a
short-range character of interaction in the Larmour scale, expressed as a
Yukawa law. On the contrary, the electromagnetic interaction regains its
long-range character in a larger scale, characterized by the Compton length. In
this scale the tail of the Yukawa potential follows an anisotropic Coulomb law:
it decreases as the distance from the charge increases, slower along the
magnetic field and faster across. The equipotential surface is an ellipsoid
stretched along the magnetic field. As a whole, the modified Coulomb potential
is a narrower-shaped function than the standard Coulomb function, the narrower
the stronger the field. The singular behavior in the vicinity of the charge
remains unsuppressed by the magnetic field.
  These results may be useful for studying atomic spectra in super- strong
magnetic fields of several Schwinger's characteristic values.

models of chemical evolution of galaxies of different morphological type:
ellipticals, spirals and irregulars. We show that this proposed scenario is
compatible also with the main chemical properties of galaxies. When the new
rate is introduced in the two-infall model for the Milky Way, the derived Type
Ia SN rate as a function of cosmic time shows a high and broad peak at very
early epochs thus influencing the chemical evolution of the galactic halo more
than in the previous widely adopted formulations for the SNIa rate. As a
consequence of this, the [O/Fe] ratio decreases faster for [Fe/H] > -2.0 dex,
relative to the old models. For a typical elliptical of 10^11 M_sun of luminous
mass, the new rate produces average [alpha/ Fe] ratios in the dominant stellar
population still in agreement with observations. The Type Ia SN rate also in
this case shows an earlier peak and a subsequent faster decline relative to the
previous results, but the differences are smaller than in the case of our
Galaxy. We have also checked the effects of the new Type Ia SN rate on the
evolution of the Fe content in the ICM, as a consequence of its production from
cluster ellipticals and we found that less Fe in the ICM is produced with the
new rate, due to the higher fraction of Fe synthesized at early times and
remaining locked into the stars in ellipticals. For dwarf irregular galaxies
suffering few bursts of star formation we obtain [O/Fe] ratios larger by 0.2
dex relative to the previous models.

accessible for the Li ions by the bond valence method can capture up to 90% of
the diffusion path. These regions however entail a significant fraction that
does not belong to the diffusion path. Because of this low specificity, care
must be taken to determine the diffusive motion of particles in amorphous

diffusion path is achieved by using a modified valence mismatch in the BV

strontium-doped lanthanum manganite, La_{2/3}Sr_{1/3}MnO_3 (LSMO), are
investigated by means of density-functional methods. As far as the structural
properties are concerned, the comparison between theory and experiments for
LSMO strained on the most commonly used substrates, shows an overall good
agreement: the slight overestimate (at most of 1-1.5 %) for the equilibrium
out-of-plane lattice constants points to possible defects in real samples. The
inclusion of a Hubbard-like contribution on the Mn d states, according to the
so-called ""LSDA+U"" approach, is rather ineffective from the structural point of
view, but much more important from the electronic and magnetic point of view.
In particular, full half-metallicity, which is missed within a bare
density-functional approach, is recovered within LSDA+U, in agreement with
experiments. Moreover, the half-metallic behavior, particularly relevant for
spin-injection purposes, is independent on the chosen substrate and is achieved
for all the considered in-plane lattice constants. More generally, strain
effects are not seen to crucially affect the electronic structure: within the

about 0.1-0.2 eV) affected by a tensile or compressive strain. Nevertheless, we
show that the growth on a smaller in-plane lattice constant can stabilize the

similar conditions of temperature and pressure, the rigid discontinuous
molecular dynamics method reproduces the essential dynamical and structural
features found in continuous-potential simulations at both gas and liquid

demonstrated to be between 2 to 100 times more efficient than the standard
molecular dynamics method depending on the specific conditions of the

to a discontinuous-potential model of a liquid composed of rigid benzene
molecules, and equilibrium and dynamical properties are shown to be in
qualitative agreement with more detailed continuous-potential models of

to the relatively crude treatment of variations in the repulsive interactions

measured in numerical simulations. For finite apertures $\delta<\pi/2$, a
particular set of initial conditions exists for which the particles are in

the selection of angular momenta close to these orbits is observed after some

$\delta>\pi/2$ a solution is found for arbitrary $n$. The escape probability as
a function of $n^{-1}$ decays with an exponent 4 for $\delta>\pi/2$ and
evidences for a power law decay are found for lower apertures as well.

Neutron powder diffraction has been used to solve the basic magnetic and

crystal diffraction measurements have been used to reveal a variety of
incommensurate phases, interspersed with lock-in transitions to commensurate
phases. CVO initially orders magnetically at 11.3 K into an incommensurate,
transversely polarized, spin density wave state, with wave vector k=(0,delta,0)
with delta=0.55 and the spin direction along the a axis. Delta is found to
decrease monotonically with decreasing temperature, and then it locks into a
commensurate antiferromagnetic structure with delta=0.5 for 6.9<T<8.6 K. Below
6.9 K the magnetic structure becomes incommensurate again. Delta continues to
decrease with decreasing temperature, and locks-in again at delta=1/3 over a
narrow temperature range (6.2<T<6.5 K). The system then undergoes a strongly
first order transition to the ferromagnetic ground state (delta=0) at Tc=6.2 K.
A dielectric anomaly is observed around the ferromagnetic transition
temperature of 6.2 K, demonstrating a significant spin-charge coupling present
in CVO. A theory based on group theory analysis and a minimal Ising model with
competing exchange interactions can explain the basic features of the magnetic

we calculate the Kondo temperature $T_{\mathrm{K}}$. The scaling calculation
yields an analytical expression of $T_{\mathrm{K}}$ as a function of $\theta$
and $p$, $T_{\mathrm{K}}(\theta, p)$, when $\delta\epsilon \ll T_{\mathrm{K}}$.
$T_{\mathrm{K}}(\theta, p)$ is a decreasing function with respect to
$p\sqrt{\cos^2(\theta/2)+v^2\sin^2(\theta/2)}$. When $\delta\epsilon$ is
relevant, we evaluate $T_{\mathrm{K}}(\delta\epsilon, \theta, p)$ using the
slave-boson mean-field theory. The Kondo resonance is split into two by finite
$\delta\epsilon$, which results in the spin accumulation in the quantum dot and
suppression of the Kondo effect.

We probe the Quantum Hall (QH) regime for filling factors $\nu \sim 1$. Our
focus is on the transient coherence induced via optical excitation and on its
time evolution during early femtosecond timescales. We simultaneously study the
interband and intraband coherence in this system by using a nonlinear
spectroscopic technique, transient three-pulse four wave mixing optical
spectroscopy, and a many-body theory. We observe striking differences in the
temporal and spectral profile of the nonlinear optical signal between a
modulation doped quantum well system (with the 2DEG) and a similar undoped
quantum well (without a 2DEG). We attribute these qualitative differences to
Coulomb correlations between the photoexcited electron-hole pairs and the 2DEG.
We show, in particular, that intraband many-particle coherences assisted by the
inter-Landau-level magnetoplasmon excitations of the 2DEG dominate the
femtosecond nonlinear optical responce. The most striking effect of these
exciton-magnetoplasmon coherences is a large off-resonant four-wave-mixing
signal in the case of very low photoexcited carrier densities, not observed in
the undoped system, with strong temporal oscillations and unusually symmetric
temporal profile.

The main purpose of the review is to position Raman scattering with regard to

and other transport and thermodynamic measurements in correlated materials.
Particular focus will be placed on photon polarizations and the role of
symmetry to elucidate the dynamics of electrons in different regions of the

averaged properties) indeed provides new insights into anisotropic and complex
many-body behavior of electrons in various systems. We review recent

one possibility to match Tate's measurement, a number of reasons were developed
by the authors over the last years to show that the gravitomagnetic field in a
rotating quantum material must be different from its classical value and that
Tate's result is actually the first experimental sign for it. This paper
reviews the latest theoretical approaches to solve the Tate Cooper-pair anomaly
based on gravitomagnetic fields in rotating superconductors.

Effective Mass Energy Density (EMD) appears to be (rho + 3 p), where rho is the
bare mass density, p is the isotropic pressure, from a purely localized view
point. But since there is no truly local definition of ``gravitational field'',
such a notion could actually be misleading. On the other hand, by using the
Tolman mass formula, we point out that, from a global perspective, the Active
Gravitational Mass Energy Density (AGMD) is sqrt{g_{00}} (rho + 3 p) and which
is obviously smaller than (rho + 3p) because g_{00} < 1. Then we show that the
AGMD eventually is (rho - 3p), i.e., exactly opposite to what is generally
believed. We further identify the AGMD to be proportional to the Ricci Scalar.
By using this fundamental and intersting property, we obtain the GR virial
theorem in terms of appropriate ``proper energies''.

post-Newtonian (PN) gravitational waveforms, as opposed to the more commonly
used restricted PN waveforms, for the quasi-circular, adiabatic inspiral of
compact binary objects. In the case of initial detectors it has been shown that
the use of amplitude-corrected waveforms for detection templates would lead to
significantly lower signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) than those suggested by
simulations based exclusively on restricted waveforms. We further elucidate the
origin of the effect by an in-depth analytic treatment. The discussion is
extended to advanced detectors, where new features emerge. Non-restricted
waveforms are linear combinations of harmonics in the orbital phase, and in the
frequency domain the $k$th harmonic is cut off at $k f_{LSO}$, with $f_{LSO}$
the orbital frequency at the last stable orbit. As a result, with
non-restricted templates it is possible to achieve sizeable signal-to-noise
ratios in cases where the dominant harmonic (which is the one at twice the
orbital phase) does not enter the detector's bandwidth. This will have
important repercussions on the detection of binary inspirals involving
intermediate-mass black holes. For sources at a distance of 100 Mpc, taking
into account the higher harmonics will double the mass reach of Advanced LIGO,
and that of EGO gets tripled. Conservative estimates indicate that the
restricted waveforms underestimate detection rates for intermediate mass binary
inspirals by at least a factor of twenty.

possibility of a gauge field localization scheme. In this work the use of
bigger lattice volumes and higher statistics confirms the existence of the
Layer phase and furthermore clarifies the issue of the phase transitions'
order. We show that the Layer phase is separated from the strongly coupled

curvaton field are studied. These models also solve the mu problem, while
generating the Peccei-Quinn scale dynamically. The curvaton is a pseudo
Nambu-Goldstone boson corresponding to an angular degree of freedom orthogonal
to the axion. Its order parameter increases substantially following a phase
transition during inflation. This results in a drastic amplification of the
curvaton perturbations. Consequently, these models are able to accommodate
low-scale inflation with Hubble parameter at the TeV scale such as modular
inflation. We find that modular inflation with the orthogonal axion as curvaton
can indeed account for the observations for natural values of the parameters.
In particular, the spectral index can easily be made adequately lower than
unity in accord with the recent data.

unification with a unified Higgs sector is given. The new framework utilizes a
single pair of vector--spinor representation $144+\bar{144}$ to break the gauge
symmetry all the way to $SU(3)_C \times U(1)_{em}$. Typically the matter--Higgs
couplings in this framework are quartic and lead to naturally suppressed Yukawa
couplings for the first two generations. Here we show that much larger third
generation couplings naturally arise at the cubic level with additional matter
in 10--plet and 45--plet representations of SO(10). Thus the physical third
generation is a mixture of 16, 10 and 45--plet representations while the
remaining components become superheavy and are removed from the low energy
spectrum. In this scenario it is possible to understand the heaviness of the
top in a natural way since the analysis generates a hierarchy in the Yukawa
couplings so that $h_{\textnormal {t}}/h_{\textnormal {b}}>> 1$ where
$h_{\textnormal {t}} (h_{\textnormal {b}})$ are the top (bottom) Yukawa
couplings. It is then possible to realize values of $\tan\beta$ as low as 2,

the total energy is shown to vanish by both analytic and numerical arguments,

integrating the local energy density only when the latter is supplemented by an

tensor is used to define the energy density. A real global divergence first

Schwarzschild-like black hole, formed by gravitational collapse, into
almost-flat space-time and weak radiation at a very late time. The relevant
quantum amplitudes have been evaluated for bosonic and fermionic fields,
showing that no information is lost in collapse to a black hole. On the other
hand, recent developments in noncommutative geometry have shown that, in
general relativity, the effects of noncommutativity can be taken into account
by keeping the standard form of the Einstein tensor on the left-hand side of
the field equations and introducing a modified energy-momentum tensor as a
source on the right-hand side. The present paper, relying on the recently
obtained noncommutativity effect on a static, spherically symmetric metric,
considers from a new perspective the quantum amplitudes in black hole
evaporation. The general relativity analysis of spin-2 amplitudes is shown to
be modified by a multiplicative factor F depending on a constant
non-commutativity parameter and on the upper limit R of the radial coordinate.
Limiting forms of F are derived which are compatible with the adiabatic

Intersecting stacks of such branes are needed to build a supersymmetric

gauge particles, then, in order to obtain just the chiral spectrum of the
(supersymmetric) standard model (with non-zero Yukawa couplings to the Higgs
multiplets), it is necessary that the number of intersections a \circ b of the
stacks a and b, and the number of intersections a \circ b' of a with the
orientifold image b' of b satisfy (a \circ b, a \circ b')=\pm(2,1) or \pm(1,2).
It is also necessary that there is no matter in symmetric representations of
the gauge group, and not too much matter in antisymmetric representations, on
either stack. We provide a number of examples having these properties.
Different lattices give different solutions and different physics.

disproved this conjecture for cubic graphs of connectivity one and maintained
that the conjecture may still be true for 2-connected cubic graphs. Their
minimum counterexample C has 4 bridges, v(C) = 60, anddom (C) = 21. In this

in {0,2} implies dom(G(t)) = ]v(G(r))/3[, and t = 1 implies dom(G(t)) =

transform (DWT) provides additional insight on the series breakdown. In
particular, in comparison to other methods, the benefit of the wavelet
transform is that it provides a way to study the sensitivity of the series to
increases in amplitude of fluctuations as well as changes in frequency.
Finally, based on results for these methods, in particular, those for DWT of
raw (or original), squared and absolute returns, it can be concluded that there
is strong indication for persistence in the volatilities of the emerging stock
market returns for the Irish data.

years in Saclay and presents good performance for neutron detection. A
prototype for neutron imaging has been designed and new results obtained in

good 1D spatial resolution, a tomographic image of a multiwire cable has been
performed using a 1D Micromegas prototype. The number of pillars supporting the
micromesh is too large and leads to local losses of efficiency that distort the
tomographic reconstruction. Nevertheless, this first tomographic image achieved
with this kind of detector is very encouraging. The next worthwhile development
for neutron imaging is to achieve a bi-dimensional detector, which is presented
in the second part of this study. The purpose of measurements was to
investigate various operational parameters to optimize the spatial resolution.
Through these measurements the optimum spatial resolution has been found to be
around 160 microns (standard deviation) using Micromegas operating in double
amplification mode. Several 2D imaging tests have been carried out. Some of
these results have revealed fabrication defects that occurred during the
manufacture of Micromegas and that are limiting the full potential of the

of a ""quasi-rapid"" extinction population dynamics. It describes a decrease and
final extinction of the population of one prey species by a ""quasi-rapid""

""quasi-rapid"" interaction means ecologically that prey species behaves
practically quite passively (since there is no time for any reaction, i.e.
defense), like an appropriate environment, in respect to ""quasi-rapid"" activity
of the predator species that can have different ""quasi-rapid"" hunting
abilities. Mathematically, our model is based on a non-Lotka-Volterraian system
of two differential equations of the first order, first of which is linear
while second, depending of a parameter that characterizes hunting ability is
nonlinear. We compare suggested ""quasi-rapid"" extinction population dynamics
and the global model of the overkill of the prehistoric megafauna (mammoths).
We demonstrate that our ""quasi-rapid"" extinction population dynamics is able to
restitute successfully correlations between empirical (archeological) data and
overkill theory in North America as well as Australia. For this reason, we
conclude that global overkill theory, completely mathematically modelable by
""quasi-rapid"" extinction population dynamics can consistently explain the
Pleistocene extinctions of the megafauna.

could be powerful enough to solve efficiently the quantum search problem, and
the reversible and unitary halting protocol based on the state-locking pulse
field is the key component to construct the efficient quantum search processes,
while the state-locking pulse field is the key component to generate the
reversible and unitary halting protocol. In this paper the reversible and
unitary halting protocol and the generalized state-locking pulse field have
been extensively investigated theoretically. The basic principles to construct
the state-locking pulse field and design the reversible and unitary halting
protocol are studied in detail. A generalized state-locking pulse field is
generally dependent upon the time and space variables. It could be a sequence
of time- and space-dependent electromagnetic pulse fields and could also
contain the time- and space-dependent potential fields. Thus, the reversible
and unitary halting protocol built up out of the state-locking pulse field
generally consists of a sequence of time- and space-dependent unitary evolution
processes. It is shown how the quantum control process is constructed to
simulate efficiently the reversible and unitary halting protocol. An improved
subspace-reduction quantum program and circuit based on the reversible and
unitary halting protocol is proposed as the key component to construct further
an efficient quantum search process. A simple atomic physical system that is an
atomic ion or a neutral atom in the double-well potential field is proposed to
show how the state-locking pulse field is generated and how to implement the
reversible and unitary halting protocol.
