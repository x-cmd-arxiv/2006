spatially closer to the central host galaxy than most DLAs. We present direct
evidence for the presence of star formation, through observation of the

Lyman-alpha (DLA) systems. The measured star formation rate (SFR) from light
falling within the SDSS fibre apertures (corresponding to physical radii of 6-9

the total observed SFR density, in the redshift range 0.4 < z < 1.3, is small,
<10%. Our result contrasts with recent conclusions, based on the Schmidt law,
that DLA absorbers can account for the majority of the total observed SFR

D74 (2006) 123007","10.1103/PhysRevD.74.123007",,"astro-ph gr-qc hep-ph hep-th",,"  Within the effective field theory of inflation, an initialization of the
classical dynamics of the inflaton with approximate equipartition between the
kinetic and potential energy of the inflaton leads to a brief fast roll stage
that precedes the slow roll regime. The fast roll stage leads to an attractive
potential in the wave equations for the mode functions of curvature and tensor
perturbations. The evolution of the inflationary perturbations is equivalent to
the scattering by this potential and a useful dictionary between the scattering
data and observables is established.Implementing methods from scattering theory
we prove that this attractive potential leads to a suppression of the
quadrupole moment for CMB and B-mode angular power spectra. The scale of the
potential is determined by the Hubble parameter during slow roll. Within the
effective field theory of inflation at the grand unification (GUT) energy scale
we find that if inflation lasts a total number of efolds N_{tot} ~ 59, there is
a 10-20% suppression of the CMB quadrupole and about 2-4% suppression of the
tensor quadrupole. The suppression of higher multipoles is smaller, falling off
as 1/l^2. The suppression is much smaller for N_{tot} > 59, therefore if the
observable suppression originates in the fast roll stage, there is the upper
bound N_{tot} ~ 59.

spinning space-missions designed to measure CMB anisotropies. Although this
work is mainly devoted to the {\sc Planck} project, it is relatively general
and allows to focus on the most relevant DSC implications. We first study a
simple analytical model for the DSC in which the pointing direction of the main
spillover can be assumed parallel or not to the spacecraft spin axis direction
and compute the time ordered data and map. The map is then analysed paying
particular attention to the DSC of the low multipole coefficients of the map.
Through dedicated numerical simulations we verify the analytical results and
extend the analysis to higher multipoles and to more complex (and realistic)
cases by relaxing some of the simple assumptions adopted in the analytical
approach. We find that the systematic effect averages out in an even number of
surveys, except for a contamination of the dipole itself that survives when
spin axis and spillover directions are not parallel and for a contamination of
the other multipoles in the case of complex scanning strategies. In particular,
the observed quadrupole can be affected by the DSC in an odd number of surveys
or in the presence of survey uncompleteness or over-completeness. Various
aspects relevant in CMB space projects (such as implications for calibration,
impact on polarization measurements, accuracy requirement in the far beam
knowledge for data analysis applications, scanning strategy dependence) are
discussed.

perturba- tions at the beginning of slow roll inflation and their effect on the
power spectra. Renormalizability and small back reaction constrain the high k
behavior of the Bogoliubov coefficients that define these initial conditions.We
introduce a transfer function D(k) which encodes the effect of generic initial
conditions on the power spectra. The constraint from renormalizability and
small back reaction entails that D(k) < mu^2/k^2 for large k, implying that
observable effects from initial conditions are more prominent in the low
multipoles. This behavior affects the CMB quadrupole by the observed amount
\~10-20% when mu is of the order of the energy scale of inflation. The effects
on high l-multipoles are suppressed by a factor ~1/l^2 due to the fall off of
D(k) for large wavevectors k. We show that the determination of generic initial
conditions for the fluc- tuations is equivalent to the scattering problem by a
potential V(eta) localized just prior to the slow roll stage. Such potential
leads to a transfer function D(k) which automatically obeys the
renormalizability and small backreaction constraints. We find that an
attractive potential V(eta) yields a suppression of the lower CMB
multipoles.Both for curvature and tensor modes, the quadrupole suppression
depends only on the energy scale of V(eta) and on the time interval where
V(eta) is nonzero. A suppression of the quadrupole for curvature pertur-
bations consistent with the data is obtained when the scale of the potential is
of the order of k^2_Q where k_Q is the wavevector whose physical wavelength is

source halo mass range downward to 10^8M_solar, to capture the full range of
halo masses thought to be primarily responsible for reionization by their star
formation following atomic hydrogen radiative cooling and gravitational
collapse. Haloes below about 10^9M_solar, however, are subject to Jeans-mass
filtering in the ionized regions, which suppresses their baryonic content and
their ability to release ionizing radiation. By including these smaller-mass
haloes but accounting for their suppression, too, we find that reionization is
``self-regulating,'' as follows. As the mean ionized fraction rises, so does
the fraction of the volume within which suppression occurs. Hence, the degree
of suppression is related to the mean ionized fraction. Since low-mass haloes
with high emissivity achieve a given mean ionized fraction earlier than do
those with low efficiency, Jeans-mass filtering compensates for the difference
in the emissivity of the suppressible haloes in these two cases. As a result,
in the presence of lower-mass source haloes, reionization begins earlier, but
the later stages of reionization and the time of overlap are dictated by the
efficiency of the higher-mass haloes, independent of the efficiency of the
suppressible, lower-mass haloes. Reionization histories consistent with current
observational constraints are shown to be achievable with standard stellar
sources in haloes above 10^8M_solar. Neither minihalos nor exotic sources are
required, and the phenomenon of ``double reionization'' previously suggested
does not occur. (abridged)

different effective charges resulted in values between one and two. We explain
these challenging observations by a large self-energy of a charge in the narrow
water filled gap between ssDNA and channel walls, related to large difference
between dielectric constants of water and lipid, and calculate effective
charges of ssDNA. We start from the most fundamental stall charge $q_s$, which
determines the force $F_s= q_s V/L$ stalling DNA against the voltage V (L is
the length of the channel). We show that the stall charge $q_s$ is proportional
to the ion current blocked by DNA, which is small due to the self-energy
barrier. Large voltage V reduces the capture barrier which DNA molecule should
overcome in order to enter the channel by $|q_c|V$, where $q_c$ is the
effective capture charge. We expressed it through the stall charge $q_s$. We
also relate the stall charge $q_s$ to two other effective charges measured for
ssDNA with a hairpin in the back end: the charge $q_u$ responsible for
reduction of the barrier for unzipping of the hairpin and the charge $q_e$
responsible for DNA escape in the direction of hairpin against the voltage. At

are shown through the nuclear modification ratio $R_{pA}$ considering

presents interesting behavior at the backward rapidities when compared with the
already known forward ones, since it is related with the large $x$ kinematical
region that is being probed. The rapidity dependence of the nuclear
modification ratio in the dilepton production is strongly dependent on the
Bjorken $x$ behavior of the nuclear structure function ratio
$R_{F_{2}}=F_{2}^{A}/F_{2}^{p}$. The $R_{pA}$ transverse momentum dependence at
backward rapidities is modified due to the large $x$ nuclear effects: at RHIC
energies, for instance, the ratio $R_{pA}$ is reduced as $p_T$ increases,
presenting an opposite behavior when compared with the forward one. It implies
that the dilepton production at backward rapidities should carry information of

two-dimensional statistical mechanics systems, and their fractal geometry have
received a lot of attention in recent years. On the one hand, Schramm has
invented a new rigorous as well as practical calculational approach to critical
curves, based on a beautiful unification of conformal maps and stochastic
processes, and by now known as Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE). On the other
hand, Duplantier has applied boundary quantum gravity methods to calculate
exact multifractal exponents associated with critical curves.
  In the first part of this paper I provide a pedagogical introduction to SLE.
I present mathematical facts from the theory of conformal maps and stochastic
processes related to SLE. Then I review basic properties of SLE and provide
practical derivation of various interesting quantities related to critical
curves, including fractal dimensions and crossing probabilities.
  The second part of the paper is devoted to a way of describing critical
curves using boundary conformal field theory (CFT) in the so-called Coulomb gas
formalism. This description provides an alternative (to quantum gravity) way of
obtaining the multifractal spectrum of critical curves using only traditional
methods of CFT based on free bosonic fields.

finitely many degrees of freedom. The unforced systems considered formally
conserve energy. Despite being formally conservative, we show that these
dynamical systems support dissipative solutions (suitably defined) and, as a
result, may admit unique (statistical) steady states when the forcing term is
nonzero. This claim is demonstrated via the complete characterization of the
solutions of the system above for specific choices of the coupling
coefficients. The mechanism of anomalous dissipations is shown to arise via a
cascade of the energy towards the modes ($a_n$) with higher $n$; this is
responsible for solutions with interesting energy spectra, namely $\EE |a_n|^2$
scales as $n^{-\alpha}$ as $n\to\infty$. Here the exponents $\alpha$ depend on
the coupling coefficients $c_n$ and $\EE$ denotes expectation with respect to
the equilibrium measure. This is reminiscent of the conjectured properties of
the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations in the inviscid limit and their
accepted relationship with fully developed turbulence. Hence, these simple
models illustrate some of the heuristic ideas that have been advanced to
characterize turbulence, similar in that respect to the random passive scalar
or random Burgers equation, but even simpler and fully solvable.

and Johnson) provide a natural generalization to the notions of directed and
undirected graphs. By a \emph{weakly (node- or edge-) acyclic} bidirected graph
we mean such graph having no (node- or edge-) simple cycles. We call a
bidirected graph \emph{strongly acyclic} if it has no cycles (even non-simple).
Unlike the case of standard graphs, a bidirected graph may be weakly acyclic
but still have non-simple cycles.
  Testing a given bidirected graph for weak acyclicity is a challenging
combinatorial problem, which also has a number of applications (e.g. checking a
perfect matching in a general graph for uniqueness). We present (generalizing
results of Gabow, Kaplan, and Tarjan) a modification of the depth-first search
algorithm that checks (in linear time) if a given bidirected graph is weakly
acyclic (in case of negative answer a simple cycle is constructed).
  Our results are best described in terms of \emph{skew-symmetric graphs} (the
latter give another, somewhat more convenient graph language which is
essentially equivalent to the language of bidirected graphs).
  We also give structural results for the class of weakly acyclic bidirected
and skew-symmetric graphs explaining how one can construct any such graph
starting from strongly acyclic instances and, vice versa, how one can decompose
a weakly acyclic graph into strongly acyclic ``parts''. Finally, we extend
acyclicity test to build (in linear time) such a decomposition.

dynamical systems in nature and are identified as signatures of self-organized
criticality. Standard models for turbulent fluid flows in meteorological theory
cannot explain satisfactorily the observed multifractal (space-time) structures
in atmospheric flows. Numerical models for simulation and prediction of
atmospheric flows are subject to deterministic chaos and give unrealistic
solutions. Deterministic chaos is a direct consequence of round-off error
growth in iterative computations. Round-off error of finite precision
computations doubles on an average at each step of iterative computations.
Round-off error will propagate to the mainstream computation and give
unrealistic solutions in numerical weather prediction and climate models which
incorporate thousands of iterative computations in long-term numerical
integration schemes. A recently developed non-deterministic cell dynamical
system model for atmospheric flows predicts the observed self-organized
criticality as intrinsic to quantumlike mechanics governing flow dynamics.
Further, the fractal space-time structure to the stringlike atmospheric flow
trajectory is resolved into a continuum of eddies. The eddy circulations obey
Kepler third law of planetary motion and therefore eddy inertial masses obey
Newton inverse square law of gravitation on all scales from microscopic to

correlation signs is able to identify possible transitions from one convention

verify that the new TOP method performs as expected even in the presence of

organization show optimal component placement, in which any spatial
rearrangement of the components would lead to an increase of total wiring.
Using extensive connectivity datasets for diverse neural networks combined with
spatial coordinates for network nodes, we applied an optimization algorithm to
the network layouts, in order to search for wire-saving component
rearrangements. We found that optimized component rearrangements could
substantially reduce total wiring length in all tested neural networks.
Specifically, total wiring among 95 primate (Macaque) cortical areas could be
decreased by 32%, and wiring of neuronal networks in the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans could be reduced by 48% on the global level, and by 49%
for neurons within frontal ganglia. Wiring length reductions were possible due
to the existence of long-distance projections in neural networks. We explored
the role of these projections by comparing the original networks with minimally
rewired networks of the same size, which possessed only the shortest possible
connections. In the minimally rewired networks, the number of processing steps
along the shortest paths between components was significantly increased
compared to the original networks. Additional benchmark comparisons also
indicated that neural networks are more similar to network layouts that
minimize the length of processing paths, rather than wiring length. These
findings suggest that neural systems are not exclusively optimized for minimal
global wiring, but for a variety of factors including the minimization of
processing steps.

properties deduced from our previously developed ``structural histograms,''
