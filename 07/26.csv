galactic and even extragalactic clusters with a high level of accuracy. This
can be done with a classical color-magnitude diagram and appropriate
isochrones. The new calibration presented in this paper is a powerful
extension. For open clusters, the reddening is straightforward for an
estimation via Isochrone fitting and is needed in order to calculate the
reddening-free, temperature sensitive, index (g1-y)0. As a last step, the
calibration can be applied to individual stars. Because no a-priori
reddening-free photometric parameters are available for the investigated
spectral range, we have applied the dereddening calibrations of the Stromgren
uvbybeta system and compared them with extinction models for the Milky Way. As
expected from the sample of bright stars, the extinction is negligible for
almost all objects. As a next step, already established calibrations within the
Stromgren uvbybeta, Geneva 7-color, and Johnson UBV systems were applied to a
sample of 282 normal stars to derive a polynomial fit of the third degree for
the averaged effective temperatures to the individual (g1-y)0 values with a
mean of the error for the whole sample of Delta T(eff) is 134K, which is lower
than the value in Paper I for hotter stars. No statistically significant effect
of the rotational velocity on the precision of the calibration was found.

which takes into account both the skew introduced by the presence of two flows
and the effects of turbulence in each flow. In order to apply the GTFM to the
solar case, we introduce the plume dynamics as modelled by Rieutord & Zahn

simulation results, the CMP improves the agreement for the fourth order
moments, by approximatively a factor of two compared with the use of the
quasi-normal approximation or a skewness computed with the classical TFM. The
asymmetry of turbulent convection in the solar case has an important impact on
the vertical-velocity fourth-order moment which has to be accounted for by
models. The CMP is a significant improvement and is expected to improve the
modelling of solar p-mode excitation.

the excitation by the turbulent Reynolds stress term. The CMP is generalized
for two-point correlation products so as to apply it to the formalism developed
by Samadi & Goupil (2001). The excitation source terms are then computed with
this improvement, and a comparison with solar data from the GOLF instrument is
performed. The present model provides a significant improvement when comparing
absolute values of theoretical ampplitudes with observational data. It gives
rise to a frequency dependence of the power supplied to solar p modes, which
agrees with GOLF observations. It is shown that the asymmetry of the turbulent
convection zone (up- and downflows) plays a major role in the excitation
processes. Despite an increase in the Reynolds stress term contribution due to
our improved description, an additional source of excitation, identified as the
entropy source term, is still necessary for reproducing the observational data.
Theoretical excitation rates in the frequency range [2.5 mHz, 4 mHz] now are in
agreement with the observational data from the GOLF instrument. However, at
lower frequencies, it exhibits small discrepancies at the maximum level of a
few per cent. Improvements are likely to come from a better physical
description of the excitation by entropy fluctuations in the superadiabatic
zone.

demonstrate that the poloidal magnetic field in the simulated jet agrees well

self-collimation. We find that the polar field is confined/collimated by the
corona. The electromagnetic field in the disk also scales as $r^{-5/4}$, which
is consistent with some Newtonian accretion models that assume rough
equipartition between magnetic and gas pressure. However, the agreement is
accidental since toward the black hole the magnetic pressure increases faster
than the gas pressure. This field dominance near the black hole is associated
with magnetic stresses that imply a large effective viscosity parameter
$\alpha\sim 1$, whereas the typically assumed value of $\alpha\sim 0.1$ holds

relativistic force-free electrodynamics (GRFFE) code to study an idealized
problem in which the accretion disk is replaced by an infinitely thin rotating
equatorial current sheet. We consider both an $r^{-5/4}$ current profile and an
$r^{-1}$ profile, the latter corresponding to the paraboloidal model of
Blandford & Znajek (1977). The force-free magnetosphere we obtain with the
$r^{-5/4}$ current sheet matches remarkably well to the Poynting-dominated jet
seen in GRMHD numerical models. By comparing to the non-rotating force-free
model studied in paper I, rotation is seen to lead to mild decollimation of the
jet suggesting that hoop-stress forces nearly cancel centrifugal forces. In
order to study the process that generates the corona and disk wind and destroys
the ordered field in the corona in GRMHD numerical models, the force-free field
with the $r^{-5/4}$ current distribution is embedded in an accretion disk and

to a magnetized, thermal wind without the aid of an ordered field threading the

the background source by the molecular clouds in the absorber. Furthermore, for
these systems we find a relationship between the molecular line strength and
red optical--near infrared (V-K) colours, thus supporting the notion that the
reddening of these sources is due to dust, which provides an environment
conducive to the formation of molecules. Upon comparison with the V-K colours
of our sample, this relationship suggests that, presuming the reddening occurs
at the host galaxy redshift at least in some of the targets, many of our

absorption, although a confirmation of the ``detection'' of OH in 2300-189

Our sample comprises the six well studied Galactic Z sources and six Atoll
sources, four of which are bright (""GX"") bulge sources while two are weaker
ones in the 2-10keV range (H1750-440 and H1608-55). For all the sources of our
sample, we analysed available public data and extracted average spectra from
the IBIS/ISGRI detector on board INTEGRAL. We can describe all the spectral
states in terms of the bulk motion Comptonisation scenario. We find evidence
that bulk motion is always present, its strength is related to the accretion
rate and it is suppressed only in the presence of high local luminosity. The
two low-dim Atoll source spectra are dominated by photons up-scattered
presumably due to dynamical and thermal Comptonisation in an optically thin,
hot plasma. For the first time, we extend the detection of H1750-440 up to
150keV. The Z and bright ""GX"" Atoll source spectra are very similar and are
dominated by Comptonised blackbody radiation of seed photons, presumably coming
from the accretion disc and NS surface, in an optically thick cloud with plasma
temperature in the range of 2.5-3keV. Six sources show a hard tail in their
average spectrum: CygX-2 (Z), GX340+0 (Z), GX17+2 (Z), GX5-1 (Z), ScoX-1 (Z)
and GX13+1 (Atoll). This is the first detection of a hard tail in the X-ray
spectrum of the peculiar GX13+1. Using radio data from the literature we find,
in all Z sources and bright ""GX"" Atolls, a systematic positive correlation
between the X-ray hard tail (40-100keV) and the radio luminosity. This suggests
that hard tails and energetic electrons causing the radio emission may have the
same origin, most likely the Compton cloud located inside the NS magnetosphere.

asteroseismological analysis based on photometry from space or ground based
network data.
  A search for pulsating PMS members in the young open clusters IC 4996 and NGC
6530 has been performed to improve the sample of known PMS pulsators. As both
clusters are younger than 10 million years, all members with spectral types
later than A0 have not reached the zero-age main sequence yet. Hence, IC 4996
and NGC 6530 are most suitable to search for PMS pulsation among their A- and
F-type cluster stars.
  CCD time series photometry in Johnson B and V filters has been obtained for
IC 4996 and NGC 6530. The resulting light curves for 113 stars in IC 4996 and

According to the computed pulsation constants, the newly detected PMS stars
seem to prefer to pulsate in a similar fashion to the classical delta Scuti
stars, and with higher overtone modes.

disentangled from the Poisson noise contamination level what is hardly to

  QHE on a honeycomb lattice in terms of the topological quantum number, with
two-fold interests: First, how the zero-mass Dirac QHE around the center of the
tight-binding band crosses over to the ordinary finite-mass fermion QHE around
the band edges. Second, how the bulk QHE is related with the edge QHE for the
entire spectrum including Dirac and ordinary behaviors. We find the following:
  (i) The zero-mass Dirac QHE persists up to the van Hove singularities, at
which the ordinary fermion behavior abruptly takes over. Here a technique
developed in the lattice gauge theory enabled us to calculate the behavior of
the topological number over the entire spectrum. This result indicates a
robustness of the topological quantum number, and should be observable if the
chemical potential can be varied over a wide range in graphene. (ii) To see if
the honeycomb lattice is singular in producing the anomalous QHE, we have
systematically surveyed over square-honeycomb-$\pi$-flux lattices, which is
scanned by introducing a diagonal transfer $t'$. We find that the massless
Dirac QHE forms a critical line, that is, the presence of Dirac cones in the
Brillouin zone is preserved by the inclusion of $t'$ and the Dirac region sits
side by side with ordinary one persists all through the transformation. (iii)
We have compared the bulk QHE number obtained by an adiabatic continuity of the
Chern number across transformation and numerically obtained edge QHE numbers
calculated from the whole energy spectra for sample with edges, which shows
that the bulk QHE number coincides, as in ordinary lattices, with the edge QHE
number throughout the lattice transformation.

obtain the decay rate which is accurate for a wide range of depth and curvature
of the middle well. In the case of a deep middle well, it reduces to a
doubly-humped-barrier counterpart of the Kramers escape rate: the barrier
height and the curvature of an initial well in the Kramers rate are replaced by
the arithmetic mean of higher(or outer) and lower(or inner) partial barriers

Co sites in the unit cell, i.e., Co(1) in the metallic Kagome layer, a Co(2)
dimerized pillar between the layers and Co(3) in the triangular lattice.
Zero-field NMR spectra have revealed that large local moments at the Co(3)
sites are magnetically ordered without any trace of bulk magnetization M at
zero field. The field-swept NMR spectra show that the internal hyperfine field
at the Co(1) site is derived from fully polarized moments Ms at the Co(3) sites
in the ""1""-plateau state at fields higher than 2.5 T, whereas it is partially
cancelled out in the ""1/3""-plateau state in which one-third of Ms is induced at
intermediate fields once a small field is applied. It has been clarified from a
microscopic point of view that the local moments at Co(3) site undergo a
field-induced ferrimagnetic (up-up-down)-to-ferromagnetic (up-up-up)
transition, which is consistent with the evidence obtained from the recent
neutron diffraction experiment. The Co(1) Kagome layer and the dimerized pillar
Co(2) site between the layers are of nonmagnetic origin, suggesting that the
nearly quasi-2D metallic conductivity is dominated by nonmagnetic Co(1) and
Co(2) sites. Consequently, unique magneto-transport phenomena observed in

finite-temperature thermodynamics of formation and dehydrogenation for the new
quaternary hydride Li4BN3H10. Two recent studies based on X-ray and neutron
diffraction have reported three bcc crystal structures for this phase. While
these structures possess identical space groups and similar lattice constants,
internal coordinate differences result in bond length discrepancies as large as
0.2 A. Geometry optimization calculations on the experimental structures reveal
that the apparent discrepancies are an artifact of X-ray interactions with
strong bond polarization; the relaxed structures are essentially identical.
Regarding reaction energetics, the present calculations predict that the
formation reaction 3LiNH2 + LiBH4 -> Li4BN3H10 is exothermic with enthalpy
Delta H(T=300K) = -11.8 kJ/(mol f.u.), consistent with reports of spontaneous
Li4BN3H10 formation in the literature. Calorimetry experiments have been
reported for the dehydrogenation reaction, but have proven difficult to
interpret. To help clarify the thermodynamics we evaluate the free energies of
seventeen candidate dehydrogenation pathways over the temperature range T =
0-1000 K. At temperatures where H2 release has been experimentally observed (T
\~ 520-630 K), the favored dehydrogenation reaction is Li4BN3H10 -> Li3BN2 +
LiNH2 + 4 H2, which is weakly endothermic [Delta H(T=550K) = 12.8 kJ/(mol H2)].
The small calculated Delta H is consistent with the unsuccessful attempts at
re-hydriding reported in the literature, and suggests that the moderately high
temperatures needed for H-desorption result from slow kinetics.

investigated by a coarse-grained model. The concentration of salt and the size
of tetravalent counterions are found playing a decisive role on chain
properties. If the size of tetravalent counterions is compatible with the one
of monomers, the chains show extended structures at low and at high salt
concentrations, whereas at intermediate salt concentrations, they acquire
compact and prolate structures. The swelling exponent of a chain against salt
concentration behaves in an analogous way as the morphological quantities.
Under certain condition, the electrostatics gives a negative contribution to
the persistence length, in companion with a salt-induced mechanical instability
of polyelectrolytes. Nearly at the same moment, it appears like-charge
attraction between chains. The equal size of the tetravalent ions and the
monomers is the optimal condition to attain the strongest attraction between
chains and the most compact chain structure. Moreover, the ions form a
multi-layer organization around a chain and, thus, the integrated charge
distribution reveals an oscillatory behavior. The results suggest that charge
inversion has no direct connection with redissolution of polyelectrolytes at
high salt concentrations.

Storage Ring, we have compared proton, lambda (charged conjugate modes are
implicit) and meson (phi and f2(1270)) production observed in gluon
fragmentation vs. quark fragmentation. Two studies have been conducted: in the
first, we corroborrate previous per-event particle yields in Upsilon(1S)->ggg
vs. e+e- -> qqbar. In the second, we compare particle production in the
photon-tagged process U(1S)->gggamma with that in e+e- -> qqbargamma events.
For each particle, we determine the `enhancement' ratio, defined as the ratio
of particle yields per gluon fragmentation event compared to quark
fragmentation event. Thus defined, an enhancement of 1.0 implies equal
per-event production in both gluon and quark fragmentation. In the
photon-tagged analysis, we find an enhancement of order unity for protons and
approximately 1.5 for lambda's. This measured proton enhancement rate is
supported by a study of baryon production in chib(J=2)->proton+X relative to
chib(J=1)->proton+X. The production of mesons having masses of order 1 GeV (phi
and f2(1270)) are found to be also approximately the same in gggamma vs.
qqbargamma fragmentation. Overall, per-event baryon production in two-gluon
fragmentation is considerably smaller than that observed in three-gluon decays
of the Upsilon(1S). Our results for baryon production are inconsistent with the
predictions of the JETSET (7.4) fragmentation model.

precision tests (EWPT). However one should be prepared for ""unexpected""

sector (using 2-Higgs-doublet models). We find that these models do not improve
the naturalness of the SM, and so they do not change the expectations of
observing NP at LHC. We also stress that a heavy SM Higgs would not be evidence
in favour of a modified Higgs sector, provided certain higher order operators
influence EWPT. On the other hand, we show that NP can escape LHC detection
without a naturalness price, and with the pure SM as the effective theory valid
at LHC energies, simply if the cut-off for top loops is slightly lower than for

the one-loop corrections give all quarks the consistent masses. This conclusion
is in contradiction to the previous analysis in which, the third scalar triplet
has been introduced. This result is based on the key properties of the model:
First, there are three quite different scales of vacuum expectation values:
$\om \sim {\cal O}(1) \mathrm{TeV}, v \approx 246 \mathrm{GeV}$ and $ u \sim
{\cal O}(1) \mathrm{GeV}$. Second, there exist two types of Yukawa couplings
with different strengths: the lepton-number conserving couplings $h$'s and the
lepton-number violating ones $s$'s satisfying the condition in which the second
are much smaller than the first ones: $ s \ll h$.
  With the acceptable set of parameters, numerical evaluation shows that in
this model, masses of the exotic quarks also have different scales, namely, the
$U$ exotic quark ($q_U = 2/3$) gains mass $m_U \approx 700 $ GeV, while the

both models $\lambda$, the underlying rate of the Poisson process, is a
parameter to be estimated. In the geometric case, also $\sigma>0$ has to be
estimated. We propose different estimators of the parameters and we investigate
their performance under the high frequency asymptotics, i.e. $\Delta_n \to 0$,
$n\Delta = T<\infty$ as $n \to \infty$, with $T>0$ fixed. The process $X(t)$ in
non markovian, non stationary and not ergodic thus we use approximation
arguments to derive estimators. Given the complexity of the equations involved
only estimators on the first model can be studied analytically. Therefore, we
run an extensive Monte Carlo analysis to study the performance of the proposed
estimators also for small sample size $n$.

that, under the suitable normalization (growing as the square root of log n),
the corresponding random process converges, in the sense of finite dimensional
distributions, to a Gaussian process with independent values. The proof uses
heavily the determinantal structure of the correlation functions and is based
on the application of the Costin-Lebowitz-Soshnikov central limit theorem. At
the spectrum edges, the fluctuation asymptotics is expressed in terms of the
largest members of the Airy ensemble; in particular, at the upper edge the
limit distribution appears to be discrete (without any normalization). These
results admit an elegant symmetric reformulation under the rotation of Young
diagrams by 45 degrees, where the normalization no longer depends on the
location of the spectrum point. We also discuss the link of our central limit

  problem","To appear in the SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications.
  Includes another 7 pages of additional materials not in the earlier Tech
  Report version",,,,"math.NA math.AG math.OC",,"  There has been continued interest in seeking a theorem describing optimal
low-rank approximations to tensors of order 3 or higher, that parallels the
Eckart-Young theorem for matrices. In this paper, we argue that the naive
approach to this problem is doomed to failure because, unlike matrices, tensors
of order 3 or higher can fail to have best rank-r approximations. The
phenomenon is much more widespread than one might suspect: examples of this
failure can be constructed over a wide range of dimensions, orders and ranks,
regardless of the choice of norm (or even Bregman divergence). Moreover, we
show that in many instances these counterexamples have positive volume: they
cannot be regarded as isolated phenomena. In one extreme case, we exhibit a
tensor space in which no rank-3 tensor has an optimal rank-2 approximation. The
notable exceptions to this misbehavior are rank-1 tensors and order-2 tensors.
In a more positive spirit, we propose a natural way of overcoming the
ill-posedness of the low-rank approximation problem, by using weak solutions
when true solutions do not exist. In our work we emphasize the importance of
closely studying concrete low-dimensional examples as a first step towards more
general results. To this end, we present a detailed analysis of equivalence
classes of 2-by-2-by-2 tensors, and we develop methods for extending results
upwards to higher orders and dimensions. Finally, we link our work to existing
studies of tensors from an algebraic geometric point of view. The rank of a
tensor can in theory be given a semialgebraic description; i.e., can be
determined by a system of polynomial inequalities. In particular we make
extensive use of the 2-by-2-by-2 hyperdeterminant.

very complex problem. Up to now only two cases have been described completely.
The complete picture for the hook case has been obtained by
  N. Spaltenstein and J.A. Vargas, and for two-row case by
  F.Y.C. Fung. They have shown in particular that the intersection of a pair of
components of a Springer fiber is either irreducible or empty. In both cases
all the components are non-singular and the irreducibility of the intersections
is strongly related to the non-singularity. As it has been shown in [8] a
bijection between orbital varieties and components of the corresponding
Springer fiber in GL_n extends to a bijection between the irreducible
components of the intersections of orbital varieties and the irreducible
components of the intersections of components of Springer fiber preserving
their codimensions. Here we use this bijection to compute the intersections of
the irreducible components of Springer fibers for two-column case. In this case
the components are in general singular. As we show the intersection of two
components is non-empty. The main result of the paper is a necessary and
sufficient condition for the intersection of two components of the Springer
fiber to be irreducible in two-column case. The condition is purely
combinatorial. As an application of this characterization, we give first
examples of pairs of componentswith a reducible intersection having components
of different dimensions.

Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) and Electron Spin Echo Envelope Modulation (ESEEM)
spectroscopies. To this end, model water cluster anions (n=4-8 and n=20,24)
that localize the electron internally are examined. It is shown that EPR
parameters of such water anions (such as hyperfine coupling tensors of H/D
nuclei in the water molecules) are defined mainly by the cavity size and the
coordination number of the electron; the water molecules in the second
solvation shell play a relatively minor role. An idealized model of hydrated
electron (that is usually attributed to L. Kevan) in which six hydroxyl groups
arranged in an octahedral pattern point towards the common center is shown to
provide the closest match to the experimental parameters, such as isotropic and
anisotropic hyperfine coupling constants for the protons (estimated from
ESEEM), the second moment of the EPR spectra, and the radius of gyration. The
salient feature of these DFT models is the significant transfer (10-20%) of
spin density into the frontal O 2p orbitals of water molecules. Spin bond
polarization involving these oxygen orbitals accounts for small, negative
hyperfine coupling constants for protons in hydroxyl groups that form the
electron-trapping cavity. In Part 2, these results are generalized for more
realistic geometries of core anions obtained using a dynamic one-electron mixed

approximately 700m^3 in size in the Homestake mine at the 4850' level. This
would allow us to make a measurement of the total uranium and thorium content
with a statistical error less than the systematic error from our current
knowledge of neutrino oscillation parameters. It would also allow us to test
the hypothesis of a naturally occurring nuclear reactor at the center of the
Earth.

recover the scaling exponents of the underlying process by excluding a minimal

defined in principle, but is very sensitive to errors in practice. For risk
management, knowledge of the entire RND provides more information for
Value-at-Risk (VaR) calculations than implied volatility alone [1]. Typically,
RNDs are deduced from option prices by making a distributional assumption, or
relying on implied volatility [2]. We present a fully non-parametric method for
extracting RNDs from observed option prices. The aim is to obtain a continuous,
smooth, monotonic, and convex pricing function that is twice differentiable.
Thus, irregularities such as negative probabilities that afflict many existing
RND estimation techniques are reduced. Our method employs neural networks to
obtain a smoothed pricing function, and a central finite difference
approximation to the second derivative to extract the required gradients.
  This novel technique was successfully applied to a large set of FTSE 100
daily European exercise (ESX) put options data and as an Ansatz to the
corresponding set of American exercise (SEI) put options. The results of paired
t-tests showed significant differences between RNDs extracted from ESX and SEI
option data, reflecting the distorting impact of early exercise possibility for
the latter. In particular, the results for skewness and kurtosis suggested
different shapes for the RNDs implied by the two types of put options. However,
both ESX and SEI data gave an unbiased estimate of the realised FTSE 100
closing prices on the options' expiration date. We confirmed that estimates of
volatility from the RNDs of both types of option were biased estimates of the
realised volatility at expiration, but less so than the LIFFE tabulated
at-the-money implied volatility.

a global view of binary protein-protein interactions across species as
dissimilar as human, yeast, and bacteria. Remarkably, these analyses have
revealed that all species studied have a degree distribution of protein-protein
binding that is approximately scale-free (varies as a power law) even though
their evolutionary divergence times differ by billions of years. The universal
power-law shows only the surface of the rich information harbored by these
high-throughput data. We develop a detailed mathematical model of the
protein-protein interaction network based on association free energy, the
biochemical quantity that determines protein-protein interaction strength. This
model reproduces the degree distribution of all of the large-scale Y2H data
sets available and allows us to extract the distribution of free energy, the
likelihood that a pair of proteins of a given species will bind. We find that
across-species interactomes have significant differences that reflect the
strengths of the protein-protein interaction. Our results identify a global
evolutionary shift: more evolved organisms have weaker binary protein-protein
binding. This result is consistent with the evolution of increased protein
unfoldedness and challenges the dogma that only specific protein-protein
interactions can be biologically functional..

cardiac excitability. It has a form essentially different from the Tikhonov
fast-slow form assumed in standard asymptotic reductions of excitable systems.
This is of interest since the standard approaches have been previously found
inadequate to describe phenomena such as the dissipation of cardiac wave fronts
and the shape of action potential at repolarization. The proposed asymptotic
description overcomes these deficiencies by allowing, among other non-Tikhonov
features, that a dynamical variable may change its character from fast to slow
within a single solution. The general asymptotic approach is best demonstrated
on an example which should be both simple and generic. The classical model of
Purkinje fibers (Noble, 1962) has the simplest functional form of all cardiac
models but according to the current understanding it assigns a physiologically
incorrect role to the Na current. This leads us to suggest an ``Archetypal
Model'' with the simplicity of the Noble model but with a structure more
typical to contemporary cardiac models. We demonstrate that the Archetypal
Model admits a complete asymptotic solution in quadratures. To validate our
asymptotic approach, we proceed to consider an exactly solvable ``caricature''
of the Archetypal Model and demonstrate that the asymptotic of its exact
solution coincides with the solutions obtained by substituting the
``caricature'' right-hand sides into the asymptotic solution of the generic
Archetypal Model. This is necessary, because, unlike in standard asymptotic
descriptions, no general results exist which can guarantee the proximity of the
non-Tikhonov asymptotic solutions to the solutions of the corresponding
detailed ionic model.

Lezama","Spectroscopic observation of the rotational Doppler effect","Submited to Physical Review Letter",,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.113601",,"quant-ph",,"  We report on the first spectroscopic observation of the rotational Doppler
shift associated with light beams carrying orbital angular momentum. The effect
is evidenced as the broadening of a Hanle/EIT coherence resonance on Rb vapor
when the two incident Laguerre-Gaussian laser beams have opposite topological
charges. The observations closely agree with theoretical predictions.
