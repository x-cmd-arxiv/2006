X-ray flash 050416a obtained with Palomar and Siding Springs Observatories as
well as HST and the VLA, placing this event among the best-studied X-ray
flashes to date. In addition, we present an optical spectrum from Keck LRIS
from which we measure the redshift of the burst, z=0.6528. At this redshift the
isotropic-equivalent prompt energy release was about 10^51 erg, and using a
standard afterglow synchrotron model we find that the blastwave kinetic energy
is a factor of 10 larger, E_K,iso ~ 10^52 erg. The lack of an observed jet
break to t ~ 20 days indicates that the opening angle is larger than 7 deg and
the total beaming-corrected relativistic energy is larger than 10^50 erg. We
further show that the burst produced a strong radio flare at t ~ 40 days
accompanied by an observed flattening in the X-ray band which we attribute to
an abrupt circumburst density jump or an episode of energy injection (either
from a refreshed shock or off-axis ejecta). Late-time observations with HST
show evidence for an associated supernova with peak optical luminosity roughly
comparable to that of SN 1998bw. Next, we show that the host galaxy of XRF
050416a is actively forming stars at a rate of at least 2 M_solar per year with
a luminosity of L_B ~ 0.5L* and metallicity of Z ~ 0.2-0.8 Z_solar. Finally, we
discuss the nature of XRF 050416a in the context of short-hard gamma-ray bursts
and under the framework of off-axis and dirty fireball models for X-ray
flashes.

substantial with the maximum flux in the direction of the Sun; the angular
distribution of the emission is broad. This previously-neglected foreground
should be taken into account in studies of the diffuse Galactic and
extragalactic gamma-ray emission. Furthermore, observations by GLAST can be
used to monitor the heliosphere and determine the electron spectrum as a
function of position from distances as large as Saturn's orbit to close
proximity of the Sun, thus enabling unique studies of solar modulation. This
paves the way for the determination of other Galactic cosmic-ray species,
primarily protons, near the solar surface which will lead to accurate
predictions of gamma rays from pp-interactions in the solar atmosphere. These
albedo gamma rays will be observable by GLAST, allowing the study of deep
atmospheric layers, magnetic field(s), and cosmic-ray cascade development. The
latter is necessary to calculate the neutrino flux from pp-interactions at
higher energies (>1 TeV). Although this flux is small, it is a ""guaranteed
flux"" in contrast to other astrophysical sources of neutrinos, and may be
detectable by km^3 neutrino telescopes of the near future, such as IceCube.
Since the solar core is opaque for very high-energy neutrinos, directly
studying the mass distribution of the solar core may thus be possible.

of about 65 pN. Two physical pictures have been developed to describe this
overstretched state. The first proposes that strong forces induce a phase
transition to a molten state consisting of unhybridized single strands. The
second picture instead introduces an elongated hybridized phase, called S-DNA,
structurally and thermodynamically distinct from standard B-DNA. Little
thermodynamic evidence exists to discriminate directly between these competing
pictures. Here we show that within a microscopic model of DNA we can
distinguish between the dynamics associated with each. In experiment,
considerable hysteresis in a cycle of stretching and shortening develops as
temperature is increased. Since there are few possible causes of hysteresis in
a system whose extent is appreciable in only one dimension, such behavior
offers a discriminating test of the two pictures of overstretching. Most
experiments are performed upon nicked DNA, permitting the detachment
(`unpeeling') of strands. We show that the long-wavelength progression of the
unpeeled front generates hysteresis, the character of which agrees with
experiment only if we assume the existence of S-DNA. We also show that internal
melting (distinct from unpeeling) can generate hysteresis, the degree of which
is strongly dependent upon the nonextensive loop entropy of single-stranded
DNA.

by providing channel state to the decoder also. The uninformed encoders benefit
from the state cancellation in terms of achievable rates, however, appears that
GDPC cannot completely eliminate the effect of the channel state on the

$\mathbf{10-120-\oot}$ FM Higgs system in Susy SO(10) GUTs that follow the
scenario\cite{blmdoom,nmsgutI} in which the $\mathbf{120}$ -plet collaborates
with the $ \mathbf{10}$-plet to fit the charged fermion masses while small
$\mathbf{\oot} $-plet couplings enhance the Type I seesaw neutrino masses to
viable values and make the fit to light fermions accurate. Restricting
ourselves to the CP conserving case we use a linear perturbative technique to
obtain accurate charged fermion fits ($\chi^2_{tot} < .2 $) to all the charged
fermion masses and angles. The resulting fits imply Type I neutrino masses that
are generically $10^2- 10^3$ times larger than those obtained in the
$\mathbf{10-\oot}$ scenario precisely because of the small $\mathbf{\oot} $
coupling. Thus the difficulty of obtaining sufficiently large neutrino masses
in the context of these Next to Minimal Susy GUTs is essentially removed. The
remaining free parameters allow one to obtain the correct ratio of neutrino
mass squared splitting and a large($\theta_{23}^{PMNS}$) and
small($\theta_{13}^{PMNS}$) mixing angle. The $\theta_{12}^{PMNS}$ is however
small and this indicates that -as in the Type I $\mathbf{10-\oot}$ case - a
fully realistic fit to the lepton mixing data also \emph{requires} CP
violation.

cycles and without interfering with structure generated in later cycles; (2)
the ekpyrotic phase, an epoch of gentle contraction with equation of state
$w\gg 1$ preceding the hot big bang, makes the universe homogeneous, isotropic
and flat within any given observer's horizon; and, (3) although the universe is
uniform within each observer's horizon, the global structure of the cyclic
universe is more complex, owing to the effects of superhorizon length
perturbations, and cannot be described in a uniform Friedmann-Robertson-Walker

smoothing, flattening and isotropizing the universe within the horizon that
this phase alone suffices to solve the horizon and flatness problems even
without an extended period of dark energy domination (a kind of low energy
inflation). Instead, the cyclic model rests on a genuinely novel,
non-inflationary mechanism (ekpyrotic contraction) for resolving the classic

other requirements, proposed by Wigner and Yanase, for an effective

We establish a connection between the geometrical formulation of quantum

show that the set of normalized Morozova-Chentsov functions describing the

Q-factor challenges designers of low-threshold microlasers. To address this
problem, basic design rules to tune the spectral and emission characteristics
of micro-scale optical cavity structures with nanoscale features by tailoring
their geometry are formulated and discussed in this paper. The validity and
usefulness of these rules is demonstrated by reviewing a number of previously
studied cavity shapes with global and local deformations. The rules provide
leads to novel improved WG-mode cavity designs, two of which are presented: a
cross-shaped photonic molecule with introduced asymmetry and a
photonic-crystal-assisted microdisk resonator. Both these designs yield
degenerate mode splitting, as well as Q-factor enhancement and directional
light output of one of the split modes.

model assumes the left ventricle to be a harmonic oscillator with two distinct
phases, simulating the systolic and diastolic phases, at which both the
amplitude and the elastic constant of the oscillator are different. Taking into
account the pressure within the left ventricle, the model shows qualitative
agreement with functional parameters of the left ventricle. The model allows
for a natural explanation of heart failure with preserved systolic left
ventricular function, also termed diastolic heart failure. Specifically, the
rise in left ventricular filling pressures following increased left-ventricular
wall stiffness is attributed to a mechanism aimed at preserving heart rate and
cardiac output.

magnetic forces acting on electrons proves accessible to introductory students
and gives a good qualitative account of eddy current forces. However, this
model cannot be complete; it ignores the electric fields that drive current
outside regions of significant magnetic field. In this paper we show how to
extend the model to obtain a boundary value problem for current density.
Solution of this problem in polar coordinates shows that the electric field
significantly affects the quantitative results and presents an exercise
suitable for upper division students. We apply elliptic cylindrical coordinates
to generalize the result and offer an exercise useful for teaching graduate
students how to use non-standard coordinate systems.

  alternans","55 pages, 13 figures, to appear in Phys. Rev. E",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.76.051911",,"q-bio.TO nlin.PS",,"  Amplitude equations are derived that describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of
cardiac alternans during periodic pacing of one- and two-dimensional
homogeneous tissue and one-dimensional anatomical reentry in a ring of
homogeneous tissue. These equations provide a simple physical understanding of
arrhythmogenic patterns of period-doubling oscillations of action potential
duration with a spatially varying phase and amplitude as well as explicit
quantitative predictions that can be compared to ionic model simulations or
experiments. The form of the equations is expected to be valid for a large
class of ionic models but the coefficients are only derived analytically for a
two-variable ionic model and calculated numerically for the original Noble
model of Purkinje fiber action potential.In paced tissue, the main result is
the existence of a linear instability that produces a periodic pattern of
discordant alternans. Moreover, the patterns of alternans can be either
stationary, with fixed nodes, or travelling, with moving nodes and hence
quasiperiodic oscillations of action potential duration, depending on the
relative strength of the destabilizing effect of CV-restitution and the
stabilizing effect of diffusive coupling. In both the paced geometries and the
ring, the onset of alternans is different in tissue than for a paced isolated
cell. The implications of these results for alternans dynamics during
two-dimensional reentry are briefly discussed.

package for solving partial-differential-equations (PDEs), as based on the
finite-element method (FEM), can be configured to calculate the frequencies and
fields of the whispering-gallery (WG) modes of axisymmetric dielectric
resonators. The approach is traceable; it exploits the PDE-solver's ability to
accept the definition of solutions to Maxwell's equations in so-called `weak
form'. Associated expressions and methods for estimating a WG mode's volume,
filling factor(s) and, in the case of closed(open) resonators, its wall
(radiation) loss, are provided. As no transverse approxi-mation is imposed, the
approach remains accurate even for so-called quasi-TM and -TE modes of low,
finite azimuthal mode order. The approach's generality and utility are
demonstrated by modeling several non-trivial structures: (i)two different
optical microcavities [one toroidal made of silica, the other an AlGaAs
microdisk]; (ii) a 3rd-order microwave Bragg cavity containing alumina layers
(iii) two different cryogenic sapphire X-band microwave resonators. By fitting
one of the latter to a set of measured resonance frequencies, the dielectric
constants of sapphire at liquid-helium temperature have been estimated.

which the Casimir force density in even complex planar structures may be
calculated, appears not to be widely appreciated, and no single paper to the

Results may be seen as an important building block in the settling of issues of
fundamental interest, such as the long-standing dispute over the thermal
behaviour of the Casimir force or the question of what is the correct stress
tensor to apply, a discussion re-quickened by the newly suggested alternative
theory due to Raabe and Welsch.
