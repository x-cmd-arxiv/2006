spectroscopic observations that cover the central kiloparsec of NGC 7742. This
Sa galaxy hosts a spectacular nuclear starburst ring and nuclear regions
characterized by low-ionization emission. The gas in the ring rotates in the
opposite sense to the stars in the galaxy, suggesting a recent merging or
acquisition event. The combination of integral-field measurements for the
H-alpha + [NII] emission lines from DensePak and the H-beta and [OIII] emission
from Sauron allow the construction of diagnostic diagrams that highlight the
transition from star formation in the nuclear ring to excitation by
high-velocity shocks or by a central AGN towards the center. DensePak
measurements for the [SII] line ratio reveal very low gas densities in the
nuclear ring, Ne < 100 per cm^3, characteristic of massive HII regions.
Comparison with MAPPINGS III models for starbursts with low gas densities show
that the ring is of roughly solar metallicity. This suggests that the gas in
the nuclear ring originated in a stellar system capable of substantially
enriching the gas metallicity through sustained star formation. We suggest that
NGC 7742 cannibalised a smaller galaxy rich in metal-poor gas, and that star
formation episodes in the ring have since increased the metallicity to its
present value.

influence of spin-axis variations of an oblate planet on satellite orbits.
Near-equatorial satellites had long been believed to keep up with the oblate
primary's equator in the cause of its spin-axis variations. As demonstrated by
Efroimsky and Goldreich (2004), this opinion had stemmed from an inexact
interpretation of a correct result by Goldreich (1965). Though Goldreich (1965)
mentioned that his result (preservation of the initial inclination, up to small
oscillations about the moving equatorial plane) was obtained for non-osculating
inclination, his admonition has been persistently ignored for forty years.
  It was explained in Efroimsky and Goldreich (2004) that the equator
precession influences the osculating inclination of a satellite orbit already
in the first order over the perturbation caused by a transition from an
inertial to an equatorial coordinate system. It was later shown in Efroimsky
(2005a) that the secular part of the inclination is affected only in the second
order. This fact, anticipated by Goldreich (1965), remains valid for a constant
rate of the precession. It turns out that non-uniform variations of the
planetary spin state generate changes in the osculating elements, that are
linear in the planetary equator's total precession rate, rate that includes the
equinoctial precession, nutation, the Chandler wobble, and the polar wander.
  We work out a formalism which will help us to determine if these factors
cause a drift of a satellite orbit away from the evolving planetary equator.

the observed X-ray emission cannot be explained as global surface emission
arising from the surface of a cooling neutron star or magnetar. The emission
likely arises in one or more localized regions (``hot spots'') covering a small
fraction of the surface. We discuss these new results in the context of both

that analytical machinery with numerics. The resulting semianalytical theory is
then applied to Deimos over long time scales. In parallel, we carry out a
purely numerical integration in an inertial Cartesian frame. The results agree
to within a small margin, for over 10 Myr, demonstrating the applicability of
our semianalytical model over long timescales. This will enable us to employ it
at the further steps of the project, enriching the model with the tides, the
pull of the Sun, and the planet's triaxiality. Another goal of our work was to
check if the equinoctial precession predicted for a rigid Mars could have been
sufficient to repel the orbits away from the equator. We show that for low
initial inclinations, the orbit inclination reckoned from the precessing
equator of date is subject only to small variations. This is an extension, to
non-uniform precession given by the Colombo model, of an old result obtained by
Goldreich (1965) for the case of uniform precession and a low initial
inclination. However, near-polar initial inclinations may exhibit considerable
variations for up to +/- 10 deg in magnitude. Nevertheless, the analysis
confirms that an oblate planet can, indeed, afford large variations of the
equinoctial precession over hundreds of millions of years, without repelling
its near-equatorial satellites away from the equator of date: the satellite
inclination oscillates but does not show a secular increase. Nor does it show
secular decrease, a fact that is relevant to the discussion of the possibility
of high-inclination capture of Phobos and Deimos.

that a small fraction of the accreting stars presents broad profiles with
Halpha equivalent widths smaller than the canonical limit separating CTTS and
WTTS. The number of strong accretors appears to be lower than in younger
regions, and a large number of CTTS have very small accretion rates
(dM/dt<10^{-9} Msun/yr). Taking into account that the spectral energy
distributions are consistent with dust evolution (grain growth/settling) in the
innermost disk, this suggests a parallel evolution of the dusty and gaseous
components. We also observe that about half of the ""transition objects"" (stars
with no IR excesses at wavelengths shorter than ~6 micron) do not show any
signs of active accretion, whereas the other half is accreting with accretion
rates <10^{-9} Msun/yr. These zero or very low accretion rates reveal important
gas evolution and/or gas depletion in the innermost disk, which could be
related to grain growth up to planetesimal or even planet sizes. Finally, we
examine the rotational velocities of accreting and non accreting stars, finding

intrinsic variability since the shorter wavelength IRAC bandpasses probe more
deeply into late L dwarf atmospheres than the longer wavelengths. A cloud
feature occupying a small percentage (1-2 %) of the visible hemisphere could
account for the observed amplitude of variation. If, instead, the variability

\~3\pm1.5. The scale heights are only 20% larger than the radii of the giant
star-forming clumps and a factor of ~10 larger than the rms clump deviations
around the midplanes. This suggests the clumps formed from midplane gas and
dissolved to make the thick disks. Redshifted stellar population models suggest
ages of ~1 Gy and mass column densities from 4 to 40 Msun pc^{-2}. The UDF
disks look like young versions of modern thick disks. This resemblance is
difficult to understand if galaxies grow over time or if subsequent accretion
of thin disks gravitationally shrinks the observed thick disks. More likely,
high redshift disks are thick because their mass column densities are low; a
velocity dispersion of only 14 km/s reproduces the observed thickness. Modern
thick disks require more heating at high redshift. This is possible if the gas
that eventually makes the thin disk is in place before the youngest age of a
modern thick disk, and if the existing stars are heated during the delivery of
this gas.

these pairs generate a transverse thermoelectric (Nernst) signal. In amorphous

the Cooper pairs Nernst signal dominate the response of the normal electrons

(HTSC's), a single nonmagnetic impurity frequently causes nontrivial widespread
change of the electronic states. To elucidate this long-standing issue, we
study a Hubbard model with a strong onsite impurity potential based on an
improved fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation, which we call the GV^I-FLEX
method. This model corresponds to the HTSC with dilute nonmagnetic impurity
concentration. We find that (i) both local and staggered susceptibilities are
strongly enhanced around the impurity. By this reason, (ii) the quasiparticle
lifetime as well as the local density of states (DOS) are strongly suppressed
in a wide area around the impurity (like a Swiss cheese hole), which causes the
``huge residual resistivity'' beyond the s-wave unitary scattering limit. We
stress that the excess quasiparticle damping rate caused by impurities has
strong momentum-dependence due to non-s-wave scatterings induced by many-body
effects, so the structure of the ``hot spot/cold spot'' in the host system
persists against impurity doping. This result could be examined by the ARPES
measurements. In addition, (iii) only a few percent of impurities can causes a
``Kondo-like'' upturn of resistivity ($d\rho/dT<0$) at low temperatures when
the system is very close to the AF quantum critical point (QCP). The results
(i)-(iii) obtained in the present study, which cannot be derived by the simple
FLEX approximation, naturally explains the main impurity effects in HTSC's. We
also discuss the impurity effect in heavy fermion systems and organic
superconductors.

that DyCo5 has planar anisotropy at room temperature whereas all the other

attributed to a change in the easy magnetization direction from the ab-plane to
the c-axis, as the temperature is increased. The anisotropy field and the first
order anisotropy constant are found to be quite high in all the compounds

steepness of the repulsive potential); thus, we find decreasing g in going from
van der Waals fluids to ionic liquids. For strongly H-bonded materials, such as
low molecular weight polypropylene glycol and water, the superpositioning

provide optimality results for both e and er, in the form of Galois insertions
from the concrete to the abstract domains and of optimal abstract operations.
The Galois insertion property is obtained by restricting the abstract domains
to those elements which do not contain garbage, by using an abstract garbage

Algebraic Quantum Gravity (AQG):The quantum kinematics of AQG is determined by
an abstract $*-$algebra generated by a countable set of elementary operators
labelled by an algebraic graph. The quantum dynamics of AQG is governed by a
single Master Constraint operator. While AQG is inspired by Loop Quantum
Gravity (LQG), it differs drastically from it because in AQG there is
fundamentally no topology or differential structure. A natural Hilbert space
representation acquires the structure of an infinite tensor product (ITP) whose
separable strong equivalence class Hilbert subspaces (sectors) are left
invariant by the quantum dynamics. The missing information about the topology
and differential structure of the spacetime manifold as well as about the
background metric to be approximated is supplied by coherent states. Given such
data, the corresponding coherent state defines a sector in the ITP which can be
identified with a usual QFT on the given manifold and background. Thus, AQG
contains QFT on all curved spacetimes at once, possibly has something to say
about topology change and provides the contact with the familiar low energy
physics. In particular, in two companion papers we develop semiclassical
perturbation theory for AQG and LQG and thereby show that the theory admits a
semiclassical limit whose infinitesimal gauge symmetry agrees with that of
General Relativity. In AQG everything is computable with sufficient precision
and no UV divergences arise due to the background independence of the
undamental combinatorial structure. Hence, in contrast to lattice gauge theory
on a background metric, no continuum limit has to be taken, there simply is no
lattice regulator that must be sent to zero.

(extended) algebraic Master constraint operator and show that it reproduces the
correct infinitesimal generators of General Relativity. Therefore the question
whether General Relativity is included in the semiclassical sector of the
theory, which is still an open problem in LQG, can be significantly improved in
the framework of AQG. For the calculations we will substitute SU(2) by U(1)^3.

AQG reproduces the correct infinitesimal dynamics in the semiclassical limit,
provided one incorrectly substitutes the non -- Abelean group SU(2) by the
Abelean group $U(1)^3$ in the calculations. The mere reason why that
substitution was performed at all is that in the non -- Abelean case the volume
operator, pivotal for the definition of the dynamics, is not diagonisable by
analytical methods. This, in contrast to the Abelean case, so far prohibited
semiclassical computations. In this paper we show why this unjustified
substitution nevertheless reproduces the correct physical result: Namely, we
introduce for the first time semiclassical perturbation theory within AQG (and
LQG) which allows to compute expectation values of interesting operators such
as the master constraint as a power series in $\hbar$ with error control. That
is, in particular matrix elements of fractional powers of the volume operator
can be computed with extremely high precision for sufficiently large power of
$\hbar$ in the $\hbar$ expansion. With this new tool, the non -- Abelean
calculation, although technically more involved, is then exactly analogous to
the Abelean calculation, thus justifying the Abelean analysis in retrospect.
The results of this paper turn AQG into a calculational discipline.

Hawking's semi-classical argument, which dictates that the quantum coherence

three decades, this contradiction has been one of the major obstacles to the
ultimate unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Recently, a
final-state boundary condition inside the black hole was proposed to resolve
this contradiction for bosons. However, no such a remedy exists for fermions
yet even though Hawking effect for fermions has been studied for sometime.
Here, I report that the black hole information paradox can be resolved for the
fermions by imposing a final state boundary condition, which resembles local
measurement with post selection. In this scenario, the evaporation can be seen
as the post selection determined by random unitary transformation. It is also
found that the evaporation processes strongly depends on the boundary condition

weak energy condition, a spherically symmetric electrically charged
electrovacuum soliton has obligatory de Sitter center in which the electric
field vanishes while the energy density of electromagnetic vacuum achieves its
maximal value. De Sitter vacuum supplies a particle with the finite positive
electromagnetic mass related to breaking of space-time symmetry from the de
Sitter group in the origin. By the G\""urses-G\""ursey algorithm based on the
Newman-Trautman technique it is transformed into a spinning electrovacuum
soliton asymptotically Kerr-Newman for a distant observer. De Sitter center
becomes de Sitter equatorial disk which has both perfect conductor and ideal
diamagnetic properties. The interior de Sitter vacuum disk displays
superconducting behavior within a single spinning soliton. This behavior found
for an arbitrary nonlinear lagrangian ${\cal L}(F)$, is generic for the class
of regular spinning electrovacuum solutions describing both black holes and
particle-like structures.

Attrition Equation as a metamodel to describe outcomes of cellular automaton
combat models. This Fractal Attrition Equation has been proposed as a
replacement for the Lanchester equation. Unlike Lanchester's equation, it is
based on a measurement of the spatial distribution of forces involved in a
battle, and incorporates this by use of the concept of the fractal dimension.
In this report, the form of the expected Loss-Exchange-Ratio function based on
this equation is determined. It is shown how this function can be used as a
Metamodel to describe the outcome of some cellular automaton models. While this
is not an exhaustive proof of the validity of the equation, the case discussed
does display interesting features which should be further investigated. This is
particularly so given the earlier work of the authors in demonstrating that the
Fractal Attrition Equation explains certain features of historical combat data.

time. Then without any sign it starts to rise abruptly to a high value and then
decreases smoothly to the previous low value again. The process of an abrupt
rise followed by a gentle decrease repeats again and again but without obvious
characteristic length as time goes on. The phenomenon is similar to the
collapse of a sand pile with sands being added continuously from the top. We
define the scale of collapse of the population variance by the difference of

Lett. 98, 110502 (2007)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.110502",,"quant-ph",,"  We present a method to estimate entanglement measures in experiments. We show
how a lower bound on a generic entanglement measure can be derived from the
measured expectation values of any finite collection of entanglement witnesses.
Hence witness measurements are given a quantitative meaning without the need of
further experimental data. We apply our results to a recent multi-photon
experiment [M. Bourennane et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 087902 (2004)], giving
bounds on the entanglement of formation and the geometric measure of
entanglement in this experiment.

$d\otimes d$ Bell diagonal entanglement witnesses are provided. By using
Jamiolkowski isomorphism, it is shown that the corresponding positive maps are
the generalized qudit Choi maps. Also by manipulating particular $d\otimes d$
Bell diagonal separable states and constructing corresponding bound entangled
states, it is shown that thus obtained $d\otimes d$ BDEW's (consequently qudit
Choi maps) are non-decomposable in certain range of their parameters.

explicitly and quantum fluctuations implicitly, whereas a comparable continuous
random field model would describe both thermal and quantum fluctuations
explicitly. An ideal classical measurement does not affect the results of later
measurements, in contrast to ideal quantum measurements, but we can describe
the consequences of the thermal and quantum fluctuations of classically
non-ideal measurement apparatuses explicitly. Some details of continuous random
fields and of Bell inequalities for random fields will be discussed.
