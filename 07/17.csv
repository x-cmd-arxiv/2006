simulations of driven, MHD, isothermal molecular clouds (MCs). The models
represent a range of magnetic field strengths in MCs from subcritical to
non-magnetic regimes. We identify CCs at different density thresholds, and for
each object, we calculate all the terms that enter the Eulerian form of the
virial theorem (EVT). A CC is considered gravitationally bound when the
gravitational term in the EVT is larger than the amount for the system to be
virialized, which is more stringent than the condition that it be large enough
to make the total volume energy negative. We also calculate, quantities
commonly used in the observations to indicate the state of gravitational
boundedness of CCs such as the Jeans number J_c, the mass-to magnetic flux
ratio mu_c, and the virial parameter alpha_vir. Our results show that: a) CCs
are dynamical out-of-equilibrium structures. b) The surface energies are of the
same order than their volume counterparts c) CCs are either in the process of
being compressed or dispersed by the velocity field. Yet, not all CCs that have
a compressive net kinetic energy are gravitationally bound. d) There is no
1-to-1 correspondence between the state of gravitational boundedness of a CC as
described by the virial analysis or as implied by the classical indicators. In
general, in the virial analysis, we observe that only the inner regions of the
objects are gravitationally bound, whereas J_c, alpha_vir, and mu_c estimates
tend to show that they are more gravitationally bound at the lowest threshold
levels and more magnetically supercritical. g) We observe, in the non-magnetic
simulation, the existence of a bound core with structural and dynamical
properties that resemble those of the Bok globule Barnard 68 (B68).

the internal extinction. On the contrary, the low extinction part of the data
of $z \ge 0.25$ clearly showed an excess of the points with respect to an empty

pointed to an interrelation between the estimated luminosity distance and

introduced a hidden variable making use of the technics of factor analysis.

general form of the metric is obtained, and the corresponding field equations
are divided into three groups, one is valid on each of the two 3-branes, and
the third is valid in the bulk. The Einstein tensor on the 3-branes is
expressed in terms of the discontinuities of the first-order derivatives of the

As applications, we consider two different cases, one is in which the bulk is
locally $AdS_{5}$, and the other is where it is vacuum. In some cases, it is
shown that the universe is first decelerating and then accelerating. The global
structure of the bulk as well as the 3-branes is also studied, and found that

provide the detection of and the absolute fluxes for more than 60 molecular
features (mainly from H2 in the near- and mid-infrared and from H2O, CO and OH

levels from v=0 to v=4 have been interpreted in the context of a state-of-art
shock code, whose output parameters are adopted as input to a Large Velocity
Gradient computation in order to interpret the FIR emission of CO, H2O and OH.
Results. The H2 emission can be interpreted as originating in either
steady-state J-type shocks or in quasi-steady J-type shocks with magnetic
precursor. However, our multi-species analysis shows that only a model of a
J-type shock with magnetic precursor (v_shock=18 km/s, n_H=10^4 cm^-3, B=100
microG, age=400 yr) can account for both the observed H2 emission and the CO
and H2O lines. Such a model predicts a H2O abundance of ~ 7 10^-5, in agreement
with estimations from other shock models for outflows associated with low mass
protostars. We can exclude the possibility that the observed atomic lines arise
in the same shock as the molecular lines, and give arguments in favour of the
presence of a further high-velocity, fully dissociative shock component in the
region. Finally, in view of the forthcoming spectroscopic facilities on board
of the Herschel satellite, we provide predictions for H2O lines considered to
be the most suitable for diagnostic purposes.

observatory to monitor the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) NGC 5204 X-1. This
was composed of a 50-ks observation, followed by ten 5-ks follow-ups spaced
initially at ~ 3, then at ~ 10 day intervals. The ULX flux is seen to vary by
factors ~ 5 on timescales of a few days, but no strong variability is seen on
timescales shorter than an hour. There is no evidence for a periodic signal in
the X-ray data. An examination of the X-ray colour variations over the period
of the campaign shows the ULX emission consistently becomes spectrally harder
as its flux increases. The X-ray spectrum from the 50-ks observation can be
fitted by a number of disparate spectral models, all of which describe a smooth
continuum with, unusually for a ULX, a broad emission feature evident at 0.96
keV. The spectral variations, both within the 50-ks observation and over the
course of the whole campaign, can then be explained solely by variations in the
continuum component. In the context of an optically-thick corona model (as
found in other recent results for ULXs) the spectral variations can be
explained by the heating of the corona as the luminosity of the ULX increases,
consistent with the behaviour of at least one Galactic black hole system in the
strongly-Comptonised very high state. We find no new evidence supporting the
presence of an intermediate-mass black hole in this ULX.

dwarfs which merge and become cool helium-rich supergiants. Our object is to
compare predicted rotation velocities with observations of highly evolved stars
believed to have formed from such a merger, including RCrB and extreme helium
stars. The principal study involves a binary containing a 0.6 solar mass CO
white dwarf, and a 0.3 solar mass He white dwarf. The initial condition for the
angular momentum distribution is defined where the secondary fills its Roche
Lobe. We assume conservation of angular momentum to compute the angular
momentum distribution in a collisionless disk and subsequently in the giant
envelope. At the end of shell-helium burning, the giant contracts to form a
white dwarf. We derive the surface rotation velocity during this contraction.
The calculation is repeated for a range of initial mass ratios, and also for
the case of mergers between two helium white dwarfs; the latter will contract
to the helium main-sequence rather than the white dwarf sequence. Assuming
complete conservation of angular momentum, we predict acceptable angular
rotation rates for cool giants and during the initial subsequent contraction.
However such stars will only survive spin-up to reach the white dwarf sequence
(CO+He merger) if the initial mass ratio is close to unity. He+He merger
products must lose angular momentum in order to reach the helium main sequence.
Minimum observed rotation velocities in extreme helium stars are lower than our
predictions by at least one half, indicating that CO+He mergers must lose at
least one half of their angular momentum.

the spatial scales at which important processes occur, such as accretion, dust
processing, and planet formation. The main results obtained so far can be
summarized as follows: 1. The measured interferometric visibilities are in good
qualitative agreement with those predicted by models of circumstellar disks. In
particular, a predicted correlation between the strength of the far-infrared
excess and the spatial structure of the disk is confirmed by direct
measurements; 2. In several objects strong evidence for deviations from
circular symmetry is present, indicating that an inclined disk is indeed the
dominant component seen in the mid-infrared; 3. The dust properties are not
uniform over the disk, but are instead a strong function of distance to the
central star. The dust in the innermost disk regions is observed to be more
``processed'' than the dust further out, both in Herbig Ae star disks and in

diffusion with a noise-induced first-order phase transition. The generalized
diffusion manifests itself in the divergence of averages of wavefunctions
(correlators). This divergence is controlled by the Lyapunov exponent $\gamma$,
which is the inverse of the localization length, $\xi=1/\gamma$. The appearance
of the generalized diffusion arises due to the instability of a fundamental
mode corresponding to correlators. The generalized diffusion can be described
in terms of signal theory, which operates with the concepts of input and output
signals and the filter function. Delocalized states correspond to bounded
output signals, and localized states to unbounded output signals, respectively.
The transition from bounded to unbounded signals is defined uniquely by the

superconductors is proportional to \sin \xi. This particular dependence on \xi
may find application of the proposed set-up in making a Josephson spin switch.

procedure in the disorder with exact transfer matrix calculations in each
sample to measure the negative tail of ground state energy distribution
$P_d(E_0)$ for the directed polymer in a random medium of dimension $d=1,2,3$.
In $d=1$, we check the validity of the algorithm by a direct comparison with
the exact result, namely the Tracy-Widom distribution. In dimensions $d=2$ and
$d=3$, we measure the negative tail up to ten standard deviations, which
correspond to probabilities of order $P_d(E_0) \sim 10^{-22}$. Our results are
in agreement with Zhang's argument, stating that the negative tail exponent
$\eta(d)$ of the asymptotic behavior $\ln P_d (E_0) \sim - | E_0 |^{\eta(d)}$
as $E_0 \to -\infty$ is directly related to the fluctuation exponent
$\theta(d)$ (which governs the fluctuations $\Delta E_0(L) \sim L^{\theta(d)}$
of the ground state energy $E_0$ for polymers of length $L$) via the simple
formula $\eta(d)=1/(1-\theta(d))$. Along the paper, we comment on the

to study the problem of protein folding. The goal of this model is to find an
unbiased effective potential that has included the effects of water and at the

sequence in reasonable time. For this purpose, rather than focusing on the real
folding dynamics or full structural details at the atomic scale, we adopt the
Monte Carlo method and the coarse-grained representation of the protein in
which both side-chains and the backbones are replaced by suitable geometrical
objects in consistent with the known structure. On top of the coarse-grained
representation, our effective potential can be developed. Two new interactions,
the dipole-dipole interactions and the local hydrophobic interactions, are
introduced and are shown to be as crucial as the hydrogen bonds for forming the
secondary structures. In particular, for the first time, we demonstrate that
the resulting reduced model can successfully fold proteins with both helix and
sheet structures without using any biased potential. Further analyses show that
this model can also fold other proteins in reasonable accuracy and thus
provides a promising starting point for the problem of protein folding.

diversity is an orthogonal strategy. However, the large number of long paths
increases the number of underlying links and consecutively the overall link
failure rate. This may increase the overall requirement in redundant FEC
packets for combating the link failures. We introduce the Redundancy Overall
Requirement (ROR) metric, a routing coefficient specifying the total number of
FEC packets required for compensation of all underlying link failures. We
present a capillary routing algorithm for constructing layer by layer steadily

and T in 'tHooft-Feynman gauge, including the ghost, unphysical
Goldstone-boson, and appropriate ""pinch"" contributions required to obtain
gauge-invariant results for the one-loop self-energy functions. We demonstrate
that the chiral-logarithmic corrections naturally separate into two parts, a
model-independent part arising from scaling below the \rho mass, which has the
same form as the large Higgs-mass dependence of the S or T parameter in the
standard model, and a second model-dependent contribution arising from scaling
between the \rho mass and the cutoff of the model. The form of the universal

models may be viewed as dual to models of dynamical symmetry breaking akin to
""walking technicolor"", and in these terms our calculation is the first to
compute the subleading 1/N corrections to the S and T parameters. We also
discuss the reduction of the model to the ``two-site'' model, which is the
usual electroweak chiral lagrangian, noting the ``non-decoupling''

counterterms indicate possible violations of the space or time homogeneity or
space isotropy in the gravitational phenomena. However, the necessity of the
phenomenologically most interesting terms such as linear in the space-time
curvature or torsion, is related to the non-constant nature of the
dimensionless Lorentz and CPT breaking parameters.

should vanish at leading order in the traditional large $N_c$ (TLNC) limit.
Quark loops are not suppressed in the recently proposed orientifold large $N_c$
(OLNC) limit, and thus the strange quark content should be non-vanishing at
leading order. The Skyrme model is supposed to encode the large $N_c$ behavior
of baryons, and can be formulated for both of these large $N_c$ limits. There
is an apparent paradox associated with the large $N_c$ behavior of strange
quark matrix elements in the Skyrme model. The model only distinguishes between
the two large $N_c$ limits via the $N_c$ scaling of the couplings and the
Witten-Wess-Zumino term, so that a vanishing leading order strange matrix
element in the TLNC limit implies that it also vanishes at leading order in the
OLNC limit, contrary to the expectations based on the
suppression/non-suppression of quark loops. The resolution of this paradox is
that the Skyrme model does not include the most general type of meson-meson
interaction and, in fact, contains no meson-meson interactions which vanish for
the TLNC limit but not the OLNC. The inclusion of such terms in the model
yields the expected scaling for strange quark matrix elements.

simultaneous linear equations. Roots of unity play a crucial role. Thus for
diagonalizing the 81 dimensional space for N=3, $r=4$, one has to solve a
maximal set of 5 linear equations. A supplementary symmetry relates invariant
subspaces pairwise ($W=(r,Nr)$ and so on) so that only one of each pair needs

quite different from, possibly generalized, algebraic Bethe ansatz. Chain
Hamiltonians are studied. The specific types of spin flips they induce and
propagate are pointed out. The inverse Cayley transform of the YB matrix giving
the potential leading to factorizable $S$-matrix is constructed explicitly for

indicates that the increasing width of the initial isospin distributions is
reflected by a significant modification of the isoscaling slope for the final

the isoscaling slope assumes the limiting value of the two individual initial
nuclei while for wide initial isotopic distributions the slope for hot
fragments approaches the initial value. The isoscaling slopes for final cold
fragments increase due to secondary emissions. The experimentally observed
evolution of the isoscaling parameter in multifragmentation of hot
quasiprojectiles at E$_{inc}$=50 AMeV, fragmentation of $^{86}$Kr projectiles
at E$_{inc}$=25 AMeV and multifragmentation of target spectators at
relativistic energies was reproduced by a simulation with the dynamical stage
described using the appropriate model (deep inelastic transfer and incomplete
fusion at the Fermi energy domain and spectator-participant model at

statistical multifragmentation model. In all cases the isoscaling behavior was
reproduced by a proper description of the dynamical stage and no unambiguous

$v_{8^\prime}$ NN and the Urbana IX 3N potentials. Quantum Monte Carlo theory,
specifically the Auxiliary Field Diffusion Monte Carlo method, and Correlated
Basis Function theory are employed in order to get quantitative and reliable
estimates of the gap. They both fully take into account the medium
modifications due to the interaction induced correlations. The two methods are
in good agreement up to the maximum gap density and both point to a slight
reduction with respect to the standard BCS value. In fact, the maximum gap is
about $2.5 \text{MeV}$ at $k_F \sim 0.8 \text{fm}^{-1}$ in BCS and 2.3--$2.4
\text{MeV}$ at $k_F \sim 0.6 \text{fm}^{-1}$ in correlated matter. At higher
densities the Quantum Monte Carlo gap becomes close to BCS. In general, the
computed medium polarization effects are much smaller than those previously
estimated within \emph{all theories}. Truncations of Argonne $v_{8^\prime}$ to
simpler forms give the same gaps in BCS, provided the truncated potentials have
been refitted to the same NN data set. Differences among the models appear in
the correlated theories, most of the reduction being attributable to the tensor
force. The three--nucleon interaction provides an additional increase of the
gap of about 0.35 MeV.

The reason for this intervention was that before the oil crisis in 1974 Japan
agriculture production prices exhibited irregular and large amplitude changes.
By means of analysis of correlations and a combination of singular spectrum
analysis (SSA), principal component analysis (PCA), and time delay phase space
construction (TDPSC) we study the influence of the government measures on the
domestic piglet prices and production in Japan. We show that the government
regulation politics was successful and leaded (i) to a decrease of the
nonstationarities and to increase of predictability of the piglet price; (ii)
to a coupling of the price and production cycles; (iii) to increase of
determinism of the dynamics of the fluctuations of piglet price around the year
average price. The investigated case is an example confirming the thesis that a
large agent can change in a significant way the environment of the small agents
in complex (economic or financial) systems which can be crucial for their
survival or extinction.

magnitude of the step size of this random walk is not given by our classical

${\cal E}_0$ with an arbitrary four-qubit mixed state resource $\Xi$ is
equivalent to a generalized depolarizing bichannel with probabilities given by
the maximally entangled components of the resource. These are defined in terms
of our four-qubit entangled states. We define the generalized singlet fraction
${\cal G}[\Xi]$, and illustrate its physical significance with several
examples. We argue that in order to teleport arbitrary two-qubit states with
average fidelity better than is classically possible, we have to demand that
${\cal G}[\Xi] > 1/2$. In addition, we conjecture that when ${\cal G}[\Xi] <
1/4$ then no entanglement can be teleported. It is shown that to determine the
usefulness of $\Xi$ for ${\cal E}_0$, it is necessary to analyze ${\cal
