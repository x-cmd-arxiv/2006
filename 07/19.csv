binary AR Aur. AR Aur is the only known eclipsing binary with a HgMn primary
star exactly on the ZAMS and a secondary star still contracting towards the
ZAMS. We detect for the first time in the spectra of the primary star that for
many elements the line profiles are variable over the rotation period. The
strongest profile variations are found for the elements Pt, Hg, Sr, Y, Zr, He
and Nd, while the line profiles of O, Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, and Fe show only weak
distortions over the rotation period. The slight variability of He and Y is
also confirmed by the study of high resolution spectra of another HgMn star:
alpha And. A preliminary modelling of the inhomogeneous distribution has been
carried out for Sr and Y. Our analysis shows that these elements are very
likely concentrated in a fractured ring along the rotational equator. It may be
an essential clue for the explanation of the origin of the chemical anomalies
in HgMn stars (which are very frequently found in binary and multiple systems)
that one large fraction of the ring is missing exactly on the surface area
which is permanently facing the secondary, and another small one on the almost
opposite side. The results presented about the inhomogeneous distribution of
various chemical elements over the stellar surface of the primary suggest new
directions for investigations to solve the question of the origin of abundance
anomalies in B-type stars with HgMn peculiarity.

sigma Ori E. To obtain reliable wind parameters for this star we first
calculate an NLTE wind model and derive wind mass-loss rate and terminal
velocity. Using corresponding force multipliers we study the possibility of
helium decoupling. We find that helium decoupling is not possible for realistic
values of helium charge (calculated from NLTE wind models). Helium decoupling
seems only possible for a very low helium charge. The reason for this behaviour
is the strong coupling between helium and hydrogen. We also find that
frictional heating becomes important in the outer parts of the wind of sigma
Ori E due to the collisions between some heavier elements and the passive
components -- hydrogen and helium. For a metallicity ten times lower than the
solar one both hydrogen and helium decouple from the metals and may fall back
onto the stellar surface. However, this does not explain the observed chemical
peculiarity since both these components decouple together from the absorbing
ions. Although we do not include the effects of the magnetic field into our
models, we argue that the presence of a magnetic field will likely not
significantly modify the derived results because in such case model equations
describe the motion parallel to the magnetic field.

oscillations on accreting neutron stars remains a matter of debate. Of
particular interest is whether the burst oscillation mechanism differs between
the bursting millisecond pulsars and the non-pulsing systems. One means to
diagnose this is to study the energy dependence of the burst oscillations: here
we present an analysis of oscillations from 28 bursts observed during the 2003
outburst of the accreting millisecond pulsar XTE J1814-338. We find that the
fractional amplitude of the burst oscillations falls with energy, in contrast
to the behaviour found by Muno et al. (2003) in the burst oscillations from a
set of non-pulsing systems. The drop with energy mirrors that seen in the
accretion-powered pulsations; in this respect XTE J1814-338 behaves like the
other accreting millisecond pulsars. The burst oscillations show no evidence
for either hard or soft lags, in contrast to the persistent pulsations, which
show soft lags of up to 50 $\mu$s. The fall in amplitude with energy is
inconsistent with current surface mode and simple hot spot models of burst
oscillations. We discuss improvements to the models and uncertainties in the

Detection Array (AMANDA) has recently presented the so far most restrictive
limit on diffuse neutrino emission (Achterberg et al. 2007). Stacking limits
which apply to AGN point source classes rather than to single point sources

limits as diffuse limits to the emission from considered point source class is
presented. The limits can for instance be used to constrain the predicted
correlation of EGRET-detected diffuse emission and neutrino emission. Also, the
correlation between X-ray and neutrino emission is constrained. Further results
for source classes like TeV blazars and FR-II galaxies are presented. Starting

role in determining their dynamical and star-forming properties. However, H2,
the dominant molecular species, is difficult to observe directly, particularly
in the regions where most molecular gas is thought to reside. Its mass is
therefore commonly inferred by assuming a direct proportionality with the
integrated intensity of the CO(J=1-0) emission line, using a CO-to-H2
conversion factor, X. Although a canonical value for X is used extensively in
such estimates, there is increasing evidence, both theoretical and
observational, that the conversion factor may vary by over an order of
magnitude under conditions different to those of the local neighbourhood. In an
effort to understand the influence of changing environmental conditions on the
conversion factor, we derive theoretical estimates of X for a wide range of
physical parameters using a photon-dominated region (PDR) time-dependent
chemical model, benchmarking key results against those of an independent PDR
code to ensure reliability. Based on these results, the sensitivity of the X
factor to change in each physical parameter is interpreted in terms of the
chemistry and physical processes within the cloud. In addition to confirming
previous observationally derived trends, we find that the time-dependence of
the chemistry, often neglected in such models, has a considerable influence on
the value of the conversion factor.

massive star formation, with particular attention to the least well-understood
aspects of the problem: fragmentation during collapse, interactions of newborn
stars with the gas outside their parent core, and the effects of radiation
pressure feedback. Through a combination of observation, analytic argument, and
numerical simulation, I develop a model for massive star formation by
gravitational collapse in which massive cores collapse to produce single stars
or (more commonly) small-multiple systems, and these stars do not gain
significant mass from outside their parent core by accretion of either gas or
other stars. Collapse is only very slightly inhibited by feedback from the
massive star, thanks to beaming of the radiation by a combination of
protostellar outflows and radiation-hydrodynamic instabilities. Based on these
findings, I argue that many of the observed properties of young star clusters
can be understood as direct translations of the properties of their gas phase
progenitors. Finally, I discuss unsolved problems in the theory of massive star

Point Process Algorithm (PPA), a Bayesian technique for extracting planetary
signals using the sine-chopped outputs of a dual nulling interferometer. It is
so-called because it represents the system being observed as a set of points in
a suitably-defined state space, thus providing a natural way of incorporating
our prior knowledge of the compact nature of the targets of interest. It can
also incorporate the spatial covariance of the exozodi as prior information
which could help mitigate against false detections. Data at multiple

variations of the planetary signals. Input parameters include the RMS
measurement noise and the a priori probability of the presence of a planet. The
output can be represented as an image of the intensity distribution on the sky,
optimized for the detection of point sources. Previous approaches by others to
the problem of planet detection for TPF-I have relied on the potentially
non-robust identification of peaks in a ""dirty"" image, usually a correlation
map. Tests with synthetic data suggest that the PPA provides greater
sensitivity to faint sources than does the standard approach (correlation map +
CLEAN), and will be a useful tool for optimizing the design of TPF-I.

variability that may arise from a polarized ""blob"" orbiting the black hole.
Finally, we use the ensemble of observations to determine the rotation measure.
This represents the first statistically significant rotation measure
determination and the only one made without resorting to comparing position
angles measured at separate epochs. We find a rotation measure of

the two-point correlation function of the three dimensional cosmic shear on the
expansion history of the universe. We first express the redshift dependent
total equation of state parameter in terms of the growing mode of the gauge
invariant metric perturbation in the conformal-Newtonian gauge for the case of
adiabatic perturbations. We then express the redshift dependent angular moments
of the shear two-point correlation function as an integral in terms of the
metric perturbation. We present the final explicit expression for the case of a
Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum of primordial perturbations. Our analysis is
restricted to the linear regime. We use our results to make a preliminary study
of the required sensitivity that will allow cosmic shear observations to add
significant information about the expansion history of the universe.

to cosmological simulations of the standard LCDM structure formation scenario

large-scale clustering patterns as well as (individual) dark matter halos.
Comparing these simulations to usual N-body simulations, we find that (i) the
new (hydrodynamic) model entails a proliferation of low--mass halos, and (ii)
dark matter halos have a higher degree of rotational support. These results
agree with the theoretical expectation about the qualitative behaviour of the

a drain of inflow kinetic energy and a source of vorticity by the small-scale

2.3 per cent) of the radiation from the RIAF in the inner region of the disk
can photo-ionize the line-emitting disk portion, because the solid angle of the
outer disk portion subtended to the inner region of the RIAF is too small. We
propose that only those AGNs with sufficient matter above the disk (slowly
moving jets or outflows) can scatter enough photons radiated from the inner
disk region to the outer line-emitting disk portion. Our model predicts a
power-law r-dependent line emissivity with an index ~2.5, which is consistent
with \beta~2-3 required by the model fittings for double-peaked line profiles.
Using a sample of radio-loud double-peaked line emitters, we show that the
outer disk regions can be efficiently illuminated by the photons scattered from
the electron-positron jets with \gamma_j<2. It is consistent with the fact that
no double-peaked emission line is present in strong radio quasars with
relativistic jets. For radio-quiet counterparts, slow outflows with Thomson
scattering depth ~0.2 can scatter sufficient photons to the line-emitting
regions. This model can therefore solve the energy budget problem for
double-peaked line emitters.

splitting of the integer edge into conducting and insulating stripes, which
enable the occurrence of the more relevant backscattering processes of

parameters used in the experiments we find that the conducting channels are
widely separated by the insulating stripes and that their presence alters
significantly the low-energy dynamics of the edges. Interchannel impurity
scattering does not influence strongly the tunneling exponents as they are
found to be irrelevant processes at low energies. Exponents of backscattering
at the point contact are unaffected by interchannel Coulomb interactions since
all channels have same chirality of propagation.

function of the magnetic field for electrons confined in a strained silicon
quantum well grown on a tilted SiGe substrate, using a parameterized
tight-binding method. For a zero substrate tilt angle, the valley splitting
slightly decreases with increasing magnetic field. In contrast, the valley
splitting for a finite substrate tilt angle exhibits a strong and
non-monotonous dependence on the magnetic field strength. The valley splitting
of the first Landau level shows an exponential increase followed by a slow
saturation as the magnetic field strength increases. The valley splitting of
the second and third Landau levels shows an oscillatory behavior. The
non-monotonous dependence is explained by the phase variation of the Landau
level wave function along the washboard-like interface between the tilted
quantum well and the buffer material. The phase variation is the direct
consequence of the misorientation between the crystal axis and the confinement
direction of the quantum well. This result suggests that the magnitude of the
valley splitting can be tuned by controlling the Landau-level filling factor

In our previous analysis (Phys. Rev. B 71, 035110 (2005)), the scattering by
the core-hole potential was treated within the Born approximation, and a
crude-model density of states was used for the $4p$ band. We improve the
analysis by taking account of the multiple scattering in Cu3d-O$2p$ bands and
by using a realistic $4p$ DOS obtained from a band calculation. The multiple
scattering effect is evaluated with the use of the time representation
developed by Nozi\`eres and De Dominicis. It is found that the multiple
scattering effect makes the $K$-edge peak in the absorption coefficient shift
to the lower energy region as a function of photon energy, that is, the photon
energy required to excite the $1s$ electron to the $K$-edge peak reduces. It is
also found that the multiple-scattering effect does not change the two-peak
structure in the RIXS spectra but modifies slightly the shape as a function of
energy loss. These findings suggests that the multiple scattering effect could
mainly be included into a renormalization of the core-level energy and partly
justify the Born approximation, leading to a future application to the RIXS in
three-dimensional systems.

specific attention is payed to the non linear part of the dispersion relation
and its interplay with the continuum of single fermionic excitations. In
particular we consider in detail the merging of collective mode into the
continuum of single fermionic excitations. This occurs not only on the BCS side
of the crossover, but also slightly beyond unitarity on the BEC side. Another
remarkable feature is the very linear behaviour of the dispersion relation in
the vicinity of unitarity almost up to merging with the continuum. Finally,
while on the BEC side the mode is quite analogous to the Bogoliubov mode, a
difference appear at high wavevectors. On the basis of our results we determine
the Landau critical velocity in the BEC-BCS crossover which is found to be

as the Cartesian product $R_1\times R_2\times...\times R_k$ where $R_i$(for
$1\leq i\leq k$) is a closed interval of the form $[a_i,a_i+1]$ on the real
line. A $k$-cube representation of a graph $G$ is a mapping of the vertices of
$G$ to $k$-cubes such that two vertices in $G$ are adjacent if and only if
their corresponding $k$-cubes have a non-empty intersection. The
\emph{cubicity} of $G$, denoted as $\cubi(G)$, is the minimum $k$ such that $G$
has a $k$-cube representation. Roberts \cite{Roberts} showed that for any graph
$G$ on $n$ vertices, $\cubi(G)\leq 2n/3$. Many NP-complete graph problems have
polynomial time deterministic algorithms or have good approximation ratios in
graphs of low cubicity. In most of these algorithms, computing a low
dimensional cube representation of the given graph is usually the first step.
  We present an efficient algorithm to compute the $k$-cube representation of
$G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$ in $O(\Delta \ln b)$ dimensions where $b$ is
the bandwidth of $G$. Bandwidth of $G$ is at most $n$ and can be much lower.
The algorithm takes as input a bandwidth ordering of the vertices in $G$.
Though computing the bandwidth ordering of vertices for a graph is NP-hard,
there are heuristics that perform very well in practice. Even theoretically,
there is an $O(\log^4 n)$ approximation algorithm for computing the bandwidth
ordering of a graph using which our algorithm can produce a $k$-cube
representation of any given graph in $k=O(\Delta(\ln b + \ln\ln n))$
dimensions. Both the bounds on cubicity are shown to be tight upto a factor of
$O(\log\log n)$.

devoted to this issue. Most of authors suggest that they are not the

molecule states or mixtures of a P-wave $c\bar s$ and a four-quark state. In
this work, we follow the four-quark-state picture, and study the masses of
$cn\bar n\bar s/cs\bar s\bar s$ states ($n$ is $u$ or $d$ quark) in the chiral
SU(3) quark model. The numerical results show that the mass of the mixed
four-quark state ($cn\bar n\bar s/cs\bar s\bar s$) with spin parity $J^P=0^{+}$
might not be $D_s(2632)$. At the same time, we also conclude that
$D_{sJ}^{*}(2317)$ and $D_{sJ}(2460)$ cannot be explained as the pure
four-quark state.

us to estimate the expected number and length of Klebanov-Strassler throats in

state at this level, 2) energy of factorization equals to arbitrary energy and

definition follows from solution of Riccati equation at given $V_{1}$. Using
arbitrary bound state in construction of superpotential, SUSY QM methods in
detailed calculations of spectral characteristics have been coming to level of
methods of inverse problem. So, if as starting $V_{1}$ to choose rectangular
well with finite width and infinitely high walls, then we reconstruct by SUSY

functions of lowest bound states, which were obtained early by methods of

proposed for zero-points of potential, nodes of the deformed wave functions,
points, where wave functions are not deformed, an analysis of angles of wave
functions leaving from such points has fulfilled. Using unbound states at

using only one superpotential, one can join two potentials, which have real

matrix. The bound state energies can be found from the characteristic equation.
The characteristic matrix can be found after a regularization and
renormalization by using a sharp cut-off in the eigenvalue spectrum of the
Laplacian, as it is done in the flat space, or using the heat kernel method.
These two approaches are equivalent in the case of compact manifolds. The heat
kernel method has a general advantage to find lower bounds on the spectrum even
for compact manifolds as shown in the case of S^2. The heat kernels for H^2 and
H^3 are known explicitly, thus we can calculate the characteristic matrix.

characterizations for singular trajectories of control-affine systems. We prove
that, under generic assumptions, such trajectories share nice properties,
related to computational aspects; more precisely, we show that, for a generic
system -- with respect to the Whitney topology --, all nontrivial singular
trajectories are of minimal order and of corank one. These results, established
both for driftless and for control-affine systems, extend previous results. As
a consequence, for generic systems having more than two vector fields, and for

prove that, given a control system satisfying the LARC, singular trajectories
are strictly abnormal, generically with respect to the cost. We then show how
these results can be used to derive regularity results for the value function

sequences, which would impede target-probe hybridization. Their conclusion is
based on the observation of ""unexpected"" asymmetries in the affinities obtained
by fitting microarray data from publicly available experiments. We point out
here that the observed asymmetry is due to the inequivalence of RNA and DNA,
and that the reported affinities are consistent with stacking free energies
obtained from melting experiments of unlabeled nucleic acids in solution. The
conclusion of Naef and Magnasco is therefore based on an unjustified
assumption.

coming from the small numbers of constituents, and the environmental noise.
Stochastic chemical kinetics equations govern the way biochemical networks
process noisy signals. The essential difficulty associated with the master
equation approach to solving the stochastic chemical kinetics problem is the
enormous number of ordinary differential equations involved. In this work, we
show how to achieve tremendous reduction in the dimensionality of specific
reaction cascade dynamics by solving variationally an equivalent quantum field
theoretic formulation of stochastic chemical kinetics. The present formulation
avoids cumbersome commutator computations in the derivation of evolution
equations, making more transparent the physical significance of the variational
method. We propose novel time-dependent basis functions which work well over a
wide range of rate parameters. We apply the new basis functions to describe
stochastic signaling in several enzymatic cascades and compare the results so
obtained with those from alternative solution techniques. The variational
ansatz gives probability distributions that agree well with the exact ones,
even when fluctuations are large and discreteness and nonlinearity are
important. A numerical implementation of our technique is many orders of
magnitude more efficient computationally compared with the traditional Monte
Carlo simulation algorithms or the Langevin simulations.

propagation in a small enzymatic cascade which is subjected to external and
internal noise. The nonlinear character of catalytic reactions, which underlie
protein signal transduction cascades, renders stochastic signaling dynamics in
cytosol biochemical networks distinct from the usual description of stochastic
dynamics in gene regulatory networks. For a simple 2-step enzymatic cascade
which underlies many important protein signaling pathways, we demonstrated that
the commonly used techniques such as the linear noise approximation and the
Langevin equation become inadequate when the number of proteins becomes too
low. Consequently, we developed a new analytical approximation, based on mixing
the generating function and distribution function approaches, to the solution
of the master equation that describes nonlinear chemical signaling kinetics for
this important class of biochemical reactions. Our techniques work in a much
wider range of protein number fluctuations than the methods used previously. We
found that under certain conditions the burst-phase noise may be injected into
the downstream signaling network dynamics, resulting possibly in unusually
large macroscopic fluctuations. In addition to computing first and second
moments, which is the goal of commonly used analytical techniques, our new
approach provides the full time-dependent probability distributions of the
colored non-Gaussian processes in a nonlinear signal transduction cascade.

the origins of the master equation as simply as possible, focusing on physical
principles and without the complications of S-matrix theory. This derivation
may serve as a useful tutorial example for students attempting to learn this
subject area. The second is the opposite: a very general derivation using
non-relativistic many body field theory. It reduces to the equation of the type
given by Joos and Zeh in the one-particle sector, but correcting certain
numerical factors which have recently become significant in connection with
experimental tests of decoherence. This master equation also emphasizes the
role of local number density as the ``preferred basis'' for decoherence in this
model.
