found in any previous work. We present magnitudes and color indices for all of
these, along with rough measurements of their effective diameters and
ellipticities. The luminosity distribution of this nearly-uncontaminated sample
of clusters matches well with the normal GCLF for giant elliptical galaxies,
and the cluster scale size and ellipticity distributions are similar to those
in the Milky Way system. The indication from this survey is that many hundreds
of individual clusters remain to be found with carefully designed search
techniques in the future. A very rough estimate of the total cluster population
from our data suggests N_GC = 1500 in NGC 5128, over all magnitudes and within

  postscript. Posted for archival purposes only",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We discuss non-self-gravitating hydrodynamic disks in the thin disk limit.
These systems are stable according to the Rayleigh criterion, and yet there is
some evidence that the dissipative and transport processes in these disks are
hydrodynamic in nature at least some of the time. We draw on recent work on the
hydrodynamics of laboratory shear flows. Such flows are often experimentally
unstable even in the absence of a linear instability. The transition to
turbulence in these systems, as well as the large linear transient
amplification of initial disturbances, may depend upon the non-self-adjoint
nature of the differential operator that describes the dynamics of
perturbations to the background state. We find that small initial perturbations
can produce large growth in accretion disks in the shearing sheet approximation
with shearing box boundary conditions, despite the absence of any linear
instability. Furthermore, the differential operator that propagates initial
conditions forward in time is asymptotically close (as a function of Reynolds
number) to possessing growing eigenmodes. The similarity to the dynamics of
laboratory shear flows is suggestive that accretion disks might be
hydrodynamically unstable despite the lack of any known instability mechanism.

among several large samples of rich clusters is interpreted in terms of
conventional physics. It has been suggested that the central soft X-ray and EUV
excess found in some clusters cannot be of thermal origin, due to problems with
rapid gas cooling and the persistent non-detection of the O VII line, but may
arise from inverse-Compton scattering between intracluster relativistic
electrons and the cosmic microwave background. In fact, recent XMM observations
of the soft X-rays from Coma and Abell 3112 are equally well fitted by a power
law or a thermal virialized gas. Therefore the missing Sunyaev-Zel'dovich flux
could partly be due to an overestimate of the central density of virialized
electrons which scatter the CMB. Synchrotron radiation in an intracluster
magnetic field of strength of a few $\mu$G is responsible for significant
additional electron energy loss. Equipartition between relativistic particle
and magnetic field energy densities is a realistic possibility. GHz radiation
data from a Coma cluster halo yields information on the high energy steepening
of the cluster relativistic electron spectrum. Cluster microwave emission in
the WMAP passbands by higher energy cosmic ray electrons and gamma ray emission
from an accompanying cosmic ray proton flux are also considered. The energetic
electrons could originate from AGN jet injection, then distributed cluster-wide
by Alfven wave sweeping, with accompanying {\it in situ} Fermi acceleration.

predominantly solar to supersolar metallicities. This leads to the question: do
low metallicity AGN exist? In this paper we use photoionization models to
examine the effects of metallicity variations on the narrow emission lines from
an AGN. We explore a variety of emission-line diagnostics that are useful for
identifying AGN with low metallicity gas. We find that line ratios involving
[NII] are the most robust metallicity indicators in galaxies where the primary
source of ionization is from the active nucleus. Ratios involving [SII] and
[OI] are strongly affected by uncertainties in modelling the density structure
of the narrow line clouds. To test our diagnostics, we turn to an analysis of
AGN in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find a clear trend in the
relative strength of [NII] with the mass of the AGN host galaxy. The
metallicity of the ISM is known to be correlated with stellar mass in
star-forming galaxies; our results indicate that a similar trend exists for
AGN. We also find that the best-fit models for typical Seyfert narrow line
regions have supersolar abundances. Although there is a mass-dependent range of
a factor of 2-3 in the NLR metallicities of the AGN in our sample, AGN with
sub-solar metallicities are very rare in the SDSS. Out of a sample of ~23000
Seyfert 2 galaxies we find only ~40 clear candidates for AGN with NLR

superb control of systematic errors in order to achieve their full scientific

provide a window on inflation. Interferometry may be a promising way to achieve
these goals. This paper presents a formalism for characterizing the effects of
a variety of systematic errors on interferometric CMB polarization
observations, with particular emphasis on estimates of the B-mode power
spectrum. The most severe errors are those that couple the temperature
anisotropy signal to polarization; such errors include cross-talk within
detectors, misalignment of polarizers, and cross-polarization. In a B mode
experiment, the next most serious category of errors are those that mix E and B
modes, such as gain fluctuations, pointing errors, and beam shape errors. The
paper also indicates which sources of error may cause circular polarization
(e.g., from foregrounds) to contaminate the cosmologically interesting linear
polarization channels, and conversely whether monitoring of the circular
polarization channels may yield useful information about the errors themselves.
For all the sources of error considered, estimates of the level of control that
will be required for both E and B mode experiments are provided. Both
experiments that interfere linear polarizations and those that interfere
circular polarizations are considered. The fact that circular experiments
simultaneously measure both linear polarization Stokes parameters in each

compare the distribution of mean HK index values for the M67 solar-type stars

be present in the optical. The optical rapid variations, at least, are well
correlated with those in X-rays. Infrared JHKs photometry, as in the previous
outburst, exhibits especially large amplitude variability. The spectral energy
distribution (SED) of the variable infrared component can be fitted with a
power-law of slope alpha=-0.78 where Fnu is proportional to nu^alpha. There is
no compelling evidence for evolution in the slope over five nights, during
which time the source brightness decayed along almost the same track as seen in
variations within the nights. We conclude that both short-term variability, and
longer timescale fading, are dominated by a single component of constant
spectral shape. We cannot fit the SED of the IR variability with a credible
thermal component, either optically thick or thin. This IR SED is, however,
approximately consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission from a jet.

accretion times. Most iron meteorites come from bodies that accreted <0.5 Myr
after CAIs formed and were melted by 26Al and 60Fe, probably inside 2 AU.
Chondrite groups accreted intermittently over 4 Myr starting 1 Myr after CAIs
formed when planetary embryos may already have formed at ~1 AU. Meteorite
evidence precludes accretion of late-forming chondrites on the surface of
early-formed bodies; instead chondritic and non-chondritic meteorites probably
formed in separate planetesimals. Maximum metamorphic temperatures in chondrite
groups correlate inversely with mean chondrule age, as expected for 26Al
heating. Dynamical models suggest that asteroids accreted before Jupiter.
Therefore Jupiter probably reached its current mass >3-5 Myr after CAIs formed.
This precludes formation of Jupiter via a gravitational instability <1 Myr
after the solar nebula formed, and strongly favors core accretion. Shocks
formed by gravitational instabilities in the disk, proto-Jupiter, or by
planetary embryos may have produced some chondrules. The minimum lifetime for
the solar nebula of 3-5 Myr inferred from CAI and chondrule ages may exceed the
median 3 Myr lifetime for protoplanetary disks, but is well within the total
1-10 Myr range. Shorter formation times for extrasolar planets may help to
explain why their orbits are unlike those of solar giant planets.

itself to high-resolution structure analysis of the interstellar gas. A large
part of the emission comes from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, excited by
nearby ultra-violet sources. Can the observed diffuse emission structure be
interpreted as column density structure? We discuss this question with the help
of a set of model molecular clouds bathed in the radiation field of a nearby
O-star. The correlation strength between column density and ``observed'' flux
density strongly depends on the absolute volume density range in the region.
Shadowing and irradiation effects may completely alter the appearance of an
object. Irradiation introduces additional small-scale structure and it can
generate structures resembling shells around HII-regions in objects that do not
possess any shell-like structures whatsoever. Nevertheless, structural
information about the underlying interstellar medium can be retrieved. In the
more diffuse regime ($n({HI})\lesssim 100$cm$^{-3}$), flux density maps may be
used to trace the 3D density structure of the cloud via density gradients.
Thus, while caution definitely is in order, mid-infrared surveys such as
GLIMPSE will provide quantitative insight into the turbulent structure of the
interstellar medium.

quadratures for the cold dark matter density and velocity perturbations. The
subsequent evolution is followed through electron pair annihilation and the
radiation-matter transition; analytic solutions are provided for both large and

system of gravitationally coupled stellar and gaseous discs with a coplanar

and a power-law rotation curve in radius . By imposing the scale-free
condition, we construct analytically stationary global MHD perturbation
configurations for both aligned and logarithmic spiral patterns. MHD
perturbation configurations in a composite system of partial discs in the
presence of an axisymmetric dark matter halo are also considered. We derive
analytically the stationary MHD dispersion relations for both aligned and
unaligned perturbation structures and analyze the corresponding phase
relationships between surface mass densities and the magnetic field. Compared
with earlier results, we obtain three solution branches corresponding to super
fast MHD density waves, fast MHD density waves and slow MHD density waves,

stability curves where the two unstable regimes corresponding to Jeans collapse
instability and ring fragmentation instability are identified. We find that the
aligned $m=0$ case is simply the limit of the unaligned $m=0$ case with the
radial wavenumber $\xi\to0$. We further show that a composite system of partial

in ionizing flux close to a quasar embedded in a highly ionized IGM. The

recover the properties of source populations with fluxes a factor of 30 or more
below the rms noise level. Mean estimates of radio flux density, luminosity,
etc., are derivable for any source class having arcsecond positional accuracy.
  We use this technique to compute the mean radio properties for 41,295 quasars
from the SDSS DR3 catalog. There is a tight correlation between optical and
radio luminosity, with the radio luminosity increasing as the 0.85 power of
optical luminosity. This implies declining radio-loudness with optical
luminosity: the most luminous objects (M=-28.5) have average radio-to-optical
ratios 3 times lower than the least luminous objects (M=-20). There is also a
striking correlation between optical color and radio loudness: quasars that are
either redder or bluer than the norm are brighter radio sources, with objects
0.8 magnitudes redder than the SDSS composite spectrum having radio-loudness

of whether a radio-loud/radio-quiet dichotomy exists in quasars, finding that
optical selection effects probably dominate the distribution function of radio
loudness, which has at most a modest (~20%) inflection between the radio-loud
and radio-quiet ends of the distribution. We also find, surprisingly, that
broad absorption line quasars have higher mean radio flux densities, with the
greatest disparity arising in the rare low-ionization BAL subclass.

solved by increasing the pitch length of subsequent cabling stages. It is for
the first time that an increase of the pitches is proposed and no experimental

lengths will result in a more homogeneous distribution of the stresses and
strains in the cable by significantly moderating the local peak stresses
associated with the intermediate-length twist pitches. The twist pitch scheme
of the present conductor layout turns out to be unfortunately close to a worst
case scenario. It is possible to improve the ITER conductor design or the
operation margin, by mainly a change in the cabling scheme. We also find that a
lower cable void fraction and larger strand stiffness add to a further
improvement of the conductor performance.

substantial giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect occurs ($\pm 20%$) for
disorder-free CNTs. Anderson-disorder averaged GMR, in turn, is positive and
reduced down to several percent in the vicinity of the charge neutrality point.

length-to-perimeter ratio, unintentional electrode-induced doping, Zeeman

conductance oscillations approaching asymptotically the upper theoretical limit

potentials, which can be tailored to achieve net spin currents without
corresponding charge currents. We consider ballistic, coherent transport in

algorithm with earlier, inexact R-algorithm results and find a reduction of 25%
in the critical quark mass, for which the first order phase transition changes
to a smooth crossover. Extending our analysis to non-degenerate quark masses,
we map out the chiral critical line up to the neighbourhood of the physical
point, which we confirm to be in the crossover region. Our data are consistent
with a tricritical point at a strange quark mass of ~500 MeV. Finally, we
investigate the shift of the critical line with finite baryon density, by
simulating with an imaginary chemical potential for which there is no sign
problem. We observe this shift to be very small or, conversely, the critical
endpoint \mu^c(m_{u,d},m_s) to be extremely quark mass sensitive. Moreover, the
sign of this shift is opposite to standard expectations. If confirmed on a
finer lattice, it implies the absence of a critical endpoint or phase
transition for chemical potentials \mu_B < 500 MeV. We thus argue that finer

natural in the sense that all couplings are of O(1) or forbidden due to a
phantom sector global U(1)_D symmetry, and basically imitates the standard
Majorana see-saw mechanism. Spontaneous breaking of the U(1)_D symmetry
triggers consistent electroweak gauge symmetry breaking only if it occurs at a
scale compatible with small Dirac neutrino masses and baryogenesis through
Dirac leptogenesis. Dirac leptogenesis proceeds through the usual
out-of-equilibrium decay scenario, leading to left and right-handed neutrino
asymmetries that do not fully equilibrate after they are produced. The model
contains two physical Higgs bosons and a massless Goldstone boson. The
existence of the Goldstone boson suppresses the Higgs to bb branching ratio and
instead the Higgs bosons will mainly decay to invisible Goldstone and/or to
visible vector boson pairs. In a representative scenario, we estimate that with
30 fb^-1 integrated luminosity, the LHC could discover this invisibly decaying
Higgs, with mass ~120 GeV. At the same time a significantly heavier, partner
Higgs boson with mass ~210 GeV could be found through its vector boson decays.

interpolated to zero momentum transfer, and then is extrapolated to the

holonomy algebra. The generalized curvature is also shown to contain the
supergravity equations of motion, even in the non-vanishing gravitino case. The
underlying gauge symmetry of D=11 supergravity is discussed and argued to
become manifest when its three-form field A_3 is expressed through a set of

well as being of interest in and of itself, our study is also of interest to
the recently introduced large extra dimension brane-localized gravity program
of Randall and Sundrum, since the particular non-normalizable mode bases that
we consider (specifically the irregular Bessel functions and the associated
Legendre functions of the second kind) are associated with the tensor
gravitational fluctuations which occur in those specific brane worlds in which
the embedding of a maximally four-symmetric brane in a five-dimensional anti-de
Sitter bulk leads to a warp factor which is divergent. Since the brane-world
massless four-dimensional graviton has a divergent wave function in these
particular cases, its resulting lack of normalizability is thus not seen to be
any impediment to its belonging to a complete basis of modes, and consequently
its lack of normalizability should not be seen as a criterion for not including
it in the spectrum of observable modes. Moreover, because the divergent modes
we consider form complete bases, we can even construct propagators out of them
in which these modes appear as poles with residues which are expressly finite.
Thus even though normalizable modes appear in propagators with residues which
are given as their finite normalization constants, non-normalizable modes can
just as equally appear in propagators with finite residues too -- it is just
that such residues will not be associated with bilinear integrals of the modes.

Hochschild homology of A_m and the only torsion, equal to Z_m, appears in

H^{1,v-1}_{A_2}(G) is closely related to the standard graph cohomology, except

asymptotic behaviour of the solutions, periodic orbits and their stability or

a numerical integration of the equations of motion. Following the recent
approach of Calogero, the real time trajectories of the system are given by
paths on $\mathcal R$ that are projected to a circle on the complex plane
$\tau$. Due to the branching of $\mathcal R$, the solutions may have different

motion has been studied in a number of papers, while the cyclic motion is much
less understood. For small data, the cyclic time trajectories lead to
isochronous dynamics. For bigger data the situation is quite complicated;
computer experiments show that, for sufficiently small degree of the monomial,
the motion is generically periodic with integer period, which depends in a
quite sensitive way on the initial data. If the degree of the monomial is
sufficiently high, computer experiments show essentially chaotic behaviour. We
suggest a possible theoretical explanation of these different behaviours. We
also introduce a one-parameter family of 2-dimensional mappings, describing the
motion of the center of the circle, as a convenient representation of the
cyclic dynamics; we call such mapping the center map. Computer experiments for
the center map show a typical multi-fractal behaviour with periodicity islands.

quanta whose wavelength equals the Planck's length. The quantum energy is very
small, so the relevant Planck constant ho is much smaller than the usual h.
This physical paradigm imposes to the motion the conservation of energy and
momentum, as well as the laws of the relativistic mechanics. The strong version
of the equivalence principle, which requires both inertia and gravitation come
from a unique phenomenon, is the relevant test to verify the physical reality
of the cosmic quanta. Through Compton's interaction each quantum colliding two
masses gives them a little momentum which produces a newtonian force pushing
the masses each towards other. The constant G depends on the quanta
characteristics, so the Newton's gravitational mass does no longer holds. The
new gravitational force of stars depends on the reducing quantum energy, so G
multiplies by a gravity factor (greater than 1) depending on the star density.
The highest number (200-300) pertains to the neutron stars, which increment
notably their accretion capacity. This property may explain the mistery of the
obscure supermassive bodies whose gravitational effects rise up to 3.7 million

scattering length by an energy-dependent scattering length which was already
introduced for the calculation of energy levels under 3D confinement. This
replacement accurately predicts the position of confinement-induced resonances
in strongly confined geometries.

  multiple ionization","19 pages, 8 figures (eps files)",,,,"physics.atom-ph",,"  We investigate laser induced nonsequential multiple ionization using a simple
statistical model in which an electron recollides inelastically with its parent
ion. In this collision, it thermalizes with the remaining $N-1$ bound electrons
within a time interval $\Delta t$. Subsequently, all the $N$ electrons leave.
We address the question of how the above time delays influence the individual
contributions from the orbits in which the first electron, upon return, is
accelerated or decelerated by the field, respectively, to the ion momentum
distributions. In both cases, the time delays modify the drift momenta obtained
by the $N$ electrons when they reach the continuum at $t+\Delta t$, by moving
such times towards or away from a crossing of the electric field. The
contributions from both types of collisions are influenced in distinct ways,
and the interplay between such trends determines the widths and the peak
momenta of the distributions. Specifically in the few-cycle pulse case, we also
show that such time delays do not affect the shapes of the momentum
distributions in a radical fashion. Hence, even with a thermalization time
$\Delta t$, nonsequential multiple ionization could in principle be used for
absolute-phase diagnosis.
