distributions from 0.8-5microns, spanning the rest-frame UV and optical. From
our sample of ~50 i-drop Lyman-break star-forming galaxies in GOODS-South with
z'(AB)<27mag, we focus on ~30 with reliable photometric or spectroscopic
redshifts. Half of these are confused with foreground sources at Spitzer
resolution, but from the 16 with clean photometry we find that a surprisingly
large fraction (40%) have evidence for substantial Balmer-breaks. This
indicates the presence of old underlying stellar populations that dominate the
stellar masses. For these objects, we find ages of 200-700Myr, implying
formation redshifts of 7<z<14, and large stellar masses in the range
1-3x10^10M_sun. Analysis of 7 i-drops that are undetected at 3.6microns
indicates that these are younger, considerably less massive systems. We
calculate that line contamination should not severely affect our photometry or
derived results. Using data out to 8microns, we find little evidence for
substantial intrinsic dust reddening. Correcting for incompleteness in our
sample, we find a lower limit on the comoving stellar mass density at z~6 to be
2.5x10^6M_sun/Mpc^3. We are able to explore the star formation histories of our
selected galaxies, and we infer that the past global star formation rate may
have been much higher than that observed at z~6. The associated UV flux we
infer at z>7 could have played a major role in reionizing the universe.

in a shallow, ``equivalent-barotropic'', turbulent atmosphere on both tidally
synchronized and unsynchronized planets. A full exploration of the large
physical and numerical parameter-space is performed to identify robust features
of the circulation. For some validation, the model is first applied to Solar
System giant planets. For extrasolar giant planets with physical parameters
similar to HD209458b--a presumably synchronized extrasolar giant planet,
representative in many dynamical respects--the circulation is characterized by
the following features: 1) a coherent polar vortex that revolves around the
pole in each hemisphere; 2) a low number--typically two or three--of
slowly-varying, broad zonal (east-west) jets that form when the maximum jet
speed is comparable to, or somewhat stronger than, those observed on the
planets in the Solar System; and, 3) motion-associated temperature field, whose
detectability and variability depend on the strength of the net heating rate
and the global root mean square wind speed in the atmosphere. In many ways, the
global circulation is Earth-like, rather than Jupiter-like. However, if
extrasolar giant planets rotate faster and are not close-in (therefore not
synchronized), their circulations become more Jupiter-like, for Jupiter-like
rotation rates.

transition below the QCD scale. Such a scalar field may couple too weakly to
the standard model to be detectable directly through particle interactions, but
may still be detectable by gravitational effects, such as lensing and baryon
accretion by large, gravitationally bound miniclusters. The masses of these
objects are shown to be constrained by the Ly$\alpha$ power spectrum to be less
than $\sim 10^4 M_\odot$, but they may be as light as classical axion
miniclusters, of the order of $10^{-12} M_\odot$. We simulate the formation and
nonlinear gravitational collapse of these objects around matter-radiation

can reveal either high-amplification, strong lensing events, or measure density
profiles directly via weak-lensing variability, depending on ScaM parameters
and survey depth. However, ScaMs, due to their low internal densities, are
unlikely to be responsible for apparent MACHO events already detected in the

early structure formation; in principle, early stellar collapse could be
triggered by ScaMs as early as recombination, and significantly affect cosmic

apply a $\beta$-viscosity prescription which has been derived from rotating

core formation in the center. Some physical quantities for $\beta$-disks are
determined numerically.We have compared our results with $\alpha$-disks under
the same initial conditions. It has been found that the accretion rate onto the
central object for $\beta$-disks more than $\alpha$-disks at least in the outer
regions where $\beta$-disks are more efficient. Our results show that Toomre
instability parameter is less than one everywhere on the $\beta$-disk which
means that in such disks gravitational instabilities can be occurred, so the
$\beta$-disk model can be a good candidate for the origin of planetary systems.
Our results show that the $\beta$-disks will decouple in the outer part of the

the scaling properties of the solution. For example, we find that the scaling
of the characteristic magnetic field amplitude with distance from the shock is
B \propto D^{s_B} with -1<s_B<=0, that the spectrum of accelerated particles is
dn/dE \propto E^{-2/(s_B+1)}, and that the scaling of the magnetic correlation
function is <B_i(x)B_j(x+dx)> \propto x^{2s_B} (for x>>D). We show that the
plasma may be approximated as a combination of two self-similar components: a
kinetic component of energetic particles and an MHD-like component representing
""thermal"" particles. We argue that the latter may be considered as infinitely
conducting, in which case s_B=0 and the scalings are completely determined
(e.g. dn/dE \propto E^{-2} and B \propto D^0). Similar claims apply to non-
relativistic shocks such as in supernova remnants, if the upstream magnetic
field can be neglected. Self-similarity has important implications for any
model of particle acceleration and/or field generation. For example, we show
that the diffusion function in the angle \mu of momentum p in diffusive shock
acceleration models must satisfy D_{\mu\mu}(p,D) = D^{-1}D'_{\mu\mu}(p/D), and
that a previously suggested model for the generation of large scale magnetic

envelopes, whereas most post-AGB stars and Planetary Nebulae (PNe) show
axisymmetric circumstellar envelopes. While various mechanisms for axisymmetric

the shape of the circumstellar shell evolves. Here we address the temporal
changes in the axisymmetry of AGB star envelopes, and in particular the
development of the torus required in the Generalized Interacting Stellar Winds
(GISW) model. Assuming (1) an AGB star rotates with sufficient angular speed at
the start of the AGB phase; and (2) that the rotational angular momentum of the
AGB star is conserved, we demonstrate that some very important observational
features of AGB star axisymmetry evolution can be reproduced. We find that,
compared to the star's increasing luminosity and decreasing effective
temperature, the decreasing mass of the star primarily affects the axisymmetry
of the envelope. When a representative mass loss history is adopted, where most
of the mass is lost near the end of the AGB phase, the envelope's axisymmetry
increases over time, with the strongest increase occurring near the end of the
AGB phase. This may naturally explain why most AGB stars have spherically
symmetric envelopes, while axisymmetry seems common-place in the post-AGB/PNe
phase. The degree of axisymmetry at the end of the AGB phase is found to
increase with increasing main sequence mass, and the onset of axisymmetry
occurs only after the onset of the superwind (SW) phase, in good agreement with
the observations.

(SMBHs) and the star formation rates (m_sf) in ULIRGs formed by gas-rich galaxy
mergers and thereby discuss what powers ULIRGs. Our principal results, which
can be tested against observations, are as follows. (1) ULIRGs powered by AGN
can be formed by major merging between luminous, gas-rich disk galaxies with
prominent bulges containing SMBHs, owing to the efficient gas fuelling m_acc >
1 M_sun/yr of the SMBH. AGN in these ULIRGs can be surrounded by compact
poststarburst stellar populations (e.g., A-type stars). (2) ULIRGs powered by
starbursts with m_sf ~ 100 M_sun/yr can be formed by merging between gas-rich
disk galaxies with small bulges having the bulge-to-disk-ratio (f_b) as small
as 0.1. (3) The relative importance of starbursts and AGN can depend on
physical properties of merger progenitor disks, such as f_b, gas mass fraction,
and total masses. For example, more massive galaxy mergers are more likely to
become AGN-dominated ULIRGs. (4) For most models, major mergers can become
ULIRGs, powered either by starbursts or by AGN, only when the two bulges
finally merge. Interacting disk galaxies can become ULIRGs with well separated
two cores (> 20kpc) at their pericenter when they are very massive and have
small bulges. (5) Irrespective of the choice of model, interacting/merging
galaxies show the highest accretion rates onto the central SMBHs, and the
resultant rapid growth of the SMBHs occur when their star formation rates are
very high.

coupling of the local strain field to the long-range elastic field. Periodic
boundary conditions used by classical potentials or density-functional theory
may not accurately reproduce the correct bulk response to an isolated defect;
this is especially true for dislocations. Recently, flexible boundary
conditions have been developed to produce the correct long-range strain field
from a defect--effectively ""embedding"" a defect in a finite cell with infinite
bulk response, isolating it from either periodic images or free surfaces.
Flexible boundary conditions require the calculation of the bulk response with
the lattice Green function (LGF). While the LGF can be computed from the
dynamical matrix, for supercell methods (periodic boundary conditions) it can
only be calculated up to a maximum range. We illustrate how to accurately
calculate the lattice Green function and estimate the error using a cutoff
dynamical matrix combined with knowledge of the long-range behavior of the

S^\prime$ be a bijection. Then it is well-known that the entropy of $X$ is the
same as the entropy of $f(X)$. This entropy preservation property has been
well-utilized to establish non-trivial properties of discrete stochastic
processes, e.g. queuing process \cite{prg03}. Entropy as well as entropy
preservation is well-defined only in the context of purely discrete or
continuous random variables. However for a mixture of discrete and continuous
random variables, which arise in many interesting situations, the notions of
entropy and entropy preservation have not been well understood.
  In this paper, we extend the notion of entropy in a natural manner for a
mixed-pair random variable, a pair of random variables with one discrete and
the other continuous. Our extensions are consistent with the existing
definitions of entropy in the sense that there exist natural injections from
discrete or continuous random variables into mixed-pair random variables such
that their entropy remains the same. This extension of entropy allows us to
obtain sufficient conditions for entropy preservation in mixtures of discrete
and continuous random variables under bijections.
  The extended definition of entropy leads to an entropy rate for continuous
time Markov chains. As an application, we recover a known probabilistic result
related to Poisson process. We strongly believe that the frame-work developed
in this paper can be useful in establishing probabilistic properties of complex
processes, such as load balancing systems, queuing network, caching algorithms.

symmetric (torsion-less). It is shown that, torsion of space-time plays an
important role in both geometry and physics. It interacts with the spin of the
moving particle and with its charge. The first interaction, {\bf{Spin-Torsion
Interaction}}, has been used to overcome the discrepancy in the results of the
COW-experiment. The second interaction, {\bf{Charge-Torsion Interaction}}, is
similar to the Aharonov-Bohm effect.

quantum features. Riemannian geometry and conventional AP-geometry are special
cases of PAP-geometry.

dripline have been studied using intermediate-energy beams of neutron-deficient
$^{34}$Ar, $^{30}$S, and $^{26}$Si. The inclusive cross sections, and also the
partial cross sections for the population of individual bound final states of
the $^{32}$Ar, $^{28}$S and $^{24}$Si knockout residues, have been determined
using the combination of particle and $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy. Similar to the
two-proton knockout mechanism on the neutron-rich side of the nuclear chart,
these two-neutron removal reactions from already neutron-deficient nuclei are
also shown to be consistent with a direct reaction mechanism.

theory and its extensions to include effects of polarization of the medium and
retardation of the interactions. Superfluidity in nuclear systems that exhibit
isospin asymmetry is studied. We further address the crossover from the
weak-coupling BCS description to the strong-coupling BEC limit in dilute
nuclear systems. Finally, within the observational context of rotational
anomalies of pulsars, we discuss models of the vortex state in superfluid
neutron stars and of the mutual friction between superfluid and normal
components, along with the possibility of type-I superconductivity of the
proton subsystem.

derive an estimate on the critical optical power at which Hawking effect is
dominated by the self-phase modulation. It appears that optical experiments
reported so far are clearly dominated by self-phase modulation.

method of images permits us to obtain some observables associated with such a
configuration by replacing the conductors with some image charges. However,
simple inspection shows that the potential energy associated with both systems
does not coincide. Nevertheless, it can be shown that for a system of a
grounded or neutral conductor and a distribution of charges outside, the
external potential energy associated with the real charge distribution embedded
in the field generated by the set of image charges is twice the value of the
internal potential energy associated with the original system. This assertion
is valid for any size and shape of the conductor, and regardless of the
configuration of images required. In addition, even in the case in which the
conductor is not grounded nor neutral, it is still possible to calculate the
internal potential energy of the original configuration through the method of
images. These results show that the method of images could also be useful for
calculations of the internal potential energy of the original system.

Then, we show the potentialities of the PTMs model of computation simulating

show that PTMs can resolve some problems in exponentially less time than any
classical deterministic Turing machine. Finally, We show that it is not

we open the possibility of constructing a new model of PTMs by which it is
