loops exhibit properties unexplained by standard theory: observed scale heights

widths of loop emission signatures defy theoretical expectations for large flux
tubes in stratified media. In this work we relate the cross-sectional profile
of a coronal flux tube to its density scale height in steady-state plasma flow
regimes. Steady flows may shorten or lengthen the scale height according to how
the tube cross-sectional area varies with arclength. In a near-potential corona
the flux tubes are expected to be sufficiently expansive in many active regions
for scale heights to be increased by steady flows. On the other hand, cases
where scale lengths are actually increased to observed sizes form a small part
of the solution space, close to regimes where density profiles reverse.
Therefore, although steady flows are the only steady process known to be
capable of extending scale heights significantly, they are not expected to be
not responsible for the majority of extended active region scale heights.

the grain extinction efficiency. However, this would require a wide range of
maximum grain sizes, which is ruled out based on constraints from the

to CO formation and depletion are also ruled out. Our result may therefore
suggest the existence of intrinsic spatial fluctuations of the dust to gas

predicted lensing galaxy population consists mainly of ellipticals (~80%) with
an average lens velocity dispersion of 164+/-3 km/s, producing typical image
separations of ~3 arcsec. The lens galaxy population lies on the fundamental
plane but its velocity dispersion distribution is shifted to higher values

lens galaxies in 2-image systems. Our key result is the explicit demonstration
that the population of lens galaxies differs markedly from the galaxy
population as a whole: lens galaxies have a higher average luminosity and
reside in more massive haloes than the overall sample of ellipticals. This bias
restricts our ability to infer galaxy evolution parameters from a sample of

shown that the induced process is not effective for radio emission of

remnants. The combined GW signal from such events occurring throughout the
Universe will produce an astrophysical GW background (AGB), one that is
fundamentally different from the GW background by very early Universe
processes. One can classify contributions to the AGB for different classes of
sources based on the strength of the GW emissions from the individual sources,
their peak emission frequency, emission duration and their event rate density
distribution. This article provides an overview of the detectability regimes of
the AGB in the context of current and planned gravitational wave observatories.
We show that there are two important AGB signal detection regimes, which we
define as `continuous' and `popcorn noise'. We describe how the `popcorn noise'
AGB regime evolves with observation time and we discuss how this feature
distinguishes it from the GW background produced from very early Universe
processes.

explore the transition region from the Newtonian to the Einsteinian regime.
With the emitting region closer to the Kerr black hole, lines are successively
subjected to a stronger gravitationally induced shift and distortion. Simulated
lines are compared to broad, optical emission lines observed in Mrk 110.
Methods. We simulate relativistic emission line profiles by using Kerr ray
tracing techniques. Emitting regions are assumed to be thin equatorial rings in
stationary Keplerian rotation. The emission lines are characterised by a
generalized Doppler factor or redshift associated with the line core. Results.
With decreasing distance from the black hole, the gravitational redshift starts
to smoothly deviate from the Newtonian Doppler factor: Shifts of the line cores
reveal an effect at levels of 0.0015 to 60% at gravitational radii ranging from
10^{5} to 2. This corresponds to fully relativistic Doppler factors of 0.999985
to 0.4048. The intrinsic line shape distortion by strong gravity i.e. very
asymmetric lines occur at radii smaller than roughly ten gravitational radii.
Conclusions. Due to the asymptotical flatness of black hole space-time, GR
effects are ubiquitous and their onset can be tested observationally with
sufficient spectral resolution. With a resolving power of ~100000, yielding a
resolution of ~0.1 Angstroems for optical and near-infrared broad emission
lines like H\beta, HeII and Pa\alpha, the gravitational redshift can be probed
out to approximately 75000 gravitational radii. [abridged]

sample spans a large range of ages (~ 1-13 Gyr) and metallicities (-0.3 >
[Fe/H] > -2.0) and has good areal coverage of the LMC disk. The strong
absorption lines of the Calcium II triplet are used to derive cluster radial
velocities and abundances. We determine mean cluster velocities to typically
1.6 km/s and mean metallicities to 0.04 dex (random error). For eight of these
clusters, we report the first spectroscopically determined metallicities based
on individual cluster stars, and six of these eight have no published radial
velocity measurements.

assumed that the blue stragglers were formed through stellar collisions in all
regions of the cluster. We find that in the core of the cluster, models of
collisional blue stragglers agree well with the observations as long as blue
stragglers are still continuing to form and the mass function in the cluster is
extremely biased towards massive stars (x=-8 where a Salpeter mass function has
x=+1.35). We show that such an extreme mass function is supported by direct
measurements of the luminosity function of main sequence stars in the centre of
the cluster. In the middle region of our dataset (25'' to 130'' from the
cluster centre), blue straggler formation seems to have stopped about half a
Gyr ago. In the outskirts of the cluster, our models are least successful at
reproducing the blue straggler data. Taken at face value, they indicate that
blue straggler formation has been insignificant over the past billion years,
and that a Salpeter mass function applies. However, it is more likely that the
dominant formation mechanism in this part of the cluster is not the collisional
one, and that our models are not appropriate for this region of the cluster. We
conclude that blue stragglers can be used as tracers of dynamics in globular
clusters, despite our incomplete understanding of how and where they were
formed.

BAL systems I and II are extended (reaching 1.4-1.6"" = 1.2-1.3 kpc, from the
nucleus) and clearly elongated at the position angle close to the radio jet PA.
Which suggest that the BAL systems I and II are both associated with the radio
jet, and supporting the bipolar jet-wind model for some BALs. For the nuclear
region of Mrk 231, the QSO and host-galaxy components were modelled, using a
new technique of decoupling 3D spectra. From this study, the following main
results were found: (i) in the pure host galaxy spectrum an extreme nuclear
starburst component was clearly observed, mainly as a very strong increase in
the flux, at the blue wavelengths; (ii) the BAL system I is observed in the
spectrum of the host galaxy; (iii) in the clean/pure QSO emission spectrum,
only broad lines were detected. 3D GMOS individual spectra (specially in the IR
Ca II triplet) and maps confirm the presence of an extreme and young nuclear
starburst (8 < age < 15 Myr), which was detected mainly in a ring or toroid
with a radius r = 0.3"" = 200 pc, around the very nucleus. The physical
properties of the four expanding nuclear bubbles were analysed, using the GMOS
3D spectra and maps. These results suggest that an important part of the
nuclear NLR is generated by the OF process and the associated low velocity
ionizing shocks.

ramifications for understanding superconductivity in crystalline materials.
Using cold atomic gases, various condensed matter models can be studied in a
highly controllable environment. Weakly repulsive fermions in an optical
lattice could undergo d-wave pairing at low temperatures, a possible mechanism
for high temperature superconductivity in the cuprates. The lattice potential
could also strongly increase the critical temperature for s-wave superfluidity.
Recent experimental advances in the bulk include the observation of fermion
pair condensates and high-temperature superfluidity. Experiments with fermions
and bosonic bound pairs in optical lattices have been reported, but have not
yet addressed superfluid behavior. Here we show that when a condensate of
fermionic atom pairs was released from an optical lattice, distinct
interference peaks appear, implying long range order, a property of a
superfluid. Conceptually, this implies that strong s-wave pairing and
superfluidity have now been established in a lattice potential, where the
transport of atoms occurs by quantum mechanical tunneling and not by simple
propagation. These observations were made for unitarity limited interactions on
both sides of a Feshbach resonance. For larger lattice depths, the coherence
was lost in a reversible manner, possibly due to a superfluid to insulator
transition. Such strongly interacting fermions in an optical lattice can be
used to study a new class of Hamiltonians with interband and atom-molecule
couplings.

arising from a combination of strong geometric barriers and weak bulk pinning.
In this paper we predict that, even in films with bulk pinning, flux domes also
occur when vortices and antivortices are produced far from the film edges
underneath current-carrying wires, coils, or permanent magnets placed above the
film. Vortex-antivortex pairs penetrating through the film are generated when
the magnetic field parallel to the surface exceeds H_{c1}+K_c, where H_{c1} is
the lower critical field and K_c = j_c d is the critical sheet-current density
(the product of the bulk critical current density j_c and the film thickness
d). The vortices and antivortices move in opposite directions to locations
where they join others to create separated vortex and antivortex flux domes. We
consider a simple arrangement of a pair of current-carrying wires carrying
current I_0 in opposite directions and calculate the magnetic-field and
current-density distributions as a function of I_0 both in the
bulk-pinning-free case (K_c = 0) and in the presence of bulk pinning,
characterized by a field-independent critical sheet-current density (K_c > 0).

motion is derived from a microscopic collision model. The model assumes that a
heavy point-like Brownian particle interacts with the lighter heat bath
particles via elastic hard-core collisions. First, the commonly known,
non-relativistic LE is deduced from this model, by taking into account the
non-relativistic conservation laws for momentum and kinetic energy.
Subsequently, this procedure is generalized to the relativistic case. There, it
is found that the relativistic stochastic force is still $\gd$-correlated
(white noise) but does \emph{no} longer correspond to a Gaussian white noise
process. Explicit results for the friction and momentum-space diffusion
coefficients are presented and discussed.

lattice gas models (DLG and RDLG respectively) is investigated via numerical
Monte Carlo simulations in two dimensions. For $T\lesssim T_c$, the average
interface width of the strips ($W$) was measured as a function of the lattice
size and the anisotropic shape factor. It was found that the saturation value
$W^{2}_{sat}$ only depends on the lattice size parallel to the external field
axis $L_y$ and exhibits two distinct regimes: $W^{2}_{sat}\propto \ln$ $L_y$
for low temperatures, that crosses over to $W^{2}_{sat}\propto L_y^{2\alpha_I}$
near the critical zone, $\alpha_I=1/2$ being the roughness exponent of the
interface. By using the relationship $\alpha_I=1/(1+\Delta_I)$, the anisotropic
exponent for the interface of the DLG model was estimated, giving
$\Delta_I\simeq 1$, in agreement with the computed value for anisotropic bulk
exponent $\Delta_B$ with a recently proposed theoretical approach. At the
crossover region between both regimes, we observed indications of bulk
criticality. The time evolution of $W$ at $T_c$ was also monitored and shows
two growing stages: first one observes that $W \propto \ln$ $t$ for several
decades, and in the following times one has $W\propto t^{\beta_I}$, where
$\beta_{I}$ is the dynamic exponent of the interface width. By using this value
we estimated the dynamic critical exponent of the correlation length in the
perpendicular direction to the external field, giving $z_{\perp}^I\approx 4$,
which is consistent with the dynamic exponent of the bulk critical transition
$z_{\perp}^B$ in both theoretical approaches developed for the standard model.
A similar scenario was also observed in the RDLG model, suggesting that both
models may belong to the same universality class.

strong and give rise to stress fluctuations in the MPa-range, which is similar
to the depinning stresses which typically occur at solid-rubber interfaces,
indicating the crucial importance of thermal fluctuations for rubber friction

influence of thermal fluctuations on the depinning of small contact patches

the velocity dependence of the macroscopic shear stress has a bell-shaped f
orm, and that the low-velocity side exhibits the same temperature dependence as
the bulk viscoelastic modulus, in qualitative agreement with experimental data.

Misner
\cite{M69q} about the quantum dynamics of the Bianchi type IX geometry near the
cosmological singularity. We extend the analysis to the generic inhomogeneous
universe by solving the super-momentum constraint and outlining the dynamical
decoupling of spatial points. Firstly, we discuss the classical evolution of
the model in terms of the Hamilton-Jacobi approach as applied to the
super-momentum and super-Hamiltonian constraints; then we quantize it in the
approximation of a square potential well after an ADM reduction of the dynamics
with respect to the super-momentum constraint only. Such a reduction relies on
a suitable form for the generic three-metric tensor which allows the use of its
three functions as the new spatial coordinates. We get a functional
representation of the quantum dynamics which is equivalent to the Misner-like
one when extended point by point, since the Hilbert space factorizes into
$\infty^3$ independent components due to the parametric role that the
three-coordinates assume in the asymptotic potential term. Finally, we discuss
the conditions for having a semiclassical behavior of the dynamics and we
recognize that this already corresponds to having mean occupation numbers of
order $\mathcal{O}(10^2)$.

$(1-x_B)Q^2$ in the coefficient function can be made in the soft-collinear

the traditional refactorization approach introduces the spurious scale
$(1-x_B)Q$ in various factors, which drives them nonperturbative in the region
of our interest. We show how to improve the situation by introducing a rapidity
cut-off scheme, and how to recover the effective theory refactorization by
choosing appropriately the cut-off parameter. Through a one-loop calculation,
we demonstrate explicitly that the proper soft subtractions must be made in the

The density perturbations produced by inflation and the temperature

laws, we establish existence and stability of curved multidimensional shock
fronts in the vanishing viscosity limit for general Lax- or
undercompressive-type shock waves of nonconservative hyperbolic systems with
parabolic regularization. The hyperbolic equations may be of variable
multiplicity and the parabolic regularization may be of ``real'', or partially
parabolic, type. We prove an existence result for inviscid nonconservative
shocks that extends to multidimensional shocks a one-dimensional result of X.
Lin proved by quite different methods. In addition, we construct families of
smooth viscous shocks converging to a given inviscid shock as viscosity goes to
zero, thereby justifying the small viscosity limit for multidimensional
nonconservative shocks.
  In our previous work on shocks we made use of conservative form especially in
parts of the low frequency analysis. Thus, most of the new analysis of this
paper is concentrated in this area. By adopting the more general
nonconservative viewpoint, we are able to shed new light on both the viscous
and inviscid theory. For example, we can now provide a clearer geometric
motivation for the low frequency analysis in the viscous case. Also, we show
that one may, in the treatment of inviscid stability of nonclassical and/or
nonconservative shocks, remove an apparently restrictive technical assumption
made by Mokrane and Coulombel in their work on, respectively, shock-type
nonconservative boundary problems and conservative undercompressive shocks.
Another advantage of the nonconservative perspective is that Lax and
undercompressive shocks can be treated by exactly the same analysis.

energy-density functionals, often formulated in terms of effective
density-dependent nucleon-nucleon interactions. The free parameters of the
functional are adjusted to empirical data. A proper choice of these parameters
requires a comprehensive set of constraints covering experimental data on
finite nuclei, concerning static as well as dynamical properties, empirical
characteristics of nuclear matter, and observational information on

dual-gain mode, a successful means for enhancing the dynamic range of the

reconstructed image, was developed and successfully tested during the last few
years. The important steps in the calibration of this mode involve a correction
to the pulse widths associated with the X-ray production, the assessment of the
detector signal above which nonlinear effects become significant and the
determination of some properties of the detector pixels, namely, of dark
fields, flatness corrections, etc. Finally, the defect-pixel map is obtained,
containing dead and flickering pixels, as well as pixels with properties which
are sufficiently `out of range'. An effect observed in the offset correction of
raw images seems to originate in the mismatch between the measured and
extrapolated values of the dark field; a correction scheme is proposed to take
account of this effect. In the data processing, which is achieved on the basis
of the files produced in the calibration of the mode, the high-gain signal is
used whenever meaningful; otherwise, it is substituted by the low-gain signal,
properly scaled. Defect pixels are interpolated from their good neighbours; a

expectation values of observables for a preparable state |psi> of the quantum

and coupling the system to an apparatus. For this method, the precision of the
measured value scales as 1/sqrt(N) for N repetitions of the experiment. For the
problem of estimating the parameter phi in an evolution exp(-i phi H), it is
possible to achieve precision 1/N (the quantum metrology limit) provided that
sufficient information about H and its spectrum is available. We consider the
more general problem of estimating expectations of operators A with minimal
prior knowledge of A. We give explicit algorithms that approach precision 1/N
given a bound on the eigenvalues of A or on their tail distribution. These
algorithms are particularly useful for simulating quantum systems on quantum
computers because they enable efficient measurement of observables and
correlation functions. Our algorithms are based on a method for efficiently
measuring the complex overlap of |psi> and U|psi>, where U is an implementable
unitary operator. We explicitly consider the issue of confidence levels in
measuring observables and overlaps and show that, as expected, confidence
levels can be improved exponentially with linear overhead. We further show that
the algorithms given here can typically be parallelized with minimal increase

in atom-photon dynamics. Using a model of two-level atoms with Ising-type
interaction as an example, it is demonstrated that interparticle interaction
combined with atom-field coupling can introduce additional interatomic
correlations acting as a phase synchronizing factor. For the case of weakly
interacting atoms with $J<\hbar\omega_0$, where $J$ is the interparticle
coupling constant and $\omega_0$ is the atomic frequency, dynamical regimes of
cooperative relaxation of atoms are analyzed in Born-Markov approximation both
numerically and using the mean field approximation. We show that interparticle
correlations induced by the direct interaction result in inhibition of
incoherent spontaneous decay leading to the regime of collective pulse
relaxation which differs from superradiance in nature. For superradiant
transition, the synchronizing effect of interatomic interaction is found to
manifest itself in enhancement of superradiance. When the interaction is strong
and $J>\hbar\omega_0$, one-partice one-photon transitions are excluded and
transition to the regime of multiphoton relaxation occurs. Using a simple model
of two atoms in a high-Q single mode cavity we show that such transition is
accompanied by Rabi oscillations involving many-atom multiphoton states.
Dephasing effect of dipole-dipole interaction and solitonic mechanism of
relaxation are discussed.
