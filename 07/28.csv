diagnostics and is often used to estimate masses of galaxies at low as well as
high redshifts. However, many stellar population models are still relatively
poorly calibrated in this part of the spectrum. To allow an improvement of this
calibration we present a new database of integrated near-infrared JHKs
magnitudes for 75 star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds, using the 2-Micron
All-Sky Survey (2MASS). The majority of the clusters in our sample have robust
age and metallicity estimates from color-magnitude diagrams available in the
literature, and populate a range of ages from 10 Myr to 15 Gyr and a range in
[Fe/H] from -2.17 to +0.01 dex. A comparison with matched star clusters in the
2MASS Extended Source Catalog (XSC) reveals that the XSC only provides a good
fit to the unresolved component of the cluster stellar population. We also
compare our results with the often-cited single-channel JHK photometry of
Persson and collaborators, and find significant differences, especially for
their 30""-diameter apertures up to ~2.5 mag in the K-band, more than 1 mag in
J-K, and up to 0.5 mag in H-K. Using simulations to center apertures based on
maximum light throughput (as performed by Persson et al, we show that these
differences can be attributed to near-IR-bright cluster stars (e.g., Carbon
stars) located away from the true center of the star clusters. The wide age and
metallicity coverage of our integrated JHKs photometry sample constitutes a
fundamental dataset for testing population synthesis model predictions, and for
direct comparison with near-IR observations of distant stellar populations.

3-3.6 sigma level of significance) in X-rays based on deep monitoring with the
XRT ranging from 8 to 120 days after the outburst. The inferred X-ray
luminosity [(2+/-1) x 10^{38} ergs/s; 0.3-2 keV band] is likely caused by
interaction of the SN shock with circumstellar material (CSM), deposited by a
stellar wind from the progenitor's companion star with a mass-loss rate of ~ 3
x 10^{-6} M_sun/yr (v_w/10 km/s). Evidence of CSM interaction in X-rays is
independently confirmed by an excess of UV emission as observed with the UVOT
onboard Swift, starting around 35 days after the explosion. The non-detection
of SN 2005ke with Chandra 105 days after the outburst implies a rate of decline
steeper than L_x \propto t^{-0.75}, consistent with the decline expected from
the interaction of the SN shock with a spherically symmetric CSM (t^{-1}). None
of the other seven SNe Ia is detected in X-rays or shows a UV excess, which
allows us to put tight constraints on the mass-loss rates of the progenitor
systems.

thin (but with finite thickness) sheets. We present the governing dynamical
equations for the multifluid system of neutral gas and ions, including
ambipolar diffusion, and also a self-consistent treatment of thermal pressure,
gravitational, and magnetic (pressure and tension) forces. The dimensionless
free parameters characterizing model clouds are discussed. The response of
cloud models to linear perturbations is also examined, with particular emphasis
on length and time scales for the growth of gravitational instability in
magnetically subcritical and supercritical clouds. We investigate their
dependence on a cloud's initial mass-to-magnetic-flux ratio (normalized to the
critical value for collapse), the dimensionless initial neutral-ion collision
time, and also the relative external pressure exerted on a model cloud. Among
our results, we find that nearly-critical model clouds have significantly
larger characteristic instability lengthscales than do more distinctly sub- or
supercritical models. Another result is that the effect of a greater external
pressure is to reduce the critical lengthscale for instability. Numerical
simulations showing the evolution of model clouds during the linear regime of
evolution are also presented, and compared to the results of the dispersion
analysis. They are found to be in agreement with the dispersion results, and
confirm the dependence of the characteristic length and time scales on
parameters such as the initial mass-to-flux ratio and relative external
pressure.

gravitational lens JVAS B0218+357. From the multi-frequency observations
presented in a recent study (Mittal et al. 2006) and several previous
observations made by other authors, the anomaly is well-established in that the
image flux-density ratio (A/B) decreases from 3.9 to 2.0 over the observed
frequency range from 15 GHz to 1.65 GHz. In Mittal et al. (2006), the authors
investigated whether an interplay between a frequency-dependent structure of
the background radio-source and a gradient in the relative image-magnification
can explain away the anomaly. Insufficient shifts in the image centroids with
frequency led them to discard the above effect as the cause of the anomaly. In
this paper, we first take this analysis further by evaluating the combined
effect of the background source extension and magnification gradients in the
lens plane in more detail. This is done by making a direct use of the observed
VLBI flux-distributions for each image to estimate the image flux-density
ratios at different frequencies from a lens-model. As a result of this
investigation, this mechanism does not account for the anomaly. Following this,
we analyze the effects of mechanisms which are non-gravitational in nature on
the image flux ratios in B0218+357. These are free-free absorption and
scattering, and are assumed to occur under the hypothesis of a molecular cloud
residing in the lens galaxy along the line-of-sight to image A. We show that
free-free absorption due to an H II region covering the entire structure of
image A at 1.65 GHz can explain the image flux ratio anomaly. We also discuss
whether H II regions with physical parameters as derived from our analysis are
consistent with those observed in Galactic and extragalactic H II regions.

scales by solving the equations of ionization balance and radiative transfer to
first order in perturbations. Given the spatial distribution and spectrum of
the ionizing sources, our formalism can be used to predict the large scale
power spectra of fluctuations in the abundances of HII, HI and radiation. Our
approach avoids common approximations/assumptions in existing analytic methods
-- for instance, we do not assume a specific ionization topology from the
outset; nor do we make a step-function bubble-like approximation to the HII
distribution. Applying our formalism to sources biased according to the
Press-Schechter prescription, we find: 1. reionization always proceeds
``inside--out'', with dense regions more highly ionized, at least on large
scales; 2. on sufficiently large scales, HII, HI and radiation exhibits a scale
independent bias relative to dark matter; 3. the bias is suppressed on scales
comparable to or smaller than the mean free path of the ionizing photons; 4. if
the ionizing source spectrum is sufficiently soft, the HII bias closely tracks
the source bias for most of the reionization process but drops precipitously
after percolation; 5. if the ionizing source spectrum is sufficiently hard, the
HII bias drops in a more steady fashion throughout the reionization process.
The tools developed here will be useful for interpreting future 21 cm, CMB and
Lyman-alpha forest observations, both to learn about the reionization
astrophysics (such as the hardness of the source spectrum and therefore the
nature of the ionizing sources) and to possibly extract interesting
cosmological information.

which the matching colour selection is most reliable, we find no evidence for

expected from a simple passive evolution model. This lack of additional
evolution is quantified using the comoving luminosity density of SDSS and 2SLAQ

evolution (beyond passive) in the LF of LRGs brighter than M_r - 5logh = -21

density of these samples is dominated by galaxies fainter than the
characteristic luminosity, and the HUDF reveals considerably more luminosity
than shallower surveys. The apparent ultraviolet luminosity density of galaxies

density distribution of Miralda-Escude et al. (2000) (MHR00), and a lognormal
distribution. We assume a uniform UV background and an isothermal IGM for the
MHR00 model, as has been done in previous works. Under these assumptions, the
MHR00 model produces poor fits to the observed flux PDFs at redshifts where the
optical depth distribution is well sampled, unless large continuum corrections
are applied. However, the lognormal optical depth distribution fits the data at
all redshifts with only minor continuum adjustments. We use a simple
parametrization for the evolution of the lognormal parameters to calculate the
expected mean transmitted flux at z > 5.4. The lognormal optical depth
distribution predicts the observed Ly-alpha and Ly-beta effective optical
depths at z > 5.7 while simultaneously fitting the mean transmitted flux down
to z = 1.6. If the evolution of the lognormal distribution at z < 5 reflects a
slowly-evolving density field, temperature, and UV background, then no sudden
change in the IGM at z ~ 6 due to late reionization appears necessary. We have
used the lognormal optical depth distribution without any assumption about the
underlying density field. If the MHR00 density distribution is correct, then a
non-uniform UV background and/or IGM temperature may be required to produce the
correct flux PDF. We find that an inverse temperature-density relation greatly
improves the PDF fits, but with a large scatter in the equation of state index.

the physical conditions in the narrow-line region (NLR) of active galactic
nuclei (AGNs). We recently used optical long-slit spectroscopy to study the
NLRs of a sample of six Seyfert-2 galaxies. We have shown that such an
approach, in comparison to the commonly used [OIII] narrow-band imaging alone,
allows us to probe the size of the NLR in terms of AGN photoionisation.
Moreover, several physical parameters of the NLR can be directly accessed. We
here apply the same methods to study the NLR of six Seyfert-1 galaxies and
compare our results to those of Seyfert-2 galaxies. We employ diagnostically
valuable emission-line ratios to determine the physical properties of the NLR,
including the core values and radial dependencies of density, ionisation
parameter, and reddening. Tracking the radial change of emission-line ratios in
diagnostic diagrams allows us to measure the transition between AGN-like and
HII-like line excitation, and thus we are able to measure the size of the NLR.
In the diagnostic diagrams, we find a transition between line ratios falling in
the AGN regime and those typical for HII regions in two Seyfert-1 galaxies,
thus determining the size of the NLR. The central electron temperature and
ionisation parameter are in general higher in type-1 Seyferts than in type 2s.
In almost all cases, both electron density and ionisation parameter decrease
with radius. In general, the decrease is faster in Seyfert-1 galaxies than in
type 2s. In several objects, the gaseous velocity distribution is
characteristic for rotational motion in an (inclined) emission-line disk in the
centre. We give estimates of the black hole masses. We discuss our findings in
detail for each object.

their color-magnitude diagrams to a grid of isochrones calibrated to Galactic
globular clusters observed in the same bands. Each field exhibits an extended
star formation history, with many stars younger than 10 Gyr but few younger
than 4 Gyr. Considered together, the star counts, kinematics, and population
characteristics of the spheroid argue against some explanations for its
intermediate-age, metal-rich population, such as a significant contribution
from stars residing in the disk or a chance intersection with the stream's
orbit. Instead, it is likely that this population is intrinsic to the inner
spheroid, whose highly-disturbed structure is clearly distinct from the
pressure-supported metal-poor halo that dominates farther from the galaxy's
center. The stream and spheroid populations are similar, but not identical,
with the stream's mean age being ~1 Gyr younger; this similarity suggests that
the inner spheroid is largely polluted by material stripped from either the
stream's progenitor or similar objects. The disk population is considerably
younger and more metal-rich than the stream and spheroid populations, but not
as young as the thin disk population of the solar neighborhood; instead, the
outer disk of Andromeda is dominated by stars of age 4 - 8 Gyr, resembling the
Milky Way's thick disk. The disk data are inconsistent with a population
dominated by ages older than 10 Gyr, and in fact do not require any stars older
than 10 Gyr.

the stars and by performing the corresponding radiative transfer calculations
we closely (given the simple geometry of the model) reproduce the FIR and NIR
maps of the Milky Way. Similar distributions for the atomic and molecular
hydrogen in the disk are used (with an inner cut-off radius for the atomic
hydrogen) to fit the gas data. The star formation rate as a function of the
Galactic radius is derived from the FIR emission and is well in agreement with
existing estimates from various star formation tracers. The gas surface density
is plotted against the star formation rate density and an ``intrinsic''
Galactic Schmidt law is derived with excellent agreement with the ``external''
Schmidt law found for spiral galaxies. The Milky Way is found to consume $\sim
1%$ and $\sim 10%$ of its gas in the outer and inner regions respectively (for
a period of 0.1 Gyr) to make stars. The dust-induced B-V color excess observed
in various directions and distances (up to $\sim 6.5$ kpc) with well-studied
Cepheid stars is compared with the model predictions showing a good agreement.
The simple assumption of exponential distributions of stars and dust in the

another recent Parkes multibeam survey at high Galactic latitudes, we have a

population of 30000 +/- 1100 potentially detectable pulsars (i.e. those beaming
towards us) having 1.4-GHz luminosities above 0.1 mJy kpc squared. Using a
pulsar current analysis, we derive the birth rate of this population to be 1.4
+/- 0.2 pulsars per century. An important conclusion from our work is that the
inferred radial density function of pulsars depends strongly on the assumed
distribution of free electrons in the Galaxy. As a result, any analyses using
the most recent electron model of Cordes & Lazio predict a dearth of pulsars in
the inner Galaxy. We show that this model can also bias the inferred pulsar
scale height with respect to the Galactic plane. Combining our results with
other Parkes multibeam surveys we find that the population is best described by
an exponential distribution with a scale height of 330 pc.

full radiation-hydrodynamics calculation. Towards this end, we have performed a
series of detailed, 1D, radiation-hydrodynamical simulations. We have varied
the distance to the source (and, hence, the flux) and the mass and evolutionary
stage of the target haloes to quantify this effect. We find: (1) trapping of
the I-front and its transformation from R-type to D-type, preceded by a shock
front; (2) photoevaporation of the ionized gas (i.e. all gas originally located
outside the trapping radius); (3) formation of an H_2 precursor shell which
leads the I-front, stimulated by partial photoionization; and (4) the
shock-induced formation of H_2 in the minihalo neutral core when the shock
speeds up and partially ionizes the gas. The fate of the neutral core is mostly
determined by the response of the core to this shock front, which leads to
molecular cooling and collapse that, when compared to the same halo without
external radiation, is either: (a) expedited, (b) delayed, (c) unaltered, or
(d) reversed or prevented, depending upon the flux (i.e. distance to the
source) and the halo mass and evolutionary stage. Roughly speaking, most haloes
that were destined to cool, collapse, and form stars in the absence of external
radiation are found to do so even when exposed to the first Pop III star in

of the compactness problem for GRB sources and how it is resolved in the

constraints on the collimation of the gamma-rays and the dependence of the
collimation angle on the photon energy are considered. The fact that the
threshold for the creation of $e^{-}e^{+}$ pairs depends on the angle between
the momenta of the annihilating photons in the GRB source provides an
alternative solution to the compactness problem. A new approach to explaining
GRBs, taking into account the angular dependence for pair creation, is
proposed, and the main features of a scenario describing a GRB source with a
total (photon) energy smaller or of the order of $10^{49}$ erg are laid out.
Thus, we are dealing with an alternative to an ultra-relativistic fireball, if
it turns out (as follows from observations) that all ""long"" GRBs are associated

pressure and the formation of jets as a consequence of even a small amount of

frequency (number of GCs per unit V-band luminosity) is enhanced in S0s
relative to spirals. If the transformation hypothesis is correct, and no GCs
are created or destroyed in the process, then this difference provides a
measure of the degree to which the S0's V-band luminosity has faded relative to
that of its spiral progenitor. We also explore whether the degree to which the
GC specific frequency is enhanced in S0s correlates with the colour of the
stellar population, as also predicted by this hypothesis in which galaxies
become redder as they fade. We find that, on average, the GC specific frequency
is a factor ~3 larger for S0s than for spirals, which can be interpreted as
meaning that passively-evolving S0s have faded by about a factor of 3 from
their spiral progenitors. This value fits remarkably well with the predictions
of stellar population synthesis calculations, and the offset between the S0 and
spiral Tully-Fisher relations. We also find that the global colours of S0
galaxies are strongly correlated with their GC specific frequencies: the redder
the stellar population of an S0, the larger its specific frequency, as we might
expect if we are catching different S0s at different stages of passively fading
and reddening. Comparison to the predictions of stellar population synthesis
models show that this explanation works quantitatively as well as
qualitatively. These tests strongly support the hypothesis that S0 galaxies
were once normal spirals, whose star formation was cut off, presumably due to a
change of environment.

systematically different, by up to a factor of 2, from photometric masses of
z~0 galaxies with the same dynamical mass. The magnitude of this bias depends
on the choice of stellar population synthesis model and the rest-frame
wavelength range used in the fits. The best result, i.e., without significant
bias, is obtained when rest-frame optical SEDs are fitted with models from
Bruzual&Charlot (2003). When the SEDs are extended to the rest-frame near-IR, a
bias is introduced: photometric masses of the z~1 galaxies increase by a factor
of 2 relative to the photometric masses of the z~0 galaxies. When we use the
Maraston (2005) models, the photometric masses of the z~1 galaxies are low
relative to the photometric masses of the z~0 galaxies by a factor of ~1.8.
This offset occurs both for fits based on rest-frame optical SEDs, and fits
based on rest-frame optical+near-IR SEDs. The results indicate that model
uncertainties produce uncertainties as high as a factor of 2.5 in mass
estimates from rest-frame near-IR photometry, independent of uncertainties due

(t/omega0)^{1/2}>g/omega0>(t/omega0)^{1/4}>1 by considering the scaling

at different magnetic fields and temperatures. Strong suppression of the
resistance by the electric field is observed in magnetic fields at which the
Landau quantization of electron motion occurs. The phenomenon survives at high
temperature where Shubnikov de Haas oscillations are absent. The scale of the
electric fields essential for the effect is found to be proportional to
temperature in the low temperature limit. We suggest that the strong reduction
of the longitudinal resistance is the result of a nontrivial change in the
distribution function of 2D electrons induced by the DC electric field.
Comparison of the data with recent theory yields the inelastic electron-electon

resistance in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). Understanding charge
injection at the metal-organic interface is critical to optimizing OFET device
performance. We have performed a series of experiments using bottom-contact
poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) OFETs in the shallow channel limit to examine the
injection process. When contacts are ohmic we find that contact resistivity is
inversely proportional to carrier mobility, consistent with diffusion-limited
injection. However, data from devices with other electrode materials indicate
that this simple picture is inadequate to describe contacts with significant
barriers. A generalized transmission line method allows the analysis of
nonohmic contacts, and we find reasonable agreement with a model for injection
that accounts for the hopping nature of conduction in the polymer. Variation of
the (unintentional) dopant concentration in the P3HT can significantly alter
the injection process via changes in metal-organic band alignment. At very low
doping levels, transport suggests the formation of a barrier at the Au/P3HT
interface, while Pt/P3HT contacts remain ohmic with comparatively low
resistance. We recently observed that self-assembled monolayers on the metal
source/drain electrodes can significantly decrease contact resistance and
maintain ohmic conduction under conditions that would result in nonohmic, high
resistance contacts to untreated electrodes. Finally, we discuss measurements
on extremely short channel devices, in the initial steps toward examining
transport through individual polymer chains.

the polaron is extremely anisotropic with a short spatial extent. The presence

led to several proof-of-concept spintronic devices [2-4]. A major hurdle for
realistic applications of (Ga,Mn)As, or other dilute magnetic semiconductors,
remains their below room-temperature ferromagnetic transition temperature.
Enhancing ferromagnetism in semiconductors requires understanding the
mechanisms for interaction between magnetic dopants, such as Mn, and
identifying the circumstances in which ferromagnetic interactions are maximized
[5]. Here we report the use of a novel atom-by-atom substitution technique with
the scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) to perform the first controlled atomic
scale study of the interactions between isolated Mn acceptors mediated by the
electronic states of GaAs. High-resolution STM measurements are used to
visualize the GaAs electronic states that participate in the Mn-Mn interaction
and to quantify the interaction strengths as a function of relative position
and orientation. Our experimental findings, which can be explained using
tight-binding model calculations, reveal a strong dependence of ferromagnetic
interaction on crystallographic orientation. This anisotropic interaction can
potentially be exploited by growing oriented Ga1-xMnxAs structures to enhance
the ferromagnetic transition temperature beyond that achieved in randomly doped
samples. Our experimental methods also provide a realistic approach to create
precise arrangements of single spins as coupled quantum bits for memory or
information processing purposes.

machines floating in a virtual liquid. The machines can bond together to form
strands (chains) that self-replicate and self-assemble into user-specified
meshes. There are four types of machines and the sequence of machine types in a
strand determines the shape of the mesh they will build. A strand may be in an
unfolded state, in which the bonds are straight, or in a folded state, in which
the bond angles depend on the types of machines. By choosing the sequence of
machine types in a strand, the user can specify a variety of polygonal shapes.
A simulation typically begins with an initial unfolded seed strand in a soup of
unbonded machines. The seed strand replicates by bonding with free machines in
the soup. The child strands fold into the encoded polygonal shape, and then the
polygons drift together and bond to form a mesh. We demonstrate that a variety
of polygonal meshes can be manufactured in the simulation, by simply changing
the sequence of machine types in the seed.

there are several candidates which show essential hints as to what a quantum
theory of gravity may look like. In particular, loop quantum gravity is a
non-perturbative formulation which is background independent, two properties
which are essential close to a classical singularity with strong fields and a
degenerate metric. In cosmological and black hole settings one can indeed see
explicitly how classical singularities are removed by quantum geometry: there
is a well-defined evolution all the way down to, and across, the smallest
scales. As for black holes, their horizon dynamics can be studied showing
characteristic modifications to the classical behavior. Conceptual and physical
issues can also be addressed in this context, providing lessons for quantum
gravity in general. Here, we conclude with some comments on the uniqueness

  layout changed",,,"CPHT-T 058.0706","hep-lat",,"  This PhD dissertation is devoted to a non-perturbative study of QCD
correlators. The main tool that we use is lattice QCD. We concentrated our
efforts on the study of the main correlators of the pure Yang - Mills theory in
the Landau gauge, namely the ghost and the gluon propagators. We are
particularly interested in determining the $\Lqcd$ parameter. It is extracted
by means of perturbative predictions available up to NNNLO. The related topic
is the influence of non-perturbative effects that show up as appearance of
power-corrections to the low-momentum behaviour of the Green functions. A new
method of removing these power corrections allows a better estimate of $\Lqcd$.
Our result is $\Lambda^{n_f=0}_{\ms} = 269(5)^{+12}_{-9}$ MeV. Another question
that we address is the infrared behaviour of Green functions, at momenta of
order and below $\Lqcd$. At low energy the momentum dependence of the
propagators changes considerably, and this is probably related to confinement.
The lattice approach allows to check the predictions of analytical methods
because it gives access to non-perturbative correlators. According to our
analysis the gluon propagator is finite and non-zero at vanishing momentum, and
the power-law behaviour of the ghost propagator is the same as in the free
case.

scattering off nuclei and hard proton-nucleus collisions can be characterized
by the multiplicity of color-excited nucleons. Within reggeon field theory,
each color-excited nucleon is associated with the unitarity cut of the pomeron
exchanged between the projectile and nucleus. In this communication we derive
the unitarity rules for the multiplicity of excited nucleons, alias cut
pomerons, alias topological cross sections, for typical hard dijet production
processes. We demonstrate how the coupled-channel non-Abelian intranuclear
evolution of color dipoles, inherent to pQCD, gives rise to the reggeon field
theory diagrams for final states in terms of the uncut, and two kinds of cut,
pomerons. Upon the proper identification of the uncut and cut pomeron
exchanges, the topological cross sections for dijet production follow in a
straightforward way from the earlier derived nonlinear k_t - factorization
quadratures for the inclusive dijet cross sections. The concept of a coherent
(collective) nuclear glue proves extremely useful for the formulation of
reggeon field theory vertices of multipomeron - cut and uncut - couplings to
particles and between themselves. A departure of our unitarity cutting rules
from the ones suggested by the pre-QCD Abramovsky-Kancheli-Gribov rules, stems
from the coupled-channel features of intranuclear pQCD. We propose a
multiplicity re-summation as a tool for the isolation of topological cross
sections for single-jet production.

imposes significant constraint on various models for new physics. A warped
extra-dimension model with custodial isospin symmetry accommodates the Bd-Bd
mixing at tree level mainly through the Kaluza-Klein gluons. This is due to the
misalignment between the bulk gauge eigenstates and the localized Yukawa
eigenstates of the bulk fermions. We adopt the universal 5D Yukawa coupling
model where all Yukawa couplings are of order one. The SM fermion mass spectra
and mixings are controlled by the bulk Dirac mass parameters. With two versions
of the hadronic parameter values, we investigate the implication of the
observed BB mixings on this model. The CP-violating effects on the Bd system is
shown to provide very strong constraint: The first Kaluza-Klein mass of a gluon
has its lower bound about 3.7 TeV with 1 sigma uncertainty.

induced effects in QED and QCD. The general analysis is then extended to a set

obtained by Arveson, Guo, Wang and the author. More recently, Guo and Wang
extended the results to quasi-homogeneous ideals in two variables. Building on
their techniques, in this note the author extends this result to Hilbert
modules over certain Reinhardt domains such as ellipsoids in two variables and
analyzes extending the result to the closure of quasi-homogeneous ideals in m
variables when the zero variety has dimension one.

d-dimensional space describing wave propagation with the initial data in the
form of a finite sum of wavepackets referred to as multi-wavepackets. The
problem involves two small parameters beta and rho where: (i) (1/beta) is a
factor describing spatial extension of the wavepackets; (ii) (1/rho) is a
factor describing the relative magnitude of the linear part of the evolution
equation compared to its nonlinearity. For a wide range of the small parameters
and on time intervals long enough for strong nonlinear effects we prove that
multi-wavepackets are preserved under the nonlinear evolution. In particular,
the corresponding wave vectors and the band numbers of involved wavepackets are
""conserved quantities"". We also prove that the evolution of a multi-wavepacket
is described with high accuracy by a properly constructed system of envelope
equations with a universal nonlinearity which in simpler cases turn into
well-known Nonlinear Schrodinger or coupled modes equations. The universal
nonlinearity is obtained by a certain time averaging applied to the original
nonlinearity. This can be viewed as an extension of the well known averaging
method developed for finite-dimensional nonlinear oscillatory systems to the
case of a general translation invariant PDE systems with the linear part having
continuous spectrum.

  stable homotopy categories","Ph.D. thesis, University of Washington, 2005",,,,"math.AT math.AC",,"  We study the triangulated subcategories of compact objects in stable homotopy
categories such as the homotopy category of spectra, the derived categories of
rings, and the stable module categories of Hopf algebras. In the first part of
this thesis we use a K-theory recipe of Thomason to classify these
subcategories. This recipe when applied to the category of finite p-local
spectra gives a refinement of the ``chromatic tower''. This refinement has some
interesting consequences. In particular, it gives new evidence to a conjecture
of Frank Adams that the thick subcategory C_2 can be generated by iterated
cofiberings of the Smith-Toda complex V(1). Similarly by applying this K-theory
recipe to derived categories, we obtain a complete classification of the
triangulated subcategories of perfect complexes over some noetherian rings.
Motivated by these classifications, in the second part of the thesis, we study
Krull-Schmidt decompositions for thick subcategories. More precisely, we show
that the thick subcategories of compact objects in the aforementioned stable
homotopy categories decompose uniquely into indecomposable thick subcategories.
Some consequences of these decompositions are also discussed. In particular, it
is shown that all these decompositions respect K-theory. Finally in the last
chapter we mimic some of these ideas in the category of R-modules. Here we
consider abelian subcategories of R-modules that are closed under extensions
and study their K-theory and decompositions.

has been built upon a dynamic general equilibrium model of optimal monetary
policy as developed by, e.g., Goodfriend and King (1997), Clarida et al.
(1999), Svensson (1999) and Woodford (2003). In this paper we extend the
standard optimal monetary policy model by introducing nonlinearity into the
Phillips curve. Under the specific form of nonlinearity proposed in our paper
(which allows for convexity and concavity and secures closed form solutions),
we show that the introduction of a nonlinear Phillips curve into the structure
of the standard model in a discrete time and deterministic framework produces
radical changes to the major conclusions regarding stability and the efficiency
of monetary policy. We emphasize the following main results: (i) instead of a
unique fixed point we end up with multiple equilibria; (ii) instead of
saddle--path stability, for different sets of parameter values we may have
saddle stability, totally unstable equilibria and chaotic attractors; (iii) for
certain degrees of convexity and/or concavity of the Phillips curve, where
endogenous fluctuations arise, one is able to encounter various results that
seem intuitively correct. Firstly, when the Central Bank pays attention
essentially to inflation targeting, the inflation rate has a lower mean and is
less volatile; secondly, when the degree of price stickiness is high, the
inflation rate displays a larger mean and higher volatility (but this is
sensitive to the values given to the parameters of the model); and thirdly, the
higher the target value of the output gap chosen by the Central Bank, the
higher is the inflation rate and its volatility.

\delta(t-t^{\prime})|{\bf x}-{\bf x^{\prime}}|^{2\epsilon}$ is studied by using
the field theoretic renormalization group and the operator product expansion.
The inertial-range stability of the corresponding scaling regime is
established. The anomalous scaling of the single-time structure functions is
studied and the corresponding anomalous exponents are calculated. Their
dependence on the compressibility parameter and anisotropy parameters is
analyzed. It is shown that, as in the isotropic case, the presence of
compressibility leads to the decreasing of the critical dimensions of the
important composite operators, i.e., the anomalous scaling is more pronounced
in the compressible systems. All calculations are done to the first order in
$\epsilon$.

such collisions result in systems characterized by much higher baryon chemical

diagram. Discovery of the critical point or, equivalently, determining the
location where the phase transition from partonic to hadronic matter switches
from a smooth crossover to 1st order would establish a major landmark in the

revealed several unexpected features in the data. In response to these results,

"quant-ph/0607204","Julia Kempe","Julia Kempe, Laszlo Pyber and Aner Shalev","Permutation groups, minimal degrees and quantum computing","28 pages, no figures",,,,"quant-ph math.GR",,"  We study permutation groups of given minimal degree without the classical
primitivity assumption. We provide sharp upper bounds on the order of a
permutation group of minimal degree m and on the number of its elements of any
given support. These results contribute to the foundations of a non-commutative
coding theory.
  A main application of our results concerns the Hidden Subgroup Problem for
the symmetric group in Quantum Computing. We completely characterize the hidden
subgroups of the symmetric group that can be distinguished from identity with
weak Quantum Fourier Sampling, showing these are exactly the subgroups with
bounded minimal degree. This implies that the weak standard method for the
symmetric group has no advantage whatsoever over classical exhaustive search.

  micro-mirror",,"Nature 444 (2006) 71","10.1038/nature05244",,"quant-ph",,"  Recent experimental progress in table-top experiments or gravitational-wave
interferometers has enlightened the unique displacement sensitivity offered by
optical interferometry. As the mirrors move in response to radiation pressure,
higher power operation, though crucial for further sensitivity enhancement,
will however increase quantum effects of radiation pressure, or even jeopardize
the stable operation of the detuned cavities proposed for next-generation
interferometers. The appearance of such optomechanical instabilities is the
result of the nonlinear interplay between the motion of the mirrors and the
optical field dynamics. In a detuned cavity indeed, the displacements of the
mirror are coupled to intensity fluctuations, which modifies the effective
dynamics of the mirror. Such ""optical spring"" effects have already been
demonstrated on the mechanical damping of an electromagnetic waveguide with a
moving wall, on the resonance frequency of a specially designed flexure
oscillator, and through the optomechanical instability of a silica
micro-toroidal resonator. We present here an experiment where a
micro-mechanical resonator is used as a mirror in a very high-finesse optical
cavity and its displacements monitored with an unprecedented sensitivity. By
detuning the cavity, we have observed a drastic cooling of the micro-resonator
by intracavity radiation pressure, down to an effective temperature of 10 K. We
have also obtained an efficient heating for an opposite detuning, up to the
observation of a radiation-pressure induced instability of the resonator.
Further experimental progress and cryogenic operation may lead to the
experimental observation of the quantum ground state of a mechanical resonator,
either by passive or active cooling techniques.

on pairs of qubits which each interact with a harmonic oscillator degree of
freedom (the \emph{bus}), but do not directly interact with one another. Our
scheme uses only weak interactions between the qubit and the bus, homodyne
measurements, and single qubit operations. In contrast to earlier schemes, the
technique presented here is extremely robust to photon loss in the bus mode,
and can function with high fidelity even when the rate of photon loss is
comparable to the strength of the qubit-bus coupling.
