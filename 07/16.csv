electrons whose synchrotron emission is observed in radio and X-rays. Recent
observations by the HESS instrument reveal that supernova remnants also emit
TeV gamma-rays; long awaited experimental evidence that supernova remnants can
accelerate cosmic rays up to the ``knee'' energies. Still, uncertainty exists
whether these gamma-rays are produced by electrons via inverse Compton
scattering or by protons via neutral pion decay. The multi-wavelength spectra
of supernova remnants can be fitted with both mechanisms, although a preference
is often given to neutral pion decay due to the spectral shape at very high
energies. A recent study of the interstellar radiation field indicates that its
energy density, especially in the inner Galaxy, is higher than previously
thought. In this paper we evaluate the effect of the interstellar radiation
field on the inverse Compton emission of electrons accelerated in a supernova
remnant located at different distances from the Galactic Centre. We show that
contribution of optical and infra-red photons to the inverse Compton emission
may exceed the contribution of cosmic microwave background and in some cases
broaden the resulted gamma-ray spectrum. Additionally, we show that if a
supernova remnant is located close to the Galactic Centre its gamma-ray
spectrum will exhibit a ``universal'' cutoff at very high energies due to the
Klein-Nishina effect and not due to the cut-off of the electron spectrum. As an
example, we apply our calculations to the supernova remnants RX J1713.7-3946
and G0.9+0.1 recently observed by HESS.

variety of high energy astrophysical sources. A theory of collisionless shocks
based on first principles does not, however, exist. Observations of gamma-ray
burst (GRB) ""afterglows"" provide a unique opportunity for diagnosing the
physics of relativistic collisionless shocks. Most GRBs are believed to be
associated with explosions of massive stars. Their ""afterglows,"" delayed low
energy emission following the prompt burst of gamma-rays, are well accounted
for by a model in which afterglow radiation is due to synchrotron emission of
electrons accelerated in relativistic collisionless shock waves driven by the
explosion into the surrounding plasma. Within the framework of this model, some
striking characteristics of collisionless relativistic shocks are implied.
These include the generation of downstream magnetic fields with energy density
exceeding that of the upstream field by ~8 orders of magnitude, the survival of
this strong field at distances ~10^{10} skin-depths downstream of the shock,
and the acceleration of particles to a power-law energy spectrum, d\log n/d\log
E ~ -2, possibly extending to 10^{20}eV. I review in this talk the
phenomenological considerations, based on which these characteristics are
inferred, and the challenges posed to our current models of particle

$\beta$ of the disc rotation speed $v_{\theta}\propto R^{-\beta}$ falls in the

holding-back of a deep background dark matter halo potential, the isopedic

overtaking the disc self-gravity, which can significantly influence global
stationary MHD perturbation configurations and stability properties of the
scale-free disc system. Only for stationary logarithmic spiral MHD
perturbations with a perturbation scale-free index $\beta_1=1/4$ or for aligned

self-gravitating point particles in static euclidean space, starting from a
simple class of infinite ``shuffled lattice'' initial conditions. These are
obtained by applying independently to each particle on an infinite perfect
lattice a small random displacement, and are characterized by a power spectrum
(structure factor) of density fluctuations which is quadratic in the wave
number k, at small k. For a specified form of the probability distribution
function of the ``shuffling'' applied to each particle, and zero initial
velocities, these initial configurations are characterized by a single relevant
parameter: the variance $\delta^2$ of the ``shuffling'' normalized in units of
the lattice spacing $\ell$. The clustering, which develops in time starting
from scales around $\ell$, is qualitatively very similar to that seen in
cosmological simulations, which begin from lattices with applied correlated
displacements and incorporate an expanding spatial background. From very soon
after the formation of the first non-linear structures, a spatio-temporal
scaling relation describes well the evolution of the two-point correlations. At
larger times the dynamics of these correlations converges to what is termed
``self-similar'' evolution in cosmology, in which the time dependence in the
scaling relation is specified entirely by that of the linearized fluid theory.
Comparing simulations with different $\delta$, different resolution, but
identical large scale fluctuations, we are able to identify and study features
of the dynamics of the system in the transient phase leading to this behavior.
In this phase, the discrete nature of the system explicitly plays an essential
role.

supported on the zero section of $TM$. The resulting algebra of generalized
functions contains an idempotent element which can be thought of as a natural
counterpart of the Bergman projection operator. Using this idempotent, we
define an algebra of Toeplitz elements and show that it is naturally isomorphic
to the algebra of Berezin-Toeplitz deformation quantization on $M$.

dynamics. When an invariant manifold is represented approximately by a graph
for example, the whole stochastic dynamical system may be reduced or restricted
to this manifold. This reduced system may provide valuable dynamical
information for the original system. The authors have derived an invariant
manifold reduction or restriction principle for systems of Stratonovich or Ito
stochastic differential equations.
  Two concepts of invariance are considered for invariant manifolds.
  The first invariance concept is in the framework of cocycles -- an invariant
manifold being a random set. The dynamical reduction is achieved by
investigating random center manifolds.
  The second invariance concept is in the sense of almost sure -- an invariant
manifold being a deterministic set which is not necessarily attracting. The
restriction of the original stochastic system on this deterministic local
invariant manifold is still a stochastic system but with reduced dimension.

whose exterior is a once-punctured torus bundle if and only if $Y$ is the
result of $p/q$-surgery on the trefoil. This partially answers a question posed
by Ken Baker in a paper in which he gives a complete classification of genus
one fibered knots contained in lens spaces. Combining Baker's classification
with Moser's characterization of lens space surgeries on the trefoil, we
generate an infinite family of lens spaces which do not contain any knot whose
exterior is a once-punctured torus bundle.

among invariants. Geometric invariant theory quotients come with a natural
ample line bundle, and hence often a natural projective embedding. This
question translates to determining the equations of the moduli space under this
embedding. This note deals with one of the most classical quotients, the space
of ordered points on the projective line. We show that under any linearization,
this quotient is cut out (scheme-theoretically) by a particularly simple set of
quadric relations, with the single exception of the Segre cubic threefold (the
space of six points with equal weight). Unlike many facts in geometric
invariant theory, these results (at least for the stable locus) are
field-independent, and indeed work over the integers.

is related to the tails of the velocity probability distribution. The
cluster-exponent is uniquely determined by the energy spectrum of the nearly
Gaussian velocity field and entire dependence of the intermittency exponent on
Reynolds number is determined by the cluster-exponent.

state) plays a major role in a variety of nuclear and astrophysical systems.
Spin and isospin asymmetries can have a dramatic impact on the equation of
state and possibly alter its stability conditions. An example is the possible
manifestation of ferromagnetic instabilities, which would indicate the
existence, at a certain density, of a spin-polarized state with lower energy
than the unpolarized one. This issue is being discussed extensively in the
literature and the conclusions are presently very model dependent. We will
report and discuss our recent progress in the study of spin-polarized neutron
matter. The approach we take is microscopic and relativistic. The calculated
neutron matter properties are derived from realistic nucleon-nucleon
interactions. This makes it possible to understand the nature of the EOS
properties in terms of specific features of the nuclear force model.
