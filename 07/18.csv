large dense nuggets. I argue that the width of 511 keV emission in this
mechanism is very narrow (in a few keV range) in agreement with all
observations. The dominant mechanism of the annihilation in this case is the
positronium formation e^+e^-to ^1S_0 to 2\gamma rather than a direct e^+e^- to
2\gamma$ annihilation. I also discuss some generic features of the \gamma rays
spectrum (in few MeV range) resulting from this mechanism.

possible high energy emission could give further indications on the accreting
object nature which remains still unknown. We present here more than two years
of 1E 1743.1-2843 monitoring with INTEGRAL/IBIS as well as public XMM-Newton
and Chandra X-ray observations. The temporal study in the 20-40 keV band shows
a rather constant flux on few months time scale. Based on this result we have
performed the broad-band spectral analysis using EPIC/IBIS non simultaneous
data and ACIS-I/IBIS data collected during 2004. In ~2 Ms, we report a
detection of 6 sigma in the energy range 35-70 keV. The first broad-band study
(2-70 keV) shows a steep slope (~3) and a black body temperature of 1.7 keV.
Combining spectral parameters and discussion about the luminosity evaluations
for different possible distances, our conclusions are in favour of a LMXB
system with a neutron star at distance higher than the Galactic Centre, even
though a firm conclusion can not be stated.

probable brown dwarf binary SDSS 121209.31+013627.7 reveals pulse-like

most likely due to a self-eclipsing accretion hot spot on the white dwarf,
rotating into view every 88.43 minutes. This period is commensurate with the
radial velocity period determined by Schmidt et al. 2005 of ~90 minutes, and
consistent with the rotation period of the accretor being equal to the binary
orbital period. We combine our observations with those recently published by
Koen and Maxted 2006 to provide an accurate ephemeris. We also detect the
system in X-rays with Swift, and estimate the accretion rate at ~1x10^-13Msun
per year. We suggest that SDSS1212 is most likely a magnetic cataclysmic
variable in an extended state of very low accretion, similar to the
well-studied Polar EF Eri. Alternatively, the putative brown dwarf is not
filling its Roche Lobe and the system is a detached binary in which the white
dwarf is efficiently accreting from the wind of the secondary. Six such
post-common envelope, ``pre-Polar'' systems - termed ``low accretion rate
Polars (LARPs)'' by Schwope et al. 2002 - have previously been identified
through optical cyclotron emission lines. Cyclotron emission from SDSS1212 has
recently been detected in the near-IR Debes et al. 2006 but, if detached, it
would be the first ``LARP'' with a probably sub-stellar secondary. It is
unclear whether an L-dwarf wind is strong enough to provide the measured
accretion rate. We suggest further observations to distinguish between the
Roche Lobe over-flow and wind accretion scenarios.

periodic system. If the line-tied kink also produces a steep gradient,
corresponding to a thin current layer, it may lead to strong resistive effects
even with weak dissipation. Numerical solution of the eigenmode equations shows
that the fastest growing kink mode in a line-tied system still possesses a jump
in the radial displacement at the location coincident with the resonant surface
of the fastest growing mode in the periodic counterpart. However, line-tying
thickens the inner layer and slows down the growth rate. As the system length
$L$ approaches infinity, both the inner layer thickness and the growth rate
approach the periodic values. In the limit of small $\epsilon\sim
B_{\phi}/B_{z}$, the critical length for instability $L_{c}\sim\epsilon^{-3}$.

far-infrared, and X-ray emission, as well as their radio and optical
morphologies, and have developed a classification scheme to compare different
selection methods and to select accurately samples of radio emitting galaxies
with AGN and star-forming activity. While alternative classification schemes do
not lead to major differences for star-forming galaxies, we show that
spectroscopic and photometric classifications of AGN lead to incomplete
samples. In particular, a large population of AGN-containing galaxies with
absorption-line spectra, and in many cases extended radio structures (jets,
lobes), is missed in the standard Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich emission-line
classification of active galaxies. This missed class of objects accounts for
roughly half of the radio AGN population. Similarly, for X-ray selected AGN in
our sample, we find that absorption-line AGN account for half of the sample.
Spectroscopically unremarkable, passive galaxies with AGN activity are not an
exception, but the norm, and we show that although they exist in all
environments, these systems preferentially reside in higher density regions.
Because of the existence of this population, the fractional abundance of AGN
increases with increasing density, in contrast to some published results based
on emission-line AGN extracted from the 15R, Sloan and 2DF redshift surveys.

the timescale of bulge chemical enrichment via [O/Fe] versus [Fe/H]. The
[O/Fe]-[Fe/H] relation in the bulge does not follow the disk relation, with
[O/Fe] values falling above those of the disk. Titanium also behaves similarly
to oxygen with respect to iron. Based on these elevated values of [O/Fe] and
[Ti/Fe] extending to large Fe abundances, it is suggested that the bulge
underwent a more rapid chemical enrichment than the halo. In addition, there
are declines in both [O/Fe] and [Ti/Fe] in those bulge targets with the largest
Fe abundances, signifying another source affecting chemical evolution: perhaps
Supernovae of Type Ia. Sodium abundances increase dramatically in the bulge
with increasing metallicity, possibly reflecting the metallicity dependant
yields from supernovae of Type II, although Na contamination from H-burning in
intermediate mass stars cannot be ruled out.

effect of adiabatic contraction of dark matter halos in response to

significantly improves observational match of both the slope and intercept of

over-produce the galaxy stellar mass function and predict the virial r-band

short-duration outburst BHLMXBs makes it improbable that any one source would
be caught in an outburst during a single snapshot observation. Long-duration
outburst BHLMXBs, although much rarer, would be detectable in a series of
snapshot observations separated by several years. Our analysis of multi-epoch
Chandra observations of the giant elliptical galaxies NGC1399 and M87 separated

long-duration outburst BHLMXBs reside within globular clusters of the galaxies.
Conversely, no definitive short-duration outburst BHLMXBs were detected in any

short--to--long-duration outbursters that is slightly lower, but consistent
with what is seen in the Milky Way. The fact that none of the luminous sources
turned off between the first and last epochs places a 95 per cent lower limit
of 50 yr on the mean burst duration of the long-duration outburst sources. The
most likely scenario for the origin of these sources is that they are
long-period (>30 d) black hole binaries with a red giant donor, much like
GRS1915+105. However, unlike GRS1915+105, most of the sources show only modest
variability from epoch to epoch.

which generated the burst emission (internal shocks in a relativistic outflow),
while the following phases of slower decay can be identified with synchrotron
emission from the forward shock sweeping the circumburst medium. Most likely,
the phase of slowest decay is due to a continuous energy injection in the
forward shock. That the optical power-law decay continues unabated after the
end of energy injection requires an ambient medium with a wind-like density
structure (n propto r^{-2}) and forward shock microphysical parameters that
change with the shock's Lorentz factor. A later break of the X-ray light-curve

b=4.1^{+1.5}_{-2.6}, using an accurate model for the redshift distribution. No

changed over the first 60 days of the outburst, ruling out currently-popular
models whereby the near-infrared emission arises from hot gas in the expanding
shock. The emission was also found to be significantly asymmetric, evidenced by
non-zero closure phases detected by IOTA. The physical interpretation of these
data depend strongly on the adopted distance to RS Oph. Our data can be
interpreted as the first direct detection of the underlying RS Oph binary,
lending support to the recent ``reborn red giant'' models of Hachisu & Kato.
However, this result hinges on an RS Oph distance of ~< 540 pc, in strong
disagreement with the widely-adopted distance of ~1.6 kpc. At the farther
distance, our observations imply instead the existence of a non-expanding,
dense and ionized circumbinary gaseous disk or reservoir responsible for the

uniquely suited to distinguish between these models and to ultimately determine

significantly preferred, but only when using the most constraining set of

lower values of the running index than with basic dataset alone and
interestingly the inclusion of Ly-alpha significantly disfavours a running
parameterisation by more than a unit in log evidence. Overall the highest
evidences, over all datasets, were obtained with a power law spectrum
containing a cutoff with a significant log evidence difference of roughly 2
units. The natural tilt and exponential cutoff present in the L-D spectrum is

suggesting that enough disk dissipation has occurred within the inner several

better explanation of the V-K data.
  For reasons of observational selection, our targets are not the most active
flare stars known, but being dMe stars indicates the presence of a
chromosphere. Scaling from Houdebine's model of the AU Mic chromosphere, we
have computed the free-free infrared excesses for a range of densities. Our
Spitzer 24 micron data shows that the chromospheres in two of our targets are
less dense than in AU Mic by a factor of 10 or more. This is consistent with
the fact that our sample includes the less active flare stars. Our models also
indicate that the chromospheric contribution to the observed AU Mic emission at

the optical/UV to the GeV energy band, on the assumption that the observed

have the pulsed double-peaked profile observed at the optical frequencies,
while the second component, C_X, is dominant in the interpeak and second peak
phase regions. The spectra of these components are modelled with log-parabolic
laws and their spectral energy distributions have peak energies at 12.2 and 178

with the same curvature but peak energies at about 300 MeV and 2 GeV. This

Galactic center had higher activities in the past than directly observed at
present. Here I show that these lines of evidence can quantitatively and
consistently be explained if the mean accretion rate during the past ~10^7 yrs
has been ~10^{3-4} times higher than the current rate, by the picture of
radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) and associated outflow that has
been successfully applied to Sgr A*. I argue that this increased rate and its
duration are theoretically reasonable in the Galactic center environment, while
the accretion rate suddenly dropped about 300 years ago most likely because of
the shell passage of the supernova remnant Sgr A East. The chance probability
of witnessing Sgr A* in such a low state is not extremely small (~0.5%). The
outflow energetics is sufficient to keep the hot (~8 keV) diffuse gas observed
in the Galactic center region. Then, I show that a significant amount of
positrons should have been created around the event horizon during the higher
activity phase, and injected into interstellar medium by the outflow. The
predicted positron production rate and propagation distance are close to those
required to explain the observed 511 keV annihilation line emission from the
Galactic bulge, giving a natural explanation for the large bulge-to-disk ratio
of the emission. The expected injection energy into interstellar medium is
about 1 MeV, which is also favorable as an explanation of the 511 keV line
emission.

obtain the distribution of monovalent ions next to a highly charged interface.
A lipid phosphate (dihexadecyl hydrogen-phosphate) was spread as a monolayer at
the air-water interface to control surface charge density. Using anomalous
reflectivity off and at the $L_3 $ Cs$^{+}$ resonance, we provide spatial
counterion (Cs$^{+}$) distributions next to the negatively charged interfaces.
Five decades in bulk concentrations are investigated, demonstrating that the
interfacial distribution is strongly dependent on bulk concentration. We show
that this is due to the strong binding constant of hydronium H$_3$O$^{+}$ to
the phosphate group, leading to proton transfer back to the phosphate group and
to a reduced surface charge. The increase of Cs$^+$ concentration modifies the
contact value potential, thereby causing proton release. This process
effectively modifies surface charge density and enables exploration of ion
distributions as a function of effective surface charge-density. The
experimentally obtained ion distributions are compared to distributions
calculated by Poisson-Boltzmann theory accounting for the variation of surface
charge density due to proton release and binding. We also discuss the accuracy

in a thermal equilibrium state and it is analyzed when such an equilibrium

AlO$_x$-barriers were recently shown to have the necessary characteristics to
be used as magnetoresistive sensors in high-density storage devices. Here we
study dielectric breakdown in such underoxidized magnetic tunnel junctions,
focusing on its dependence on tunnel junction area and oxidation time. A clear
relation between breakdown mechanism and junction area is observed for the MTJs
with the highest studied oxidation time: samples with large areas fail usually
due to extrinsic causes (characterized by a smooth resistance decrease at
dielectric breakdown). Small area junctions fail mainly through an intrinsic
mechanism (sharp resistance decrease at breakdown). However, this dependence
changes for lower oxidation times, with extrinsic breakdown becoming dominant.
In fact, in the extremely underoxidized magnetic tunnel junctions, failure is
exclusively related with extrinsic causes, independently of MTJ-area. These
results are related with the presence of defects in the barrier (weak spots
that lead to intrinsic breakdown) and of metallic unoxidized Al
nanoconstrictions (leading to extrinsic breakdown).

approximation of an unknown distribution P called a stochastic language. The
estimate of P stands in some class of probabilistic models such as
probabilistic automata (PA). In this paper, we focus on probabilistic models
based on multiplicity automata (MA). The stochastic languages generated by MA
are called rational stochastic languages; they strictly include stochastic
languages generated by PA; they also admit a very concise canonical
representation. Despite the fact that this class is not recursively enumerable,
it is efficiently identifiable in the limit by using the algorithm DEES,
introduced by the authors in a previous paper. However, the identification is
not proper and before the convergence of the algorithm, DEES can produce MA
that do not define stochastic languages. Nevertheless, it is possible to use
these MA to define stochastic languages. We show that they belong to a broader
class of rational series, that we call pseudo-stochastic rational languages.
The aim of this paper is twofold. First we provide a theoretical study of
pseudo-stochastic rational languages, the languages output by DEES, showing for
example that this class is decidable within polynomial time. Second, we have
carried out a lot of experiments in order to compare DEES to classical
inference algorithms such as ALERGIA and MDI. They show that DEES outperforms
them in most cases.

use of Weyl scalars to achieve wave extraction. It is well known that, with a
correct choice of null tetrad, Weyl scalars are directly associated to physical
properties of the space-time under analysis in some well understood way. In
particular it is possible to associate $\Psi_4$ with the outgoing gravitational
radiation degrees of freedom, thus making it a promising tool for numerical
wave--extraction. The right choice of the tetrad is, however, the problem to be
addressed. We have made progress towards identifying a general procedure for
choosing this tetrad, by looking at transverse tetrads where $\Psi_1=\Psi_3=0$.
  As a direct application of these concepts, we present a numerical study of
the evolution of a non-linearly disturbed black hole described by the
Bondi--Sachs metric. This particular scenario allows us to compare the results
coming from Weyl scalars with the results coming from the news function which,
in this particular case, is directly associated with the radiative degrees of
freedom. We show that, if we did not take particular care in choosing the right

diffeomorphism invariant disguise. It describes field evolution on arbitrary
foliations of the flat spacetime instead of only the usual flat ones, by
treating the `embedding variables' which describe the foliation as dynamical
variables to be varied in the action in addition to the scalar field. A formal
Dirac quantization turns the constraints of PFT into functional Schrodinger
equations which describe evolution of quantum states from an arbitrary Cauchy
slice to an infinitesimally nearby one.This formal Schrodinger picture- based
quantization is unitarily equivalent to the standard Heisenberg picture based
Fock quantization of the free scalar field if scalar field evolution along
arbitrary foliations is unitarily implemented on the Fock space. Torre and
Varadarajan (TV) showed that for generic foliations emanating from a flat
initial slice in spacetimes of dimension greater than 2, evolution is not
unitarily implemented, thus implying an obstruction to Dirac quantization.
  We construct a Dirac quantization of PFT,unitarily equivalent to the standard
Fock quantization, using techniques from Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) which are
powerful enough to super-cede the no- go implications of the TV results. The
key features of our quantization include an LQG type representation for the
embedding variables, embedding dependent Fock spaces for the scalar field, an
anomaly free representation of (a generalization of) the finite transformations
generated by the constraints and group averaging techniques. The difference
between 2 and higher dimensions is that in the latter, only finite gauge
transformations are defined in the quantum theory, not the infinitesimal ones.

perturbations of an empty self-accelerated background can be quantized
consistently without yielding ghosts. (2) Conformal sources, such as radiation,
do not give rise to instabilities either. (3) A typical non-conformal source
could introduce ghosts in the linearized approximation and become unstable,
however, it also invalidates the approximation itself. Such a source creates a
halo of variable curvature that locally dominates over the self-accelerated
background and extends over a domain in which the linearization breaks down.
Perturbations that are valid outside the halo may not continue inside, as it is
suggested by some non-perturbative solutions. (4) In the Euclidean continuation
of the theory, with arbitrary sources, we derive certain constraints imposed by
the second order equations on first order perturbations, thus restricting the
linearized solutions that could be continued into the full nonlinear theory.
Naive linearized solutions fail to satisfy the above constraints. (5) Finally,

The corresponding gauge-field operator in the functional integral for the

an operator, we consider advanced and retarded Green functions giving rise to a
Peierls bracket among group-invariant functionals. Our Peierls bracket is a

""change of representation"" which involves no loss of information provided the
dynamical system under consideration has a suitably high degree of instability
of motion. From a mathematical point of view, MPC theory is a theory of
positivity preserving quasi-affine transformations that intertwine the unitary
groups associated with deterministic dynamics to contraction semigroups
associated with stochastic Markov processes. In this work, dropping the
positivity condition, a characterization of the contraction semigroups induced
by quasi-affine transformations, the structure of the unitary groups admitting
such intertwining relations and a prototype for the quasi-affinities are given
on the basis of the Sz.-Nagy-Foia\c{s} dilation theory. The results are applied
to MPC theory in the context of statistical mechanics.

to obtain the Jacobi equation and we show that there is a particular
integration by parts which is invariant. We introduce two new Lagrangians,
${\cal L}_1$ and ${\cal L}_2$, associated to the first and second--order
deformations of the original Lagrangian ${\cal L}_0$ respectively; they are in
fact the first elements of a whole hierarchy of Lagrangians derived from ${\cal
L}_0$. In terms of these Lagrangians we are able to establish simple relations
between the variational derivatives of different orders of a given Lagrangian.
We then show that the Jacobi equations of ${\cal L}_0$ may be obtained as
variational equations, so that the Euler--Lagrange and the Jacobi equations are
obtained from a single variational principle based on the first--order
variation ${\cal L}_1$ of the Lagrangian. We can furthermore introduce an
associated energy--momentum tensor ${{\cal H}^\mu}_\nu$ which turns out to be a
conserved quantity if ${\cal L}_0$ is independent of space--time variables.

A variety of applications of these algebras have been presented elsewhere,

arbitrary analytic nonlinear systems of PDEs. The respective global generalized
solutions are analytic on the whole of the domain of the equations considered,

convenience can be chosen to have zero Lebesgue measure. In view of the severe
limitations due to the polynomial type growth conditions in the definition of

considerably limited. Consequently, in such algebras one cannot even formulate,

formal power series, which are called rational series, are the behaviour of a

encoding, it may be interesting to point out one of them with the smallest

diffraction regime, in which the particle's de Broglie wave length, while being
small compared to the size of the scatterers, is large enough to prevent the
formation of geometric shadow over distances of the order of the particle's
free flight path. The hard-disk or hard-sphere scattering system must be
sufficiently dilute in order for this high-energy diffraction regime to be
achievable. Apart from the overall exponential decay, the autocorrelation
function exhibits a generally complicated sequence of relatively strong peaks
corresponding to partial revivals of the wave packet. Both the exponential
decay (or escape) rate and the revival peak structure are predominantly
determined by the underlying classical dynamics. A relation between the escape
rate, and the Lyapunov exponents and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of the
counterpart classical system, previously known for hard-disk billiards, is
strengthened by generalization to three spatial dimensions. The results of the

cooperative networks. Second, within the FSA-modified IPD frame-work, a rich
ecology of agents and network topologies is observed and described. Third, the

Randriamampianina, the fluid used is air rather than a liquid as used in all
other previous work. This study investigated a bifurcation sequence from the
axisymmetric flow to a number of complex flows. The transition sequence, on
increase of the rotation rate, from the axisymmetric solution via a steady,
fully-developed baroclinic wave to chaotic flow followed a variant of the
classical quasi-periodic bifurcation route, starting with a subcritical Hopf
and associated saddle-node bifurcation. This was followed by a sequence of two
supercritical Hopf-type bifurcations, first to an amplitude vacillation, then
to a three-frequency quasi-periodic modulated amplitude vacillation (MAV), and
finally to a chaotic MAV\@. In the context of the baroclinic annulus this
sequence is unusual as the vacillation is usually found on decrease of the
rotation rate from the steady wave flow. Further transitions of a steady wave
with a higher wave number pointed to the possibility that a barotropic
instability of the side wall boundary layers and the subsequent breakdown of
these barotropic vortices may play a role in the transition to structural
vacillation and, ultimately, geostrophic turbulence.

Scaling behavior is also observed for these microscopic time intervals. We find
that the time evolution of the distributions is according to a super diffusive
q-Gaussian stationary process within a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation. This
regime breaks down due to the exponential fall-off of the tails, which in turn,
governs the transient dynamics to the long-term macroscopic Gaussian regime.

excitatory-inhibitory network with a heterogeneous structure. The entry into
the reactivation phase is mediated through a physiologically feasible
regulation of global excitability and external input sources, while the
reactivated component of the network is formed through induced network
heterogeneities during learning. We show that structural changes needed for
robust reactivation of a given network region are well within known

Morse potential remains exactly solvable in a position-dependent mass
background. Furthermore, we show how in such a context, the map from the full
line $(- \infty, \infty)$ to the half line $(0, \infty)$ may convert an exactly
solvable Morse potential into an exactly solvable Coulomb one. This generalizes
a well-known property of constant-mass problems.

via a sequence of simpler steps - quantum gates. However, actual implementation
of a quantum gate is always imperfect and takes a finite time. Therefore,
seeking for a short sequence of gates - efficient quantum circuit for a given
operation, is an important task. We contribute to this issue by proposing
optimization of the well-known universal procedure proposed by Barenco et.al
[1]. We also created a computer program which realizes both Barenco's
decomposition and the proposed optimization. Furthermore, our optimization can
be applied to any quantum circuit containing generalized Toffoli gates,
including basic quantum gate circuits.

extensions to quantum field theory and relativity. In the last section, I
speculate about an extension of Bohmian mechanics to quantum gravity.
