by comparing the masses of 15 elliptical lensing galaxies from the Sloan Lens
ACS Survey as determined in two independent ways. The first method assumes only
that Newtonian gravity is correct and is independent of gamma, while the second
uses gravitational lensing which depends on gamma. More specifically, we
combine Einstein radii and radial surface-brightness gradient measurements of
the lens galaxies with empirical distributions for the mass concentration and
velocity anisotropy of elliptical galaxies in the local universe to predict
gamma-dependent probability distributions for the lens-galaxy velocity
dispersions. By comparing with observed velocity dispersions, we derive a
maximum-likelihood value of gamma = 0.98 +/- 0.07 (68% confidence). This result
is in excellent agreement with the prediction of general relativity that has
previously been verified to this accuracy only on solar-system length scales.

required in a relativistic description of forces mediated by massless spin-1
and spin-2 particles. In this context we also review the Weinberg-Witten
theorem and its implications.
  This leads us to consider a class of models in which long-range interactions
are mediated by Goldstone bosons of spontaneous Lorentz violation. Since the
Lorentz symmetry is realized non-linearly in the Goldstones, these models could
evade the Weinberg-Witten theorem and the need for gauge invariance. In the
case of gravity, the broken symmetry would protect the theory from having
non-zero cosmological constant, while the compositeness of the graviton could
provide a solution to the perturbative non-renormalizability of gravity.
  We also consider the phenomenology of spontaneous Lorentz violation by a
vector VEV and the experimental limits thereon. We find the general low-energy
effective action of the Goldstones of this kind of symmetry breaking minimally
coupled to gravity. We compare this to the ghost condensate that has been
proposed as a model for gravity in a Higgs phase.
  We then summarize the cosmological constant problems and show that models in
which a scalar field causes super-acceleration of the universe generally
exhibit instabilities. We discuss how the equation of state evolves in a
universe where the dark energy is caused by the ghost condensate. We comment on
the anthropic argument for a small cosmological constant and how it is weakened
if the inflaton self-coupling varies over the landscape of possible universes.
  Finally, we discuss the reverse sprinkler, a problem in elementary fluid
mechanics that had eluded a definitive treatment for decades.

"math/0607766","Derbez Pierre","Pierre Derbez","Topological rigidity and Gromov simplicial volume","40 pages, 6 figures",,,,"math.GT",,"  A natural problem in the theory of 3-manifolds is the question of whether two
3-manifolds are homeomorphic or not. The aim of this paper is to study this
problem for the class of closed Haken manifolds using degree one maps.
  To this purpose we introduce an invariant $ \tau(N)=({\rm Vol}(N),\|N\|)$
where $\|N\|$ denotes the Gromov simplicial volume of $N$ and ${\rm Vol}(N)$ is
a 2-dimensional simplicial volume which measures the volume of the base
2-orbifolds of the Seifert pieces of $N$.
  After studying the behavior of $\tau(N)$ under nonzero degree maps action, we
prove that if $M$ and $N$ are closed Haken manifolds such that $\|M\|=\abs{{\rm
deg}(f)}\|N\|$ and ${\rm Vol}(M)={\rm Vol}(N)$ then any non-zero degree map
$f\co M\to N$ is homotopic to a covering map. This extends a result of S. Wang
in \cite{W1} for maps of nonzero degree from $M$ to itself. As a corollary we
prove that if $M$ and $N$ are closed Haken manifolds such that $\tau(N)$ is
sufficiently close to $\tau(M)$ then any degree one map $f\co M\to N$ is
homotopic to a homeomorphism.

Suspension semiflows model the dynamics of flows admitting cross-sections,
where the dynamics of the base is given by the Poincar\'e return map and the
roof function is the return time to the cross-section. The results are

introduction of dispersion creates a coupling between the transverse and
longitudinal planes. If this coupling is handled properly, one can achieve
cooling in all three phase space planes. This is usually done by placing a
wedge-shaped absorber in a region where there is dispersion. I will demonstrate
using an eigenvalue analysis that there are other configurations of dispersion
and absorber shape that will achieve ionization cooling in all phase space
planes. In particular, I will show that a one can even achieve cooling in all
phase planes with a parallel-faced absorber in a dispersion-free region. I will
use perturbation theory to approximate the change in the cooling rates due to
longitudinal-transverse coupling. I will then describe how the cooling of
longitudinal oscillations can be understood via the projection of the
""longitudinal"" eigenmodes into the transverse plane.

incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is rigorously estimated with a focus on
its dependence on the nature of the driving force. For square integrable body
forces the high Reynolds number (low viscosity) upper bound on the dissipation
is independent of the viscosity, consistent with the existence of a
conventional turbulent energy cascade. On the other hand when the body force is
not square integrable, i.e., when the Fourier spectrum of the force decays
sufficiently slowly at high wavenumbers, there is significant direct driving at
a broad range of spatial scales. Then the upper limit for the dissipation rate
may diverge at high Reynolds numbers, consistent with recent experimental and
computational studies of ""fractal-forced'' turbulence.

low-index, polymer core layer, bounded by two multilayer stacks. This geometry
allows exceptionally strong confinement of the light at the fundamental
wavelength inside the core region with virtually zero net propagation losses
for distances that exceed several centimeters, provided material and scattering
losses are neglected. A phase-matched configuration of the waveguide is
reported in which the pump signal is the lowest-order mode of the waveguide,
and the generated second harmonic signal corresponds to the third propagation
mode of the waveguide. Using a polymer waveguide core, having chi(2)=100 pm/V,
we predict a conversion efficiency of approximately 90% after a propagation
distance of 2 mm, using peak pump intensities inside the core of the waveguide
of 1.35 GW/cm^2. If the waveguide core contains polymer layers with different
glass transition temperatures, the layers can be poled independently to
maximize the overlap integral, and similar pump depletions may be achieved over
a distance of approximately 500 microns.

surfaces as a generic prototype model of protein-protein interactions. The
theory predicts that pairs of randomly superimposed identical (homodimeric)
random patterns have always twice as large magnitude of the energy fluctuations
with respect to their mutual orientation, as compared with pairs of different
(heterodimeric) random patterns. The amplitude of the energy fluctuations is
proportional to the square of the average pattern density, to the square of the
amplitude of the potential and its characteristic length, and scales linearly
with the area of surfaces. The greater dispersion of interaction energies in
the ensemble of homodimers implies that strongly attractive complexes of random
surfaces are much more likely to be homodimers, rather than heterodimers. Our
findings suggest a plausible physical reason for the anomalously high fraction
of homodimers observed in real protein interaction networks.

a quantum extension of the Chernoff bound, which gives the best asymptotically
achievable error exponent in classical discrimination between two probability
measures on a finite set. In our framework, the classical result is reproduced
if the two hypothetic density operators commute. Recently, it has been shown
elsewhere [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98 (2007) 160504] that the lower bound is
