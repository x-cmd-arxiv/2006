years $33\times10^6$ stars in the Magellanic clouds for microlensing events
caused by such objects. In this work, we use only a subsample of $7\times10^6$
bright stars spread over $84 \deg^2$ of the LMC and $9 \deg^2$ of the SMC. The
strategy of using only bright stars helps to discriminate against background
events due to variable stars and allows a simple determination of the effects
of source confusion (blending). The use of a large solid angle makes the survey
relatively insensitive to effects that could make the optical depth strongly
direction dependent. Using this sample of bright stars, only one candidate
event was found, whereas $\sim39$ events would have been expected if the Halo
were entirely populated by objects of mass $M\sim0.4M_{\odot}$. Combined with
the results of EROS-1, this implies that the optical depth toward the Large
Magellanic Cloud (\object{LMC}) due to such lenses is $\tau<0.36\times10^{-7}$
(95%CL), corresponding to a fraction of the halo mass of less than 8%. This
optical depth is considerably less than that measured by the MACHO
collaboration in the central region of the LMC. More generally, machos in the
mass range $0.6\times10^{-7}M_\odot<M<15M_{\odot}$ are ruled out as the primary
occupants of the Milky Way Halo.

and precise distances that are essentially assumption free. To do so,
high-quality photometric and spectroscopic data are needed. As a first step in
the project, broad band photometry (in Johnson B and V) has been obtained in a
region (34'x34') at the North-Eastern quadrant of the galaxy over 5 years. The

means of the so-called difference image analysis technique and the DAOPHOT

so far in the studied region and contains 3964 identified variable stars, with

are weak. We study the case when both cascades are, in a sense, strong. The
inertial-range of this imbalanced cascade has the following properties: (i) the
ratio of the r.m.s. Elsasser amplitudes is independent of scale, and is equal
to the ratio of the corresponding energy fluxes; (ii) in common with the
balanced strong cascade, the energy spectra of both Elsasser waves are of the
anisotropic Kolmogorov form, with their parallel correlation lengths equal to
each other on all scales, and proportional to the two-thirds power of the
transverse correlation length; (iii) the equality of cascade time and
waveperiod (critical balance) that characterizes the strong balanced cascade
does not apply to the Elsasser field with the larger amplitude. Instead, the
more general criterion that always applies to both Elsasser fields is that the
cascade time is equal to the correlation time of the straining imposed by
oppositely-directed waves. Our results are particularly relevant for turbulence
in the solar wind. Spacecraft measurements have established that, in the

true for the low latitude, probably galactic, ones only 10 % of which has been

are Isolated Neutron Stars (INS), both radio-loud and radio-quiet

optical coverage of low-latitude unidentified gamma-ray sources aiming at high

counterparts. Since low latitude sources are heavily affected by the
interstellar absorption at both X-ray and optical wavelengths, we have focussed
on two middle-latitude, probably galactic, GRO/EGRET sources: 3EG J0616-3310

hydrodynamic modeling of the interaction of a SNR shock wave with an
interstellar gas cloud. The scope includes: 1) to study the correspondence
between modeled and X-ray emitting structures, 2) to explore two different
physical regimes in which either thermal conduction or radiative cooling plays
a dominant role, and 3) to investigate the effects of the physical processes at
work on the emission of the shocked cloud in the two different regimes.
  METHODS. We use a detailed hydrodynamic model, including thermal conduction
and radiation, and explore two cases characterized by different Mach numbers of
the primary shock: M = 30 in which the cloud dynamics is dominated by radiative
cooling and M = 50 dominated by thermal conduction. From the simulations, we
synthesize the expected X-ray emission, using available spectral codes.
  RESULTS. The morphology of the X-ray emitting structures is significantly
different from that of the flow structures originating from the shock-cloud
interaction. The hydrodynamic instabilities are never clearly visible in the
X-ray band. Shocked clouds are preferentially visible during the early phases
of their evolution. Thermal conduction and radiative cooling lead to two
different phases of the shocked cloud: a cold cooling dominated core emitting
at low energies and a hot thermally conducting corona emitting in the X-ray
band. The thermal conduction makes the X-ray image of the cloud smaller, more
diffuse, and shorter-lived than that observed when thermal conduction is
neglected.

a linear matched filter which maximises the signal-to-noise ratio by minimising
the number of spurious detections caused by the superposition of large-scale
structures (LSS). This is achieved by suppressing those spatial frequencies
dominated by the LSS contamination. We confirm the improved stability and
reliability of the detections achieved with our new filter compared to the
commonly-used aperture mass (Schneider, 1996; Schneider et al., 1998) and to
the aperture mass based on the shear profile expected for NFW haloes (see e.g.
Schirmer et al., 2004; Hennawi & Spergel, 2005). Schirmer et al.~(2006)
achieved results comparable to our filter, but probably only because of the low
average redshift of the background sources in GaBoDS, which keeps the LSS
contamination low. For deeper data, the difference will be more important, as
shown by Maturi et al. (2005). We detect fourteen halos on about eighteen
square degrees selected from the survey. Five are known clusters, two are
associated with over-densities of galaxies visible in the GaBoDS image, and

(TeV measurements) during the same period in an attempt to search for
correlations between TeV variability and the evolution of the radio morphology
on parsec scales. While the VLBI maps show no temporal changes in the Mkn 421
VLBI jet, there is strong evidence of complex variability in both the total and
polarized fluxes of the VLBI core of Mkn 421 and in its spectrum over the
two-month span of our data. The high-energy measurements indicate that the
overall TeV activity of the source was rising during this period, with a
gamma-ray flare detected just three days prior to our second VLBI observing
run. Although no firm correlation can be established, our data suggest that the
two phenomena (TeV activity and VLBI core variability) are connected, with the
VLBI core at 22 GHz being the self-absorbed radio counterpart of synchrotron
self-Compton (SSC) emission at high energies. Based on the size of the VLBI
core, we could derive an upper limit of 0.1 pc (3 x 10**17 cm) for the

the interactions between spins within the cluster of all possible
configurations in exact manner and the rest of the interaction by an effective
variational field . The magnetization M and transition temperature Tc are then
calculated for different concentration and exchange parameters (JAA, JBB and
JAB). The magnetization M exhibits different kinds of ferrimagnetic behaviour
depending on concentration and relative strength of intra- and inter-
sub-network exchange interactions. For antiferromagnetic JAB, the sub-network
magnetization saturates and aligned antiferromagnetically at low temperature.
The existence of compensation temperature Tcm, where total magnetization
reverses its direction, depends sensitively on relative values of JAA/ JAB and
JBB/ JAB and p. For B (A)-rich alloy with small JAB, the direction of net
magnetization remains same upto Tc and a maximum of M appears at intermediate T

maximum with p. The transition temperature is much less than the mean-field

scalar power spectrum of the cosmological fluctuations on cosmic scales is
scale-invariant for closed strings and inclines towards red for open strings in
three compact spatial dimensions. This generation of thermal fluctuations
happens during the Hagedorn era of string gas cosmology and without invoking an
inflationary epoch the perturbations enter the radiation-dominated era. The
amplitude of the fluctuations is proportional to the ratio of the two length
scales in the theory, i.e., the Planck length over the string length. Since
modes with the shorter wavelengths exit the Hubble radius at the end of the
Hagedorn phase at later times compare to the modes with long wavelengths, the

Fano orbifolds. We present several families of hypersurface singularities that
are obstructed, including 3-fold and 4-fold singularities of ADE type that have
been studied previously in the physics literature. We show that the AdS/CFT
dual of one obstruction is that the R-charge of a gauge invariant chiral

is a relation between the spectral characteristics of a random operator in the

infinite operator goes along with Poisson level statistics, it is expected that
purely absolutely continuous spectrum would be associated with gap
distributions resembling the corresponding random matrix ensemble. We prove
that on regular rooted trees, which exhibit both spectral types, the eigenstate
point process has always Poissonian limit. However, we also find that this does
not contradict the picture described above if that is carefully interpreted, as
the relevant limit of finite trees is not the infinite homogenous tree graph
but rather a single-ended ``canopy graph''. For this tree graph, the random
Schroedinger operator is proven here to have only pure-point spectrum at any
strength of the disorder. For more general single-ended trees it is shown that
the spectrum is always singular -- pure point possibly with singular continuous
component which is proven to occur in some cases.

high-density structures that are thin in one direction and extended in the
others. We give a detailed study of an energy functional that arises in a
simplified model for lipid bilayer membranes. We demonstrate that this
functional, defined on a class of two-dimensional spatial mass densities,
exhibits partial localization and displays the `solid-like' behavior of cell
membranes.
  Specifically, we show that density fields of moderate energy are partially
localized, i.e. resemble thin structures. Deviation from a specific uniform
thickness, creation of `ends', and the bending of such structures all carry an
energy penalty, of different orders in terms of the thickness of the structure.
  These findings are made precise in a Gamma-convergence result. We prove that
a rescaled version of the energy functional converges in the zero-thickness
limit to a functional that is defined on a class of planar curves. Finiteness
of the limit enforces both optimal thickness and non-fracture; if these
conditions are met, then the limit value is given by the classical Elastica
(bending) energy of the curve.

noncommutative residue for the hypoelliptic calculus on Heisenberg manifolds,
that is, for the class of Heisenberg PsiDOs introduced by Beals-Greiner and
Taylor. This noncommutative residue appears as the residual trace on integer
order Heisenberg PsiDOs induced by the analytic extension of the usual trace to
non-integer order Heisenberg PsiDOs. Moreover, it agrees with the integral of
the density defined by the logarithmic singularity of the Schwartz kernel of
the corresponding Heisenberg PsiDO. In addition, we show that this
noncommutative residue provides us with the unique trace up to constant
multiple on the algebra of integer order Heisenberg PsiDOs. In the second part,
we give some analytic applications of this construction concerning zeta
functions of hypoelliptic operators, logarithmic metric estimates for Green
kernels of hypoelliptic operators, and the extension of the Dixmier trace to
the whole algebra of integer order Heisenberg PsiDOs. In the third part, we
present examples of computations of noncommutative residues of some powers of
the horizontal sublaplacian and the contact Laplacian on contact manifolds. In
the fourth part, we present two applications in CR geometry. First, we give
some examples of geometric computations of noncommutative residues of some
powers of the horizontal sublaplacian and of the Kohn Laplacian. Second, we
make use of the framework of noncommutative geometry and of our noncommutative
residue to define lower dimensional volumes in pseudohermitian geometry, e.g.,
we can give sense to the area of any 3-dimensional CR manifold. On the way we
obtain a spectral interpretation of the Einstein-Hilbert action in
pseudohermitian geometry.

compensation will enable individuals with spinal cord injuries to be aware of a
localized excess of pressure at the skin/seat interface and, consequently, will
enable them to prevent the formation of pressure ulcers by relieving the

approach and the feasibility of creating an adapted behavior, with a change in

due to Szabo, we arrive at new parametric families of complex Hadamard matrices

contexts in particular concerning Quantum Field Theory and Quantum Optics.
Beginning with the seminal work of Katriel [Lett. Nuovo Cimento,
10(13):565--567, 1974], in the last few years, normally ordered forms have been
shown to have a rich combinatorial structure, mainly in virtue of a link with
the theory of partitions. In this paper, we attempt to enrich this link. By
considering linear representations of noncrossing partitions, we define the
notion of noncrossing normal ordering. Given the growing interest in
noncrossing partitions, because of their many unexpected connections (like, for
example, with free probability), noncrossing normal ordering appears to be an
intriguing notion. We explicitly give the noncrossing normally ordered form of
the functions (a^{r}(a^{\dag})^{s})^{n}) and (a^{r}+(a^{\dag})^{s})^{n}, plus
various special cases. We are able to establish for the first time bijections
between noncrossing contractions of these functions, k-ary trees and sets of
lattice paths.

cascade by a single particle (atom, molecule, nucleus, etc). The
time-dependence of the probability amplitude of the second photon in the
cascade has a sharply rising leading edge due to the detection of the first
photon, as results from causality. If a macroscopic ensemble of resonant
two-level absorbers is placed in the path of the second photon between the
radiation source and the detector, the photon absorption does not follow Beer's
law due to the time-asymmetric shape of the photon. For very short delay times
almost no absorption takes place, even in an optically dense medium. We analyze
the propagation of such a second photon in a thick resonant three-level
absorber if a narrow electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) window is
present at the center of the absorption line. It is shown that the EIT medium
can change the asymmetric time dependence of the photon probability amplitude
to a bell shape (EIT filtering). This bell-shaped photon interacts much more
efficiently with an other ensemble of two-level absorbers chosen, for example,
to store this photon and the information it carries.
