stages of protostellar collapse, with a view to explaining the observed
longevity of N2H+ and NH3 and the high levels of deuteration of these species.
We followed the chemical evolution of a medium comprising gas and dust as it
underwent free--fall gravitational collapse. Chemical processes which determine
the relative populations of the nuclear spin states of molecules and molecular
ions were included explicitly, as were reactions which lead ultimately to the
deuteration of the nitrogen--containing species N2H+ and NH3. The freeze-out of
`heavy' molecules onto grains was taken into account. We found that the
timescale required for the nitrogen--containing species to attain their
steady--state values was much larger than the free--fall time and even
comparable with the probable lifetime of the precursor molecular cloud.
However, it transpires that the chemical evolution of the gas during
gravitational collapse is insensitive to its initial composition. If we suppose
that the grain--sticking probabilities of atomic nitrogen and oxygen are both
less than unity (S less than 0.3), we find that the observed differential
freeze--out of nitrogen- and carbon--bearing species can be reproduced by the
model of free--fall collapse when a sufficiently large grain radius (a_{g}= 0.5
micron) is adopted. Furthermore, the results of our collapse model are
consistent with the high levels of deuteration of N2H+ and NH3 which have been
observed in L1544 providing that 0.5<a_{g}<1 micron. We note that the o/p H2D+
ratio and fractional abundance of ortho-H2D+ should be largest when ND3 is most
abundant.

characterize the burst mode of protostellar accretion. The burst mode begins
upon the formation of a centrifugally balanced disk around a newly formed
protostar. It is comprised of prolonged quiescent periods of low accretion rate
(typically $\la 10^{-7} \Msun$ yr$^{-1}$) which are punctuated by intense
bursts of accretion (typically $\ga 10^{-4} \Msun$ yr$^{-1}$, with duration
$\la 100$ yr) during which most of the protostellar mass is accumulated. The
accretion bursts are associated with the formation of dense
protostellar/protoplanetary embryos, which are later driven onto the protostar
by the gravitational torques that develop in the disk. Gravitational
instability in the disk, driven by continuing infall from the envelope, is
shown to be an effective means of transporting angular momentum outward, and
mass inward to the protostar. We show that the disk mass always remains
significantly less than the central protostar mass throughout this process. The
burst phenomenon is robust enough to occur for a variety of initial values of
rotation rate, frozen-in (supercritical) magnetic field, and
density-temperature relations. Even in cases where the bursts are nearly
entirely suppressed, a moderate increase in cloud size or rotation rate can
lead to vigorous burst activity. We conclude that most (if not all) protostars
undergo a burst mode of evolution during their early accretion history, as
inferred empirically from observations of FU Orionis variables.

to measure the angular diameter distance and Hubble parameter at 2~<z~<4 using
the standard ruler provided by baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO). The goal
would be to obtain a high enough density of sources to probe the
three-dimensional density field on the scale of the BAO feature. A
percent-level measurement in this redshift range can almost double the Dark
Energy Task Force Figure of Merit, relative to the case with only a similar
precision measurement at z~1, if the Universe is not assumed to be flat. This
improvement is greater than the one obtained by doubling the size of the z~1
survey, with Planck and a weak SDSS-like z=0.3 BAO measurement assumed in each
case. Galaxy BAO surveys at z~1 may be able to make an effective LyaF
measurement simultaneously at minimal added cost, because the required number
density of quasars is relatively small. We discuss the constraining power as a
function of area, magnitude limit (density of quasars), resolution, and
signal-to-noise of the spectra. For example, a survey covering 2000 sq. deg.
and achieving S/N=1.8 per Ang. at g=23 (~40 quasars per sq. deg.) with an
R~>250 spectrograph is sufficient to measure both the radial and transverse
oscillation scales to 1.4% from the LyaF (or better, if fainter magnitudes and
possibly Lyman-break galaxies can be used). At fixed integration time and in
the sky-noise-dominated limit, a wider, noisier survey is generally more
efficient; the only fundamental upper limit on noise being the need to identify
a quasar and find a redshift. Because the LyaF is much closer to linear and
generally better understood than galaxies, systematic errors are even less
likely to be a problem.

Investigation into these selection effects has been overshadowed by instrument
complexity. We identify the field configuration algorithm (FCA) used to select
targets for observation as mainly responsible for such effects. A FCA can
imprint artificial structure on observed target distributions, which may accrue
over large angular scales, potentially to the detriment of statistical analyses
applied to such surveys. We present here a new FCA developed for 2dF that is
based on simulated annealing (SA), a generic method commonly used to solve
constrained optimisation problems. We generate synthetic fields and utilise
mock 2dF volumes to contrast the behaviour of previous strategies with the SA
FCA. The angular two-point correlation function and other sensitive techniques
reveal that the new FCA achieves unprecedented sampling uniformity and target
yield with improved target priority handling and observational flexibility over
current FCAs. The SA FCA is generic enough to be used by current 2dF-like and
potentially next-generation MOS instruments with little modification.

The combined map also shows that the outer portion of the disk-like envelope
has a fan-shaped structure which delineates the rim of the CO(1-0) outflow
observed with the NMA. The position-velocity (P-V) diagrams in the H13CO+ (1-0)

a dispersing gas motion and a possible rigid-like rotation. The mass dispersing
rate is estimated to be (3.4 - 6.0) times 10^-5 M_sun/yr, which implies that
MMS 7 has an ability to disperse ~10 M_sun during the protostellar evolutional

rotation in the disk-like envelope is nearly two orders of magnitude larger

the sources. In this scenario, our line of sight to the source would intersect
the torus in its inner region with low optical depth due to high spin and

""dark"" and ""bright"" states. The dynamics of those states depends on the
internal relaxation time between bright and dark states (spin-flip time), and
on the radiative recombination time of the bright states. On the other hand,
the calculated values of these recombination times depend not only on the
treatment of correlation effects, but also on the accuracy of the electron and
hole wavefunctions. We calculate the radiative decay rates for monoexcitons and
biexcitons in (In,As)Ga/GaAs self-assembled and colloidal CdSe quantum dots
from atomistic correlated wave functions. We show how the radiative decay time
tau_R(X^0) of the monoexciton depends on the spin-flip relaxation time between
bright and dark states. In contrast, a biexciton has no bright-dark splitting,
so the decay time of the biexciton tau_R(XX^0) is insensitive to this spin-flip
time. This results in ratios $\tau_R(X^0)/\tau_R(XX^0)$ of 4 in the case of
fast spin flip, and a ratio of 2 in the case of slow spin flip. For
(In,Ga)As/GaAs, we compare our results with the model calculation of Wimmer et
al. [M. Wimmer et al., Phys. Rev. B 73, 165305 (2006)]. When the same spin-flip
rates are assumed, our predicted tau_R(X^0)/tau_R(XX^0) agrees with that of
Wimmer et al., suggesting that our treatment of correlations is adequate to
predict the ratio of monoexciton and biexciton radiative lifetimes. Our results
agree well with experiment on self-assembled quantum dots when assuming slow
spin flip. Conversely, for colloidal dots the agreement with experiment is best
for fast spin flip.

gives rise to spatial modulations in the order parameter, like stripes in 2d

compared with the time needed to the formation of modulated structures, the
dynamics is dominated by a standard ferromagnetic contribution plus a
correction term. However, once these structures are formed, the long time
dynamics is no longer pure ferromagnetic. After a quench from a disordered
state to low temperatures the system develops growing domains of stripes
(lamellae). Due to the character of the transition, the paramagnetic phase is
metastable at all finite temperatures, and the correlation length diverges only
at T=0. Consequently, the temperature is a relevant variable, for $T>0$ the
system exhibits interrupted aging while for T=0 the system ages for all time
scales. Furthermore, for all $T$, the exponent associated with the aging

The result is a recursive upper bound on the bit error probability after each

recovers the density evolution equation of LDPC codes on the binary erasure
channel (BEC) with inequalities satisfied with equalities. A significant

objective is to optimize the two criteria of minimizing the makespan and
minimizing job reassignments in response to machine failures. We assume that
the set of jobs is known in advance but that the pattern of machine failures is
unpredictable. Motivated by the requirements of BGP routing, we consider
path-independent algorithms, with the property that the job assignment is
completely determined by the subset of available machines and not the previous
history of the assignments. We examine first the question of performance
measurement of path-independent load-balancing algorithms, giving the measure
of makespan and the normalized measure of reassignments cost. We then describe
two classes of algorithms for optimizing these measures against an oblivious
adversary for identical machines. The first, based on independent random
assignments, gives expected reassignment costs within a factor of 2 of optimal
and gives a makespan within a factor of O(log m/log log m) of optimal with high
probability, for unknown job sizes. The second, in which jobs are first grouped
into bins and at most one bin is assigned to each machine, gives
constant-factor ratios on both reassignment cost and makespan, for known job
sizes. Several open problems are discussed.

promising way to obtain sensitivity of these devices significantly better than
the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). The most challenging element of the
intracavity topologies is the \emph{local meter} which has to monitor position
of a small ($1\div10$ gram) local mirror and which precision defines the
sensitivity of the detector.
  To overcome the SQL, the quantum variational measurement can be used in the
local meter. In this method a frequency-dependent correlation between the meter
back-action noise and measurement noise is introduced, which allows to
eliminate the back-action noise component from the meter output signal. This
correlation is created by means of an additional filter cavity.
  In this article the sensitivity limitations of this scheme imposed by the
optical losses both in the local meter itself and in the filter cavity are
estimated. It is shown that the main sensitivity limitation stems from the
filter cavity losses. In order to overcome it, it is necessary to increase the
filter cavity length. In a preliminary prototype experiment about 10 meter long
filter cavity can be used to obtain sensitivity approximately $2\div3$ times
better than the SQL. For future QND gravitational-wave detectors with
sensitivity about ten times better than the SQL, the filter cavity length
should be within kilometer range.

introduce chiral superfields in the adjoint representation of $SU(3)_C$ and

well motivated by intersecting D-brane models in which additional massless
adjoint chiral supermultiplets appear generically in the low energy spectrum.
Although it has been pointed out that the existence of these additional fields
may make it difficult to obtain asymptotic freedom, we demonstrate that this
consideration does not rule out the existence of adjoints. The QCD gauge
coupling can be perturbative up to a sufficiently high scale, and therefore a
perturbative description for a D-brane model is valid. The full supersymmetric
and soft SUSY breaking Lagrangians and the resulting renormalization group
equations are given. Phenomenological aspects of the adjoint matter are also
studied, including the decay and production processes. The similarity in gauge
interaction between the adjoint fermion and gluino facilitates our study on

elastic-scattering data up to a pion laboratory kinetic energy of 100 MeV. The
hadronic interaction was assumed to be isospin invariant. We found that it was
possible to obtain self-consistent databases by removing very few measurements.
A pion-nucleon model was fitted to the elastic-scattering database obtained
after the removal of the outliers. The model-parameter values showed an
impressive stability when the database was subjected to different criteria for
the rejection of experiments. Our result for the pseudovector $\pi N N$
coupling constant (in the standard form) is $0.0733 \pm 0.0014$. The six
hadronic phase shifts up to 100 MeV are given in tabulated form. We also give
the values of the s-wave scattering lengths and the p-wave scattering volumes.
Big differences in the s-wave part of the interaction were observed when
comparing our hadronic phase shifts with those of the current GWU solution. We
demonstrate that the hadronic phase shifts obtained from the analysis of the
elastic-scattering data cannot reproduce the measurements of the $\pi^- p$
charge-exchange reaction, thus corroborating past evidence that the hadronic
interaction violates isospin invariance. Assuming the validity of the result
obtained within the framework of chiral perturbation theory, that the mass
difference between the $u$- and the $d$-quark has only a very small effect on
the isospin invariance of the purely hadronic interaction, the
isospin-invariance violation revealed by the data must arise from the fact that
we are dealing with a hadronic interaction which still contains residual
effects of electromagnetic origin.

to find simplified analytical mass spectra and wave functions of the

aspects of the D-brane world, focusing on homogeneous anisotropic cosmology
driven by the dilaton and the NS-NS 2-form field which becomes massive in the
presence of the D-brane. The dilaton possesses the potential due to the
presence of the D-brane, various form field fluxes, and the curvature of extra
dimensions. In the absence of stabilizing potential, we found the attractor
solutions for this system which show the overall features of general solutions.
In the presence of the non-vanishing NS-NS 2-form field, the homogeneous
universe expands anisotropically while the D-brane term dominates. The isotropy
is recovered as the dilaton rolls down and the curvature term dominates. With
the stabilizing potential for the dilaton, the anisotropy developed by the
initial NS-NS 2-form field flux is erased as the NS-NS 2-form field begins to
oscillate around the minimum, forming the B-matter, and the isotropic

  The special case of one variable equations in free groups has been open for a
number of years, although it is known that the solution sets admit simple
descriptions. We use cancellation arguments to give a short and direct proof of
this result and also to give a practical polynomial time algorithm for finding
solution sets. One variable equations are the only general subclass of
equations in free groups for which such results are known.
  We improve on previous attempts to use cancellation arguments by employing a
new method of reduction derived from techniques from formal language theory.
Our paper is self contained; we assume only knowedge of basic facts about free
groups.

Navier-Stokes equations, for which no rigorous proof of the existence of unique

solutions, from which we derive an {\it a posteriori} check that can be applied
to a numerical solution to guarantee the existence of a strong solution of the
corresponding exact problem.
  We then consider Galerkin approximations, and show that {\it if} a strong
solution exists the Galerkin approximations will converge to it; thus if one is
prepared to assume that the Navier-Stokes equations are regular one can justify
this particular numerical method rigorously.
  Combining these two results we show that if a strong solution of the exact
problem exists then this can be verified numerically using an algorithm that
can be guaranteed to terminate in a finite time.
  We thus introduce the possibility of rigorous computations of the solutions
of the 3d Navier-Stokes equations (despite the lack of rigorous existence and
uniqueness results), and demonstrate that numerical investigation can be used
to rule out the occurrence of possible singularities in particular examples.

his masterful Principia Mathematica, in 1686. The problem consists of
determining, in dimension three, the shape of an axis-symmetric body, with
assigned radius and height, which offers minimum resistance when it is moving
in a resistant medium. The problem has a very rich history and is well
documented in the literature. Of course, at first glance, one suspects that the
two dimensional case should be well known. Nevertheless, we have looked into
numerous references and ask at least as many experts on the problem, and we
have not been able to identify a single source. Solution was always plausible
to everyone who thought about the problem, and writing it down was always
thought not to be worthwhile. Here we show that this is not the case: the
two-dimensional problem is more rich than the classical one, being, in some
sense, more interesting. Novelties include: (i) while in the classical
three-dimensional problem only the restricted case makes sense (without
restriction on the monotonicity of admissible functions the problem doesn't
admit a local minimum), we prove that in dimension two the unrestricted problem
is also well-posed when the ratio height versus radius of base is greater than
a given quantity; (ii) while in three dimensions the (restricted) problem has a
unique solution, we show that in the restricted two-dimensional problem the
minimizer is not always unique - when the height of the body is less or equal
than its base radius, there exists infinitely many minimizing functions.

publications. In ref [1], we have derived a set of space-time transformations
referred to as the extended space-time transformations. These transformations,
which assume the existence of a preferred aether frame and the variability of
the one-way speed of light in the other frames, are compared to the
Lorentz-Poincare transformations. We demonstrate that the extended
transformations can be converted into a set of equations that have a similar
mathematical form to the Lorentz-Poincare transformations, but which differ
from them in that they connect reference frames whose co-ordinates are altered
by the systematic unavoidable measurement distortions due to length contraction
and clock retardation and by the usual synchronization procedures, a fact that
the conventional approaches of relativity do not show. As a result, we confirm
that the relativity principle is not a fundamental principle of physics [i.e,
it does not rigorously apply in the physical world when the true co-ordinates
are used]. It is contingent but seems to apply provided that the distorted
coordinates are used. The apparent invariance of the speed of light also
results from the measurement distortions. The space-time transformations
relating experimental data, therefore, conceal hidden variables which deserved
to be disclosed for a deeper understanding of physics.

a polarization insensitive lens, in which both E- and H-polarized waves exhibit
the same refocusing effect. For shallow incident angles, the QIMM slab will
provide some degree of refocusing in the same manner as an isotropic negative
index material. The refocusing effect allows us to introduce the ideas of
paraxial beam focusing and phase compensation by the QIMM slab. On the basis of
angular spectrum representation, a formalism describing paraxial beams
propagating through a QIMM slab is presented. Because of the negative phase
velocity in the QIMM slab, the inverse Gouy phase shift and the negative
Rayleigh length of paraxial Gaussian beam are proposed. We find that the phase
difference caused by the Gouy phase shift in vacuum can be compensated by that
caused by the inverse Gouy phase shift in the QIMM slab. If certain matching
conditions are satisfied, the intensity and phase distributions at object plane
can be completely reconstructed at image plane. Our simulation results show
that the superlensing effect with subwavelength image resolution could be
achieved in the form of a QIMM slab.

bull-market or bear-market phases, in which the vast majority of market
participants seem to almost exclusively choose one action (between buying or
selling) over the other. From the point of view of conventional economic
theory, such events are thought to reflect the arrival of ``external news''
that justifies the observed behavior. However, empirical observations of the
events leading up to such market phases, as well events occurring during the
lifetime of such a phase, have often failed to find significant correlation
between news from outside the market and the behavior of the agents comprising
the market. In this paper, we explore the alternative hypothesis that the
occurrence of such market polarizations are due to interactions amongst the
agents in the market, and not due to any influence external to it. In
particular, we present a model where the market (i.e., the aggregate behavior
of all the agents) is observed to become polarized even though individual
agents regularly change their actions (buy or sell) on a time-scale much
shorter than that of the market polarization phase.

injection of electron bunches longer than a plasma wavelength can generate
accelerated femtosecond bunches with relatively low energy spread. This is of
high interest because such injecting bunches can be provided, e.g., by
state-of-the-art photo cathode RF guns. Here we point out that when an e-bunch
is injected in the wakefield it is important to take into account the
ponderomotive scattering of the injecting bunch by the laser pulse in the
vacuum region located in front of the plasma. At low energies of the injected
bunch this scattering results in a significant drop of the collection
efficiency. Larger collection efficiency can by reached with lower intensity
laser pulses and relatively high injection energies. We also estimate the
minimum trapping energy for the injected electrons and the length of the
trapped bunch.

atom and a standing-wave single-mode laser field which creates a
one-dimensional optical lattice. Internal dynamics of the atom is governed by
the laser field which is treated to be classical with a large number of
photons. Center-of-mass classical atomic motion is governed by the optical
potential and the internal atomic degree of freedom. The resulting
Hamilton-Schr\""odinger equations of motion are a five-dimensional nonlinear
dynamical system with two integrals of motion. The main focus of the paper is
chaotic atomic motion that may be quantified strictly by positive values of the
maximal Lyapunov exponent. It is shown that atom, depending on the value of its
total energy, can either oscillate chaotically in a well of the optical
potential or fly ballistically with weak chaotic oscillations of its momentum
or wander in the optical lattice changing the direction of motion in a chaotic
way. In the regime of chaotic wandering atomic motion is shown to have fractal
properties. We find a useful tool to visualize complicated atomic motion --
Poincar\'e mapping of atomic trajectories in an effective three-dimensional
phase space onto planes of atomic internal variables and momentum. We find
common features with typical non-hyperbolic Hamiltonian systems -- chains of
resonant islands of different sizes embedded in a stochastic sea, stochastic
layers, bifurcations, and so on. The phenomenon of sticking of atomic
trajectories to boundaries of regular islands, that should have a great
influence to atomic transport in optical lattices, is found and demonstrated
numerically.

the statistical distribution of the actual photon numbers convolved with a
Bernoulli distribution. Photodetectors are characterized by a nonunit quantum
efficiency, i.e. not all the photons lead to a charge, and by a finite
resolution, i.e. a different number of detected photons leads to a
discriminable values of the charge only up to a maximum value. We present a
detailed comparison, based on Monte Carlo simulated experiments and real data,
among the performances of detectors with different upper limits of counting
capability. In our scheme the inversion of Bernoulli convolution is performed
by maximum-likelihood methods assisted by measurements taken at different
quantum efficiencies. We show that detectors that are only able to discriminate
between zero, one and more than one detected photons are generally enough to
provide a reliable reconstruction of the photon statistics for single-peaked
distributions, while detectors with higher resolution limits do not lead to
further improvements. In addition, we demonstrate that, for semiclassical
states, even on/off detectors are enough to provide a good reconstruction.
Finally, we show that a reliable reconstruction of multi-peaked distributions
requires either higher quantum efficiency or better capability in
discriminating high number of detected photons.
