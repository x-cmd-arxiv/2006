in galaxies at both high and low redshifts by Faraday Rotation Measurements
(FRMs), have their origin in the electromagnetic fluctuations that naturally
occurred in the dense hot plasma that existed just after the QHPT. We evolve
the predicted fields to the present time. The size of the region containing a
coherent magnetic field increased due to the fusion (polymerization) of smaller
regions. Magnetic fields (MFs) $\sim 10 \mu G$ over a comoving $\sim 1$ pc
region are predicted at redshift z $\sim 10$. These fields are orders of
magnitude greater than those predicted in previous scenarios for creating
primordial magnetic fields. Line-of-sight average magnetic fields (MFs) $\sim$
$10^{-2}$ $\mu$G, valid for FRMs, are obtained over a 1 Mpc comoving region at
the redshift z $\sim$ 10.
  In the collapse to a galaxy (comoving size $\sim$ 30 kpc) at z $\sim$ 10, the
fields are amplified to $\sim 10 \mu$G. This indicates that the MFs created
immediately after the QHPT, predicted by the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem,
could be the origin of the $\sim \mu G$ fields observed by FRMs in galaxies at
both high and low redshifts.

outer solar system following the birth of the giant planets, as implied by the
existence of the Oort cloud, coagulation requirements for Pluto, and
inefficiencies in planet formation. Upon gravitationally scattering
planetesimal debris, planets migrate. Orbital migration can lead to resonance
capture, as evidenced here in the Kuiper and asteroid belts, and abroad in
extra-solar systems. Finite sizes of planetesimals render migration stochastic
(""noisy""). At fixed disk mass, larger (fewer) planetesimals generate more
noise. Extreme noise defeats resonance capture. We employ order-of-magnitude
physics to construct an analytic theory for how a planet's orbital semi-major
axis fluctuates in response to random planetesimal scatterings. To retain a
body in resonance, the planet's semi-major axis must not random walk a distance
greater than the resonant libration width. We translate this criterion into an
analytic formula for the retention efficiency of the resonance as a function of
system parameters, including planetesimal size. We verify our results with
tailored numerical simulations. Application of our theory reveals that capture
of Resonant Kuiper belt objects by a migrating Neptune remains effective if the
bulk of the primordial disk was locked in bodies having sizes < O(100) km and
if the fraction of disk mass in objects with sizes > 1000 km was less than a
few percent. Coagulation simulations produce a size distribution of primordial
planetesimals that easily satisfies these constraints. We conclude that
stochasticity did not interfere with, nor modify in any substantive way,
Neptune's ability to capture and retain Resonant Kuiper belt objects during its
migration.

virial-to-stellar mass ratio (M_{200}/M_\ast) for isolated ~ L* galaxies

the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Utilizing the motions of satellite galaxies
around isolated galaxies, we measure line-of-sight velocity dispersions and
derive dark matter halo virial masses for these host galaxies. At both epochs
the velocity dispersion of satellites correlates with host galaxy stellar mass,
\sigma\propto M_\ast^{0.4+/-0.1}, while the relation between satellite velocity
dispersion and host galaxy B-band luminosity may grow somewhat shallower from
\sigma\propto L_B^{0.6+/-0.1} at z~1 to \sigma\propto L_B^{0.4+/-0.1} at z~0.
The evolution in M_200/M_\ast from z~1 to z~0 displays a bimodality insofar as
host galaxies with stellar mass below M_\ast ~10^{11} M_Sun/h maintain a
constant ratio (the intrinsic increase is constrained to a factor of 1.1+/-0.7)
while host galaxies above M_\ast ~10^{11} M_Sun/h experience a factor of 4+/-3
increase in their virial-to-stellar mass ratio. This result can be easily
understood if galaxies below this stellar mass scale continue to form stars
while star formation in galaxies above this scale is quenched and the dark
matter halos of galaxies both above and below this scale grow in accordance
with LCDM cosmological simulations. Host galaxies that are red in U-B color
have larger satellite dispersions and hence reside on average in more massive
halos than blue galaxies at both z~1 and z~0. The redshift and host galaxy
stellar mass dependence of M_200/M_\ast agrees qualitatively with the
Millennium Run semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. (ABRIDGED)

presence of a huge core in the planet, which challenges planet formation
theory. We first derive constraints on the amount of heavy elements and
hydrogen/helium present in the planet: We find that preferred values of the
core mass are between 50 and 80 M_E. We then investigate the possibility of
subcritical core accretion as envisioned for Uranus and Neptune and find that
the subcritical accretion scenario is unlikely in the case of HD149026b for at
least two reasons: (i) Subcritical planets are such that the ratio of their
core mass to their total mass is above ~0.7, in contradiction with constraints
for all but the most extreme interior models of HD149026b; (ii) High accretion
rates and large isolation mass required for the formation of a subcritical core
of 30 M_E are possible only at specific orbital distances in a disk with a
surface density of dust equal to at least 10 times that of the minimum mass
solar nebula. This value climbs to 30 when considering a 50 M_E core. These
facts point toward two main routes for the formation of this planet: (i) Gas
accretion that is limited by a slow viscous inflow of gas in an evaporating
disk; (ii) A significant modification of the composition of the planet after as
accretion has stopped. These two routes are not mutually exclusive.
Illustrating the second route, we show that for a wide range of impact
parameters, giant impacts lead to a loss of the gas component of the planet and
thus may lead to planets that are highly enriched in heavy elements. In the
giant impact scenario, we expect an outer giant planet to be present.
Observational studies by imaging, astrometry and long term interferometry of
this system are needed to better narrow down the ensemble of possibilities.

signficantly, so that the time-averaged flux (and accretion rate) decreased by
around 40%. By equating the time-averaged X-ray flux with the expected mass
transfer rate from gravitational radiation, we derived a lower limit on the
distance of 3.4 kpc. Combined with an upper limit from assuming that the four
radius-expansion thermonuclear bursts observed during the 2002 October outburst
reached at most the Eddington limit for a pure He atmosphere, we found that the
probable distance range for the source is 3.4-3.6 kpc. The implied inclination,
based on the optical/IR properties of the counterpart, is i<~30 degrees.
  We compared the properties of the bursts with an ignition model. The time
between bursts was long enough for hot CNO burning to significantly deplete the
accreted hydrogen, so that ignition occurred in a pure helium layer underlying
a stable hydrogen burning shell. This is the first time that this burning
regime has been securely observationally identified. The observed energetics of
the bursts give a mean hydrogen fraction at ignition of <X> approx. 0.1, and
require that the accreted hydrogen fraction X_0 and the CNO metallicity Z_CNO
are related by Z_CNO approx. 0.03(X_0/0.7)^2. We show that in this burning
regime, a measurement of the burst recurrence time and energetics allows the
local accretion rate onto the star to be determined independently of the
accreted composition, giving a new method for estimating the source distance
which is in good agreement with our other estimates.

gravity towards the magnetic equator, burying the polar magnetic field and
compressing it into a narrow equatorial belt. Steady-state, Grad-Shafranov
calculations with a self-consistent mass-flux distribution (and a
semi-quantitative treatment of Ohmic diffusion) show that, for $\Ma \gtrsim
10^{-5}\Msun$, the maximum field strength and latitudinal half-width of the
equatorial magnetic belt are $B_{\rm max} = 5.6\times 10^{15}

a}/10^{-8}\Msun {\rm yr}^{-1})^{-0.5}]$ respectively, where $\Ma$ is the total
accreted mass and $\dot{M}_{\rm a}$ is the accretion rate. It is shown that the
belt prevents north-south heat transport by conduction, convection, radiation,
and ageostrophic shear. This may explain why millisecond oscillations observed
in the tails of thermonuclear (type I) X-ray bursts in low-mass X-ray binaries
are highly sinusoidal: the thermonuclear flame is sequestered in the magnetic
hemisphere which ignites first. The model is also consistent with the
occasional occurrence of closely spaced pairs of bursts. Time-dependent,
ideal-magnetohydrodynamic simulations confirm that the equatorial belt is not
disrupted by Parker and interchange instabilities.

case of the recently discovered planet OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb (Beaulieu et al.

2.6[+1.5/-0.6]-astronomical units away from an old M-type star of the Galactic
Bulge. The planet should be entirely frozen given the low surface temperature
(35 to 47 K). However, depending on the rock-to-ice mass ratio in the planet,
the radiogenic heating could be sufficient to make the existence of liquid
water within an icy crust possible. This possibility is estimated as a function
of the planetary mass and the illumination received from the parent star, both
being strongly related by the observational constraints. The results are
presented for water-poor and water-rich planets. We find that no oceans can be
present in any cases at 9-10 Gyr, a typical age for a star of the Bulge.
However, we find that, in the past when the planet was < 5-billion-years old,
liquid water was likely present below an icy surface. Nevertheless, the planet
is now likely to be entirely frozen.

the first 21 SWAN fields around bright guide stars, carefully taking into
account the survey selection effects and using an accurate treatment of the

classes according to their Sersic index. The extracted morphological properties
and number counts of the galaxies are compared with the predictions of
different galaxy formation and evolution models, both for the whole galaxy
population and separately for late-type and early-type galaxies. This is one of
the first times such a comparison has been done in the near-IR, as AO
observations and accurate PSF modeling are needed to obtain reliable
morphological classification of faint field galaxies at these wavelengths. For
early-type galaxies we find that a pure luminosity evolution model, without
evidence for relevant number and size evolution, better reproduces the observed
properties of our Ks-selected sample than current semi-analytic models based on
the hierarchical picture of galaxy formation. In particular, we find that the
observed flattening of elliptical galaxy counts at Ks~20 is quantitatively in
good agreement with the prediction of the pure luminosity evolution model that
was calculated prior to the observation. For late-type galaxies, while both
models are able to reproduce the number counts, we find some hints of a
possible size growth. These results demonstrate the unique power of AO

hard-spectrum gamma-ray burst (SHB) by Swift last year, a growing body of
evidence has suggested that SHBs are associated with an older and
lower-redshift galactic population than long-soft GRBs and, in a few cases,
with large (>~ 10 kpc) projected offsets from the centers of their putative
host galaxies. Here we present observations of the field of GRB 060502B, a SHB
detected by Swift and localized by the X-ray Telescope (XRT). We find a massive
red galaxy at a redshift of z=0.287 at an angular distance of 17.1 arcsec from
our revised XRT position. Using associative and probabilistic arguments we
suggest that this galaxy hosted the progenitor of GRB 060502B. If true, this
offset would correspond to a physical displacement of 73 +- 19 kpc in
projection, about twice the largest offset inferred for any SHB to date and
almost an order of magnitude larger than a typical long-soft burst offset.
Spectra and modeling of the star-formation history of this possible host show
it to have undergone a large ancient starburst. If the progenitor of GRB
060502B was formed in this starburst episode, the time of the GRB explosion
since birth is tau = 1.3 +- 0.2 Gyr and the minimum kick velocity of the SHB

parameterize the neutrino fluxes emitted from the central protoneutron star and
approximate the neutrino transfer by a light-bulb scheme. We find that the
waveforms due to the anisotropic neutrino emissions show the monotonic increase
with time, whose amplitudes are up to two order-of-magnitudes larger than the
ones from the convective matter motions outside the protoneutron stars.
  We point out that the amplitudes begin to become larger when the growth of
the SASI enters the nonlinear phase, in which the deformation of the shocks and
the neutrino anisotropy become large. From the spectrum analysis of the
waveforms, we find that the amplitudes from the neutrinos are dominant over the
ones from the matter motions at the frequency below $\sim 100$ Hz, which are
suggested to be within the detection limits of the detectors in the next
generation such as LCGT and the advanced LIGO for a supernova at 10 kpc.
  As a contribution to the gravitational wave background, we show that the
amplitudes from this source could be larger at the frequency above $\sim$ 1 Hz
than the primordial gravitational wave backgrounds, but unfortunately,
invisible to the proposed space-based detectors.

this paper, we characterize the X-ray properties of 39 double-peaked Balmer
line AGN, 29 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 10 low optical-luminosity
double-peaked emitters from earlier radio-selected samples. We find that the
UV-to-X-ray slope of radio-quiet (RQ) double-peaked emitters as a class does
not differ substantially from that of normal RQ AGN with similar UV
monochromatic luminosity. The radio-loud (RL) double-peaked emitters, with the
exception of LINER galaxies, are more luminous in the X-rays than RQ AGN, as
has been observed for other RL AGN with single-peaked profiles. The X-ray
spectral shapes of double-peaked emitters, measured by their hardness ratios or
power-law photon indices, are also largely consistent with those of normal AGN
of similar radio-loudness. In practically all cases studied here, external
illumination of the accretion disk is necessary to produce the Balmer-line
emission, as the gravitational energy released locally in the disk by viscous
stresses is insufficient to produce lines of the observed strength. In the

the positive cone of a real symplectic Lie algebra. The presence of disorder in
the physical system determines a probability measure with support on this cone.
The present paper analyzes a discrete family of such measures of exponential
type, and does so in an attempt to capture, by a simple random matrix model,
some generic statistical features of the characteristic frequencies of
disordered bosonic quasi-particle systems. The level correlation functions of
the said measures are shown to be those of a determinantal process, and the
kernel of the process is expressed as a sum of bi-orthogonal polynomials. While
the correlations in the bulk scaling limit are in accord with sine-kernel or
GUE universality, at the low-frequency end of the spectrum an unusual type of
scaling behavior is found.

and complex dynamics for which a general theoretical framework based on finite
populations is still lacking. Recently, an explicit mean-field description in
the form of a Fokker-Planck equation was derived for frequency-dependent
selection with two strategies in finite populations based on microscopic
processes [A.Traulsen, J.C. Claussen, and C.Hauert, Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 238701
(2005)]. Here we generalize this approach in a twofold way: First, we extend
the framework to an arbitrary number of strategies and second, we allow for
mutations in the evolutionary process. The deterministic limit of infinite
population size of the frequency dependent Moran process yields the adjusted
replicator-mutator equation, which describes the combined effect of selection
and mutation. For finite populations, we provide an extension taking random
drift into account. In the limit of neutral selection, i.e. whenever the
process is determined by random drift and mutations, the stationary strategy
distribution is derived. This distribution forms the background for the
coevolutionary process. In particular, a critical mutation rate $u_c$ is
obtained separating two scenarios: above $u_c$ the population predominantly
consists of a mixture of strategies whereas below $u_c$ the population tends to
be in homogenous states. For one of the fundamental problems in evolutionary
biology, the evolution of cooperation under Darwinian selection, we demonstrate
that the analytical framework provides excellent approximations to individual
based simulations even for rather small population sizes. This approach
complements simulation results and provides a deeper, systematic understanding
of coevolutionary dynamics.

measurements of the mass of the \emph{top quark}, the most massive observed
fundamental particle. Top quarks can be produced and studied only in collisions
at high energy particle accelerators. Most collisions, however, do not produce
top quarks; making precise measurements requires culling these collisions into
a sample that is rich in collisions producing top quarks (\emph{signal}) and
spare in collisions producing other particles (\emph{background}). Collision
selection is typically performed with heuristics or supervised learning
methods. However, such approaches are suboptimal because they assume that the
selector with the highest classification accuracy will yield a mass measurement
with the smallest statistical uncertainty. In practice, however, the mass
measurement is more sensitive to some backgrounds than others. Hence, this
paper presents a new approach that uses stochastic optimization techniques to
directly search for selectors that minimize statistical uncertainty in the top
quark mass measurement. Empirical results confirm that stochastically optimized
selectors have much smaller uncertainty. This new approach contributes
substantially to our knowledge of the top quark's mass, as the new selectors
are currently in use selecting real collisions.

the amount of supercooling and the duration of the phase transition that are

typically have a different Higgs potential from the Standard Model. They could
lead to a gravitational wave signature in the milli-Hertz frequency, which is
precisely the peak sensitivity of LISA. We also show that the signal coming

However, a critical issue for such models is to find a way of introducing the
required flavor dependence needed for generating neutrino oscillations. In this
paper, we point out that a natural ``minimal'' framework that accomplishes this
can be constructed by combining the bulk-neutrino hypothesis for right-handed
neutrinos with the split-fermion scenario for left-handed neutrinos. This
combination leads to a unique flavor signature for neutrino phenomenology which
easily incorporates large flavor mixing angles. This hybrid scenario also has a
number of additional important features. For example, one previous difficulty
of the split-fermion scenario applied to neutrinos has been that the mass
matrix is exponentially sensitive to neutrino displacements within the brane.
However, in our hybrid scenario, the interactions between the brane and bulk
naturally convert this dependence from exponential to linear. Another important
feature is that our hybrid scenario provides its own natural regulator for
Kaluza-Klein sums. Thus, in our scenario, all Kaluza-Klein summations are
manifestly finite, even in cases with multiple extra dimensions. But most
importantly, our mechanism completely decouples the effective neutrino flavor
mixing angles from the sizes of the overlaps between the neutrino wavefunctions
within the brane. Thus, we are able to obtain large neutrino mixing angles even
when these neutrinos have significant spatial separations and their overlaps
vanish.

QCD (NRQCD) factorization formalism, fixed-order perturbative calculations of
color-octet mechanisms suffer from large perturbative and nonperturbative
corrections that grow rapidly in the endpoint region, z -> 1. In this paper,
NRQCD and soft collinear effective theory are combined to resum these large
corrections to the color-octet photoproduction cross section. We derive a
factorization theorem for the endpoint differential cross section involving the
parton distribution function and the color-octet J/psi shape functions. A one
loop matching calculation explicitly confirms our factorization theorem at
next-to-leading order. Large perturbative corrections are resummed using the
renormalization group. The calculation of the color-octet contribution to
dsigma/dz is in qualitative agreement with data. Quantitative tests of the
universality of color-octet matrix elements require improved knowledge of shape
functions entering these calculations as well as resummation of the
color-singlet contribution which accounts for much of the total cross section

generators of the corresponding universal enveloping algebra. If
representations are considered, twists also serve as starproducts that
accordingly quantize representation spaces. In physics, requirements turn out
to be the other way around. Physics comes up with noncommutative spaces in
terms of starproducts that miss a suiting quantum symmetry. In general the
classical limit is known, i.e. there exists a representation of the Lie-algebra
on a corresponding finitely generated commutative space. In this setup
quantization can be considered independently from any representation theoretic
issue. We construct an algebra of vector fields from a left cross-product
algebra of the representation space and its Hopf-algebra of momenta. The latter
can always be defined. The suitingly devided cross-product algebra is then
lifted to a Hopf-algebra that carries the required genuine structure to
accomodate a matrix representation of the universal enveloping algebra as a
subalgebra. We twist the Hopf-algebra of vector fields and thereby obtain the
desired twisting of the Lie-algebra. Since we twist with vector fields and not
with generators of the Lie-algebra, this is the most general twisting that can
possibly be obtained. In other words, we push starproducts to twists of the
desired symmetry algebra and to this purpose solve the problem of turning
vector fields into a Hopf-algebra. We give some genuine example.

reduced to the time dependence of the charge associated to a conserved current.
For the U(1) gauge symmetry a non-perturbative control of the charge
commutators is obtained by an analysis of the Coulomb charged fields. From
this, in the unbroken case we obtain a correct expression for the electric
charge on the Coulomb states, its superselection and the presence of massless
vector bosons; in the broken case, we obtain a general non-perturbative version
of the Higgs phenomenon, i.e. the absence of massless Goldstone bosons and of
massless vector bosons. The conservation of the (gauge dependent) current
associated to the U(1) axial symmetry in QCD is shown to be compatible with the
time dependence of the corresponding charge commutators and a non-vanishing
eta' mass, as a consequence of the non locality of the (conserved) current.

Here we elaborate the detailed procedures for the pedagogical purpose. Due to
the nature of the symmetry, one may get the degeneracy from the solution of
eigenfunctions for given one class operator. In order to remove the degeneracy
we use extra class operators, which may be the subgroup class operator or even
the state permutation operator. In doing so, a variety of eigenvalues come out.
Every eigenfunction is therefore obtained, and basis vectors are completely

the threshold value (m$_p$+m$_\eta$) and the N*(1535) resonance mass, is
largely determined by the $\eta N$ scattering amplitude close to threshold. The
initial photon energy is chosen in the range $4 < E_\gamma^{Lab} < 5$ GeV, in
order to reach low (absolute) values of the squared 4-momentum transfer from
the initial photon to the final $\phi$-meson. In these conditions, we expect
the t-channel $\pi^0$- and $\eta$-meson exchanges to drive the dynamics
underlying the $\gamma p \to \phi \eta p$ process. We show that the
$\eta$-exchange is the dominating contribution to the cross section while the
$\pi^0$-exchange is negligible. The $\eta$-$\pi^0$ interference is of the order
of $20 - 30 %$. The sign of this term is not known and alters significantly our
results. Data on the $\gamma p \to \phi \eta p$ process would be therefore very

pulse focused on Cu foil target. Cu K-alpha photon emission obtained with
second harmonic laser pulse is more intense than the case of fundamental laser
pulse. The Cu K-alpha conversion efficiency shows strong dependence on laser
nonlinearly skewed pulse shape and reaches the maximum value 4x10-4 with 100 fs
negatively skewed pulse. It shows the electron spectrum shaping contribute to
the increase of conversion efficiency. Particle-in-cell simulations
demonstrates that the application of high contrast laser pulses will be an
effective method to optimize the x-ray emission, via the Enhanced Vacuum

  Reactive Scattering Theory","33 pages",,,,"physics.chem-ph",,"  A new approach is described to the evaluation of the S-matrix in
three-dimensional atom-diatom reactive quantum scattering theory. The theory is
developed based on natural collision coordinates where progress along the
reaction coordinate can be viewed as fulfilling the same role as time in a
time-dependent formulation. By writing the full wavefunction in coupled-channel
form it is proved that the 3D quantum reactive scattering problem can be
treated in the same way as an inelastic single-arrangement problem. In
particularly, two types of coupled-channel representations, which are reduced
to two different systems of coupled first order ordinary differential equations
describing the inelastic scattering, are used. The first system of coupled
differential equations is constructed on a set of points (grid) of the
coordinate reaction curve after solution of many 1D Schroedinger problems in
the directions normal to the reaction coordinate. The second expression for
inelastic scattering is found using exactly solvable nonstationary 1D
Schroedinger equation (etalon equation method), which is introduced for
describing the localization properties of the full wavefunction along the curve
of coordinate reaction. In this case we avoid a large amount of computation
involved in solving the 1D Schroedinger problem along the reaction coordinate
by using a slightly difficult initial conditions for the inelastic scattering
equations. In both cases by solving the system of coupled first order ordinary
differential equations, the full wavefunction and all S-matrix elements are
obtained simultaneously without further calculations. Our analysis shows that
the methods we have developed constitute the simplest algorithms for computing
the reactive scattering S-matrices.

photon or ""corpuscular"" model have heretofore been unable to account for the
observed decrease in the speed of light as it passes from air into a region of
higher refractive index n such as water or glass. In the present work it is
argued on the basis of the quantum mechanical relations p = k and E = h omega
that the energy of photons satisfies the equation E = pc/n. It is possible to
obtain an exact prediction of the observed speed of the photons in a given
medium by application of Hamilton's equations of motion to the above formula,
but at the same time to conclude, in agreement with the arguments of Newton and
other classical physicists, that the photon momentum increases in direct
proportion to n, thereby producing the well-known bending of light rays toward
the normal when entering water from air. The corresponding relativistic
particle theory of light indicates that the potential V encountered by the
photons in a given medium is attractive for n > 1 and is momentum-dependent,
which suggests the microscopic interactions responsible for the refraction of
light are non-Coulombic in nature and are instead akin to the spin-orbit and
orbit-orbit terms in the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian for electrons moving in an
external field. The present theory concludes that the reason photons are slowed
down upon entering water from air is that their relativistic mass p/v increases
faster with n than does their momentum, which in turn requires that Einstein's
famous E = mc^2 formula does not hold for light dispersion because the energy
of the photons is expected to be the same in both media.

the rotating disk and h is the interdisk spacing. The rotation rate Omega under
consideration is equivalent to the rotational Reynolds number Re=Omegab2/nu=9.5
x 104, where nu is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid. This corresponds to a
value at which an experiment carried out at the laboratory has shown that the
stator boundary layer is turbulent, whereas the rotor boundary layer is still
laminar. Comparisons of the 3D computed solution with velocity measurements
have given good agreement for the mean and turbulent fields. The results
enhance evidence of weak turbulence at this Reynolds number, by comparing the
turbulence properties with available data in the literature. An approximately
self-similar boundary layer behavior is observed along the stator side. The
reduction of the structural parameter a1 under the typical value 0.15 and the
variation in the wall-normal direction of the different characteristic angles
show that this boundary layer is three-dimensional. A quadrant analysis of
conditionally averaged velocities is performed to identify the contributions of
different events (ejections and sweeps) on the Reynolds shear stress producing
vortical structures. The asymmetries observed in the conditionally averaged
quadrant analysis are dominated by Reynolds stress-producing events in this

and its effects on tumor cells dynamics have to be taken into account when
studying cancer progression. There is no unifying theoretical framework in
mathematical modeling of carcinogenesis that would account for parametric
heterogeneity. Here we formulate a modeling approach that naturally takes stock
of inherent cancer cell heterogeneity and illustrate it with a model of
interaction between a tumor and an oncolytic virus. We show that several
phenomena that are absent in homogeneous models, such as cancer recurrence,
tumor dormancy, an others, appear in heterogeneous setting. We also demonstrate
that, within the applied modeling framework, to overcome the adverse effect of
tumor cell heterogeneity on cancer progression, a heterogeneous population of
an oncolytic virus must be used. Heterogeneity in parameters of the model, such
as tumor cell susceptibility to virus infection and virus replication rate, can
lead to complex, time-dependent behaviors of the tumor. Thus, irregular,
quasi-chaotic behavior of the tumor-virus system can be caused not only by
random perturbations but also by the heterogeneity of the tumor and the virus.
The modeling approach described here reveals the importance of tumor cell and
virus heterogeneity for the outcome of cancer therapy. It should be
straightforward to apply these techniques to mathematical modeling of other
types of anticancer therapy.
