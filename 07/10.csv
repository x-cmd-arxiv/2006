requires proper treatment of QED effects, in particular the effect of photon
mode conversion due to the ``vacuum resonance'' between plasma and vacuum
polarization. Previous NS atmosphere models incorporated this effect
approximately, using transfer equations for the photon modes which are
inadequate near the vacuum resonance, particularly for field strengths around
$B_l\simeq 7\times 10^{13}$ G, where the vacuum resonance occurs near the
photosphere. In this paper, we provide an accurate treatment of the QED-induced
mode conversion effect in NS atmosphere models, employing both the modal
radiative transfer equations, coupled with an accurate mode conversion
probability at the resonance, and the full evolution equations for the photon
Stokes parameters. In doing so, we are able to quantitatively calculate the
effects of vacuum polarization on the atmosphere emission spectra, beam
patterns, and polarizations for the entire range of field strengths,
$B=10^{12}-10^{15}$ G. We find that for NSs with $B\ga 2 B_l$, vacuum
polarization reduces the widths of spectral features, and softens the hard
spectral tail typical of magnetized atmosphere models. For $B\la B_l/2$, vacuum
polarization does not change the emission spectra, but can significantly affect
the polarization signals. We show that vacuum polarization induces a unique
energy-dependent linear polarization signature, and that circular polarization
can be generated in the magnetospheres of rapidly rotating NSs. We discuss the
implications of our results for recent observations of thermally emitting
isolated NSs and magnetars, as well as the prospects for future spectral and

presence of time-dependent line profiles. Long term observations of several
systems revealed the periodicity of this variability, synchronized with the
orbital movement. Several partially successful models have been proposed to
reproduce the observed data. The most promising assume that the origin of the
emission is the wind-wind interaction zone. In this scenario, two high velocity
and dense winds produce a strong shock layer, responsible for most of the
X-rays observed from these systems. As the secondary star moves along its
orbital path, the shock region of conical shape, changes its position with
relation to the line of sight. As a consequence, the stream measured Doppler
shift presents time variations resulting in position changes of the spectral
line. In our work, we present an alternative model, introducing turbulence in
the shock layer to account for the line broadening and opacity effects for the
asymmetry in the line profiles. We showed that the gas turbulence avoids the
need of an unnaturally large contact layer thickness to reproduce line
broadening. Also, we demonstrated that if the emission from the opposing cone
surface is absorbed, the result is a single peaked profile. This result fully
satisfies the recent data obtained from massive binary systems, and can help on
the determination of both winds and orbital parameters. We successfully applied
this model to the Br22 system and determined its orbital parameters.

arguments based on a quantitative analysis that supermassive objects at
galactic centers may be bubbles of dark matter axions rather than black holes.
An oscillating axion bubble can explain periodic variability of Sagittarius A*
and yields the axion mass about 0.6 meV which fits in the open axion mass
window. The bubble scenario with no other free parameters explains lack of
supermassive ""black holes"" with mass M<10^6 M_{Sun}. Low-mass bubbles decay
fast and as a result are very rare. We also found that the mass of an axion
bubble can not exceed 1.5\times 10^9 M_{Sun}, in agreement with the upper limit
on the supermassive ""black hole"" mass obtained from observations. Our finding,
if confirmed, suggests that Einstein general relativity is invalid for strong
gravity and the gravitational field for the bubble effectively becomes
repulsive at large potential. Imaging a shadow of the ""black hole"" at the
Galactic center with VLBI in the next decade can distinguish between the black
hole and the oscillating axion bubble scenarios. In the case of axion bubble, a
steady shadow will not be observed. Instead, the shadow will appear and

temperature profile in the X-ray emitting jet that best fits the observed
precessional variations of the X-ray emission temperature. The hottest visible

System of Cherenkov Telescopes (H.E.S.S.) in 2005 at very high energy (VHE)
gamma-ray energies. These observations reveal that its flux and energy spectrum
are modulated with the 3.9 day orbital period of the binary system. This is the
first time in gamma-ray astronomy that orbital modulation has been observed,
and periodicity clearly established using ground-based gamma-ray detectors. The
VHE gamma-ray emission is largely confined to half of the orbit, peaking around
the inferior conjunction epoch of the compact object. For this epoch, there is
also a hardening of the energy spectrum in the energy range between 0.2 TeV and
a few TeV. The flux vs. orbital phase profile provides the first clear
indication of gamma-ray absorption via pair production within an astrophysical
source, a process which is expected to occur if the gamma-ray production site
is situated within ~1 AU of the compact object. Moreover the production region
size must be not significantly greater than the binary separation (~0.15 AU).
Notably, these constraints are also considerably smaller than the collimated
outflows or jets (extending out to ~1000 AU) observed in LS 5039. The spectral
hardening could arise from variations with phase in the maximum electron
energies, and/or the dominant VHE gamma-ray production mechanism.

low density winds and the shock waves generated by the supernova interaction
with the wind are not expected to be radiative at typical times of observation.
The injected energy spectrum of radio emitting electrons typically has an
observed index p=3, which is suggestive of acceleration in cosmic ray dominated
shocks. The early, absorbed part of the radio light curves can be attributed to
synchrotron self-absorption, which leads to constraints on the magnetic field
in the emitting region and on the circumstellar density. The range of
circumstellar densities inferred from the radio emission is somewhat broader
than that for Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars, if similar efficiencies of synchrotron
emission are assumed in the extragalactic supernovae. For the observed and
expected ranges of circumstellar densities to roughly overlap, a high
efficiency of magnetic field production in the shocked region is required
(epsilon_B ~ 0.1). For the expected densities around a Wolf-Rayet star, a
nonthermal mechanism is generally required to explain the observed X-ray
luminosities of Type Ib/c supernovae. Although the inverse Compton mechanism
can explain the observed X-ray emission from SN 2002ap if the wind parameters
are taken from the radio model, the mechanism is not promising for other
supernovae unless the postshock magnetic energy density is much smaller than
the electron energy density. In some cases another mechanism is definitely
needed and we suggest that it is X-ray synchrotron emission in a case where the
shock wave is cosmic ray dominated so that the electron energy spectrum
flattens at high energy. More comprehensive X-ray observations of a Type Ib/c
supernova are needed to determine whether this suggestion is correct.

factor of ~5 lower than the flux which they predict. Our predicted neutrino
flux would be below the atmospheric neutrino foreground flux at energies below

galaxies are also unlikely to be detected. Compared with predicted fluxes from
other extragalactic high energy neutrino sources, starburst neutrinos with ~PeV

also estimate an upper limit for the diffuse GeV gamma-ray flux from starburst

and OH content on the elastic properties of silica glass, we have performed
high resolution in situ Brillouin spectra of SiO2 glass from room temperature
to the supercooled liquid at 1773K across the glass transition. The well known
anomalous increase of elastic modulus in the glassy state and in the
supercooled liquid regime is observed. No change of slope in the elastic moduli
of silica appears as a characteristic of glass transition, on the contrary to
what happens in various other glasses. We show that thermal history has a weak
effect on elastic moduli in the glass transition regime for silica glass. The
effect of water content in silica glass is more efficient than the fictive
temperature effect and gives larger changes in the amplitude of elastic modulus
for the same thermal dependence. A singular decrease above 1223K is also
observed in the shear moduli for hydrated samples. Different models explaining
elastic properties temperature dependence in relationship with frozen-in
density fluctuations or with the structure are discussed.

stack-splitting approach, previously described by the authors and
experimentally validated on shared-memory systems, which in turn is an
evolution of the stack-copying method used in a variety of parallel logic and
constraint systems--e.g., MUSE, YAP, and Penny. The PALS system is the first
distributed or-parallel implementation of Prolog based on the stack-splitting
method ever realized. The results presented confirm the superiority of this
method as a simple yet effective technique to transition from shared-memory to
distributed-memory systems. PALS extends stack-splitting by combining it with
incremental copying; the paper provides a description of the implementation of
PALS, including details of how distributed scheduling is handled. We also
investigate methodologies to effectively support order-sensitive predicates
(e.g., side-effects) in the context of the stack-splitting scheme. Experimental
results obtained from running PALS on both Shared Memory and Beowulf systems

broadcasting the proper time of the emitters are the so called {\em emission

that the obstruction for the periodicity of algebraic K-theory is again cyclic
homology.

chiral theory by first extending it to allow a much larger class of algebras

of an O(sg) algebra is the chiral de Rham complex Q(M) of a G manifold M. There
is an interesting subalgebra of Q(M) which does not admit a full O(sg) algebra
structure but retains the structure of an sg[t] algebra, enough for us to
define its chiral equivariant cohomology. The latter then turns out to have
many surprising features that allows us to delineate a number of interesting
geometric aspects of the G manifold M, sometimes in ways that are quite
different from the classical theory.

model of a meandering jet flow motivated by the problem of lateral mixing and
transport in the Gulf Stream. We briefly discuss a model streamfunction,
Hamiltonian advection equations, stationary points, and bifurcations. The phase
portrait of the chosen model flow in the moving reference frame consists of a
central eastward jet, chains of northern and southern circulations, and
peripheral westward currents. Under a periodic perturbation of the meander's
amplitude, the topology of the phase space is complicated by the presence of
chaotic layers and chains of oscillatory and ballistic islands with sticky
boundaries immersed into a stochastic sea. Typical chaotic trajectories of
advected particles are shown to demonstrate a complicated behavior with long
flights in both the directions of motion intermittent with trapping in the
circulation cells being stuck to the boundaries of vortex cores and resonant
islands. Transport is asymmetric in the sense that mixing between the
circulations and the peripheral currents is, in general, different from mixing
between the circulations and the jet. The transport properties are
characterized by probability distribution functions (PDFs) of durations and
lengths of flights. Both the PDFs exhibit at their tails power-law decay with
different values of exponents.

model are investigated in a unified coupled-channels framework of the
resonating-group method (RGM). The interaction Hamiltonian for quarks consists
of the phenomenological confinement potential, the color Fermi-Breit
interaction with explicit flavor-symmetry breaking (FSB), and effective-meson
exchange potentials of scalar-, pseudoscalar- and vector-meson types. The model
parameters are determined to reproduce the properties of the nucleon-nucleon
(NN) system and the low-energy cross section data for the hyperon-nucleon (YN)
interactions. The NN phase shifts and many observables for the NN and YN
interactions are nicely reproduced. Properties of these B8 B8 interactions are
analyzed through the G-matrix calculations. The B8 B8 interactions are then
applied to some of few-baryon systems and light Lambda-hypernuclei in a
three-cluster Faddeev formalism using two-cluster RGM kernels. An application
to the three-nucleon system shows that the quark-model NN interaction can give
a sufficient triton binding energy with little room for the three-nucleon
force. The hypertriton Faddeev calculation indicates that the attraction of the
Lambda N interaction in the 1S0 state is only slightly more attractive than
that in the 3S1 state. In the application to the alpha alpha Lambda system, the
energy spectrum of 9 Lambda Be is well reproduced using the alpha alpha RGM
kernel. The very small spin-orbit splitting of the 9 Lambda Be excited states
is also discussed. In the Lambda Lambda alpha Faddeev calculation, the NAGARA
event for 6 Lambda Lambda He is found to be consistent with the quark-model
Lambda Lambda interaction.

eliminated, as in renormalization-group methodology. We prove that
flux-conservation can be violated for an arbitrarily small length-scale $\ell,$
and in the absence of any non-ideality, but only if singular current sheets and
vortex sheets both exist and intersect in sets of large enough dimension. This
result gives analytical support to and rigorous constraints on theories of fast
turbulent reconnection. Mathematically, our theorem is analogous to Onsager's
result on energy dissipation anomaly in hydrodynamic turbulence. As a physical
phenomenon, the breakdown of magnetic-flux conservation in ideal MHD is similar
to the decay of magnetic flux through a narrow superconducting ring, by
phase-slip of quantized flux lines. The effect should be observable both in
numerical MHD simulations and in laboratory plasma experiments at moderately
high magnetic Reynolds numbers.

condensate, focusing on the role of rogue decoherence in the formation of
macroscopic atom-molecule superpositions. Rogue dissociation occurs when two
zero-momentum condensate atoms are photoassociated into a molecule, which then
dissociates into a pair of atoms of equal-and-opposite momentum, instead of
dissociating back to the zero-momentum condensate. As a source of decoherence
that may damp quantum correlations in the condensates, rogue dissociation is an
obstacle to the formation of a macroscopic atom-molecule superposition. We
study rogue decoherence in a setup which, without decoherence, yields a
macroscopic atom-molecule superposition, and find that the most favorable
conditions for said superposition are a density ~ 1e12 atoms per cc and
temperature ~ 1e-10.

highly efficient homodyne measurements. We present a two-qubit scheme, with a
simple bucket measurement system yielding an entangling operation with success
probability 1/2. Then we extend this to a three-qubit interaction, increasing
this probability to 3/4. We discuss the important issues of the overhead cost

with $d$ non-prime. The entanglement of such states is revealed by the
construction of canonically associated entanglement witnesses. The structure of
the states is very simple and similar to the one of isotropic states: they are
a mixture of a separable and a pure entangled state whose supports are
orthogonal. Despite such simple structure, in an opportune interval of the
mixing parameter their entanglement is not revealed by partial transposition
nor by the realignment criterion, i.e. by any permutational criterion in the
bipartite setting. In the range in which the states are Positive under Partial
Transposition (PPT), they are not distillable; on the other hand, the states in
the considered class are provably distillable as soon as they are Nonpositive
under Partial Transposition (NPT). The states are associated to any set of more
than two pure states. The analysis is extended to the multipartite setting. By
an opportune selection of the set of multipartite pure states, it is possible
to construct mixed states which are PPT with respect to any choice of bipartite
cuts and nevertheless exhibit genuine multipartite entanglement. Finally, we
show that every $k$-positive but not completely positive map is associated to a
family of nondecomposable maps.
