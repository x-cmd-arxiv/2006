simple singular isothermal ellipsoid models including external shear. Using the
three-dimensional line-of-sight (LOS) information on galaxies from the DEEP2

isothermal sphere halos truncated at 200 h^-1 kpc. These are also compared
against three-dimensional local-density estimates. We find that even strong
lenses in demonstrably underdense local environments may be considerably
affected by LOS contributions, which in turn, may be underestimates of the
effect of large scale structure.

the moment method together with the amplitude and phase variations across the

unambiguously identify (l_1,m_1) = (2,2) and (l_2,m_2) = (0,0). We cannot

plays an important role in galaxy evolution. The low group velocity dispersion
favors tidal interactions and mergers, which may bring stars from galaxies to
the diffuse intragroup light. Numerical simulations of galaxy clusters in
hierarchical cosmologies show that the amount of the diffuse light increases
with the dynamical evolution of the cluster. We search for diffuse light in the
galaxy group HCG 44 in order to determine its luminosity and luminosity
fraction. Combining with literature data, we aim to constrain the dynamical
status of Hickson compact groups. We use Intra Group planetary nebulae (IGPNe)
as tracers of diffuse light. These are detected by the so-called on band-off
band technique. We found 12 emission line objects in HCG 44, none of them
associated with the galaxies of the group. 6/12 emission line objects are
consistent with being IGPNe in HCG 44, but are also consistent with being
Ly$\alpha$ background galaxies. Thus we derive an upper limit to the diffuse
light fraction in HCG 44 of 4.7%. We find a correlation between the fraction of
elliptical galaxies and the amount of diffuse light in Hickson compact groups.
Those with large fraction of diffuse light are those with large fractions in
number and luminosity of E/S0 galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for
Hickson compact groups in which the amount of diffuse light increases with the

high-resolution optical spectra covering in most cases the entire oscillation
cycle of the stars. Nitrogen is found to be enhanced by up to 0.6 dex in four
stars, three of which have severe constraints on their equatorial rotational
velocity, \Omega R, from seismic or line-profile variation studies: beta Cep

material at the surface of such largely unevolved, slowly-rotating objects is
not predicted by current evolutionary models including rotation. We draw
attention to the fact that three stars in this subsample have a detected
magnetic field and briefly discuss recent theoretical work pointing to the
occurrence of diffusion effects in beta Cephei stars possibly capable of
altering the nitrogen surface abundance. On the other hand, the abundances of
all the other chemical elements considered are, within the errors,
indistinguishable from the values found for OB dwarfs in the solar
neighbourhood. Despite the mild nitrogen excess observed in some objects, we
thus find no evidence for a significantly higher photospheric metal content in
the studied beta Cephei stars compared to non-pulsating B-type stars of similar
characteristics.

formation is how kilometre-sized planetesimals form from, initially,
micron-sized dust grains. Solid growth beyond metre sizes can be difficult both
because the sticking efficiency becomes very small, and because these particles
should rapidly migrate into the central star. We consider here how metre-sized
particles evolve in self-gravitating accretion discs using simulations in which
the gravitational influence of the solid particles is also included.
Metre-sized particles become strongly concentrated in the spiral structures
present in the disc and, if the solid to gas density ratio is sufficiently
high, can fragment due to their own self-gravity to form planetesimals
directly. This result suggests that planetesimal formation may occur very early
in the star formation process while discs are still massive enough to be
self-gravitating. The dependence of this process on the surface density of the
solids is also consistent with the observation that extrasolar planets are
preferentially found around high metallicity stars.

few objects fainter than M_{B}=-20.5 or bluer than U-B=0.6. This places the AGN
in a distinct region of color-magnitude space, on the ``red sequence'' or at
the top of the ``blue cloud'', with many in between these two modes in galaxy
color. A key stage in the evolution of massive galaxies is when star formation
is quenched, resulting in a migration from the blue cloud to the red sequence.
Our results are consistent with scenarios in which AGN either cause or maintain
this quenching. The large numbers of red sequence AGN imply that strong,
ongoing star formation is not a necessary ingredient for AGN activity, as black
hole accretion appears often to persist after star formation has been
terminated.

physical sizes < 1 kpc. They are also among the most metal-poor galaxies known,
and are found to reside within voids. Both the HST images and the objects'
optical spectra reveal that they are composites of young (~1 Myr) populations
that dominate their light, and older (~10 Gyr) populations that dominate their
stellar masses, which we estimate to be ~10^7 - 10^8 Msol. An intermediate-age
population is also indicated in most cases. The objects are not as dynamically
disturbed as the prototype UCBD, POX 186, but the structure of several of them
suggests that their current starbursts have been triggered by the
collisions/mergers of smaller clumps of stars. In one case, HS 0822+3542, the
ACS/HRC images resolve the object into two small (~100 pc) components which
appear to have recently collided, supporting this interpretation. In six of the
objects much of their star formation is concentrated in Young Massive Star
clusters. The evidence that the galaxies consist mainly of ~10 Gyr old stars
establishes that they are not protogalaxies; their low metallicities are more
likely to be the result of the escape of supernova ejecta, as opposed to youth.
These results are consistent with recent galaxy formation simulations which
predict that cosmic re-ionization at z ~ 6 significantly limited the subsequent
star formation of dwarf galaxies in voids due to the photo-evaporation of
baryons from their cold dark matter halos (Abridged).

parallelized Newton-Krylov methods to obtain a solution of these nonlinear,
implicit equations. Our second major extension to the ZEUS algorithm is
inclusion of an electron conservation equation, which describes evolution of
electron-number density in the hydrodynamic flow. This permits following the
effects of deleptonization in a stellar core. In our third extension, we have

photometric measurements from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), which, in
combination with optical photometry, can partially break the well-known
age-metallicity degeneracy operating at ages in excess of a few Gyr. We show
robustly that previous age determinations based on photometric data were
affected significantly by this age-metallicity degeneracy. Except for one
cluster, the ages of our other sample GCs are all older than 1 Gyr. Their age
distribution shows populations of young and intermediate-age GCs, peaking at
$\sim3$ and 8 Gyr respectively, as well as the ""usual"" complement of well-known

these formulae to estimate statistical errors on f_NL from Gaussian
realizations, which are much faster to generate than non-Gaussian ones, fully
taking into account the cosmic/sampling variance, beam smearing, survey mask,
etc. We show that the CMB data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe
should be sensitive to |f_NL|\simeq 40 at the 68% confidence level. The Planck
data should be sensitive to |f_NL|\simeq 20. As for the LSS data, the late-time
non-Gaussianity arising from gravitational instability and galaxy biasing makes
it more challenging to detect primordial non-Gaussianity at low redshifts. The
late-time effects obscure the primordial signals at small spatial scales.
High-redshift galaxy surveys at z>2 covering \sim 10Gpc^3 volume would be
required for the LSS data to detect |f_NL|\simeq 100. Minkowski Functionals are
nicely complementary to the bispectrum because the Minkowski Functionals are
defined in real space and the bispectrum is defined in Fourier space. This
property makes the Minksowski Functionals a useful tool in the presence of
real-world issues such as anisotropic noise, foreground and survey masks. Our
formalism can be extended to scale-dependent f_NL easily.

reproducing the absorber column ratio, N(CIV)/N(HI). We explore the effects of
using different UV continua in the photoionization calculations. A comparison
is drawn between the absorber in 0200+015 and the two absorbers in the lensed
Lynx Arc Nebula at z=3.36, which present similar N(CIV)/N(HI) ratios. We find
that hot stars from a powerful starburst, or a metagalactic background
radiation (MBR) in which stars dominate over quasars, are equally successful in
producing the observed N(CIV)/N(HI), assuming subsolar absorber metallicities.
These softer SEDs eliminate the factor 1000 difference in metallicity between
the two absorbers encountered in earlier work assuming a powerlaw SED. The
detected level of continuum flux in 0943-242 is consistent with stellar
ionization. If the MBR is responsible for the ionization of the radio galaxy
absorbing shells, their radii (if spherical) would be large (> 100 kpc) and
their mass would be huge (>1E12 M_Sun), implying that a feedback event within
the radiogalaxy has expelled more baryonic material than left within it. If, as
we believe more likely, stellar sources within the radiogalaxy are responsible
for the absorber's ionization, smaller radii of ~25 kpc and much smaller masses
(~1E8-1E10 M_Sun) are inferred. This radius is consistent with the observed
transition in radio source size between smaller sources where strong HI
absorption is almost ubiquitous, and the larger sources where it is mostly
lacking. Finally, we outline additional absorption line diagnostics which could
further constrain the properties of the haloes and their ionization sources.

stratification in stellar magnetic atmospheres due to microscopic diffusion, in
particular the redistribution of momentum among the various ionisation stages
of a given element and the calculation of diffusion velocities in the presence
of inclined magnetic fields.
  We have considerably modified and extended our CARAT code to provide
radiative accelerations, not only from bound-bound but also from bound-free
transitions. In addition, our code now computes ionisation and recombination
rates, both radiative and collisional. These rates are used in calculating the
redistribution of momentum among the various ionisation stages of the chemical
elements. A careful comparison shows that the two different theoretical
approaches to redistribution that are presently available lead to widely
discrepant results for some chemical elements, especially in the magnetic case.
In the absence of a fully satisfactory theory of redistribution, we propose to
use the geometrical mean of the radiative accelerations from both methods.
  Diffusion velocities have been calculated for 28 chemical elements in a T_eff
= 12000K, log g = 4.00 stellar magnetic atmosphere with solar abundances.

survey and derived the angular power spectra (APSs) of the total intensity, the
polarized emission, and their cross-correlation for the entire surveys and for
three low-intensity regions. The APSs of the diffuse synchrotron emission are
modelled by power laws. For the $E$ and $B$ modes, a slope of $\alpha \sim
[-3.0,-2.5]$ for the multipole range $\sim [30,300]$ is found. By the
extrapolation of these results to 70 GHz, we can estimate the Galactic
synchrotron contamination of CMB anisotropies, and we find results that are
compatible with the ones coming from WMAP 3-yr data. In the low-intensity
regions, the cosmological primordial B~mode peak at $\ell \sim 100$ should be
clearly observable for a tensor-to-scalar ratio $T/S \gsim 0.5$ and a
synchrotron temperature spectral index $\beta \sim -3$. Its detection is also
possible for $T/S \gsim 0.005$ and $\beta \sim -3$, in case a separation of the
foreground from the CMB signal could be achieved with an accuracy of $\sim
5-10%$. For the TE mode, a mask excluding $|b_{gal}| \le 5^{\circ}$ (for
$\beta\sim -3.0$) or $|b_{gal}| \le 20^{\circ}$ (for $\beta\sim -2.8$) from the

confirming the ability of WMAP to have a clear view of the

weight, and careful analysis reveals two separate features near 2 eV that may
be related to different charge-transfer processes. The polarization dependence
indicates that the 4p electrons contribute significantly to the RIXS cross
section. Third-order perturbation arguments and a shake-up of valence
excitations are then applied to account for the final-energy resonance in the

been proposed as a mechanism for autonomous DNA computation and for bottom-up
fabrication of complex nanostructures. A `program' for growing a desired
structure consists of a set of molecular `tiles' designed to have specific
binding interactions. A key challenge to making algorithmic self-assembly
practical is designing tile set programs that make assembly robust to errors
that occur during initiation and growth. One method for the controlled
initiation of assembly, often seen in biology, is the use of a seed or catalyst
molecule that reduces an otherwise large kinetic barrier to nucleation. Here we
show how to program algorithmic self-assembly similarly, such that seeded
assembly proceeds quickly but there is an arbitrarily large kinetic barrier to
unseeded growth. We demonstrate this technique by introducing a family of tile
sets for which we rigorously prove that, under the right physical conditions,
linearly increasing the size of the tile set exponentially reduces the rate of
spurious nucleation. Simulations of these `zig-zag' tile sets suggest that
under plausible experimental conditions, it is possible to grow large seeded
crystals in just a few hours such that less than 1 percent of crystals are
spuriously nucleated. Simulation results also suggest that zig-zag tile sets
could be used for detection of single DNA strands. Together with prior work
showing that tile sets can be made robust to errors during properly initiated
growth, this work demonstrates that growth of objects via algorithmic
self-assembly can proceed both efficiently and with an arbitrarily low error
rate, even in a model where local growth rules are probabilistic.

reported in three different families of high temperature superconductors by
using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. As we follow the dispersing
peak of the spectral function from the Fermi energy to the valence band
complex, we find dispersion anomalies marked by two distinctive high energy
scales, E_1=~ 0.38 eV and E_2=~0.8 eV. E_1 marks the energy above which the
dispersion splits into two branches. One is a continuation of the near
parabolic dispersion, albeit with reduced spectral weight, and reaches the
bottom of the band at the gamma point at ~0.5 eV. The other is given by a peak
in the momentum space, nearly independent of energy between E_1 and E_2. Above
E_2, a band-like dispersion re-emerges. We conjecture that these two energies
mark the disintegration of the low energy quasiparticles into a spinon and
holon branch in the high T_c cuprates.

sufficiently large macroion charges and nematic bulk order. The asymptotic
wetting and drying behavior is investigated by means of effective interface
potentials which turn out to be asymptotically the same as for a suitable
neutral system governed by isotropic nonretarded dispersion forces. Wetting and
drying points as well as predrying lines and the corresponding critical points

electrostatic potential profiles upon varying the surface charge density has

aggressive driving model (ADM), a simple cellular automata-based model of
vehicular traffic, a unique feature of which is that it allows a natural
extension to capture the essential features of dynein motor traffic. We first
calculate several collective properties of the ADM, under both periodic and
open boundary conditions, analytically using two different mean-field
approaches as well as by carrying out computer simulations. Then we extend the
ADM by incorporating the possibilities of attachment and detachment of motors
on the track which is a common feature of a large class of motor proteins that
are collectively referred to as cytoskeletal motors. The interplay of the
boundary and bulk dynamics of attachment and detachment of the motors to the
track gives rise a phase where high and low density phases separated by a
stable domain wall coexist. We also compare and contrast our results with the
model of Parmeggiani et. al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 90}, 086601 (2003)) which
can be regarded as a minimal model for traffic of a closely related family of
motor proteins called kinesin. Finally, we compare the transportation
efficiencies of dynein and kinesin motors over a range of values of the model
parameters.

best continuous stationary strategy. We make mild compactness assumptions but
no stochastic assumptions about the environment. In particular, no assumption
of stationarity is made about the environment, and the stationarity of the
considered strategies only means that they do not depend explicitly on time; we
argue that it is natural to consider only stationary strategies even for highly

  Phys.Rev.D","Phys.Rev.D75:085013,2007","10.1103/PhysRevD.75.085013",,"gr-qc",,"  Field theories whose full action is Lorentz invariant (or diffeomorphism
invariant) can exhibit superluminal behaviors through the breaking of local
Lorentz invariance. Quantum induced superluminal velocities are well-known
examples of this effect. The issue of the causal behavior of such propagations
is somewhat controversial in the literature and we intend to clarify it. We
provide a careful analysis of the meaning of causality in classical
relativistic field theories, and we stress the role played by the Cauchy
problem and the notions of chronology and time arrow. We show that superluminal
behavior threaten causality only if a prior chronology on spacetime is chosen.
In the case where superluminal propagations occur, however, there is at least
two non conformally related metrics on spacetime and thus two available notions
of chronology. These two chronologies are on equal footing and it would thus be
misleading to choose \textit{ab initio} one of them to define causality.
Rather, we provide a formulation of causality in which no prior chronology is
assumed. We argue this is the only way to deal with the issue of causality in
the case where some degrees of freedom propagate faster than others. We
actually show that superluminal propagations do not threaten causality. As an
illustration of these conceptual issues, we consider two field theories, namely
k-essences scalar fields and bimetric theories of gravity, and we derive the
conditions imposed by causality. We discuss various applications such as the
dark energy problem, MOND-like theories of gravity and varying speed of light
theories.

astronomical observations. Time of flight measurement from different
astronomical sources set current limits on the energy scale of possible LIV to
$> 0.01 M_{pl}$ (for n=1 models) and $> 10^{-9} M_{pl}$ (for n=2). According to
current models Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are accompanied by bursts of high energy

currently constructed neutrino detectors is so low that a detection of a single
neutrino from the direction of a GRB months or even years after the burst would
imply an association of the neutrino with the burst and will establish a
measurement of a time of flight delay. Such time of flight measurements provide
the best way to observe (or set limits) on LIV. Detection of a single GRB
neutrino would open a new window on LIV and would improve current limits by
many orders of magnitude.

The new approach says that a vertex algebra is an associative algebra such that
the underlying Lie algebra is a vertex Lie algebra. In particular, vertex
algebras can be formulated in terms of a single multiplication and they behave
like associative algebras with respect to it.
  Chapter 1 is the introduction. In chapter 2 we discuss many examples of
vertex Lie algebras and we show that vertex Lie algebras form a full
subcategory of the category of ""local"" Lie algebras. In chapter 3 we introduce
associative, commutative, and Poisson vertex algebras and vertex algebra
modules and we show that graded associative vertex algebras form a full
subcategory of the category of ""local"" associative algebras. In chapter 4 we
give a systematic presentation of the vertex algebra identities, proving in
particular the equivalence of various axiom systems, and we use filtrations to
prove results about generating subspaces with the PBW-property, with and
without repeats. In chapter 5 we explain three constructions of the enveloping
vertex algebra of a vertex Lie algebra and prove the PBW-theorem. In chapter 6
we prove the Zhu correspondence between N-graded vertex algebra modules and
modules over the Zhu algebra.

and greater infectivity. We present and analyze a dynamic compartmental model

these transitions are accomplished via a transient that lingers for a long time
around the third, unstable fixed point of saddle type. We propose a simple
explanation for this phenomenon and find the transient life-time to scale as
$-(\ln{|r-r_c|})/\lambda_r$ where $r_c$ is the critical rate necessary to

transparent to a \textit{p}-polarized obliquely incident electromagnetic wave.
High transparency is achieved due to the interference of the evanescent waves
in the subcritical region. The transmission coefficient has the resonant
character due to the excitation of a plasma surface mode (plasmon-polariton).
It is crucial that two evanescent waves have certain phase shift to provide
non-zero energy flux through non-transparent region. The required phase shift
is obtained at the exact resonance and corresponds to the absolute
transparency. In a warm plasma case, the excitation of the propagating
longitudinal (electrostatic) modes becomes possible. We demonstrate that these
longitudinal excitations facilitate the total transparency of an opaque plasma
slab creating additional resonances in the transmission property of the system.

enhancement results from non-Maxwellian knock-on perturbations of ion

appreciably affect the D+X and T+X reaction rates. The phenomenon discussed is

as a consequence, on the achievable peak and integrated luminosity. In order to
alleviate the problem numerical and experimental studies of the parasitic
crossings compensation with current-carrying wires have been performed at
