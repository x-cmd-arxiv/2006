The X-ray observations were obtained over a period beginning prior to outburst

and demonstrate that the mean flux of the spatially coincident X-ray source
closely tracked the near-infrared luminosity of V1647 Ori throughout its

and infrared light curves over this period was the result of multiple X-ray
flares unrelated to the accretion burst. The recent Chandra data confirm that
the X-ray spectrum of V1647 Ori hardened during outburst, relative both to its
pre-outburst state and to the X-ray spectra of nearby pre-MS stars in the L1630
cloud. We conclude that the observed changes in the X-ray emission from V1647
Ori over the course of its 2003-2005 eruption were generated by a sudden
increase and subsequent decline in its accretion rate. These results for V1647
Ori indicate that the flux of hard X-ray emission from erupting low-mass,
pre-MS stars, and the duration and intensity of such eruptions, reflect the
degree to which star-disk magnetic fields are reorganized before and during
major accretion events.

dimensional space of black hole mass, normalized accretion rate (Ledd),

mass black holes at all redshifts. 2. For a given black hole mass Ledd propto
z^gamma or (1+z)^delta where the slope gamma increases with black hole mass.
The mean slope is similar to the star formation rate slope over the same
redshift interval. 3. The FeII/Hb line ratio is significantly correlated with
Ledd. It also shows a weaker negative dependence on redshift. Combined with the
known dependence of metalicity on accretion rate, we suggest that the FeII/Hb
line ratio is a metalicity indicator. 4. Given the measured accretion rates,
the growth times of most AGNs exceed the age of the universe. This suggests
past episodes of faster growth for all those sources. Combined with the FeII/Hb
result, we conclude that the broad emission lines metalicity goes through
cycles and is not a monotonously decreasing function of redshift. 5. FWHM(OIII)
is a poor proxy of sigma_* especially for high Ledd. 6. We define a group of

systems magnetic reconnection is interesting and/or important? To address this
question, I first put forward three general criteria for selecting the relevant
astrophysical environments. Namely, reconnection should be: fast; energetically
important; and observable. From this, I deduce that the gas density should be
low, so that the plasma is: collisionless; force-free; and optically thin.
Thus, for example, the requirement that reconnection is fast implies that
Petschek's reconnection mechanism must be operating, which is possible,
apparently, only in the collisionless regime. Next, I argue that the force-free
condition implies that the magnetic field be produced in, and anchored by, a
nearby dense massive object, e.g., a star or a disk, strongly stratified by
gravity. I then stress the importance of field-line opening (e.g., by
differential rotation) as a means to form a reconnecting current sheet.
Correspondingly, I suggest the Y-point helmet streamer as a generic
prototypical magnetic configuration relevant to large-scale reconnection in
astrophysics. Finally, I discuss several specific astrophysical systems where
the above criteria are met: stellar coronae, magnetically-interacting
star--disk systems, and magnetized coronae above turbulent accretion disks. In
the Appendix, I apply the ideas put forward in this talk to the solar coronal
heating problem.

found that, when the ground state of the non-diluted system is a non-magnetic
state with a finite spin gap, a sufficiently weak bond dilution induces a
disordered state with a mid gap in the original spin gap, and under a further
stronger bond dilution an antiferromagnetic long-range order emerges. While the
site-dilution-induced long-range order is induced by an infinitesimal
concentration of dilution, there exists a finite critical concentration in the
case of bond dilution. We argue that this essential difference is due to the
occurrence of two types of effective interactions between induced magnetic
moments in the case of bond dilution, and that the antiferromagnetic
long-range-ordered phase does not appear until the magnitudes of the two
interactions become comparable.

and thus provide a thermodynamic route to understand the dynamics of gravity.
We study this approach further and show that the field equations for
Lanczos-Lovelock action in a spherically symmetric spacetime can also be
expressed as TdS = dE + PdV with S and E being given by expressions previously
derived in the literature by other approaches. The Lanczos-Lovelock Lagrangians
are of the form L=Q_a^{bcd}R^a_{bcd} with \nabla_b Q^{abcd}=0. In such models,
the expansion of Q^{abcd} in terms of the derivatives of the metric tensor
determines the structure of the theory and higher order terms can be
interpreted quantum corrections to Einstein gravity. Our result indicates a
deep connection between the thermodynamics of horizons and the allowed quantum
corrections to standard Einstein gravity, and shows that the relation TdS = dE

related) applications of great interest in risk control. In the first place, we
will review the problem of modelling the behaviour of the mean exit time (MET)
of a process out of a given region of fixed size. The surveyed stochastic
processes are the cumulative returns of asset prices. The link between the
value of the MET and the timescale of the market fluctuations of a certain
degree is crystal clear. In this sense, MET value may help, for instance, in
deciding the optimal time horizon for the investment. The MET is, however, one
among the statistics of a distribution of bigger interest: the survival
probability (SP), the likelihood that after some lapse of time a process
remains inside the given region without having crossed its boundaries. The
final part of the article is devoted to the study of this quantity. Note that
the use of SPs may outperform the standard ""Value at Risk"" (VaR) method for two
reasons: we can consider other market dynamics than the limited Wiener process
and, even in this case, a risk level derived from the SP will ensure (within
the desired quintile) that the quoted value of the portfolio will not leave the

steady sources and sinks is naturally defined in terms of the suppression of
bulk scalar variance in the presence of stirring, relative to the variance in
the absence of stirring. These variances can be weighted at various spatial
scales, leading to a family of multi-scale mixing measures and efficiencies. We
derive a priori estimates on these efficiencies from the advection--diffusion
partial differential equation, focusing on a broad class of statistically
homogeneous and isotropic incompressible flows. The analysis produces bounds on
the mixing efficiencies in terms of the Peclet number, a measure the strength
of the stirring relative to molecular diffusion. We show by example that the
estimates are sharp for particular source, sink and flow combinations. In
general the high-Peclet number behavior of the bounds (scaling exponents as
well as prefactors) depends on the structure and smoothness properties of, and
length scales in, the scalar source and sink distribution. The fundamental
model of the stirring of a monochromatic source/sink combination by the random
sine flow is investigated in detail via direct numerical simulation and
analysis. The large-scale mixing efficiency follows the upper bound scaling
(within a logarithm) at high Peclet number but the intermediate and small-scale
efficiencies are qualitatively less than optimal. The Peclet number scaling
exponents of the efficiencies observed in the simulations are deduced
theoretically from the asymptotic solution of an internal layer problem arising

  superconducting single-photon detectors","4 figures",,"10.1063/1.2717582",,"quant-ph",,"  Single-photon sources and detectors are key enabling technologies in quantum
information processing. Nanowire-based superconducting single-photon detectors
(SSPDs) offer single-photon detection from the visible well into the infrared
with low dark counts, low jitter and short dead times. We report on the high
fidelity characterization (via antibunching and spontaneous emission lifetime
measurements) of a cavity-coupled single-photon source at 902 nm using a pair
of SSPDs. The twin SSPD scheme reported here is well-suited to the
characterization of single-photon sources at telecom wavelengths (1310 nm, 1550
nm).

A 74, 022321 (2006)","10.1103/PhysRevA.74.022321",,"quant-ph",,"  We discuss the generation of a macroscopic entangled state in a single atom
cavity-QED system. The three-level atom in a cascade configuration interacts
dispersively with two classical coherent fields inside a doubly resonant
cavity. We show that a macroscopic entangled state between these two cavity
modes can be generated under large detuning conditions. The entanglement
persists even under the presence of cavity losses.

Schwarzschild black hole are investigated. The Hawking radiation was found to
degrade both the quantum coherence of the entangled state and the mutual
correlations of the entangled pair. When the black hole evaporated completely,
the measure of entanglement vanished, but the classical correlation between the
entangled pair still remained.
