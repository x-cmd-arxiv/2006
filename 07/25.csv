Survey, we study the relationship between galaxy color and environment at 0.4 <
z < 1.35. We find that the fraction of galaxies on the red sequence depends
strongly on local environment out to z > 1, being larger in regions of greater
galaxy density. At all epochs probed, we also find a small population of red,
morphologically early-type galaxies residing in regions of low measured
overdensity. The observed correlations between the red fraction and local
overdensity are highly significant, with the trend at z > 1 detected at a
greater than 5-\sigma level. Over the entire redshift regime studied, we find
that the color-density relation evolves continuously, with red galaxies more
strongly favoring overdense regions at low z relative to their red-sequence
counterparts at high redshift. At z ~ 1.3, the red fraction only weakly
correlates with overdensity, implying that any color dependence to the
clustering of ~ L* galaxies at that epoch must be small. Our findings add
weight to existing evidence that the build-up of galaxies on the red sequence
has occurred preferentially in overdense environments (i.e., galaxy groups) at
z < 1.5. The strength of the observed evolutionary trends at 0 < z < 1.35
suggests that the correlations observed locally, such as the morphology-density
and color-density relations, are the result of environment-driven mechanisms
(i.e., ""nurture'') and do not appear to have been imprinted (by ""nature'') upon
the galaxy population during their epoch of formation.

zeta-statistic, has recently been popular in actual observations for
measurement of individual cluster mass. It has however been anticipated that
the line-of-sight projection by foreground and background matter can adversely
affect the cluster mass determination with not only substantial error
dispersion but also a sizable positive systematic bias. Additionally, the
finite number of background galaxies even at a reasonable observing depth can
also introduce Poisson noise to the mass estimate. In this paper, we
quantitatively investigate the degree of errors separately contributed by the
two sources to the mass determination of those galaxy clusters with
M_{200}>10^{14}M_{\odot}. We find that the aperture mass of zeta-statistic
turns out to be a mass estimator of much reduced systematic bias, due to the
cancellation by the positively biased local background mass sheet. However, the
error dispersion of M_{200} arising from both projection effect and Poisson
noise is found to be still sizable (40%-90%), even for the shear-selected,
clean sample where multiple clusters located within a suitable projected
aperture are removed. We also investigate how to remedy this large-error
problem in weak lensing measurements, and propose a plausible alternative mass
estimator, M(<theta_{1000}), an aperture mass measured within about half the
virial radius. The aperture mass M(<theta_{1000}) is free of bias and has a
substantially reduced error dispersion, 39% for the worst case of high-z,
low-mass clusters, that can be smaller than the error dispersion of M_{200} as
much as a factor 3.

the effect of a strong radial differential rotation and stable stratification.
We identify the different roles that the shear flow and stable stratification
play in turbulence regulation and transport. Particle transport is found to be
severely quenched due to stable stratification as well as radial differential
rotation, especially in the radial direction with an effectively more efficient
horizontal transport. The eddy viscosity is shown to become negative for
parameter values typical of the tachocline, suggesting that turbulence in the

accurately measure the average relation between galaxy properties and halo
mass. In order to obtain a signal of sufficient signal-to-noise, one needs to
stack many lens galaxies according to their property of interest, such as
luminosity or stellar mass. Since such a stack consists of both central and
satellite galaxies, which contribute very different lensing signals, the
resulting shear measurements can be difficult to interpret. In the past,
galaxy-galaxy lensing studies have either completely ignored this problem, have
applied rough isolation criteria in an attempt to preferentially select
`central' galaxies, or have tried to model the contribution of satellites
explicitely. However, if one is able to {\it a priori} split the galaxy
population in central and satellite galaxies, one can measure their lensing
signals separately. This not only allows a much cleaner measurement of the
relation between halo mass and their galaxy populations, but also allows a
direct measurement of the sub-halo masses around satellite galaxies. In this
paper, we use a realistic mock galaxy redshift survey to show that galaxy
groups, properly selected from large galaxy surveys, can be used to accurately
split the galaxy population in centrals and satellites. Stacking the resulting
centrals according to their group mass, estimated from the total group
luminosity, allows a remarkably accurate recovery of the masses and density
profiles of their host haloes. In addition, stacking the corresponding
satellite galaxies according to their projected distance from the group center
yields a lensing signal that can be used to accurate measure the masses of both
sub-haloes and host haloes. (Abridged)

The positrons escape freely, but the electrons are directed towards the star
and quickly fill all available states, such that their degeneracy suppresses
further SPC. An electron must be reflected and gain energy in order to escape,
along with the positron. Each escaping electron leaves a hole that is
immediately filled by another electron through SPC. We discuss the collisional
processes that produce escaping electrons. When the Landau quantization of the
motion perpendicular to the magnetic field is taken into account,
electron-electron collisions can lead to an escaping electron only through a
multi-stage process involving higher Landau levels. Although the available
estimates of the collision rate are deficient in several ways, it appears that
the rate is too low for electron-electron collisions to be effective. A simple
kinetic model for electron-quark collisions leads to an estimate of the rate of
pair production that is analogous to thermionic emission, but the work function

total mass and dark matter distributions in non radiative simulations are on
average larger by ~3% and 10% than those in a pure dark matter simulation. Our
results indicate that the total mass density profile is little affected by a
hot gas component in the simulations. After carefully excluding the effects of
resolutions and spurious two-body heating between dark matter and gas
particles, we conclude that the increase of the dark matter concentration
parameters is due to interactions between baryons and dark matter. We
demonstrate this with the aid of idealized simulations of two-body mergers. The
results of individual halos simulated with different mass resolutions show that
the gas profiles of densities, temperature and entropy are subjects of mass
resolution of SPH particles. In particular, we find that in the inner parts of

to determine whether or not the progenitor of V838 Mon may be a massive star.
In the first part of this paper, the evolution of massive stars around solar
metallicity is described, especially the evolution in the Hertzsprung-Russell
(HR) diagram. Then, using the observational constraints, the probable
progenitors (and their evolution) are described. Using models of single stars,
no progenitor can be found amongst massive stars that can satisfy all the
observational constraints. Wolf-Rayet stars (stars with initial masses above
about 30 solar masses, which have lost their hydrogen rich envelopes) could
explain 10 to 100 solar masses of circumstellar material but they are very
luminous (L > 100,000 solar luminosities). Main sequence stars crossing the HR
diagram and becoming red supergiants (RSG) can have very low effective
temperatures but take thousands of years to cross over. Be stars (fast rotating
stars with a mass around 10 solar masses), which form disk or B stars accreting
matter from a binary companion of a similar mass would need to be compared in
detail with the observational constraints. In the future, there will hopefully
be further observational constraints on the models coming from the mass and
nature (interstellar or circumstellar) of the material producing the light echo
and from a frequency estimate of spectacular objects such as V838 Mon.

likely to have followed the same evolution as giant ellipticals, which is
consistent with a simple feedback/collapse formation and a passive evolution.
These fLSBs are mainly clustered around NGC4889. We found two other distinct
fLSB populations. These populations have respectively redder and bluer colors

is not well understood. The standard approach is to assume that, as
temperatures heat up during star formation, methanol and other species
evaporate from grain surfaces and undergo a warm gas-phase chemistry at 100 K
or greater to produce species such as methyl formate, dimethyl ether, and
others. But a series of laboratory results shows that protonated ions, typical
precursors to final products in ion-molecule schemes, tend to fragment upon
dissociative recombination with electrons rather than just ejecting a hydrogen
atom. Moreover, the specific proposed reaction to produce protonated methyl
formate is now known not to occur at all. Methods: We utilize a gas-grain
chemical network to probe the chemistry of the relatively ignored stage of hot
core evolution during which the protostar switches on and the temperature of
the surrounding gas and dust rises from 10 K to over 100 K. During this stage,
surface chemistry involving heavy radicals becomes more important as surface
hydrogen atoms tend to evaporate rather than react. Results: Our results show
that complex species such as methyl formate, formic acid, and dimethyl ether
can be produced in large abundance during the protostellar switch-on phase, but
that both grain-surface and gas-phase processes help to produce most species.
The longer the timescale for protostellar switch-on, the more important the
surface processes.

of the Orion OB1 association located in the subassociations OB1a ($\sim$10 Myr)
and OB1b ($\sim$5 Myr). In a representative sample of stars earlier than F5 of
both stellar groups, we find a population of stars surrounded of debris disks,
without excess in the IRAC bands and without emission lines in their optical
spectra, but with a varying degree of 24{\micron} excess. Comparing our samples
with 24{\micron} observations of intermediate mass stars in other stellar
groups, spanning a range of ages from 2.5 Myr to 150 Myr, we find that debris
disks are more frequent and have larger 24{\micron} excess at 10 Myr (OB1a).
This trend agrees with predictions of models of evolution of solids in the
outer regions of disks ($>$30 AU), where large icy objects ($\sim$1000 Km)
begin to form at $\sim$10 Myr; the presence of these objects in the disk
initiates a collisional cascade, producing enough dust particles to explain the
relatively large 24 {\micron} excess observed in OB1a. The dust luminosity
observed in the stellar groups older than 10 Myr declines roughly as predicted
by collisional cascade models. Combining Spitzer observations, optical spectra
and 2MASS data, we found a new Herbig Ae/Be star (HD290543) and a star
(HD36444) with a large 24 {\micron} excess, both in OB1b. This last object
could be explained as a intermediate stage between HAeBe and true debris
systems or as a massive debris disk produced by a collision between two large
objects ($>$1000 Km).

luminous stars could be detectable assuming just the normal cosmic-ray electron
spectrum. We present the basic formalism required and give possible candidate

the diffuse background emission at about the few percent level.

the ground state energy is analyzed as a function of $L$, in order to obtain
the low temperature behavior of the model. For large finite $L$ there is a
range of $T$ in which the heat capacity is proportional to $T^{5.33 \pm 0.12}$.
The range of $T$ in which this behavior occurs scales slowly to $T = 0$ as $L$

which is simpler and easier to interpret. We perform SC calculations for Nb for
large temperatures T and find that kappa increases with T as kappa(T)=a+bT,
where a and b are constants, consistent with a saturation of the mean free
path, l, and in good agreement with experiment. In contrast, we find that for
A3C60, kappa(T) decreases with T for very large T. We discuss the reason for
this qualitatively in the limit of large T. We give a quantum-mechanical
explanation of the saturation of l for Nb and derive the Wiedemann-Franz law in
the limit of T much smaller than W, where W is the band width. In contrast, due
to the small W of A3C60, the assumption T much smaller than W can be violated.

criticality disappears in both models through an unusual mechanism, arising
from the absence of an area constraint. In the Gaussian case the ring swells to
such a mean area, $<A> \sim NQ$, that the pressure exerted by the particles is
at $p_c$ for any $Q$. In the freely jointed model the mean area is such that
the particle pressure is always higher than $p_c$, and $<A>$ consequently
follows a single scaling law, $<A> \sim N^2 f(Q/N)$, for any $Q$. By contrast,
when the particles are in contact with a reservoir of fixed chemical potential,
the criticality is retained. Thus, the two ensembles are manifestly
inequivalent in these systems.

  Sink Algebras, and the Three-Element Case",,,,,"cs.LO cs.CC",,"  The constraint satisfaction probem (CSP) is a well-acknowledged framework in
which many combinatorial search problems can be naturally formulated. The CSP
may be viewed as the problem of deciding the truth of a logical sentence
consisting of a conjunction of constraints, in front of which all variables are
existentially quantified. The quantified constraint satisfaction problem (QCSP)
is the generalization of the CSP where universal quantification is permitted in
addition to existential quantification. The general intractability of these
problems has motivated research studying the complexity of these problems under
a restricted constraint language, which is a set of relations that can be used
to express constraints.
  This paper introduces collapsibility, a technique for deriving positive
complexity results on the QCSP. In particular, this technique allows one to
show that, for a particular constraint language, the QCSP reduces to the CSP.
We show that collapsibility applies to three known tractable cases of the QCSP
that were originally studied using disparate proof techniques in different
decades: Quantified 2-SAT (Aspvall, Plass, and Tarjan 1979), Quantified
Horn-SAT (Karpinski, Kleine B\""{u}ning, and Schmitt 1987), and Quantified
Affine-SAT (Creignou, Khanna, and Sudan 2001). This reconciles and reveals
common structure among these cases, which are describable by constraint
languages over a two-element domain. In addition to unifying these known
tractable cases, we study constraint languages over domains of larger size.

that the direct sum of subspace subcodes is equivalent to the direct product of

in detail in the context of cosmology. The model possesses scale invariance
which is spontaneously broken due to the intrinsic features of the TMT
dynamics. The effective model represents an explicit example of the effective
k-essence resulting from first principles without any exotic term in the
fundamental action. Depending of the choice of regions in the parameter space,
TMT exhibits different possible outputs for cosmological dynamics: a) Absence
of initial singularity of the curvature while its time derivative is singular.
This is a sort of ""sudden"" singularities studied by Barrow on purely kinematic
grounds. b) Power law inflation in the subsequent stage of evolution. Depending
on the region in the parameter space (but without fine tuning) the inflation
ends with a graceful exit either into the state with zero cosmological constant
(CC) or into the state driven by both a small CC and the field phi with a
quintessence-like potential. c) Possibility of resolution of the old CC
problem. From the point of view of TMT, it becomes clear why the old CC problem
cannot be solved (without fine tuning) in conventional field theories. d) TMT
enables two ways for achieving small CC without fine tuning of dimensionfull
parameters: either by a seesaw type mechanism or due to a correspondence
principle between TMT and conventional field theories (i.e theories with only
the measure of integration sqrt{-g} in the action. e) There is a wide range of
the parameters such that in the late time universe: the equation-of-state
w=p/\rho <-1; w asymptotically (as t\to\infty) approaches -1 from below; \rho
approaches a constant, the smallness of which does not require fine tuning of
dimensionfull parameters.

consisting of pure Higgs extensions and the other one involving fermionic
extensions of the standard model. We give examples of each class and discuss
their possible embeddings into higher unified theories. One of the models has
the interesting property that spontaneous CP violation is triggered by
spontaneous P violation, thereby linking the scale of CP violation to the
seesaw scale for neutrino masses.

the QCD collisional energy loss becomes independent of the jet energy in the

  appear in Commun. Math. Phys",,,,"math-ph math.MP",,"  We study the adiabatic time evolution of quantum resonances over time scales
which are small compared to the lifetime of the resonances. We consider three
typical examples of resonances: The first one is that of shape resonances
corresponding, for example, to the state of a quantum-mechanical particle in a
potential well whose shape changes over time scales small compared to the
escape time of the particle from the well. Our approach to studying the
adiabatic evolution of shape resonances is based on a precise form of the
time-energy uncertainty relation and the usual adiabatic theorem in quantum
mechanics. The second example concerns resonances that appear as isolated
complex eigenvalues of spectrally deformed Hamiltonians, such as those
encountered in the N-body Stark effect. Our approach to study such resonances
is based on the Balslev-Combes theory of dilatation-analytic Hamiltonians and
an adiabatic theorem for nonnormal generators of time evolution. Our third
example concerns resonances arising from eigenvalues embedded in the continuous
spectrum when a perturbation is turned on, such as those encountered when a
small system is coupled to an infinitely extended, dispersive medium. Our
approach to this class of examples is based on an extension of adiabatic
theorems without a spectral gap condition. We finally comment on resonance
crossings, which can be studied using the last approach.

nonnegative integers whose nondecreasing rearrangement (a_1, a_2,...,a_n) has
the property that a_i < i for every i. A well-known result about parking
functions is that the polynomial P_n(q), which enumerates the complements of
parking functions by the sum of their terms, is the generating function for the
number of connected graphs by the number of excess edges when evaluated at
(1+q). In this paper we extend this result to arbitrary connected graphs G. In
general the polynomial that encodes information about subgraphs of G is the
Tutte polynomial, which is the generating function for two parameters, namely
the internal and external activities, associated with the spanning trees of G.
We define G-multiparking functions, which generalize the G-parking functions
that Postnikov and Shapiro introduced in the study of certain quotients of the
polynomial ring. We construct a family of algorithmic bijections between the
spanning forests of a graph G and the G-multiparking functions. In particular,
the bijection induced by the breadth-first search leads to a new
characterization of external activity, and hence a representation of Tutte
polynomial by the reversed sum of G-multiparking functions.

function of past innovations raising proportionately more during market
declines, a phenomenon known as the leverage effect. However, when we control
for the effect of changes in macroeconomic variables, we find no significant
evidence of asymmetric behaviour of the stock market returns. There are some
signs that the Portuguese Stock Market tends to show somewhat less market

  boundary conditions","13 pages, 2 figures, based on a talk at the conference: Time-symmetry
  in Quantum Mechanics, Sydney, Australia, 23-26 July 2005",,,,"quant-ph",,"  If the block universe view is correct, the future and the past have similar
status and one would expect physical theories to involve final as well as
initial boundary conditions. A plausible consistency condition between the
initial and final boundary conditions in non-relativistic quantum mechanics
leads to the idea that the properties of macroscopic quantum systems,
relevantly measuring instruments, are uniquely determined by the boundary
conditions. An important element in reaching that conclusion is that
preparations and measurements belong in a special class because they involve
many subsystems, at least some of which do not form superpositions of their
physical properties before the boundary conditions are imposed. It is suggested
that the primary role of the formalism of standard quantum mechanics is to
provide the consistency condition on the boundary conditions rather than the
properties of quantum systems. Expressions are proposed for assigning a set of
(unmeasured) physical properties to a quantum system at all times. The physical
properties avoid the logical inconsistencies implied by the no-go theorems
because they are assigned differently from standard quantum mechanics. Since
measurement outcomes are determined by the boundary conditions, they help
determine, rather than are determined by, the physical properties of quantum
systems.

defect centers in diamond have been observed at liquid helium temperature. They
display unprecedented spectral stability over many seconds and excitation
cycles. Spectral tuning of the spin selective optical resonances was performed
via the application of an external electric field (i.e. the Stark shift). A
rich variety of Stark shifts were observed including linear as well as
quadratic components. The ability to tune the excitation lines of single NV
centers has potential applications in quantum information processing.

  classical and quantum mechanics wrong?","Presented in talks at conferences: ""Foundations of Probability and
  Physics-4"" (Vaxjo, Sweden, June 2006), ""Quantum Probability"" (Greifswald,
  Germany, March 2006 and Nottingham, UK, July 2006), ""Quantum Structures
  Association"" (Malta, July 2006)",,,"Report from MSI, N 060712","quant-ph",,"  We analyze anomalies in data to test the violation of Bell's inequality for
the EPR-Bohm experiment. We found that the experimental correlations for photon
polarization have an intriguing property. In the experimental data there are
visible non-negligible deviations of probabilities $P_{++}^{\rm{exp}}(\alpha,
\beta), P_{+-}^{\rm{exp}}(\alpha, \beta), P_{-+}^{\rm{exp}}(\alpha, \beta),
P_{--}^{\rm{exp}}(\alpha, \beta) $ from the predictions of quantum mechanics,
namely, $P_{++}(\alpha, \beta)=P_{--}(\alpha, \beta)=
{1/2}\cos^2(\alpha-\beta)$ and $P_{+-}=P_{-+}(\alpha,
\beta)={1/2}\sin^2(\alpha-\beta).$ However, in some mysterious way those
deviations compensate each other and finally the correlation
$E^{\rm{exp}}(\alpha, \beta)= P_{++}^{\rm{exp}}(\alpha, \beta)-
P_{+-}^{\rm{exp}}(\alpha, \beta)- P_{-+}^{\rm{exp}}(\alpha, \beta)+
P_{--}^{\rm{exp}}(\alpha, \beta)$ is in the complete agreement with the
QM-prediction, namely, $E(\alpha, \beta)= P_{++}(\alpha, \beta)- P_{+-}(\alpha,
\beta)- P_{-+}(\alpha, \beta)+ P_{--}(\alpha, \beta)= \cos 2(\alpha-\beta).$
Therefore such anomalies play no role in the Bell's inequality framework.
Nevertheless, other linear combinations of experimental probabilities do not
have such a compensation property. There can be found non-negligible deviations
from predictions of quantum mechanics. Thus neither classical nor quantum model
can pass the whole family of statistical tests given by all possible linear
combinations of the EPR-Bohm probabilities. Does it mean that both models are
wrong?
