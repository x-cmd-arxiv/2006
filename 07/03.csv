cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of Population III star formation in a
Lambda CDM universe, varying the box size and large-scale structure, to
understand systematic effects in the formation of primordial protostellar
cores. We find results that are qualitatively similar to those observed
previously. We observe that the threshold halo mass for formation of a
Population III protostar does not evolve significantly with time in the
redshift range studied (33 > z > 19) but exhibits substantial scatter due to
different halo assembly histories: Halos which assembled more slowly develop
cooling cores at lower mass than those that assemble more rapidly, in agreement
with Yoshida et al. (2003). We do, however, observe significant evolution in
the accretion rates of Population III protostars with redshift, with objects
that form later having higher maximum accretion rates, with a variation of two
orders of magnitude (10^-4 - 10^-2 Msolar/year). This can be explained by
considering the evolving virial properties of the halos with redshift and the
physics of molecular hydrogen formation at low densities. Our result implies
that the mass distribution of Population III stars inferred from their
accretion rates may be broader than previously thought, and may evolve with
redshift. Finally, we observe that our collapsing protostellar cloud cores do
not fragment, consistent with previous results, which suggests that Population
III stars which form in halos of mass 10^5 - 10^6 Msun always form in
isolation.

in the black hole binary (micro-quasar) V4641 Sgr in order to examine its
surface chemical composition and to see if its surface shows any signature of
pollution by ejecta from a supernova explosion. High-resolution spectra of
V4641 Sgr observed in the quiescent state in the blue-visual region are
compared with those of the two bright well-studied B9 stars (14 Cyg and $\nu$
Cap) observed with the same instrument. The effective temperature of V4641 Sgr
(10500 $\pm$ 200 K) is estimated from the strengths of He~{\sc i} lines, while
its rotational velocity, $\it v$ sin $\it i$ (95 $\pm$ 10 km s${}^{-1}$), is
estimated from the profile of the Mg~{\sc ii} line at 4481 \AA. We obtain
abundances of 10 elements and find definite over-abundances of N (by 0.8 dex or
more) and Na (by 0.8 dex) in V4641 Sgr. From line-by-line comparisons of eight
other elements (C, O, Mg, Al, Si, Ti, Cr, and Fe) between V4641 Sgr and the two
reference stars, we conclude that there is no apparent difference in the
abundances of these elements between V4641 Sgr and the two normal late B-type
stars, which have been reported to have solar abundances. An evolutionary model
of a massive close binary system has been constructed to explain the abundances
observed in V4641 Sgr. The model suggests that the progenitor of the black hole
forming supernova was as massive as ~ 35 Msun on the main-sequence and, after
becoming a ~ 10 Msun He star, underwent ""dark"" explosion which ejected only N

the virtues of being less sensitive to the assumed temperatures of the stars

recorded using the Phoenix spectrometer on the Gemini South telescope. The

the formation of the planetary systems.
  Evaporation during chondrule melting may have resulted in depletion of
volatile elements in chondrules. However, no evidence for a large degree of
heavy-isotope enrichment has been reported in chondrules. In order to meet this
observed constraint, the rapid heating rate at temperatures below the silicate
solidus is required to suppress the isotopic fractionation.
  We have developed a new shock-wave heating model taking into account the
radiative transfer of the dust thermal continuum emission and the line emission
of gas molecules and calculated the thermal history of chondrules. We have
found that optically-thin shock waves for the thermal continuum emission from
dust particles can meet the rapid heating constraint, because the dust thermal
emission does not keep the dust particles high temperature for a long time in
the pre-shock region and dust particles are abruptly heated by the gas drag
heating in the post-shock region. We have also derived the upper limit of
optical depth of the pre-shock region using the radiative diffusion
approximation, above which the rapid heating constraint is not satisfied. It is
about 1 - 10.

system. This allows us to study how both the density profile and velocity
anisotropy affect the degree of mass loss--we present basic results from such a
study. Our model predicts that mass loss is a continuous process even in a
static tidal field, a consequence of the fact that mass loss weakens the
potential of the system making it easier for further mass loss to occur. We
compare the predictions of our model with N-body simulations of idealized
systems in order to check its validity. We find reasonable agreement with the
N-body simulations except for in the case of very strong tidal fields, where
our results suggest that a higher-order perturbation analysis may be required.
The continuous tidally-induced mass loss predicted by our model can lead to
substantial reduction in satellite mass in cases where the traditional

consequences for the orbits and survival of low mass satellites in dark matter

have developed a simulator, which calculates the ionization and thermal

Carlo simulations of X-ray photons propagating through the wind. The emergent

accounting for photon transport in three dimensions including dynamics. From

find the ionization structure and the geometrical distribution of material in

continuum shapes at different orbital phases remarkably well. It is found that
a large fraction of X-ray emission lines from highly ionized ions are formed in

emission of the Milky Way. Two physical effects that can produce these canals
have been identified: the presence of Faraday rotation measure ($\RM$)
gradients in a foreground screen and the cumulative cancellation of
polarization known as differential Faraday rotation. We show that the behaviour
of the Stokes parameters $Q$ and $U$ in the vicinity of a canal can be used to
identify its origin. In the case of canals produced by a Faraday screen we
demonstrate that, if the polarization angle changes by $90\degr$ across the
canal, as is observed in all fields to-date, the gradients in $\RM$ must be
discontinuous. Shocks are an obvious source of such discontinuities and we
derive a relation of the expected mean separation of canals to the abundance
and Mach number of supernova driven shocks, and compare this with recent
observations by \citet{Haverkorn03}. We also predict the existence of less
common canals with polarization angle changes other than $90\degr$.
Differential Faraday rotation can produce canals in a uniform magneto-ionic
medium, but as the emitting layer becomes less uniform the canals will
disappear. We show that for moderate differences in emissivity in a two-layer

wave background in a two dimensional lattice is theoretically studied. When the
embedded small polarons become cores of merons and antimerons (vortices in spin
configuration with winding numbers +1 and -1, respectively), a spin Berry phase
arises from the spiral spin texture of the merons and antimerons, and generates
a spin current around the polarons. Electric current is, however, absent due to
the exact cancellation of the up- and down-spin electron currents. By addition
of an imaginary magnetic flux that negates the fictitious magnetic flux from
the spin Berry phase, the state with merons and antimerons is stabilized and
non-zero electric current appears; this imaginary flux becomes a real one when
side-by-side bipolaronic cores of merons and antimerons are formed, where the
real flux arises spontaneously from the wave function for the motion of the
system as a whole; thus, the bipolarons serve as pumps for the persistent
electric current. It is also shown that a Nernst signal stems from thermal
diffusion of the bipolarons. Implications of the present results to anomalous
properties of cuprate superconductors, including the enhanced Nernst signal,
Drude peak, and Fermi arc are also discussed. The present result suggests the

vortex contribution. Based on microscopic Eilenberger theory $N(E)$ is
evaluated for isotropic gap, line and point node gaps to yield a V-shape
$N(E)$. STS-STM experiments on NbSe$_2$ and YNi$_2$B$_2$C give direct evidence
for this. We provide arguments on significance of this finding and on relevance
to other experiments.

atoms as implicitely suggested by recent mean-field it ab initio calculations.
In the latter case, the physics is ruled by a Heisenberg Hamiltonian involving
magnetic oxygen bridges. This paper shows that the spectra resulting from the
resolution of both models are analytically identical. This single resulting
model spectrum accurately reproduces the spectrum of Zener polarons in
Pr0.6Ca0.4MnO3 manganite studied by means of explicitely correlated ab initio
calculations. Since the physics supported by each model are different, the
analysis of the exact Hamiltonian ground state wave function should a priori
enables one to determine the most appropriate model. It will be shown that
neither the spectrum nor the wavefunction analysis bring any decisive arguments

the different concerns that it addresses, which in turn requires a way to
identify these concerns in the source code. Whereas some concerns are
explicitly represented by program entities (like classes, methods and
variables) and thus are easy to identify, crosscutting concerns are not
captured by a single program entity but are scattered over many program
entities and are tangled with the other concerns. Because of their crosscutting
nature, such crosscutting concerns are difficult to identify, and reduce the
understandability of the system as a whole.
  In this paper, we report on a combined experiment in which we try to identify
crosscutting concerns in the JHotDraw framework automatically. We first apply
three independently developed aspect mining techniques to JHotDraw and evaluate
and compare their results. Based on this analysis, we present three interesting
combinations of these three techniques, and show how these combinations provide
a more complete coverage of the detected concerns as compared to the original
techniques individually. Our results are a first step towards improving the
understandability of a system that contains crosscutting concerns, and can be
used as a basis for refactoring the identified crosscutting concerns into
aspects.

underlying states. But what about contexts where states do have a clear
structure - how should IT cope with such situations? And if such coping is at
all possible then - how should structure be expressed so that it can be coped
with? A possible answer to these questions is presented here. Noting that IT
can cope well with a structure expressed as an accurate clustering (by shifting
to the implied reduced alphabet), a generalization is suggested in which
structure is expressed as a measure on reduced alphabets. Given such structure
an extension of IT is presented where the reduced alphabets are treated
simultaneously. This structure-sensitive IT, called ITs, extends traditional IT
in the sense that: a)there are structure-sensitive analogs to the notions of
traditional IT and b)translating a theorem in IT by replacing its notions with
their structure-sensitive counterparts, yields a (provable) theorem of ITs.
Seemingly paradoxically, ITs extends IT but it's completely within the
framework of IT. The richness of the suggested structures is demonstrated by
two disparate families studied in more detail: the family of hierarchical
structures and the family of linear structures. The formal findings extend the
scope of cases to which a rigorous application of IT can be applied (with
implications on quantization, for example). The implications on the foundations
of IT are that the assumption regarding no underlying structure of states is
not mandatory and that there is a framework for expressing such underlying
structure.

proposed Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is the inspiral of compact
objects into massive black holes in the centers of galaxies. The detection of
waves from such ""extreme mass ratio inspiral"" systems (EMRIs) and extraction of
information from those waves require template waveforms. The systems' extreme
mass ratio means that their waveforms can be determined accurately using black
hole perturbation theory. Such calculations are computationally very expensive.
There is a pressing need for families of approximate waveforms that may be
generated cheaply and quickly but which still capture the main features of true
waveforms. In this paper, we introduce a family of such ""kludge"" waveforms and
describe ways to generate them. We assess performance of the introduced
approximations by comparing ""kludge"" waveforms to accurate waveforms obtained
by solving the Teukolsky equation in the adiabatic limit (neglecting GW
backreaction). We find that the kludge waveforms do extremely well at
approximating the true gravitational waveform, having overlaps with the
Teukolsky waveforms of 95% or higher over most of the parameter space for which
comparisons can currently be made. Indeed, we find these kludges to be of such
high quality (despite their ease of calculation) that it is possible they may
play some role in the final search of LISA data for EMRIs.

and/or K's) is of interest. If experimental acceptance must be taken into
account, PHOTOS Monte Carlo is often used in experimental simulations. We will
use scalar QED to benchmark PHOTOS, even though this theory is of limited use
for complex objects. We present the analytical form of the kernel used in the
older versions of PHOTOS, and the new, exact (scalar QED) one. Matrix element
and phase-space Jacobians are separated in the final weight and future
extensions based on measurable electromagnetic form-factors are thus possible.
The massive phase-space is controlled in the the program with no
approximations. Thanks to the iterative solution all leading and next to
leading logarithmic terms are properly reproduced by the Monte Carlo
simulation. Simultaneously, full differential distributions over complete
multiple body phase-space are provided. An agreement of better than 0.01% with
independent calculations of scalar QED is demonstrated.

Several theoretical ingredients are employed: next-to-leading order initial
conditions, evolution and coefficient functions; soft-gluon resummation to
next-to-leading-log accuracy; a next-to-leading order matching condition for
the crossing of the bottom threshold in the evolution. Important initial-state
electromagnetic radiation effects in the CLEO and BELLE data are also accounted
for. We find that with reasonably simple choices of a non-perturbative
correction to the fixed-order initial condition for the evolution, the data
from CLEO and BELLE can be fitted with remarkable accuracy. The fitted
fragmentation function, when evolved to LEP energies, does not however
represent fairly the D* fragmentation spectrum measured by ALEPH. Large
non-perturbative corrections to the coefficient functions of the meson spectrum
are needed in order to reconcile CLEO/BELLE and ALEPH results.

innovation distribution in a class of stationary and ergodic time series
models. The asymptotic null distribution of the usual Kolmogorov--Smirnov test
based on the residuals generally depends on the underlying model parameters and
the error distribution. To overcome the dependence on the underlying model
parameters, we propose that tests be based on a vector of certain weighted
residual empirical processes. Under the null hypothesis and under minimal
moment conditions, this vector of processes is shown to converge weakly to a
vector of independent copies of a Gaussian process whose covariance function
depends only on the fitted distribution and not on the model. Under certain
local alternatives, the proposed test is shown to have nontrivial asymptotic
power. The Monte Carlo critical values of this test are tabulated when fitting
standard normal and double exponential distributions. The results obtained are
shown to be applicable to GARCH and ARMA--GARCH models, the often used models
in econometrics and finance. A simulation study shows that the test has
satisfactory size and power for finite samples at these models. The paper also
contains an asymptotic uniform expansion result for a general weighted residual
empirical process useful in heteroscedastic models under minimal moment
conditions, a result of independent interest.

information carrier and the clock in a computer, is studied. The information
channel capacity and the lower limit of energy requirement/dissipation are
studied in a simple digital system with zero threshold voltage, for the case of
error probability close to 0.5, when the thermal noise is equal to or greater
than the digital signal. In a simple hypothetical realization of a thermal
noise driven gate, the lower limit of energy needed to generate the digital
signal is 1.1*kT/bit. The arrangement has potentially improved energy
efficiency and it is free of leakage current, crosstalk and ground plane
electromagnetic interference problems. Disadvantage is the large number of
redundancy elements needed for low-error operation.

interacting three component Fermi gas in the continuum space using quantum
Monte Carlo techniques. Three body effects predominate in the regime of
interaction strength beyond that of threshold of the three particle bound
state. However, we find that there is an interval of the interaction strength
where the SU(2)$\otimes$U(1) broken symmetry superfluidity is possible. For a
strong enough interaction, the SU(3) symmetry is restored and the superfluidity
is suppressed. Within the interval of the broken symmetry, we also find that on
average the particle pairs belonging to the species with superfluid pairing
remain further separated than those without the superfluid pairing correlation.

regimes. The non-linear relation between the pressure drop $\Delta p$ in the
double-reed and the volume flow crossing it $q$ is measured for slow variations
of these variables. The volume flow is determined from the pressure drop in a
diaphragm replacing the instrument's bore. Measurements are compared to other
experimental results on reed instrument exciters and to physical models,
revealing that clarinet, oboe and bassoon quasi-static behavior relies on
similar working principles. Differences in the experimental results are
interpreted in terms of pressure recovery due to the conical diffuser role of
the downstream part of double-reed mouthpieces (the staple).

attention to the maximally entangled mixed states (MEMS) of each system.
Following this we investigate how efficiently one may transfer entanglement
