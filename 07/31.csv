clusters from the ESO Distant Cluster Survey (EDisCS), comprising the first
results of a planned X-ray survey of the full EDisCS high-redshift sample. The
EDisCS clusters were identified in the Las Campanas Distant Cluster Survey as
surface brightness fluctuations in the optical sky and their masses and galaxy
populations are well described by extensive photometric and spectroscopic
observations. We detect two of the three clusters in the X-ray and place a firm
upper limit on diffuse emission in the third cluster field. We are able to
constrain the X-ray luminosity and temperature of the detected clusters and
estimate their masses. We find the X-ray properties of the detected EDisCS
clusters are similar to those of X-ray-selected clusters of comparable mass and
-- unlike other high-redshift, optically-selected clusters -- are consistent
with the T - sigma and L_x - sigma relations determined from X-ray selected
clusters at low redshift. The X-ray determined mass estimates are generally
consistent with those derived from weak lensing and spectroscopic analyses.
These preliminary results suggest that the novel method of optical selection
used to construct the EDisCS catalog may, like selection by X-ray luminosity,
be well-suited for identification of relaxed, high-redshift clusters whose
intracluster medium is in place and stable by z ~ 0.8.

and discuss limitations on the attainable precision. In addition to the
intrinsic slow-down behaviour of the pulsar, tempo2 accounts for the effects of
a binary orbital motion, the secular motion of the pulsar or binary system,
interstellar, Solar system and ionospheric dispersion, observatory motion
(including Earth rotation, precession, nutation, polar motion and orbital
motion), tropospheric propagation delay, and gravitational time dilation due to
binary companions and Solar system bodies. We believe the timing model is
accurate in its description of predictable systematic timing effects to better
than one nanosecond, except in the case of relativistic binary systems where
further theoretical development is needed. The largest remaining sources of
potential error are measurement error, interstellar scattering, Solar system
ephemeris errors, atomic clock instability and gravitational waves.

aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and dust emission, studying the variations in the
colors of the dust emission, and searching for possible excess submillimeter
emission compared to what is anticipated based on dust models applied to the
mid- and far-infrared data. PAH emission at 8 micron is found to correlate best
with hot dust emission at 24 micron on kiloparsec scales, although the relation
breaks down on scales equal to hundreds of parsecs, possibly because of
differences in the mean free paths between the photons that excite the PAHs and
heat the dust and possibly because the PAHs are destroyed by the hard radiation
fields in the centers of some star formation regions. The ratio of 8 micron PAH
emission to 160 micron cool dust emission appears to be a function of radius.
The 70/160 and 160/450 micron flux density ratios are remarkably constant even
though the surface brightness varies by a factor of 25 in each wave band, which
suggests that the emission is from dust heated by a nearly-uniform radiation
field. Globally, we find an excess of 850 micron emission relative to what
would be predicted by dust models. The 850 micron excess is highest in regions
with low 160 micron surface brightness, although the strength and statistical
significance of this result depends on the model fit to the data. We rule out
variable emissivity functions or ~4 K dust as the possible origins of this 850
micron emission, but we do discuss the other possible mechanisms that could
produce the emission.

find companions at separations of 0.13"" - 1.12"" (60 - 500 AU), and detected 13
new binaries. Combined with the results of Petr (1998), we have a sample of 275
objects, about half of which have masses from the literature and high
probabilities to be cluster members. We used an improved method to derive the
completeness limits of the observations, which takes into account the elongated
point spread function of stars at relatively large distances from the adaptive
optics guide star. The multiplicity of stars with masses >2 M_sun is found to
be significantly larger than that of low-mass stars. The companion star
frequency of low-mass stars is comparable to that of main-sequence M-dwarfs,
less than half that of solar-type main-sequence stars, and 3.5 to 5 times lower

the binary frequency of low-mass stars in the periphery of the cluster to be
the same or only slightly higher than for stars in the cluster core (<3 arcmin

low binary frequency in the cluster is caused by the disruption of binaries due
to dynamical interactions. There are two ways out of this dilemma: Either the
initial binary frequency in the Orion Nebula Cluster was lower than in
Taurus-Auriga, or the Orion Nebula Cluster was originally much denser and
dynamically more active.

flux in the HI Lyman alpha forest along and transverse to the lines of sight
are in good agreement implying that the distortions in redshift space due to
peculiar velocities are small. The clustering signal is significant up to
velocity separations of ~200 km/s, or about 3 h^{-1} comoving Mpc. The regions
at lower overdensity (rho/<rho> < 6.5) are still clustered but on smaller
scales (Delta v < 100 km/s). The observed and simulated correlation functions
are compatible at the 3 sigma level. A better concordance is obtained when only
the low overdensity regions are selected for the analysis or when the effective
optical depth of the simulated spectra is increased artificially, suggesting a
deficiency of strong lines in the simulated spectra. We found that also a lower
value of the power-law index of the temperature-density relation for the Lyman

extended Hubbard models at quarter-filling, where the frustration arises from
competing charge ordered patterns favored by different intersite Coulomb
interactions, which are effective models for various charge transfer-type
molecular conductors and transition metal oxides. Two different lattice
structures are considered: (a) one-dimensional chain with intersite Coulomb
interaction of nearest neighbor V_1 and that of next-nearest neighbor V_2, and
(b) two-dimensional square lattice with V_1 along the squares and V_2 along one
of the diagonals. From previous studies, charge ordered insulating states are
known to be unstable in the frustrated region, i.e., V_1 \simeq 2V_2 for case
(a) and V_1 \simeq V_2 for case (b), resulting in a robust metallic phase even
when the interaction strenghs are strong. By applying the Lanczos exact
diagonalization to finite-size clusters, we have found that fluctuations of
different charge order patterns exist in the frustration-induced metallic
phase, showing up as characteristic low energy modes in dynamical correlation
functions. Comparison of such features between the two models are discussed,
whose difference will be ascribed to the dimensionality effect. We also point

function is measured over a large momentum transfer region, from which an

a stringent test on the validity of the theoretically calculated exciton wave

reveal that the conductance obeys a variable-range-hopping law up to an
unexpectedly high temperature of over 100 K. The symmetric dual-gate

the spatial variation of the impurity-band energy determines the hopping
conduction in transistor structures. We conclude that the emergence of the

the band bending and its change by the gate bias. Moreover, the peak structure
is found to be strongly related to the density of states (DOS) of the
phosphorus impurity band, suggesting the possibility of performing a novel

polarised Gowdy $T^3$ cosmologies are equivalent to a free scalar field
propagating in a fixed nonstationary background. Recently, a new field
parameterisation was proposed for the metric of the Gowdy spacetimes such that
the associated scalar field evolves in a flat background in 1+1 dimensions with
the spatial topology of $S^1$, although subject to a time dependent potential.
Introducing a suitable Fock quantisation for this scalar field, a quantum
theory was constructed for the Gowdy model in which the dynamics is implemented
as a unitary transformation. A question that was left open is whether one might
adopt a different, nonequivalent Fock representation by selecting a distinct
complex structure. The present work proves that the chosen Fock quantisation is
in fact unique (up to unitary equivalence) if one demands unitary
implementation of the dynamics and invariance under the group of constant $S^1$
translations. These translations are precisely those generated by the global
constraint that remains on the Gowdy model. It is also shown that the proof of
uniqueness in the choice of complex structure can be applied to more general
field dynamics than that corresponding to the Gowdy cosmologies.

earlier stages, where the simplifications used in making inspiral predictions
by the perturbative and post-Newtonian methods are more nearly correct. Current
concepts for future missions such as DECIGO and BBO would allow even more
stringent tests by this same method. Recently discovered evidence supports the

Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model is soft enough to render neutron stars (NS) unstable
at the onset of the deconfined phase, and no pure quark matter can be actually
present in its interior. Since this is a peculiarity of the NJL model, we have
studied a modified NJL model with a momentum cut-off which depends on the
density. This procedure, which improves the agreement between QCD and NJL model
at large density, modifies the standard NJL equation of state, and then it is
potentially relevant for the stability analysis of neutron stars. We show that
also within this approach, the NS instability still persists, and that the
vacuum pressure, as a signal of quark confinement, has a fundamental role for
the NS stability. In this respect, our conclusions point to a relationship
between confinement and NS stability.

level. In virtue of the quantization scheme proposed in [Talalaev04]
(hep-th/0404153) it is natural to treat the quantum Lax operator as a
connection; this connection is a particular case of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov
connection [ChervovTalalaev06] (hep-th/0604128). In this paper we find a gauge
transformation which produces the ""second normal form"" or the
""Drinfeld-Sokolov"" form. Moreover the differential operator naturally
corresponding to this form is given precisely by the quantum characteristic
polynomial [Talalaev04] of the Lax operator (this operator is called the G-oper
or Baxter equation). This observation allows to relate solutions of the KZ and
Baxter equations in an obvious way, and to prove that the immanent KZ-equations
has only meromorphic solutions. As a corollary we obtain the quantum
Cayley-Hamilton identity for the Gaudin-type Lax operators (including the
general gl(n)[t] case). The presented construction sheds a new light on a
geometric Langlands correspondence. We also discuss the relation with the
Harish-Chandra homomorphism.

the initial condition by a large constant. The resulting fluid limit is the
solution of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) in ``most'' of the state

follow from stability of the set of fluid limits. Moreover, similarly to the

concentration on lines rather than dispersion in all directions.

simple inequalities which can be solved to give minimal sample sizes needed for
various estimation goals. In several parametric examples, we verify that our

``geometrical'' factors. The former is determined by the complex adiabatic
eigenvalues E_(t), only, whereas the latter solely requires the knowledge of
\alpha_(+-)(t), the ratio of the components of each of the adiabatic

the complex level crossing points, and a nonuniversal one, involving the full

constant $\gamma$. For analytic power-law sweeps we find that Stueckelberg

disappear for gamma > gamma_c. A physical interpretation of this behavior will

Schrodinger's equation that had previously been obtained through
information-theoretic arguments. We obtain analytical expressions for the
leading correction, in terms of the nonlinearity scale, to the energy
eigenvalues of the linear Schrodinger equation in the presence of an external
potential and observe some generic features. In one space dimension these are:
(i) For nodeless ground states, the energy shifts are subleading in the
nonlinearity parameter compared to the shifts for the excited states, (ii) the
shifts for the excited states are due predominantly to contribution from the
nodes of the unperturbed wavefunctions and (iii) the energy shifts for excited
states are positive for small values of a regulating parameter and negative at
large values, vanishing at a universal critical value that is not manifest in
the equation. Some of these features hold true for higher dimensional problems.
We also study two exactly solved nonlinear Schrodinger equations so as to
contrast our observations. Finally, we comment on the possible significance of
our results if the nonlinearity is physically realised.
