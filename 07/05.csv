an orbital period of 2.4 hours, placing it within the ``period gap'' for

model of the eclipse fitted to the observed light curve by chi-squared
minimization. We obtain a mass ratio of q = 0.215 +/- 0.015 and an orbital
inclination i = 82.4 +- 0.4 degrees. The primary mass is M_w = 0.94 +/- 0.01
Msun. The secondary mass and radius are found to be Mr = 0.20 +/- 0.01 Msun and
Rr = 0.243 +/- 0.013 Rsun respectively. We find a distance to the system of 440
+/- 30 pc, and an effective temperature for the secondary star of 3800 +/- 100
K (corresponding to a spectral type of M0 +/- 0.5V). Both the distance and
effective temperature are consistent with previous values derived via
spectroscopy of the red star.
  The secondary star is significantly less massive than expected for the
orbital period, and significantly warmer than expected for its mass. This can
be explained if the secondary star is significantly evolved: the mass and
effective temperature are consistent with a secondary star that began mass
transfer with a greatly reduced central hydrogen fraction. The nature of the
secondary star in SDSS J1702+3229 supports predictions that CVs with evolved
secondary stars might be found accreting within the period gap.

visualizing the nonlinear P-L relation; (2) long period Cepheids and sample

the period-color (P-C) relation; (6) nonlinear P-L relations in different

statistical test is needed to detect the nonlinear PL relation. We then show
that sample selection, number of long period Cepheids in the sample, outlier
removal and extinction errors are unlikely to be responsible for the detection
of the nonlinear P-L relation. We also argue for the existence of a nonlinear
P-L relation from the perspective of the nonlinear P-C relation and the
non-universality of the P-L relation. Combining the evidence and discussion
from these aspects, we find that there is a strong indication that the observed
LMC P-L relation is indeed nonlinear in the optical bands (however the K-band
LMC P-L relation is apparently linear). This could be due to the internal
physical reasons or the external hidden/additional factors. Compared to the
non-linear P-L relation, the systematic error in distance scale introduced from
using the (incorrect) linear P-L relation is at most at a few per cent level.
While this is small compared to other systematic errors, it will be important
in future efforts to produce a Cepheid distance scale accurate to one per cent
in order to remove degeneracies presented in CMB results.

simulates >10^7 noisy galaxy images convolved with anisotropic PSFs, and
attempts to recover an input shear. The tests are designed to be immune to

recovery is divided into two classes, calibration (multiplicative) and

TeV $\gamma$-ray flares without simultaneous X-ray flares. In this paper we
propose a model for the ``orphan'' TeV $\gamma$-ray flares, employing an
inhomogeneous leptonic jet model. After a primary flare that accompanies
flare-up both in X-rays and TeV $\gamma$-rays, radiation propagates in various
directions in the comoving frame of the jet. When a dense region in the jet
receives the radiation, X-rays are scattered by relativistic
electrons/positrons to become TeV $\gamma$-rays. These $\gamma$-ray photons are
observed as an ``orphan'' TeV $\gamma$-ray flare. The observed delay time
between the primary and ``orphan'' flares is about two weeks and this is
accounted for in our model for parameters such as $\Gamma = 20$, $d = 4 \times
10^{17}$cm, $\alpha = 3$, and $\eta = 1$, where $\Gamma$ is the bulk Lorentz
factor of the jet, $d$ is the distance between the central black hole and the
primary flare site, $\alpha/\Gamma$ is the angle between the jet axis and the
direction of the motion of the dense region that scatters incoming X-rays

not interact with other known matters in the standard model of particle
physics. In the present work, the (generalized) Cheng-Weyl vector field coupled

mixture of the scalar field and a so-called ``cosmic triad'' of three mutually

0.05620(4) d (80.93 min), which is among the shortest for SU UMa stars with

and surrounding stars. Using a previous measurement of the superhump period, we

for Draco in the light of available observational data, we carefully model the
DM density profile, taking advantage of numerical simulations of hierarchical
structure formation. We then analyze the gamma-ray and electron/positron yield
expected for weakly interacting DM particle (WIMP) models, including an
accurate treatment of the propagation of the charged particle species. We show
that unlike in larger DM structures - such as galaxy clusters - spatial
diffusion plays here an important role. While Draco would appear as a
point-like gamma-ray source, synchrotron emission from electrons and positrons
produced by WIMP annihilations features a spatially extended structure.
Depending upon the cosmic ray propagation setup and the size of the magnetic
fields, the search for a diffuse radio emission from Draco can be a more
sensitive indirect DM search probe than gamma rays. Finally, we show that
available data are consistent with the presence of a black hole at the center
of Draco: if this is indeed the case, very significant enhancements of the
rates for gamma rays and other emissions related to DM annihilations are
expected.

set of strong-line oxygen abundance calibrations will be useful for future

metal-rich galaxies due to its independence on ionization parameter and low
scatter. Dust extinction must be considered properly at first. These
calibrations are more suitable for metal-rich galaxies (8.4<12+log(O/H)<9.3),

z~2, based on the first epoch VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey (VVDS) data.In agreement
with previous works we find that the galaxy rest-frame color distribution
follows a bimodal distribution at z<=1, and we establish that this bimodality
holds up to z~2. The details of the rest-frame color distribution depend
however on redshift and on galaxy luminosity: faint galaxies are bluer than the
luminous ones over the whole redshift range of our data, and galaxies become
bluer as redshift increases. This blueing trend does not depend, to a first
approximation, on galaxy luminosity. Using our spectroscopic dataset we can
also separate galaxies based on a star-formation, estimated combining the
equivalent width of the [OII] emission line and the strength of the Dn(4000)
break. The comparison between this spectral classification and the rest-frame
colors shows that about 35-40 % of the red objects are star forming galaxies.
Hence we conclude that the red sequence cannot be used to effectively isolate a
sample of purely passively evolving objects within a cosmological survey. We
also find that the color-magnitude relations derived for the color and for the
spectroscopically selected early-type galaxies have remarkably similar
properties, with the contaminating star-forming galaxies within the red
sequence objects introducing no significant offset in the rest frame colors.
Therefore the average color of the red objects does not appear to be a very
sensitive indicator for measuring the evolution of the early-type galaxy
population.Finally, we use the multi-band VVDS photometric data and SED fitting
to derive multi-color galaxy types, which have a slightly higher efficiency
than rest-frame color in isolating the passive, non star-forming galaxies
within the VVDS sample.

an accurate determination of the unmixing binodal. Our results show that the

insulating glasses in the temperature interval $10mK<T<50mK$ is considered. In
this temperature range, the dielectric permittivity is defined by the resonant
contribution of tunneling systems. The external magnetic field regulates
nuclear spins of tunneling atoms. This regulation suppresses a nuclear
quadrupole interaction of these spins with lattice and, thus, affects the
dielectric response of tunneling systems. It is demonstrated that in the
absence of an external magnetic field the nuclear quadrupole interaction $b$
results in the correction to the permittivity $\delta\chi\sim| b| /T$ in the
temperature range of interest. An application of a magnetic field results in a
sharp increase of this correction approximately by a factor of two when the
Zeeman splitting $m$ approaches the order of $| b| $. Further increase of the
magnetic field results in a relatively smooth decrease in the correction until
the Zeeman splitting approaches the temperature. This smooth dependence results
from tunneling accompanied by a change of the nuclear spin projection. As the
magnetic field surpasses the temperature, the correction vanishes. The results
obtained in this paper are compared with experiment. A new mechanism of the low

the reliability of the chemically-based Sorenson/Head-Gordon (SHG) model and a
standard native centric model in reproducing through molecular dynamics

cooperative, two-state, folding mechanism of the WW-domain, while the SHG model
predicts a transition occurring in two stages: a collapse followed by a
structural rearrangement. The lack of a cooperative folding in the SHG
simulations appears to be related to the non-funnel shape of the energy
landscape featuring a partitioning of the native valley in sub-basins
corresponding to different chain chiralities. However the SHG approach remains
more reliable in estimating the $\Phi$-values with respect to G\={o}-like
description. This may suggest that the WW-domain folding process is stirred by
energetic and topological factors as well, and it highlights the better
suitability of chemically-based models in simulating mutations.

systems differ from most standard glass-forming liquids. They feature arrest
that occurs at lower densities and that is stronger than would be expected for

influence of attraction increases with increasing the number of carbon atoms

XML documents by a set of their sub-paths, defined according to some criteria
(length, root beginning, leaf ending). By considering those sub-paths as words,
we can use standard methods for vocabulary reduction, and simple clustering
methods such as K-means that scale well. We actually use an implementation of
the clustering algorithm known as ""dynamic clouds"" that can work with distinct
groups of independent variables put in separate variables. This is useful in
our model since embedded sub-paths are not independent: we split potentially
dependant paths into separate variables, resulting in each of them containing
independant paths. Experiments with the INEX collections show good results for
the structure-only collections, but our approach could not scale well for large

The detection efficiency of the GCC statistic is investigated analytically,
particularly focusing on the statistical relation between the false-alarm and
the false-dismissal probabilities, and the minimum detectable amplitude of
gravitational-wave signals. We derive simple analytic formulae for these
statistical quantities. The robustness of the GCC statistic is clarified based
on these formulae, and one finds that the detection efficiency of the GCC
statistic roughly corresponds to the one of the SCC statistic neglecting the
contribution of non-Gaussian tails. This remarkable property is checked by
performing the Monte Carlo simulations and successful agreement between
analytic and simulation results was found.

the domain-wall fermion formulation, combined with non-perturbative

of a large fraction of the systematic error from the finite lattice spacing.
Our main effort is devoted to a calculation performed in the quenched
approximation, where the direct calculation of the nucleon to pseudoscalar
matrix elements, as well as the indirect estimate of them from the nucleon to
vacuum matrix elements, are performed. First results, using two flavors of
dynamical domain-wall quarks for the nucleon to vacuum matrix elements are also
presented to address the systematic error of quenching, which appears to be
small compared to the other errors. Our results suggest that the representative
value for the low energy constants from the nucleon to vacuum matrix elements
are given as |alpha| simeq |beta| simeq 0.01 GeV^3. For a more reliable
estimate of the physical low energy matrix elements, it is better to use the
relevant form factors calculated in the direct method. The direct method tends
to give smaller value of the form factors, compared to the indirect one, thus
enhancing the proton life-time; indeed for the pi^0 final state the difference
between the two methods is quite appreciable.

criterion to be maximized is expected average rewards. The transition rates of

two optimality inequalities with opposed directions, and also give suitable
conditions under which the existence of solutions to the two optimality
inequalities is ensured. Then, from the two optimality inequalities we prove
the existence of optimal (deterministic) stationary policies by using the
Dynkin formula. Moreover, we present a ``semimartingale characterization'' of
an optimal stationary policy. Finally, we use a generalized Potlach process
with control to illustrate the difference between our conditions and those in
the previous literature, and then further apply our results to average optimal
control problems of generalized birth--death systems, upwardly skip-free
processes and two queueing systems. The approach developed in this paper is

framework for homology and cohomology of modules over a ring and, in
particular, of abelian groups. For many years, a similar categorical framework
has been lacking for non-abelian (co)homology, the subject of which includes
the categories of non-abelian groups, of rings, Lie algebras, etc. The notion
of semi-abelian category due to Janelidze, Marki and Tholen allows a unified
study of many important homological properties of such categories. For
instance, in any semi-abelian category, the classical diagram lemmas (the Short
Five Lemma, the 3x3 Lemma, the Snake Lemma, Noether's Isomorphism Theorems)
hold. The point of this thesis is, that the semi-abelian framework is indeed
perfectly suited for the study of non-abelian (co)homology and the
corresponding homotopy theory. It describes the foundations for a categorical
homology theory that unifies many basic aspects of the classical (co)homology
theories of e.g., groups, Lie algebras and crossed modules. Starting from
homology of (proper) chain complexes and of simplicial objects, a semi-abelian
version of Barr-Beck cotriple homology is introduced. A systematic study of the
theory of Baer invariants in this context yields categorical versions of Hopf's
formula (describing the second homology object in terms of commutators) and the
Stallings-Stammbach sequence. We obtain a Universal Coefficient Theorem, a
version of the Hochschild-Serre sequence, and an interpretation of the second
cohomology group in terms of isomorphism classes of central extensions. Also,
Quillen model category structures for homotopy of simplicial objects and
internal categories are studied, and are shown to be compatible with the
respective semi-abelian notions of homology.

derived by keeping the zeroth order term in a Taylor expansion of the memory
integrand in the Mori-Zwanzig formalism. We present here a collection of models
for the Euler equations which are based also on the Mori-Zwanzig formalism. The
models arise from a Taylor expansion of a different operator, the orthogonal
dynamics evolution operator, which appears in the memory integrand. The zero,
first and second order models are constructed and simulated numerically. The
form of the nonlinearity in the Euler equations, the special properties of the
projection operator used and the general properties of any projection operator
can be exploited to facilitate the recursive calculation of even higher order
models. We use our models to compute the rate of energy decay for the
Taylor-Green vortex problem. The results are in good agreement with the
theoretical estimates. The energy decay appears to be organized in ""waves"" of
activity, i.e. alternating periods of fast and slow decay. Our results
corroborate the assumption in \cite{CHSS06}, that the modeling of the 3D Euler
equations by a few low wavenumber modes should include a long memory.

that our formulas are fast and easy to evaluate numerically.

important new technique for lower bounding the mixing time of a Markov chain.
In this paper we extend Wilson's technique to find lower bounds of the correct
order for card shuffling Markov chains where at each time step a random card is
picked and put at the top of the deck. Two classes of such shuffles are
addressed, one where the probability that a given card is picked at a given
time step depends on its identity, the so-called move-to-front scheme, and one
where it depends on its position. For the move-to-front scheme, a test function
that is a combination of several different eigenvectors of the transition
matrix is used. A general method for finding and using such a test function,
under a natural negative dependence condition, is introduced. It is shown that
the correct order of the mixing time is given by the biased coupon collector's
problem corresponding to the move-to-front scheme at hand. For the second
class, a version of Wilson's technique for complex-valued
eigenvalues/eigenvectors is used. Such variants were presented in [Random Walks
and Geometry (2004) 515--532] and [Electron. Comm. Probab. 8 (2003) 77--85].
Here we present another such variant which seems to be the most natural one for
this particular class of problems. To find the eigenvalues for the general case
of the second class of problems is difficult, so we restrict attention to two
special cases. In the first case the card that is moved to the top is picked
uniformly at random from the bottom $k=k(n)=o(n)$ cards, and we find the lower
bound $(n^3/(4\pi^2k(k-1)))\log n$. Via a coupling, an upper bound exceeding
this by only a factor 4 is found. This generalizes Wilson's [Electron. Comm.
Probab. 8 (2003) 77--85] result on the Rudvalis shuffle and Goel's [Ann. Appl.
Probab. 16 (2006) 30--55] result on top-to-bottom shuffles. In the second case
the card moved to the top is, with probability 1/2, the bottom card and with
probability 1/2, the card at position $n-k$. Here the lower bound is again of
order $(n^3/k^2)\log n$, but in this case this does not seem to be tight unless
$k=O(1)$. What the correct order of mixing is in this case is an open question.
We show that when $k=n/2$, it is at least $\Theta(n^2)$.

curves from ensembles of emitters, such as semiconductor quantum dots, with the
aim to interpret ubiquitous non-single-exponential decay. Contrary to what is
widely assumed, the density of excited emitters and the intensity in an
emission decay curve are not proportional, but the density is a time-integral
of the intensity. The integral relation is crucial to correctly interpret
non-single-exponential decay. We derive the proper normalization for both a
discrete, and a continuous distribution of rates, where every decay component
is multiplied with its radiative decay rate. A central result of our paper is
the derivation of the emission decay curve in case that both radiative and
non-radiative decays are independently distributed. In this case, the
well-known emission quantum efficiency can not be expressed by a single number
anymore, but it is also distributed. We derive a practical description of
non-single-exponential emission decay curves in terms of a single distribution
of decay rates; the resulting distribution is identified as the distribution of
total decay rates weighted with the radiative rates. We apply our analysis to
recent examples of colloidal quantum dot emission in suspensions and in
photonic crystals, and we find that this important class of emitters is well
described by a log-normal distribution of decay rates with a narrow and a broad
distribution, respectively. Finally, we briefly discuss the Kohlrausch
stretched-exponential model, and find that its normalization is ill-defined for
emitters with a realistic quantum efficiency of less than 100 %.

The authors discovered that total concentration of seven amino acids in

explore the conditions under which temporal differentiation leads to optimized

different subtasks associated with performing a given task are done at
different times. The idea is that, by focusing on one particular set of
subtasks at a time, it is possible to increase the efficiency with which each
subtask is performed, thereby allowing for faster completion of the overall
task. For this paper, we consider a process whereby some resource is converted
into some final product in a series of three agent-mediated steps. Temporal
differentiation is incorporated by allowing the agents to oscillate between
performing the first two steps and performing the last step. We find that
temporal differentiation is favored when the number of agents is small, and
when the process intermediates have a much longer lifetime than the original
resource. Within the framework of biological systems, we argue that these
results provide a possible evolutionary basis for the emergence of sleep, and
also of distinct REM and non-REM sleep states. We also discuss our use of a
three-step model. Briefly, in order for temporal differentiation to increase
product output in a mean-field description of resource metabolism, it is
necessary for temporal differentiation to have a nonlinear effect on individual
process rates. For stochastic models, we argue that temporal differentiation
can increase product output even in fundamentally linear systems.

operons is driven by the benefits of coordinated gene expression and
regulation. Direct evidence that co-expression increases the individual's
fitness enough to ensure operon formation and maintenance is, however, still
lacking. Here, a previously described quantitative model of the network that
controls the transcription factor sigmaF during sporulation in Bacillus
subtilis is employed to quantify the benefits arising from both organisation of
the sporulation genes into the spoIIA operon and from translational coupling.
The analysis shows that operon organization, together with translational
coupling, is important because of the inherent stochastic nature of gene
expression which skews the ratios between protein concentrations in the absence
of co- regulation. The predicted impact of different forms of gene regulation

appear due to interference between polaritonic wave packets of different group
velocities.

Hilbert space to be indecomposable. We show that this criterion can be applied
to two families of positive maps. These families of maps can then be used to
form separability criteria for bipartite quantum states that can detect the
entanglement of bound entangled quantum states.

atomic quantum memory generated by Raman scattering of a laser pulse, can be
emitted deterministically at a time-delay in control. It is shown that
production rate of single photons can be enhanced by a feedback circuit
considerably while the single-photon quality is conserved. Thus our present
single-photon source is well suitable for future large-scale realization of
quantum communication and linear optical quantum computation.

vacuum state through the application of an electric field.
