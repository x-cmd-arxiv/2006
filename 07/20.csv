semi-analytical galaxy formation model based on Lambda-CDM proposed by Baugh et
al. (2005). Our black hole model has one free parameter, which we set by
matching the observed zeropoint of the local correlation between black hole
mass and bulge luminosity. We present predictions for the evolution with
redshift of the relationships between black hole mass and bulge properties. Our
simulations reproduce the evolution of the optical luminosity function of
quasars. We study the demographics of the black hole population and address the
issue of how black holes acquire their mass. We find that the direct accretion
of cold gas during starbursts is an important growth mechanism for lower mass
black holes and at high redshift. On the other hand, the re-assembly of
pre-existing black hole mass into larger units via merging dominates the growth
of more massive black holes at low redshift. This prediction could be tested by
future gravitational wave experiments. As redshift decreases, progressively
less massive black holes have the highest fractional growth rates, in line with
recent claims of ""downsizing"" in quasar activity.

either a supermassive black hole (SMBH) or a compact stellar nucleus,
regardless of the galaxy mass or morphological type, and that there is a tight
relation between the masses of CMOs and those of the host galaxies. Several
recent studies show that feedback from black holes can successfully explain the
$\msigma$ correlation in massive elliptical galaxies that contain SMBHs.
However, puzzles remain in spirals or dwarf spheroids that do not appear to
have black holes but instead harbor a compact central stellar cluster. Here we
use three-dimensional, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of isolated
galaxies to study the formation and evolution of CMOs in bulgeless disk
galaxies, and simulations of merging galaxies to study the transition of the
CMO--host mass relation from late-type bulgeless spirals to early-type
ellipticals. Our results suggest that the observed correlations may be
established primarily by the depletion of gas in the central region by
accretion and star-formation, and may hold for all galaxy types. A systematic
search for CMOs in the nuclei of bulgeless disk galaxies would offer a test of

dissipationless mergers. The increased rotation speed of dissipational remnants
owes its origin to star formation that occurs in the central regions during the
galaxy merger. We have further quantified the anisotropy, three-dimensional
shape, minor axis rotation, and isophotal shape of each merger remnant, finding
that dissipational remnants are more isotropic, closer to oblate, have the
majority of their rotation along their major axis, and are more disky than
dissipationless remnants. Individual remnants display a wide variety of
kinematic properties. A large fraction of the dissipational remnants are oblate
isotropic rotators. Many dissipational, and all of the dissipationless, are
slowly rotating and anisotropic. The remnants of gas-rich major mergers can
well-reproduce the observed distribution of projected ellipticities, rotation

(HVS) in the centre of the Milky Way due to inspiralling intermediate-mass
black holes (IMBHs). We considered IMBHs of different masses, all starting from
circular orbits at an initial distance of 0.1 pc.
  We find that the IMBHs sink to the centre of the Galaxy due to dynamical
friction, where they deplete the central cusp of stars. Some of these stars
become HVS and are ejected with velocities sufficiently high to escape the
Galaxy. Since the HVS carry with them information about their origin, in
particular in the moment of ejection, the velocity distribution and the
direction in which they escape the Galaxy, detecting a population of HVS will
provide insight in the ejection processes and could therefore provide indirect
evidence for the existence of IMBHs.
  Our simulations show that HVS are generated in short bursts which last only a
few Myrs until the IMBH is swallowed by the supermassive black hole (SMBH). HVS
are ejected almost isotropically, which makes IMBH induced ejections hard to
distinguish from ejections due to encounters of stellar binaries with a SMBH.
After the HVS have reached the galactic halo, their escape velocities correlate
with the distance from the Galactic centre in the sense that the fastest HVS
can be found furthest away from the centre. The velocity distribution of HVS
generated by inspiralling IMBHs is also nearly independent of the mass of the
IMBH and can be quite distinct from one generated by binary encounters.
  Finally, our simulations show that the presence of an IMBH in the Galactic
centre changes the stellar density distribution inside r<0.02 pc into a core
profile, which takes at least 100 Myrs to replenish.

evolution of very massive stars. Giant eruptions of Luminous Blue Variables
(LBVs) like the 19th century event of eta Carinae can remove large quantities
of mass almost instantaneously, making them significant in stellar evolution.
They can potentially remove much more mass from the star than line-driven
winds, especially if stellar winds are highly clumped such that previous
estimates of O star mass-loss rates need to be revised downward. When seen in
other galaxies as ``supernova impostors'', these LBV eruptions typically last
for less than a decade, and they can remove of order 10 Msun as indicated by
massive nebulae around LBVs. Such extreme mass-loss rates cannot be driven by
radiation pressure on spectral lines, because the lines will completely
saturate during the events. Instead, these outbursts must either be
continuum-driven super-Eddington winds or outright hydrodynamic explosions,
both of which are insensitive to metallicity. As such, this eruptive mode of
mass loss could also play a pivotal role in the evolution and ultimate fate of
massive metal-poor stars in the early universe. If they occur in these
Population III stars, such eruptions would also profoundly affect the chemical
yield and types of remnants from early supernovae and hypernovae thought to be
the origin of long gamma ray bursts.

density perturbations exhibit scale dependent runaway growth at late times and,
in particular, a mode of a given wavenumber goes nonlinear at a higher redshift

40--70%. In each simulation about three neutron stars become members of close
binaries with a main-sequence companion. Such a binary will eventually become
an x-ray binary, when the main-sequence star starts to fill its Roche lobe.
Black holes are found more frequently in binaries; in each simulated cluster we
find about 11 potential x-ray binaries containing a black hole. Abstract

  Aims. In the last paper of this series we study the effects of the magnetic
field, varying its strength and orientation, on the model atmosphere structure,
the energy distribution, photometric colors and the hydrogen Balmer line
profiles. We compare with the previous results for an isotropic case in order
to understand whether there is a clear relation between the value of the
magnetic field angle and model changes, and to study how important the
additional orientational information is. Also, we examine the probable
explanation of the visual flux depressions of the magnetic chemically peculiar
stars in the context of this work.
  Methods. We calculated one more grid of the model atmospheres of magnetic A
and B stars for different effective temperatures (Teff=8000K, 11000K, 15000K),
magnetic field strengths (B=0, 5, 10, 40 kG) and various angles of the magnetic
field (Omega=0-90 degr) with respect to the atmosphere plane. We used the
LLmodels code which implements a direct method for line opacity calculation,
anomalous Zeeman splitting of spectral lines, and polarized radiation transfer.
  Results. We have not found significant changes in model atmosphere structure,
photometric and spectroscopic observables or profiles of hydrogen Balmer lines
as we vary the magnetic field inclination angle Omega. The strength of the
magnetic field plays the main role in magnetic line blanketing. We show that
the magnetic field has a clear relation to the visual flux depressions of the
magnetic CP stars.
  Conclusions. See abstract in the paper.

linear and non-linear regimes. Results of several recent studies show that
dissipationless simulations with a simple, non-parametric model for the
relation between halo circular velocity and luminosity of the galaxy they host
predict the shape, amplitude, and luminosity dependence of the two-point
correlation function in excellent agreement with the observed galaxy clustering
in the SDSS data at z~0 and in the DEEP2 samples at z~1 over the entire probed
range of projected separations. In particular, the small-scale upturn of the
correlation function from the power-law form in the SDSS and DEEP2
luminosity-selected samples is reproduced very well. At z~3-5, predictions also
match the observed shape and amplitude of the angular two-point correlation
function of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) on both large and small scales,
including the theoretically predicted strong upturn at small scales. This
suggests that, like galaxies in lower redshift samples, the LBGs are fair
tracers of the overall halo population and that their luminosity is tightly
correlated with the circular velocity (and hence mass) of their dark matter
halos.

independent modes, we assign the relatively growing/decaying one in an
expanding phase as the C/d-mode. In the collapsing phase, the roles are
reversed, and the C/d-mode is relatively decaying/growing. The analytic
solution shows that, as long as the large scale and the adiabatic conditions
are met, the C- and d-modes preserve their nature throughout the bounce. Here,
by using a concrete nonsingular bouncing world model based on two scalar

d-modes which preserve their nature through the bounce, thus confirming our
previous anticipation based on the analytic solution. Thus, while the
large-scale condition is satisfied and the adiabatic condition is met during

matched sample of DR4 and 2MASS, in which the photometric aperture mismatch
between these two surveys is carefully corrected. It is shown that, after
correcting the dust attenuation, the optical colors for faint galaxies (i.e.
$M_r > -21$) have very weak correlation with the luminosity, while the optical
colors for bright galaxies (i.e. $M_r < -21$) are redder for more luminous
galaxies. All (optical, optical-infrared and infrared) colors show similar but
stronger correlations with stellar mass than with absolute magnitude. The
optical colors correlate more strongly with stellar mass surface density than
with stellar mass, while optical-infrared and infrared colors show stronger
correlations with stellar mass. By comparing the observed colors of our sample
galaxies with the colors predicted by stellar population synthesis model, we
find that massive late-type galaxies have older and higher metallicity stellar
population than less massive galaxies. This suggests that CMRs for late-type

metallicity. Moreover, our results suggest that the stellar mean metallicity of
late-type galaxy is mainly determined by its stellar mass, while the star
formation history is mainly regulated by the stellar mass surface density.

focused on sources that have coalesced into a single nucleus. The stellar
kinematics, extracted from the CO ro-vibrational bandheads in our spectra,
indicate that ULIRG remnants are dynamically heated systems with a mean
dispersion of 161 km/s. The combination of kinematic, structural, and
photometric properties of the remnants indicate that they mostly originate from
major mergers and that they result in the formation of systems supported by
random motions, therefore, elliptical galaxies. The peak of the velocity
dispersion distribution and the locus of ULIRGs on the fundamental plane of
early-type galaxies indicate that the end products of ultraluminous mergers are
typically moderate-mass ellipticals (of stellar mass ~10^10 - 10^11 M_sun).
Converting the host dispersion into black hole mass with the aid of the
M_BH-sigma relation yields black hole mass estimates of the order 10^7 - 10^8

contamination in cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy observations at
angular scales $\theta \gsim 1^\circ$ and frequencies $\nu \lsim 70$ GHz. The
accurate understanding of its polarization properties is crucial to extract the
cosmological information contained in the CMB polarization anisotropy. Radio
surveys at $\nu \sim 1$ GHz offer the unique opportunity to study Galactic
synchrotron emission where it represents the dominant component, possibly
except for regions close to the Galactic plane where free-free emission is also
important. We review the observational status of Galactic radio surveys at
scales $\theta \gsim 0.5^\circ$. Leiden surveys, thanks to their frequency
coverage from 0.408 GHz to 1.411 GHz, still remain of fundamental importance
for the comprehension of depolarization phenomena. Recent surveys at 1.42 GHz
(in both total intensity and polarization) with a better sensitivity and sky
sampling now cover both celestial hemispheres and allow to accurately map the
correlation properties of the diffuse synchrotron emission. We present an
analysis of these surveys in terms of angular power spectrum. A comparison of a
simple frequency extrapolation of these results with the recent WMAP results
shows that we are close to map the bulk of the diffuse synchrotron polarization
fluctuations and to understand the corresponding implications for CMB
experiments.

the supermassive black hole in the Galactic centre could form a population
observationally similar to the so-called Sgr A* cluster or `S' stars, which
have close eccentric orbits around the hole. We model the evolution of such
stars, and show that the more luminous end of the population may indeed appear
similar to young B stars within the observational limits of the Galactic Centre
region. Whether some or all of these cluster stars can be accounted for in this
manner depends strongly on the assumed IMF of the loss cone stars and the
scattering rate. If most of the observed stars are in fact scattered from the
Galactic Centre inner cusp region itself then the population of ~20 to current
observational limits may be reproduced. However, this only works if the local
relaxation time is small and relies on the cusp stars themselves being young,
i.e. it is dependent on some star formation being possible in the central few
parsecs. Conversely, we obtain a possible constraint on the tidal stripping
rate of `normal'-IMF stars if there are not to be red stars visible in the Sgr
A* cluster.

spectral decay properties with superimposed variability of this high redshift
burst. Five telescopes were used to study the decaying afterglow of GRB 050730
in the B, V, r', R, i', I, J and K photometric pass bands. A spectral energy
distribution was constructed at 2.9 hours post-burst in the K, J, I, R, V and B

the afterglow evolution at higher energies. The early afterglow shows
variability at early times and shows a steepening at ~0.1 days (8.6 ks) in the
B, V, r', R, i', I, J and K passbands. The early afterglow light curve decayed
with alpha_1 = -0.60+/-0.07 and alpha_2 = -1.71+/-0.06 based on R and I band
data. A millimeter detection of the afterglow around 3 days after the burst
shows an excess in comparison to predictions. The early X-ray light curve
observed by Swift is complex and contains flares. At late times the X-ray light
curve can be fit by a powerlaw alpha_x = -2.5+/-0.15 which is steeper than the
optical light curve. A spectral energy distribution (SED) was constructed at
\~2.9 hours after the burst. An electron energy index, p, of ~ 2.3 was
calculated using the SED and the photon index from the X-ray afterglow spectra

within 2\deg of one another. We estimate that the globular cluster lies at a
total distance of 175+/-55 kpc from M31, making it the farthest M31 globular
cluster known. It also shows the typical characteristics of a bright globular
cluster, with a half-light radius of 2.3+/-0.2 pc and an absolute magnitude in
the V band of M_{V,0}=-8.5+/-0.3 and contains a very old population with a
metallicity of [Fe/H]~-1.3. The three dwarf galaxies are all very faint, with
absolute magnitudes in the range -7.3<M_{V,0}<-6.4, and show strikingly similar
characteristics with metallicities of [Fe/H]~-1.4 and half-light radii of
\~120+/-45 pc, making these dwarf galaxies two to three times smaller than the
smallest previously known satellites of M31. We estimate them to be between 740

estimate that up to 45+/-20 satellites brighter than M_V~-6.5 should be
orbiting M31. Hence faint dwarf galaxies cannot alone account for the missing
satellites that are predicted by $\Lambda$CDM models, unless they reside in

detected by INTEGRAL indicate that although there is little difference between
the spectral slopes of the different sub-types, intermediate polars may be
considerably more luminous than polars in the soft gamma-ray regime. We also
present the detection of an unusual high-energy burst from V1223 Sgr discovered

in quantum mechanics. Its solution yields total transparency (100% tunneling)
at discrete energies. This dramatic phenomenon results from coherent
interference among many trajectories, and it is the basis of transport through
periodic structures. Resonant tunneling of electrons is commonly seen in
semiconducting 'quantum dots'. Here we demonstrate that detecting
(distinguishing) electron trajectories in a quantum dot (QD) renders the QD
nearly insulating. We couple trajectories in the QD to a 'detector' by
employing edge channels in the integer quantum Hall regime. That is, we couple
electrons tunneling through an inner channel to electrons in the neighboring
outer, 'detector' channel. A small bias applied to the detector channel
suffices to dephase (quench) the resonant tunneling completely. We derive a
formula for dephasing that agrees well with our data and implies that just a
few electrons passing through the detector channel suffice to dephase the QD
completely. This basic experiment shows how path detection in a QD induces a
transition from delocalization (due to coherent tunneling) to localization
(sequential tunneling).

transition at finite curvature coefficient \alpha, and moreover that the order
of the transition remains unchanged even when L is enlarged such that the
surfaces become sufficiently oblong. This is in sharp contrast to the known
results of the same model on tethered surfaces, where the transition weakens to
a second-order one as L is increased. The phase transition of the model in this
paper separates the smooth phase from the crumpled phase. The surfaces become
string-like between two point-boundaries in the crumpled phase. On the
contrary, we can see a spherical lump on the oblong surfaces in the smooth
phase. The string tension was calculated and was found to have a jump at the
transition point. The value of \sigma is independent of L in the smooth phase,
while it increases with increasing L in the crumpled phase. This behavior of
\sigma is consistent with the observed scaling relation \sigma \sim (2L/N)^\nu,

purpose is to discuss to what extent logical learning settings have to be

interested in extending the learning from interpretations setting introduced by

propositional (or attribute-value) concept learning from examples framework. We
are inspired here by ideas presented by H. Hirsh in a work extending the
Version space inductive paradigm to incomplete data. H. Hirsh proposes to
slightly modify the notion of solution when dealing with incomplete examples: a
solution has to be a hypothesis compatible with all pieces of information
concerning the examples. We identify two main classes of incompleteness. First,
uncertainty deals with our state of knowledge concerning an example. Second,
generalization (or abstraction) deals with what part of the description of the
example is sufficient for the learning purpose. These two main sources of
incompleteness can be mixed up when only part of the useful information is
known. We discuss a general learning setting, referred to as ""learning from
possibilities"" that formalizes these ideas, then we present a more specific
learning setting, referred to as ""assumption-based learning"" that cope with
examples which uncertainty can be reduced when considering contextual
information outside of the proper description of the examples. Assumption-based
learning is illustrated on a recent work concerning the prediction of a
consensus secondary structure common to a set of RNA sequences.

as solutions black-hole BTZ-like geometries, particle-like geometries as well

opens a wide perspective for higher gauge theory to be tested and understood in
a relevant gravitational context. Additionally, it offers the possibility of

Inhomogeneities and spatial averaging, through this spatial curvature
correction term, can have a very significant dynamical effect on the dynamics
of the Universe and cosmological observations; in particular, we discuss
whether spatial averaging might lead to a more conservative explanation of the
observed acceleration of the Universe (without the introduction of exotic dark
matter fields). We also find that the correlation tensor for a non-FLRW

anisotropic fluid. This may lead to interesting effects of averaging on
astrophysical scales. We also discuss the results of averaging an inhomogeneous

The divergence of $\chi_t$ in these models is traced to the presence of small
instantons with a radius of order $a$ (= lattice spacing), which are directly
observed on the lattice. The observation of these small instantons provides
detailed confirmation of L\""{u}scher's argument that such short-distance
excitations, with quantized topological charge, should be the dominant
topological fluctuations in $CP^1$ and $CP^2$, leading to a divergent
topological susceptibility in the continuum limit. For the $\CP$ models with
$N>3$ the topological susceptibility is observed to scale properly with the
mass gap. These larger $N$ models are not dominated by instantons, but rather
by coherent, one-dimensional regions of topological charge which can be
interpreted as domain wall or Wilson line excitations and are analogous to
D-brane or ``Wilson bag'' excitations in QCD. In Lorentz gauge, the small
instantons and Wilson line excitations can be described, respectively, in terms
of poles and cuts of an analytic gauge potential.

kinematical variables. We review the traditional methods of calculating the
hadronic tensor, expansion in $\alpha_s$ and HQET, and discuss their
shortcomings. In the kinematical region relevant for experiment (""shape

$1/m_b$, as a product of calculable hard functions and a convolution of
calculable jet functions with non perturbative shape functions. Using SCET, we
calculate the leading order hard and jet function to first order in $\alpha_s$.
Large logarithms are resummed in RGE improved perturbation theory. Local OPE is
used to relate moments of the renormalized shape function to HQET parameters,
defined in the ""shape function scheme"". Beyond leading order in $1/m_b$,
several subleading shape functions arise. We derive them at tree level, where
they can be expressed as forward matrix elements of bi-local light-cone
operators. Based on these theoretical calculations we present two applications.

effect does not decouple for an arbitrarily high mass of the hair-providing

show that in five dimensions such a black hole can be interpreted as a string

it. For the compactification on a translation-invariant circle, this
substructure uncovers hidden flux conservation and quantization of the monopole
charges, which constrain the quantum hair of the resulting four-dimensional
black hole. For the spin-2 quantum hair this result is somewhat unexpected,
since the constituent `magnetic' charges have no `electric' counterparts.
Nevertheless, the information about their quantization is encoded in

operators satisfying the so called weak Weyl relation with the unitary groups

irreversible because they admit Lyapounov operators as functions of the time
operator. For quantum systems selfadjoint time operators are defined in the
same way or as dilations of symmetric ones dealing with the time-energy
uncertainty relation, times of occurrence or survival probabilities. This work
tackles the question of the existence of selfadjoint time operators on the
basis of the Halmos-Helson theory of invariant subspaces, the Sz.-Nagy-Foias
dilation theory and the Misra-Prigogine-Courbage theory of irreversibility. It
is shown that the existence of a selfadjoint time operator for a unitary

the existence of a simply invariant subspace or a rigid operator-valued
function for its Sz.-Nagy-Foias functional model. An extensive set of

built out of functions associated with a special solution of the P_I^2

to prove our result, we use the well-known connection between the eigenvalue
correlation kernel and the Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problem for orthogonal

the RH problem asymptotically. The key step in the asymptotic analysis will be
the construction of a parametrix near the singular endpoint, for which we use
the model RH problem for the special solution of the P_I^2 equation.
  In addition, the RH method allows us to determine the asymptotics (in a
double scaling limit) of the recurrence coefficients of the orthogonal
polynomials with respect to the varying weights e^{-nV_{s,t}} on \mathbb{R}.
The special solution of the P_I^2 equation pops up in the n^{-2/7}-term of the

working to exploit the analogy between the f-vector of faces in each dimension
and the alpha-vector of angle sums. The Gram and Perles relations on the
$\alpha$-vector are analogous to the Euler and Dehn-Sommerville relations on
the f-vector. First we describe the spaces spanned by the the alpha-vector and
the $\alpha$-f-vectors of certain classes of polytopes. Families of polytopes
are constructed whose angle sums span the spaces of polytopes defined by the
Gram and Perles equations. This shows that the dimension of the affine span of
the space of angle sums of simplices is floor[(d-1)/2], and that of the
combined angle sums and face numbers of simplicial polytopes and general
polytopes are d-1 and 2d-3, respectively. Next we consider angle sums of
polytopal complexes. We define the angle characteristic on the alpha-vector in
analogy to the Euler characteristic. We show that the changes in the two
correspond and that, in the case of certain odd-dimensional polytopal
complexes, the angle characteristic is half the Euler characteristic. Finally,
we consider spherical and hyperbolic polytopes and polytopal complexes.
Spherical and hyperbolic analogs of the Gram relation and a spherical analog of
the Perles relation are known, and we show the hyperbolic analog of the Perles
relations in a number of cases. Proving this relation for simplices of
dimension greater than 3 would finish the proof of this result. Also, we show
how constructions on spherical and hyperbolic polytopes lead to corresponding
changes in the angle characteristic and Euler characteristic.

theorem states that if the dimension of V is more than twice the embedding
dimension of M, the Taylor tower in the sense of orthogonal calculus

experimental results via microwave susceptibility. In this paper, an optimised
computation of this microwave susceptibility for large meshes is proposed. The
microwave susceptibility is obtained by linearisation of the Landau and
Lifchitz equations near equilibrium states and the linear systems to be solved
are very ill-conditionned. Solutions are computed using the Conjugate Gradient
method for the Normal equation (CGN Method). An efficient preconditioner is
developed consisting of a projection and an approximation of an ``exact''
preconditioner in the set of circulant matrices. Control of the condition
number due to the preconditioning and evolution of the singular value
decomposition are shown in the results.

particular cases where the exact distribution of the zero set turns out to
belong to an important class of point processes known as determinantal point

high-sensitive underground experiments. Therefore, when scheduling a delicate
underground measurements one needs to measure neutron background. Deep
underground the most significant source of neutrons are the U-Th natural
radioactive chains giving a fission spectrum with the temperature of 2-3 MeV.
Another source is the U-Th alpha-reactions on light nuclei of mine rock giving
neutrons with different spectra in the 1-15 MeV energy region. Normal basalt
mine rocks contain 1 ppm g/g of U-238 and less. Deep underground those rocks
produce natural neutron fluxes of 10^{-7} - 10^{-6} cm^{-2}s^{-1} above 1 MeV.
To measure such a background one needs a special techniques. In the Institute
for Nuclear Research, Moscow, the neutron spectrometer was developed and built
which is sensitive to such a low neutron fluxes. At the end of 2001 the
collection of neutron data at the Pyhasalmi mine was started for the CUPP
project. During 2002 the background and rough energy spectra of neutron at
underground levels 410, 660, 990 and 1410 m were measured. The result of the

energy of eight A=48 nuclei is reasonably described with an effective
Hamiltonian derived from the CD-Bonn interaction while there is an overall
underbinding by about 0.4 MeV/nucleon. However, the resulting spectra exhibit
deficiencies that are anticipated due to: (1) basis space limitations and/or
the absence of effective many-body interactions; and, (2) the absence of
genuine three-nucleon interactions. We then introduce additive
isospin-dependent central terms plus a tensor force to our Hamiltonian and
achieve accurate binding energies and reasonable spectra for all three nuclei.

Stochastic Volatility models to describe the conditional correlations between

structure of the conditional covariance matrix. Specifications with zero,
constant and time-varying conditional correlations are taken into account. As
an example we study trivariate volatility models for the daily log returns on
the WIG, SP500, and FTSE100 indexes. In order to formally compare the relative
explanatory power of SV specifications we use the Bayesian principles of
comparing statistic models. Our results are based on the Bayes factors and
implemented through Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. The results indicate
that the most adequate specifications are those that allow for time-varying
conditional correlations and that have as many latent processes as there are
conditional variances and covariances. The empirical results clearly show that
the data strongly reject the assumption of constant conditional correlations.

  M. Sch\""urmann and U. Franz, (2005) 428--447",,,"quant-ph math-ph math.MP",,"  The white noise approach to the investigation of the dynamics of a quantum
particle interacting with a dilute and in general non-equilibrium gaseous
environment in the low density limit is outlined. The low density limit is the
kinetic Markovian regime when only pair collisions (i.e., collisions of the
test particle with one particle of the gas at one time moment) contribute to
the dynamics. In the white noise approach one first proves that the appropriate
operators describing the gas converge in the sense of appropriate matrix
elements to certain operators of quantum white noise. Then these white noise
operators are used to derive quantum white noise and quantum stochastic
equations describing the approximate dynamics of the total system consisting of
the particle and the gas. The derivation is given ab initio, starting from the
exact microscopic quantum dynamics. The limiting dynamics is described by a
quantum stochastic equation driven by a quantum Poisson process. This equation
then applied to the derivation of quantum Langevin equation and linear
Boltzmann equation for the reduced density matrix of the test particle. The
first part of the paper describes the approach which was developed by L.
Accardi, I.V. Volovich and the author and uses the Fock-antiFock (or GNS)
representation for the CCR algebra of the gas. The second part presents the
approach to the derivation of the limiting equations directly in terms of the
correlation functions, without use of the Fock-antiFock representation. This
approach simplifies the derivation and allows to express the strength of the
quantum number process directly in terms of the one-particle $S$-matrix.

the lowest-order wave function of a dimensional perturbation theory (DPT)
treatment for the N-body quantum-confined system. Taking advantage of the
symmetry of the zeroth-order configuration, we use group theoretic techniques
and the FG matrix method from quantum chemistry to obtain analytic results for
frequencies and normal modes. This method directly accounts for each two-body
interaction, rather than an average interaction so that even lowest-order
results include beyond-mean-field effects. It is thus appropriate for the study
of both weakly and strongly interacting systems and the transition between
them. While previous work has focused on energies, lowest-order wave functions
yield important information such as the nature of excitations and expectation
values of physical observables at low orders including density profiles. Higher
orders in DPT also require as input the zeroth-order wave functions. In the
earlier paper we presented a program for calculating the analytic normal-mode
coordinates of the large-D system and illustrated the procedure by deriving the
two simplest normal modes. In this paper we complete this analysis by deriving
the remaining, and more complex, normal coordinates of the system.

mechanically, lead to different semiclassical limits. We show that the
semiclassical limit of the coherent state propagator in Weyl representation is

width. This propagator is also free from the phase corrections found in
\cite{Bar01} for the two Klauder forms and provides an explicit connection

The structure is visualised due to the spreading of the two-photon amplitude as
two-photon light propagates through optical fibre with group-velocity
dispersion (GVD). Because of the spreading, polarization-entangled Bell states
can be obtained without any birefringence compensation at the output of the
nonlinear crystal; instead, proper time selection of the intensity correlation
function is required. A birefringent material inserted at the output of the
nonlinear crystal (either reducing the initial o-e delay between the oppositely
polarized twin photons or increasing this delay) leads to a more complicated
interference structure of the correlation function.
