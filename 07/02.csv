been observed with the ACIS detector on board the Chandra X-ray Observatory. We
detect 117 X-ray sources, of which ~50-60 are likely members of the young open
cluster Trumpler~37 dispersed throughout the HII region, and 25 are associated
with young stars formed within the globule. Spitzer/2MASS photometry shows the
X-ray population is very young: 3 older Class III stars, 16 classical T Tauri
stars, 6 protostars including a Class 0/I system. We infer a total T Tauri
population of ~30 stars in the globule, including the undetected population,
with a star formation efficiency of 1-4%. An elongated source spatial
distribution with an age gradient oriented towards the exciting star is
discovered in the X-ray population of IC 1396N, supporting similar findings in
other cometary globules. The geometric and age distribution is consistent with
the RDI model for triggered star formation in CGs by HII region shocks. The
inferred velocity of the shock front propagating into the globule is ~0.6km/s.
The large number of X-ray-luminous protostars in the globule suggests either an
unusually high ratio of Class I/0 vs. Class II/III stars, or a non-standard IMF
favoring higher mass stars by the triggering process. The Chandra source
associated with the luminous Class 0/I protostar IRAS 21391+5802 is one of the
youngest stars ever detected in the X-ray band. We also establish for the first
time that the X-ray absorption in protostars arises from the local infalling
envelopes rather than ambient molecular cloud material.

out to study the critical behavior in a submonolayer lattice-gas of interacting

each nanotube or unit cell is represented by a one-dimensional array. Two kinds
of lateral interaction energies have been considered: $1)$ $w_L$, interaction
energy between nearest-neighbor particles adsorbed along a single channel and
$2)$ $w_T$, interaction energy between particles adsorbed across
nearest-neighbor channels. For $w_L/w_T=0$ and $w_T > 0$, successive planes are
uncorrelated, the system is equivalent to the triangular lattice and the
well-known $(\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3})$ $[(\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3})^*]$
ordered phase is found at low temperatures and a coverage, $\theta$, of 1/3
$[2/3]$. In the more general case ($w_L/w_T \neq 0$ and $w_T > 0$), a
competition between interactions along a single channel and a transverse
coupling between sites in neighboring channels allows to evolve to a
three-dimensional adsorbed layer. Consequently, the $(\sqrt{3} \times
\sqrt{3})$ and $(\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3})^*$ structures ""propagate"" along the
channels and new ordered phases appear in the adlayer. The Monte Carlo
technique was combined with the recently reported Free Energy Minimization
Criterion Approach (FEMCA), to predict the critical temperatures of the
order-disorder transformation. The excellent qualitative agreement between
simulated data and FEMCA results allow us to interpret the physical meaning of
the mechanisms underlying the observed transitions.

mixing, is studied by means of the field theoretic renormalization group. As a
simplified model, relaxational stochastic dynamics of a non-conserved scalar
order parameter, coupled to a random velocity field with prescribed statistics,
is considered. The velocity is taken Gaussian, white in time, with correlation
function of the form $\propto \delta(t-t') /|{\bf k}_{\bot}|^{d+\xi}$, where
${\bf k}_{\bot}$ is the component of the wave vector, perpendicular to the
distinguished direction (``direction of the flow''). It is shown that,
depending on the relation between the exponent $\xi$ and the space
dimensionality $d$, the system exhibits various types of large-scale
self-similar behaviour, associated with different infrared attractive fixed
points of the renormalization-group equations. Existence of a new,
non-equilibrium and strongly anisotropic, type of critical behaviour
(universality class) is established, and the corresponding critical dimensions
are calculated to the second order of the double expansion in $\xi$ and
$\epsilon=4-d$ (two-loop approximation). The most realistic values of the model
parameters (for example, $d=3$ and the Kolmogorov exponent $\xi=4/3$) belong to
this class. The scaling behaviour appears anisotropic in the sense that the
critical dimensions related to the directions parallel and perpendicular to the
flow are essentially different.

  with Applications to Repeat-Accumulate Codes and Variations","Submitted to IEEE Trans. on Information Theory, June 2006 (57 pages,
  9 figures)",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  This paper is focused on the performance analysis of binary linear block
codes (or ensembles) whose transmission takes place over independent and
memoryless parallel channels. New upper bounds on the maximum-likelihood (ML)
decoding error probability are derived. These bounds are applied to various
ensembles of turbo-like codes, focusing especially on repeat-accumulate codes
and their recent variations which possess low encoding and decoding complexity
and exhibit remarkable performance under iterative decoding. The framework of
the second version of the Duman and Salehi (DS2) bounds is generalized to the
case of parallel channels, along with the derivation of their optimized tilting
measures. The connection between the generalized DS2 and the 1961 Gallager
bounds, addressed by Divsalar and by Sason and Shamai for a single channel, is
explored in the case of an arbitrary number of independent parallel channels.
The generalization of the DS2 bound for parallel channels enables to re-derive
specific bounds which were originally derived by Liu et al. as special cases of
the Gallager bound. In the asymptotic case where we let the block length tend
to infinity, the new bounds are used to obtain improved inner bounds on the
attainable channel regions under ML decoding. The tightness of the new bounds
for independent parallel channels is exemplified for structured ensembles of
turbo-like codes. The improved bounds with their optimized tilting measures
show, irrespectively of the block length of the codes, an improvement over the
union bound and other previously reported bounds for independent parallel
channels; this improvement is especially pronounced for moderate to large block
lengths.

  sections","IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, vol. 55(8), pages
  3995-4003, August 2007.",,,"math.OC",,"  We present several natural notions of distance between spectral density
functions of (discrete-time) random processes. They are motivated by certain
filtering problems. First we quantify the degradation of performance of a
predictor which is designed for a particular spectral density function and then
it is used to predict the values of a random process having a different
spectral density. The logarithm of the ratio between the variance of the error,
over the corresponding minimal (optimal) variance, produces a measure of
distance between the two power spectra with several desirable properties.
Analogous quantities based on smoothing problems produce alternative distances
and suggest a class of measures based on fractions of generalized means of
ratios of power spectral densities. These distance measures endow the manifold
of spectral density functions with a (pseudo) Riemannian metric. We pursue one
of the possible options for a distance measure, characterize the relevant
geodesics, and compute corresponding distances.

  1411-1425",,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, the physics of flow instability and turbulent transition in
shear flows is studied by analyzing the energy variation of fluid particles
under the interaction of base flow with a disturbance. For the first time, a
model derived strictly from physics is proposed to show that the flow
instability under finite amplitude disturbance leads to turbulent transition.
The proposed model is named as ""energy gradient method."" It is demonstrated
that it is the transverse energy gradient that leads to the disturbance
amplification while the disturbance is damped by the energy loss due to
viscosity along the streamline. It is also shown that the threshold of
disturbance amplitude obtained is scaled with the Reynolds number by an
exponent of -1, which exactly explains the recent modern experimental results
by Hof et al. for pipe flow. The mechanism for velocity inflection and hairpin
vortex formation are explained with reference to analytical results. Following
from this analysis, it can be demonstrated that the critical value of the so
called energy gradient parameter Kmax is constant for turbulent transition in
wall bounded parallel flows, and this is confirmed by experiments and is about
370-389. The location of instability initiation in the flow field accords well
with the experiments for both pipe Poiseuille flow (r/R=0.58) and plane
Poiseuille flow (y/h=0.58). It is also inferred from the proposed method that
the transverse energy gradient can serve as the power for the self-sustaining
process of wall bounded turbulence. Finally, the relation of ""energy gradient
method"" to the classical ""energy method"" based on Rayleigh-Orr equation is
discussed.

sharp tungsten tip triggered by sub-8 femtosecond low power laser pulses. This
process is non-linear in the laser electric field, and the non-linearity can be
tuned via the DC voltage applied to the tip. Numerical simulations of this
system show that electron emission takes place within less than one optical
period of the exciting laser pulse, so that an 8 fsec 800 nm laser pulse is
capable of producing a single electron pulse of less than 1 fsec duration.
Furthermore, we find that the carrier-envelope phase dependence of the emission
process is smaller than 0.1% for an 8 fsec pulse but is steeply increasing with
decreasing laser pulse duration.

gates for quantum information processing, only in weakly coupled systems in
which the individual spins can be identified as qubits. In this work, we
implement controlled phase shift gates in strongly coupled systems, by using
non-adiabatic geometric phases, obtained by evolving the magnetization of
fictitious spin-1/2 subspaces, over a closed loop on the Bloch sphere. The
dynamical phase accumulated during the evolution of the subspaces, is refocused
by a spin echo pulse sequence and by setting the delay of transition selective
pulses such that the evolution under the homonuclear coupling makes a complete
$2\pi$ rotation. A detailed theoretical explanation of non-adiabatic geometric
phases in NMR is given, by using single transition operators. Controlled phase
shift gates, two qubit Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and parity algorithm in a
qubit-qutrit system have been implemented in various strongly dipolar coupled
systems obtained by orienting the molecules in liquid crystal media.
