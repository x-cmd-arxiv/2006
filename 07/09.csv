vorticity to a laminar state, and vice versa, in the outer core of a neutron
star. By solving numerically the hydrodynamic Hall-Vinen-Bekarevich-Khalatnikov
equations for a rotating superfluid in a differentially rotating spherical
shell, we find that the meridional counterflow driven by Ekman pumping exceeds
the Donnelly-Glaberson threshold throughout most of the outer core, exciting
unstable Kelvin waves which disrupt the rectilinear vortex array, creating a
vortex tangle. In the turbulent state, the torque exerted on the crust
oscillates, and the crust-core coupling is weaker than in the laminar state.
This leads to a new scenario for the rotational glitches observed in radio
pulsars: a vortex tangle is sustained in the differentially rotating outer core
by the meridional counterflow, a sudden spin-up event brings the crust and core
into corotation, the vortex tangle relaxes back to a rectilinear vortex array,
then the crust spins down electromagnetically until enough meridional
counterflow builds up to reform a vortex tangle. The turbulent-laminar
transition can occur uniformly or in patches; the associated time-scales are
estimated from vortex filament theory. We calculate numerically the global
structure of the flow with and without an inviscid superfluid component, for
Hall-Vinen and Gorter-Mellink forms of the mutual friction. We also calculate
the post-glitch evolution of the angular velocity of the crust and its time
derivative, and compare the results with radio pulse timing data, predicting a
correlation between glitch activity and Reynolds number.

Several works assume that this is the case, but no quantitative analysis is

collaborations to accurately trace the prominent event in the lightcurve for
the A component of the system. Then the observed event is compared with
synthetic light curves derived from trajectories in magnification maps. These
maps are generated using a ray-tracing technique. We take more than 10^9
trajectories and test a wide range of different physical properties of the
lensing galaxy and the source quasar (lens transverse velocity, microlens mass,
source intensity profile and source size). We found that around 75% of our good
trajectories (i.e. that are consistent with the observations) are caustic
crossings. In addition, a high transverse velocity exceeding 300 km/s, a
microlens mass of about 0.1 M_sun and a small standard accretion disk is the
best parameter combination. The results justify the interpretation of the
OGLE-GLITP event in Q2237+0305A as a caustic crossing. Moreover, the physical
properties of the lens and source are in very good agreement with previous
works. We also remark that a standard accretion disk is prefered to those
simpler approaches, and that the former should be used in subsequent
simulations.

of ionized gas from the nucleus that presumably resulted from the intrusion of
a radio jet into the ambient interstellar medium. Using diagnostic diagrams, we
estimate the contributions from the AGN and star formation to the galactic gas
ionization. We estimate the bar pattern speed by the Tremaine-Weinberg method

reviewed in Spruit (1999) are discussed with some detail and new developments
added. In stellar models which include magnetic torques, the differential
rotation tends to accumulate in the gradients in composition. In view of this,
instability in a $\mu$-gradient is studied in more detail here, resulting in
the detection of a second instability. Its relevance for angular momentum
transport is uncertain, however, since it requires high horizontal field
gradients and would not operate near the pole. Finally, the possibility is
discussed that magnetic instability in a $\mu$-gradient will lead to {\em layer
formation}: the gradients breaking up into small steps of uniform composition
and rotation rate. This would enhance the angular momentum transport across
inhomogeneous zones, and decrease the rotation rates of the end products of
stellar evolution. A recent {\tt astro-ph} submission by Dennisenkov and

transition sequence and is obtained only when the AFD distortion is taken into
account. We also find that compressive misfit strains induce ferroelectricity
in the tetragonal low temperature phase only whilst tensile strains induce
ferroelectricity in the orthorhombic phases only. The calculated FE
polarization for both the tetragonal and orthorhombic phases increases
monotonically with the magnitude of the strains. The AFD rotation angle of the
oxygen octahedra in the tetragonal phase increases dramatically as the misfit
strain goes from the tensile to compressive strain region whilst it decreases
slightly in the orthorhombic (FO4) phase. This reveals why the polarization in
the epitaxially strained SrTiO$_3$ would be larger when the tensile strain is
applied, since the AFD distortion is found to reduce the FE instability and
even to completely suppress it in the small strain region. Finally, our
analysis of the average polar distortion and the charge density distribution
suggests that both the Ti-O and Sr-O layers contribute significantly to the FE
polarization.

the form of false positives, and which rises the more the filters are
compressed. In this paper, we introduce the retouched Bloom filter (RBF), an
extension that makes the Bloom filter more flexible by permitting the removal
of selected false positives at the expense of generating random false
negatives. We analytically show that RBFs created through a random process
maintain an overall error rate, expressed as a combination of the false
positive rate and the false negative rate, that is equal to the false positive
rate of the corresponding Bloom filters. We further provide some simple
heuristics and improved algorithms that decrease the false positive rate more
than than the corresponding increase in the false negative rate, when creating
RBFs. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of an RBF over a Bloom filter in a
distributed network topology measurement application, where information about
large stop sets must be shared among route tracing monitors.

quintessence today. Our first question is whether it is possible to explain why
quintessence ``knows'' that the Universe is going toward the vanishing energy
state. We show from a new perspective that the conventional $O(H)$ corrections
may reproduce the required potential. Our second question is whether it is
possible to obtain plausible amount of the potential energy density today

quintessence, one may solve the coincidence problem using the conventional
techniques for solving the coincidence problem in quintessence cosmology.
However, in our scenario we have another option, which is qualitatively
different from the one that have been discussed in quintessence cosmology.
Besides quintessence cosmology, we show that there is a relation between a
dynamical approach, which suggests that we can solve the coincidence problem in

interesting mathematical object useful for applications. We introduce more
general integral transforms that reveal distinctive features of higher-rank
objects in full generality. We call these new transforms the composite cosine
transforms, by taking into account that their kernels agree with the composite
power function of the cone of positive definite symmetric matrices. We show
that injectivity of the composite cosine transforms can be studied using
standard tools of the Fourier analysis on matrix spaces. In the framework of
this approach, we introduce associated generalized zeta integrals and give new
simple proofs to the relevant functional relations. Our technique is based on
application of the higher-rank Radon transform on matrix spaces.

$i(\gamma)$ is the number of independent (true) inflection points and

arise in mathematical physics in the context of integrable quantum field
theory, integrable quantum spin chains, and solvable lattice models. They
provide the algebraic framework behind the spectral parameter dependent
Yang-Baxter equation.
  One can distinguish three classes of affine quantum groups, each leading to a
different dependence of the R-matrices on the spectral parameter: Yangians lead
to rational R-matrices, quantum affine algebras lead to trigonometric
R-matrices and elliptic quantum groups lead to elliptic R-matrices. We will
mostly concentrate on the quantum affine algebras but many results hold
similarly for the other classes.
  After giving mathematical details about quantum affine algebras and Yangians
in the first two section, we describe how these algebras arise in different
areas of mathematical physics in the three following sections. We end with a
description of boundary quantum groups which extend the formalism to the
boundary Yang-Baxter (reflection) equation.

rely on symmetry arguments. In this paper, we prove the security of a
three-state protocol that does not possess rotational symmetry. The three-state
QKD protocol we consider involves three qubit states, where the first two
states, |0_z> and |1_z>, can contribute to key generation and the third state,
|+>=(|0_z>+|1_z>)/\sqrt{2}, is for channel estimation. This protocol has been
proposed and implemented experimentally in some frequency-based QKD systems
where the three states can be prepared easily. Thus, by founding on the
security of this three-state protocol, we prove that these QKD schemes are, in
fact, unconditionally secure against any attacks allowed by quantum mechanics.
The main task in our proof is to upper bound the phase error rate of the qubits
given the bit error rates observed. Unconditional security can then be proved
not only for the ideal case of a single-photon source and perfect detectors,
but also for the realistic case of a phase-randomized weak coherent light
source and imperfect threshold detectors. Our result on the phase error rate
upper bound is independent of the loss in the channel. Also, we compare the
three-state protocol with the BB84 protocol. For the single-photon source case,
our result proves that the BB84 protocol strictly tolerates a higher quantum
bit error rate than the three-state protocol; while for the coherent-source
case, the BB84 protocol achieves a higher key generation rate and secure
distance than the three-state protocol when a decoy-state method is used.
