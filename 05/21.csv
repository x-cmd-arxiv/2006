from beamed inverse-Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons

  Ivanov, J. Borissova",,"10.1007/978-3-540-71173-5_22",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a pedagogical review on the formation and evolution of galaxies in
groups, utilizing observational information from the Local Group to galaxies at
z~6. The majority of galaxies in the nearby universe are found in groups, and
galaxies at all redshifts up to z~6 tend to cluster on the scale of nearby
groups (~1 Mpc). This suggests that the group environment may play a role in
the formation of most galaxies. The Local Group, and other nearby groups,
display a diversity in star formation and morphological properties that puts
limits on how, and when, galaxies in groups formed. Effects that depend on an
intragroup medium, such as ram-pressure and strangulation, are likely not major
mechanisms driving group galaxy evolution. Simple dynamical friction arguments
however show that galaxy mergers should be common, and a dominant process for
driving evolution. While mergers between L_* galaxies are observed to be rare
at z < 1, they are much more common at earlier times. This is due to the
increased density of the universe, and to the fact that high mass galaxies are
highly clustered on the scale of groups. We furthermore discus why the local
number density environment of galaxies strongly correlates with galaxy
properties, and why the group environment may be the preferred method for
establishing the relationship between properties of galaxies and their local
density.

their lives. For very massive stars, mass loss dominates their evolution,
although the mass loss rates are not known exactly, particularly once the star
has left the main sequence. Direct observations of the stellar winds of massive
stars can give information on the current mass-loss rates, while studies of the
ring nebulae and HI shells that surround many Wolf-Rayet (WR) and luminous blue
variable (LBV) stars provide information on the previous mass-loss history. The
evolution of the most massive stars, (M > 25 solar masses), essentially follows
the sequence O star to LBV or red supergiant (RSG) to WR star to supernova. For
stars of mass less than 25 solar masses there is no final WR stage. During the
main sequence and WR stages, the mass loss takes the form of highly supersonic
stellar winds, which blow bubbles in the interstellar and circumstellar medium.
In this way, the mechanical luminosity of the stellar wind is converted into
kinetic energy of the swept-up ambient material, which is important for the
dynamics of the interstellar medium. In this review article, analytic and
numerical models are used to describe the hydrodynamics and energetics of
wind-blown bubbles. A brief review of observations of bubbles is given, and the
degree to which theory is supported by observations is discussed.

as the bubble rises through the intra-cluster medium (ICM). We show that while
the jet is powering the inflation, the deceleration of the bubble-ICM interface
is able to reverse the Rayleigh-Taylor instability criterion. In addition, the
inflation introduces a drag effect which increases substantially the
instability growth time. The combined action of these two effects considerably
delays the onset of the instability. Later on, when the magnitude of the
deceleration drops or the jet fades, the Rayleigh-Taylor and the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities set in and eventually disrupt the bubble. We
conclude that the initial deceleration and drag, albeit unable to prevent the
disruption of a bubble, may significantly lengthen its lifetime, removing the
need to invoke stabilising magnetic fields.

resonance, thereby converting a degenerate quantum gas of fermionic atoms into
a degenerate quantum gas of bosonic dimers. Our analysis relies on a zero
temperature mean-field theory which accurately accounts for initial molecular
quantum fluctuations, triggering the association process. The structure of the
resulting semiclassical phase space is investigated, highlighting the dynamical
instability of the system towards association, for sufficiently small detuning
from resonance. It is shown that this instability significantly modifies the
finite-rate efficiency of the sweep, transforming the single-pair exponential
Landau-Zener behavior of the remnant fraction of atoms Gamma on sweep rate
alpha, into a power-law dependence as the number of atoms increases. The
obtained nonadiabaticity is determined from the interplay of characteristic
time scales for the motion of adiabatic eigenstates and for fast periodic
motion around them. Critical slowing-down of these precessions near the
instability leads to the power-law dependence. A linear power law $Gamma\propto
alpha$ is obtained when the initial molecular fraction is smaller than the 1/N
quantum fluctuations, and a cubic-root power law $Gamma\propto alpha^{1/3}$ is
attained when it is larger. Our mean-field analysis is confirmed by exact
calculations, using Fock-space expansions. Finally, we fit experimental low
temperature Feshbach sweep data with a power-law dependence. While the
agreement with the experimental data is well within experimental error bars,
similar accuracy can be obtained with an exponential fit, making additional
data highly desirable.

reduced to a 1+1 dimensional system of partial differential equations. Due to
this technical obstacle, very little is known about the collapse of pure
gravitational waves because by Birkhoff's theorem there is no spherical
collapse in vacuum. In this essay we describe a new cohomogeneity-two symmetry
reduction of the vacuum Einstein equations in five and higher odd dimensions

been carried out. The real and imaginary potentials have been constrained from
fits to elastic scattering data, reaction cross sections, and level properties
of valence hole states deduced from (e,e'p) data. The surface imaginary
potential was found to be larger overall and the gap in this potential on
either side of the Fermi energy was found to be smaller for the neutron-rich
p+48Ca system. These results imply that protons with energies near the Fermi
surface experience larger correlations with increasing asymmetry.

of several tens micrometers in oil was examined. Such a droplet exhibits
repetitive translational motion between the electrodes in a spontaneous manner.
The state diagram of this oscillatory motion was deduced; at 0-20 V the droplet
is fixed at the surface of the electrode, at 20-70 V the droplet exhibits
small-amplitude oscillatory motion between the electrodes, and at 70-100 V the
droplet shows large-amplitude periodic motion between the electrodes. The
observed rhythmic motion is explained in a semi-quantitative manner by using
differential equations, which includes the effect of charging the droplet under
an electric field. We also found that twin droplets exhibit synchronized
rhythmic motion between the electrodes.

exist? Here we propose a simple dynamics for social networks in which the sense
of a relationship can change so as to eliminate imbalanced triads--relationship
triangles that contains 1 or 3 unfriendly links. In this dynamics, a friendly
link changes to unfriendly or vice versa in an imbalanced triad to make the
triad balanced. Such networks undergo a dynamic phase transition from a steady
state to ""utopia""--all friendly links--as the amount of network friendliness is
changed. Basic features of the long-time dynamics and the phase transition are
discussed.

Lett. 97, 087601 (2006)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.087601",,"quant-ph cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.other",,"  We study the coupling of a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond to a
nearby single nitrogen defect at room temperature. The magnetic dipolar
coupling leads to a splitting in the electron spin resonance frequency of the
nitrogen-vacancy center, allowing readout of the state of a single nitrogen
electron spin. At magnetic fields where the spin splitting of the two centers
is the same we observe a strong polarization of the nitrogen electron spin. The
amount of polarization can be controlled by the optical excitation power. We
combine the polarization and the readout in time-resolved pump-probe
measurements to determine the spin relaxation time of a single nitrogen
electron spin. Finally, we discuss indications for hyperfine-induced
polarization of the nitrogen nuclear spin.
