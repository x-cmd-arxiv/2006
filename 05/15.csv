weighted dipoles are very robust because they closely approximate a mass
weighted dipole, bypassing the effects of redshift distortions and require no
preferred reference frame. We use this method with the redshift information to
determine the change in dipole with distance. The LG dipole seemingly converges
by 60 Mpc/h. Assuming convergence, the comparison of the 2MRS flux dipole and
the CMB dipole provides a value for the combination of the mass density and
luminosity bias parameters Omega_m^0.6/b_L= 0.40+/-0.09.

upon the results of low and high resolution spectroscopy. It is argued that
bright extragalactic planetary nebulae from galaxies (or subsystems) with and
without star formation have different distributions of central star temperature
and ionization structure. As regards the chemical compositions, oxygen and neon
are generally found to be unchanged as a result of the evolution of the stellar
progenitors. Nitrogen enrichment may occur as a result of the evolution of the
progenitors of bright planetary nebulae in all stellar populations, though this
enrichment may be (more) random in old stellar populations. Helium abundances
appear to be influenced by the chemical evolution of the host galaxy, with
planetary nebulae in dwarf spheroidals having systematically elevated
abundances. Neither the age nor the metallicity of the progenitor stellar
population has a strong effect upon the kinematics observed for nebular shells.
Both the range of expansion velocites, 8-28 km/s, and the typical expansion
velocity, ~18 km/s, are found to be relatively constant in all galaxies. On the
other hand, bright planetary nebulae in the bulge of M31 have systematically
higher expansion velocities than their counterparts in M31's disk. The
expansion velocities show no trend with nebular Hbeta luminosity, apart from a
lack of large expansion velocities at the highest luminosities (the youngest
objects), but appear to correlate with the 5007/Hbeta ratio, at least until
this ratio saturates. These results suggest a link between the evolution of the
nebular shells and central stars of bright extragalactic planetary nebulae.

constrain the distribution of dark matter and the physical evolution of their
hosts. There is increasing evidence that objects with masses of dwarf galaxies
form in the tidal tails of colliding galaxies and speculations that they could
become satellite-like galaxies around their progenitors and thus be
cosmologically important. Yet, whether these ""Tidal Dwarf Galaxies"" (TDGs)
candidates are really long-lived and not only present in young interacting
systems is still an open question to which numerical simulations may give
answers. We present a set of 96 simulations of colliding galaxies with various
mass ratios and encounter geometries, and statistically study the evolution of
their TDG candidates. Among the 593 substructures initially identified in tidal
tails, about 75% fall back onto their progenitor or are disrupted in a few 10^8
years. The remaining 25% become long-lived bound objects that typically survive
more than 2Gyr with masses above 10^8 M_sun. These long-lived, satellite-like
objects, are found to form in the outer most regions of the tidal tails. We
infer several basic properties that dwarf galaxies should meet to have a tidal
origin and apply these criteria to the Local Group dwarfs. We also find that
the presence of TDGs would foster the anisotropy observed in the distribution
of satellite galaxies around their host. Identifying the conditions required
for interacting systems to form long-lived tidal dwarfs, we roughly estimate
their contribution to the overall population of dwarfs. We conclude that a
small but significant fraction of them - typically a few percent, and possibly
more in dense environments or around early-type galaxies - could be of tidal
origin.

dimming assuming pure luminosity evolution. However, instead of relying on
stellar population synthesis model--dependent assumptions, we adopt the
empirical luminosity dimming rate derived from the evolution of the Fundamental
Plane of field and cluster massive ETGs.Our results show that the amount of
evolution for the ETG population depends critically on the range of luminosity
and masses considered. While the number density of luminous (massive) ETGs with
M_B(z=0)< -20.5 (Mass > 10^11 M_Sun) is nearly constant since z~0.8, less
luminous galaxies display a deficit which grows with redshift and that can be
explained with a gradual population of the ETG ""red sequence"" by the
progressive quenching of star formation in galaxies less massive than ~10^11
M_Sun. At each redshift there is a critical mass above which virtually all ETGs
appear to be in place, and this fits well in the now popular ""downsizing""
scenario. However, ``downsizing'' does not appear to be limited to star
formation, but the concept may have to be extended to the mass assembly itself
as the build-up of the most massive galaxies preceeds that of the less massive
ones. This evolutionary trend is not reproduced by the most recent theoretical
simulations even when they successfully reproduce ""downsizing"" in star
formation.

derive how and how fast semi-degenerate identical free fermions become

derive the temperature and mass of the warm molecular gas. We detect H2 in 77%

mass is ~2x10^8solar-masses. High extinction, inferred from the 9.7um silicate
absorption depth, is not observed along the line of site to the molecular gas.
The derived H2 mass does not depend on F(25um)/F(60um), which has been used to
infer either starburst or AGN dominance. Similarly, the molecular mass does not
scale with the 25 or 60um luminosities. In general, the H2 emission is
consistent with an origin in photo-dissociation regions associated with star
formation. We detect the S(0) 28.22um emission line in a few ULIRGs. Including
this line in the model fits tends to lower the temperature by ~50-100K,
resulting in a significant increase in the gas mass. The presence of a cooler

identified 41 extended Ly-alpha sources. The redshift distribution of these
sources shows that this kind of objects are common in the early universe over
the surveyed redshift range. The identified objects have typical sizes of
\~10-15 kpc and luminosities of ~10^42 ergs/s. Follow-up spectroscopy made for
7 of the 41 objects showed that our sample suffers from little contamination.
All 7 objects have large equivalent widths of Ly-alpha emission line, all but
one exceeding 240A in the rest frame. The large equivalent widths suggest that
their extended Ly-alpha emissions are unlikely to be due to normal starbursts,
but possibly originated from very young galaxies. All 41 objects in our sample
have much smaller Ly-alpha luminosities than the two Ly-alpha Blobs (LABs)
found by Steidel et al. (2000) in spite of our much larger survey volume. This
suggests that large and luminous extended Ly-alpha objects like the two LABs
are very rare and are clustered in overdense regions.

provides the sub-arcsecond field of view up to 3 degrees in diameter for the

  As an example, the f/1.9 telescope is considered with the 6.5-m aperture and
the total length 8.8~m. Its primary and secondary mirrors are pure ellipsoids
close to concave paraboloid and concave sphere, respectively. In the basic
configuration, all surfaces of the corrector are spherical. The diameter of a

detected, at lower confidence level, north east of the center. These sources of
diffuse light contribute to 10-15% of the total visible light in the cluster.
Whether they are independent entities or are part of the very elliptical
external envelope of the central galaxy remains unclear. VLT VIMOS integral
field spectroscopy reveals a faint continuum at the positions of DS1 and ComDif
but do not allow to compute a redshift. A hierarchical substructure detection
method reveals the presence of several galaxy pairs and groups defining a
similar direction as the one drawn by the DS1-central galaxy-DS2 axis. The
analysis of archive XMM-Newton and Chandra observations shows X-ray emission
elongated in the same direction. The X-ray temperature map shows the presence
of a cool core, a broad cool zone stretching from north to south and hotter
regions towards the north east, south west and north west. This possibly
suggests shock fronts along these directions produced by infalling material.
These various data are consistent with a picture in which diffuse sources are
concentrations of tidal debris and harassed matter expelled from infalling
galaxies by tidal stripping and undergoing an accretion process onto the
central cluster galaxy; as such, they are expected to be found along the main

  (2007)","10.1088/0953-8984/19/13/136219",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.other",,"  We show theoretically that nonrelativistic nearly-free electrons in solids
should experience a trembling motion
  (Zitterbewegung, ZB) in absence of external fields, similarly to relativistic
electrons in vacuum.
  The Zitterbewegung is directly related to the influence of periodic potential
on the free electron motion.
  The frequency of ZB is $\omega\approx E_g/\hbar$, where $E_g$ is the energy
gap. The amplitude of ZB is determined by the strength of periodic potential
and the lattice period and it can be of the order of nanometers. We show that
the amplitude of ZB does not depend much on the width of the wave packet
representing an electron in real space.
  An analogue of the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation, known from relativistic
quantum mechanics, is introduced in order to decouple electron states in
various bands. We demonstrate that, after the bands are decoupled, electrons
should be treated as particles of a finite size.
  In contrast to nearly-free electrons we consider a two-band model of tightly
bound electrons.
  We show that also in this case the electrons should experience the trembling
motion. It is concluded that the phenomenon of Zitterbewegung of electrons in
crystalline solids is a rule rather than an exception.

transverse NMR mode into spin waves of the longitudinal NMR. Recently the cross
interaction amplitude between the two modes has been calculated by Sourovtsev
and Fomin \cite{SF} for the so-called Brinkman-Smith configuration, i.e. for
the orientation of the orbital momentum of Cooper pairs along the magnetic
field, ${\bf L}\parallel {\bf H}$. In their treatment, the interaction is
caused by the anisotropy of the speed of the spin waves. We found that in the
more general case of the non-parallel orientation of ${\bf L}$ corresponding to
the typical conditions of experiment, the spin-orbital interaction provides the
additional interaction between the modes. By analyzing experimental data we are
able to distinguish which contribution is dominating in different regimes.

results in a qualitative agreement with pump-probe spectroscopic measurements

Using the monad operations, continuous functions on length spaces (a common

that this approach yields a real number library that is reasonably efficient

Grid computing. Central to management of resources is the effectiveness of
resource allocation as it determines the overall utility of the system. The
current approaches to superscheduling in a grid environment are non-coordinated
since application level schedulers or brokers make scheduling decisions
independently of the others in the system. Clearly, this can exacerbate the
load sharing and utilization problems of distributed resources due to
suboptimal schedules that are likely to occur. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a mechanism for coordinated sharing of distributed clusters based on
computational economy. The resulting environment, called
\emph{Grid-Federation}, allows the transparent use of resources from the
federation when local resources are insufficient to meet its users'
requirements. The use of computational economy methodology in coordinating
resource allocation not only facilitates the QoS based scheduling, but also
enhances utility delivered by resources.

from (undecidable and) recursively enumerable to highly undecidable, where the
recursively enumerable logics are obtained by considering substructures of
structures induced by topological spaces. As our undecidability results also
capture logics based on the real line, they improve upon undecidability results

general characteristics are responsible for the different types of quantitative
behavior of entantglement-entropy. Our main lesson is that what really matters
is the degree of degeneracy of the spectrum of certain nearby reference
Hamiltonians. For calculational convenience we study primarily systems defined
on large but finite regions of regular lattices. We show that general vector
states, being not related to some short-range Hamiltonian do not lead in the
generic case to an area-like behavior of entanglement-entropy. The situation
changes if eigenstates of a Hamiltonian with short-range interactions are
studied. We found three broad classes of eigenstates. Global groundstates
typically lead to entanglement-entropies of subvolumes proportional to the area
of the dividing surface. Macroscopically excited (vector)states have in the
generic case an entanglement-entropy which is proportional to the enclosed
subvolume and, furthermore, display a certain Gibbsian behavior. Low-lying
excited states, on the other hand, lead to an entanglement-entropy which is
usually proportional to the logarithm of the enclosed subvolume times the area

the theory with one fermionic flavor, where the partition function in this

place in the theory with one bosonic flavor when the chemical potential is

function shows no phase transition, whereas the fermionic counterpart has a
phase transition at $\mu = m_\pi/2$. The difference between the bosonic

very rapidly near the points where $f$ is smooth, while it decays slowly near
the irregular points. This property allows one to precisely identify the
singular support of $f$. However, the continuous wavelet transform is unable to
provide additional information about the geometry of the singular points. In
this paper, we introduce a new transform for functions and distributions on
$\R^2$, called the Continuous Shearlet Transform. This is defined by
$\mathcal{S}\mathcal{H}_f(a,s,t) = \ip{f}{\psi_{ast}}$, where the analyzing
elements $\psi_{ast}$ are dilated and translated copies of a single generating
function $\psi$ and, thus, they form an affine system. The resulting continuous
shearlets $\psi_{ast}$ are smooth functions at continuous scales $a >0$,
locations $t \in \R^2$ and oriented along lines of slope $s \in \R$ in the
frequency domain. The Continuous Shearlet Transform transform is able to
identify not only the location of the singular points of a distribution $f$,
but also the orientation of their distributed singularities. As a result, we
can use this transform to exactly characterize the wavefront set of $f$.

  By applying symbolic techniques in the shift-space model we derive new
results about genericity of dynamical properties for transitive and totally
transitive homeomorphisms of the Cantor set. We show that the isomorphism class
of the universal odometer is generic in the space of transitive systems. On the
other hand, the space of totally transitive systems displays much more varied
dynamics. In particular, we show that in this space the isomorphism class of
every Cantor system without periodic points is dense, and the following
properties are generic: minimality, zero entropy, disjointness from a fixed
totally transitive system, weak mixing, strong mixing, and minimal self
joinings. The last two stand in striking contrast to the situation in the
measure-preserving category. We also prove a correspondence between genericity

$^7$Be beam of energy 1.23A GeV was formed. This beam was used to expose
photo-emulsion chambers. The mean free path for inelastic $^7$Be interactions
in emulsion $\lambda$=14.0$\pm$0.8 cm coincides within the errors with those
for $^6$Li and $^7$Li nuclei. More than 10% of the $^7$Be events are associated
with the peripheral interactions in which the total charge of the relativistic
fragments is equal to the charge of the $^7$Be and in which charged mesons are
not produced. An unusual ratio of the isotopes is revealed in the composition
of the doubly charged $^7$Be fragments: the number of $^3$He fragments is twice
as large as that of $^4$He fragments. In 50% of peripheral interactions, a
$^7$Be nucleus decays to two doubly charged fragments. The present paper gives
the channels of the $^7$Be fragmentation to charged fragments. In 50% of
events, the $^7$Be fragmentation proceeds only to charged fragments involving
no emission of neutrons. Of them, the $^3$He+$^4$He channel dominates, the
$^4$He+d+p and $^6$Li+pchannels constitute 10% each. Two events involving no
emission of neutrons are registered in the 3-body $^3$He+t+p and $^3$He+d+d
channels. The mean free path for the coherent dissociation of relativistic
$^7$Be nuclei to $^3$He+$^4$He is 7$\pm$1 m. The particular features of the

by the $^3$He+$^4$He 2-cluster structure of the $^7$Be nucleus.

  A distinctive feature of the charge topology in the dissociation of the Ne,
Mg, Si, and S nuclei is an almost total suppression of the binary splitting of
nuclei to fragments with charges higher than 2. The growth of the nuclear
fragmentation degree is revealed in an increase in the multiplicity of singly
and doubly charged fragments with decreasing charge of the non-excited part of
the fragmenting nucleus.
  The processes of dissociation of stable Li, Be, B, C, N, and O isotopes to

inter-market dependencies and the correlations among their different

pairs of signals and correlation matrices for rich multivariate data. In the
latter case one constructs a real symmetric matrix with real non-negative
eigenvalues describing the correlation structure of the data. However, if one
performs a correlation-function-like analysis of multivariate data, when a
stress is put on investigation of delayed dependencies among different types of
signals, one can calculate an asymmetric correlation matrix with complex
eigenspectrum. From the Random Matrix Theory point of view this kind of
matrices is closely related to Ginibre Orthogonal Ensemble (GinOE). We present
an example of practical application of such matrices in correlation analyses of
empirical data. By introducing the time lag, we are able to identify temporal
structure of the inter-market correlations. Our results show that the American
and German stock markets evolve almost simultaneously without a significant
time lag so that it is hard to find imprints of information transfer between
these markets. There is only an extremely subtle indication that the German

evolutionary dynamics are discussed. Although there is a strong consensus that
general laws in biology may exist, opinions opposing such suggestion are
abundant. Based on recent progress in both mathematics and biology, another
attempt to address this issue is made in the present article. Specifically,
three laws which form a mathematical framework for the evolutionary dynamics in
biology are postulated. The second law is most quantitative and is explicitly
expressed in the unique form of a stochastic differential equation. Salient
features of Darwinian evolutionary dynamics are captured by this law: the
probabilistic nature of evolution, ascendancy, and the adaptive landscape. Four
dynamical elements are introduced in this formulation: the ascendant matrix,
the transverse matrix, the Wright evolutionary potential, and the stochastic
drive. The first law may be regarded as a special case of the second law. It
gives the reference point to discuss the evolutionary dynamics. The third law
describes the relationship between the focused level of description to its
lower and higher ones, and defines the dichotomy of deterministic and
stochastic drives. It is an acknowledgement of the hierarchical structure in
biology. A new interpretation of Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural
selection is provided in terms of the F-Theorem. The proposed laws are based on
continuous representation in both time and population. Their generic nature is
demonstrated through their equivalence to classical formulations. The present
three laws appear to provide a coherent framework for the further development
of the subject.

the variety of geometric shapes exhibited by dendritic trees remains unclear.
This question was addressed by developing a model of the growth of dendritic
trees based on diffusion-limited aggregation process. The model reproduces
diverse neuronal shapes (i.e., granule cells, Purkinje cells, the basal and
apical dendrites of pyramidal cells, and the axonal trees of interneurons) by
changing only the size of the growth area, the time span of pruning, and the
spatial concentration of 'neurotrophic particles'. Moreover, the presented
model shows how competition between neurons can affect the shape of the
dendritic trees. The model reveals that the creation of complex (but
reproducible) dendrite-like trees does not require precise guidance or an
intrinsic plan of the dendrite geometry. Instead, basic environmental factors
and the simple rules of diffusive growth adequately account for the spatial
embedding of different types of dendrites observed in the cortex. An example
demonstrating the broad applicability of the algorithm to model diverse types
of tree structures is also presented. Key words: Diffusion-limited aggregation;

constructed a layered associative network embedded with memory patterns. We
analyzed the network dynamics with the Fokker-Planck equation. First, we
addressed the stability of one memory pattern as a propagating spike volley. We
showed that memory patterns propagate as pulse packets. Second, we investigated
the activity when we activated two different memory patterns. Simultaneous
activation of two memory patterns with the same strength led the propagating
pattern to a mixed state. In contrast, when the activations had different
strengths, the pulse packet converged to a two-peak state. Finally, we studied
the effect of the preceding pulse packet on the following pulse packet. The
following pulse packet was modified from its original activated memory pattern,

A363 (2007) 197-201","10.1016/j.physleta.2006.11.002",,"quant-ph hep-th nlin.PS",,"  A nonlinear generalisation of Schrodinger's equation had previously been
obtained using information-theoretic arguments. The nonlinearities in that
equation were of a nonpolynomial form, equivalent to the occurence of
higher-derivative nonlinear terms at all orders. Here we construct some exact
solutions to that equation in 1+1 dimensions. On the half-line, the solutions
resemble exponentially damped Bloch waves even though no external periodic
potential is included: the periodicity is induced by the nonpolynomiality. The
solutions are nonperturbative as they do not reduce to solutions of the linear
theory in the limit that the nonlinearity parameter vanishes. An intriguing
feature of the solutions is their infinite degeneracy: for a given energy,
there exists a very large arbitrariness in the normalisable wavefunctions. We
also consider solutions to a q-deformed version of the nonlinear equation and
discuss a natural discretisation implied by the nonpolynomiality. Finally, we
contrast the properties of our solutions with other solutions of nonlinear
Schrodinger equations in the literature and suggest some possible applications
of our results in the domains of low-energy and high-energy physics.

  Parametric Interaction","4 pages, 2 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A novel method for preparation of a single photon in temporally-delocalized
entangled modes is proposed and analyzed. We show that two single-photon pulses
propagating in a driven nonabsorbing medium with different group velocities are
temporally split under parametric interaction into well-separated pulses. In
consequence, the single-photon ""time-bin-entangled"" states are generated with a
programmable entanglement easily controlled by driving field intensity. The
experimental study of nonclassical features and nonlocality of generated states
by means of balanced homodyne tomography is discussed.

into two singly quantized vortices was experimentally investigated in dilute
atomic cigar-shaped Bose-Einstein condensates [Y. Shin et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.
93, 160406 (2004)]. In particular, the dependency of the splitting time on the
peak particle density was studied. We present results of theoretical
simulations which closely mimic the experimental set-up. Contrary to previous
theoretical studies, claiming that thermal excitations are the essential
mechanism in initiating the splitting, we show that the combination of
gravitational sag and time dependency of the trapping potential alone suffices
to split the doubly quantized vortex in time scales which are in good agreement
with the experiments. We also study the dynamics of the resulting singly
quantized vortices which typically intertwine--especially, a peculiar vortex
chain structure appears for certain parameter values.

the operator based quantum mechanics of Schrodinger, or and equivalent, and
assign a c-number function in phase space to it. We propose to begin with a
higher level of abstraction, in which the independence and the symmetric role
of q and p is maintained throughout, and at once arrive at phase space state
functions. Upon reduction to the q- or p-space the proposed formalism gives the
conventional quantum mechanics, however, with a definite rule for ordering of
factors of non commuting observables. Further conceptual and practical merits
of the formalism are demonstrated throughout the text.
