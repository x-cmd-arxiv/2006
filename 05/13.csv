\~600,000 luminous red galaxies (LRGs) measured by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS), using photometric redshifts. This sample of galaxies ranges from
redshift z=0.2 to 0.6 over 3,528 deg^2 of the sky, probing a volume of 1.5
(Gpc/h)^3, making it the largest volume ever used for galaxy clustering
measurements. We measure the angular clustering power spectrum in eight
redshift slices and combine these into a high precision 3D real space power
spectrum from k=0.005 (h/Mpc) to k=1 (h/Mpc). We detect power on gigaparsec
scales, beyond the turnover in the matter power spectrum, on scales
significantly larger than those accessible to current spectroscopic redshift
surveys. We also find evidence for baryonic oscillations, both in the power
spectrum, as well as in fits to the baryon density, at a 2.5 sigma confidence
level. The statistical power of these data to constrain cosmology is ~1.7 times
better than previous clustering analyses. Varying the matter density and baryon
fraction, we find \Omega_M = 0.30 \pm 0.03, and \Omega_b/\Omega_M = 0.18 \pm
0.04, The detection of baryonic oscillations also allows us to measure the
comoving distance to z=0.5; we find a best fit distance of 1.73 \pm 0.12 Gpc,
corresponding to a 6.5% error on the distance. These results demonstrate the
ability to make precise clustering measurements with photometric surveys

RX J1131-1231 using two seasons of monitoring data. The short delays between
cusp images are A-B = 11.98 +1.52,-1.27 days and A-C = 9.61 +1.97,-1.57 days.
The long A-D delay for the counter image is not as precisely determined because
of the season gaps, but the data suggest a delay of -87 +- 8 days. The short
delays are difficult to explain using standard isothermal halo models of the
lensing potential, which instead prefer A-B and A-C delays of ~1 day for
reasonable values of the Hubble constant. Matching the cusp delays is possible
by adding a significant (~5 x 10^10 M_sun) amount of matter nearly coincident
(~0.05"" South-East) with the A image. Adding such a satellite also helps
improve the quasar and lens astrometry of the model, reduces the velocity
dispersion of the main lens and shifts it closer to the Fundamental Plane. This
is suggestive of a satellite galaxy to the primary lens, but its expected
luminosity and proximity to both image A and the system's bright Einstein ring
make visual identification impossible even with the existing HST data. We also
find evidence for significant structure along the line of sight toward the
lens. Archival Chandra observations show two nearby regions of extended X-ray
emission, each with bolometric X-ray luminosities of 2-3 x 10^43 ergs/s. The
brighter region is located 153"" from the lens and centered on a z=0.1
foreground cD galaxy, and the fainter and presumably more distant region is 4-5
times closer (in angular separation) to the lens and likely corresponds to the
weaker of two galaxy red sequences (which includes the lens galaxy) previously
detected at optical wavelengths.

Most of these systems show evidence of cavities in the intracluster medium

We present a new and extensive analysis of X-ray cavities in these systems. We
find that AGN are energetically able to balance radiative losses (cooling) from
the ICM in more than half of our sample. Using a subsample of 17 systems, we
examine the relationship between cooling and star formation. We find that the
star formation rates are approaching or are comparable to X-ray and far UV
limits on the rates of gas condensation onto the central galaxy. The remaining
radiative losses could be offset by AGN feedback. The vast gulf between
radiative losses and the sink of cooling material, which has been the primary
objection to cooling flows, has narrowed and, in some cases, is no longer a
serious issue. Using the cavity (jet) powers, we place strong lower limits on
the rate of growth of supermassive black holes in central galaxies, and we find
that they are growing at an average rate of ~ 0.1 solar masses per year, with
some systems growing as quickly as ~ 1 solar mass per year. We find a trend
between bulge growth (star formation) and black hole growth that is
approximately in accordance with the slope of the local (Magorrian) relation
between black hole and bulge mass. However, the large scatter in the trend
suggests that bulges and black holes do not always grow in lock step.

analysis in a Bayesian framework our entire inference is contained in the
multidimensional posterior distribution from which we can extract marginalised
parameter constraints and the comparative Bayesian evidence. Treating the
left-handed Bianchi CMB anisotropy as a template centred upon the `cold-spot'
in the southern hemisphere, the parameter estimates derived for the total
energy density, `tightness' and vorticity from 3-year data are found to be:
$\Omega_{tot} = 0.43\pm 0.04$, $h = 0.32^{+0.02}_{-0.13}$, $\omega =
9.7^{+1.6}_{-1.5}\times 10^{-10}$ with orientation $\gamma =

unity in log-evidence over a concordance cosmology alone. A Bianchi type
template is supported by the data only if its position on the sky is heavily
restricted. The low total energy density of the preferred template, implies a
geometry that is incompatible with cosmologies inferred from recent CMB
observations. Jaffe et al. found that extending the Bianchi model to include a
term in $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ creates a degeneracy in the $\Omega_m -
\Omega_{\Lambda}$ plane. We explore this region fully by MCMC and find that the
degenerate likelihood contours do not intersect areas of parameter space that 1

can confirm that a physical Bianchi ${\rm VII_h}$ model is not responsible for

indicates that the ejected shell had a low mass, the white dwarf has a high

the interactions with cosmic background radiations including the CMB and the

assumption fits well the present data at the highest energies. We compare the
cosmogenic neutrino flux from mixed composition sources to pure proton sources.
We find that the neutrino flux in the mixed composition case has a high energy
peak, mainly due to photopion production off CMB photons, of similar shape and
amplitude to the proton case. At low energies both composition cases have
significant neutrino flux with a peak around 1014.5 eV due to the higher energy
backgrounds. The mixed composition case induces a higher flux of neutrinos at
energies below 1013 eV due to the neutron decay component that extends down to
low energies. Detection of diffuse neutrino fluxes at ultra high energies can
strongly constrain the source distribution of UHECR whereas fluxes at lower
energies could be used to constrain confinement of VHE and UHE cosmic rays if
combined with composition analysis from cosmic ray experiments.

model molecular emission lines from the vicinity of a 1.4 M_J self-gravitating

commonly observed dense gas tracer, HCO+. Our main results are the following:
1. Very high lying HCO+ transitions (e.g. HCO+ J=7-6) can trace dense planet
forming clumps around circumstellar disks. Depending on the molecular
abundance, the proto-GGP may be directly imageable by the Atacama Large
Millimeter Array (ALMA). 2. HCO+ emission lines are heavily self-absorbed
through the proto-GGP's dense molecular core. This signature is nearly
ubiquitous, and only weakly dependent on assumed HCO+ abundances. The
self-absorption features are most pronounced at higher angular resolutions.
Dense clumps that are not self-gravitating only show minor self-absorption
features. 3. Line temperatures are highest through the proto-GGP at all assumed
abundances and inclination angles. Conversely, due to self-absorption in the
line, the velocity-integrated intensity may not be. High angular resolution
interferometers such as the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and ALMA may be able to
differentiate between competing theories of gas giant planet formation.

rotating neutron stars, which can form in stellar core collapse or binary
neutron star coalescence. Magnetic braking and the magnetorotational
instability (MRI) both redistribute angular momentum; the outcome of the
evolution depends on the star's mass and spin. Simulations are carried out in
axisymmetry using our recently developed codes which integrate the coupled
Einstein-Maxwell-MHD equations. For initial data, we consider three categories
of differentially rotating, equilibrium configurations, which we label normal,
hypermassive and ultraspinning. Hypermassive stars have rest masses exceeding
the mass limit for uniform rotation. Ultraspinning stars are not hypermassive,
but have angular momentum exceeding the maximum for uniform rotation at the
same rest mass. We show that a normal star will evolve to a uniformly rotating
equilibrium configuration. An ultraspinning star evolves to an equilibrium
state consisting of a nearly uniformly rotating central core, surrounded by a
differentially rotating torus with constant angular velocity along magnetic
field lines, so that differential rotation ceases to wind the magnetic field.
In addition, the final state is stable against the MRI, although it has
differential rotation. For a hypermassive neutron star, the MHD-driven angular
momentum transport leads to catastrophic collapse of the core. The resulting
rotating black hole is surrounded by a hot, massive, magnetized torus
undergoing quasistationary accretion, and a magnetic field collimated along the
spin axis--a promising candidate for the central engine of a short gamma-ray
burst. (Abridged)

simple model of single star formation from a rotating collapsing core and the
viscous evolution of the circumstellar disk. In this model, the rate of
rotation of the parent core sets the value of the `centrifugal radius' within
which the infalling matter is loaded onto the surface of the disk. As a
consequence, the disk accretion rate measured long after the dispersal of the
parental core bears the imprint of the initial conditions of star formation.
The observed trend results naturally if, at the onset of the collapse, cores of
all masses rotate with the same distribution of angular velocities, measured in

finite temperatures. The crux of the proof hinges on the existence of
low-dimensional Gauge-Like Symmetries (that notably extend and differ from
standard local gauge symmetries) and their associated defects, thus providing a
unifying framework based on a symmetry principle. These symmetries may be
actual invariances of the system, or may emerge in the low-energy sector.
Prominent examples of Topological Quantum Order display Gauge-Like Symmetries.
New systems exhibiting such symmetries include Hamiltonians depicting
orbital-dependent spin exchange and Jahn-Teller effects in transition metal
orbital compounds, short-range frustrated Klein spin models, and p+ip
superconducting arrays. We analyze the physical consequences of Gauge-Like
Symmetries (including topological terms and charges), discuss associated
braiding, and show the insufficiency of the energy spectrum, topological
entanglement entropy, maximal string correlators, and fractionalization in
establishing Topological Quantum Order. General symmetry considerations
illustrate that not withstanding spectral gaps, thermal fluctuations may impose
restrictions on certain suggested quantum computing schemes and lead to
""thermal fragility"". Our results allow us to go beyond standard topological
field theories and engineer systems with Topological Quantum Order.

properties of a short-range square-well (SW) fluid of range $\lambda$ at a
given packing fraction and reduced temperature can be represented by those of a
sticky-hard-sphere (SHS) fluid at the same packing fraction and an effective
stickiness parameter $\tau$. Such an equivalence cannot hold for the radial
distribution function since this function has a delta singularity at contact in
the SHS case, while it has a jump discontinuity at $r=\lambda$ in the SW case.
Therefore, the equivalence is explored with the cavity function $y(r)$.
Optimization of the agreement between $y_{\sw}$ and $y_{\shs}$ to first order
in density suggests the choice for $\tau$. We have performed Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations of the SW fluid for $\lambda=1.05$, 1.02, and 1.01 at several
densities and temperatures $T^*$ such that $\tau=0.13$, 0.2, and 0.5. The
resulting cavity functions have been compared with MC data of SHS fluids
obtained by Miller and Frenkel [J. Phys: Cond. Matter 16, S4901 (2004)].
Although, at given values of $\eta$ and $\tau$, some local discrepancies
between $y_{\sw}$ and $y_{\shs}$ exist (especially for $\lambda=1.05$), the SW
data converge smoothly toward the SHS values as $\lambda-1$ decreases. The
approximate mapping $y_{\sw}\to y_{\shs}$ is exploited to estimate the internal
energy and structure factor of the SW fluid from those of the SHS fluid. Taking
for $y_{\shs}$ the solution of the Percus--Yevick equation as well as the
rational-function approximation, the radial distribution function $g(r)$ of the
SW fluid is theoretically estimated and a good agreement with our MC
simulations is found. Finally, a similar study is carried out for short-range
SW fluid mixtures.

bursts in the data of ground-based interferometric detectors typically uses
`excess-power' search methods. One of the most challenging problems in the
burst-data-analysis is to distinguish between actual GW bursts and spurious
noise transients that trigger the detection algorithms. In this paper, we
present a unique and robust strategy to `veto' the instrumental glitches. This
method makes use of the phenomenological understanding of the coupling of
different detector sub-systems to the main detector output. The main idea
behind this method is that the noise at the detector output (channel H) can be
projected into two orthogonal directions in the Fourier space -- along, and
orthogonal to, the direction in which the noise in an instrumental channel X
would couple into H. If a noise transient in the detector output originates
from channel X, it leaves the statistics of the noise-component of H orthogonal
to X unchanged, which can be verified by a statistical hypothesis testing. This
strategy is demonstrated by doing software injections in simulated Gaussian
noise. We also formulate a less-rigorous, but computationally inexpensive
alternative to the above method. Here, the parameters of the triggers in
channel X are compared to the parameters of the triggers in channel H to see
whether a trigger in channel H can be `explained' by a trigger in channel X and
the measured transfer function.

approach is based on the one-loop effective action encoded in the associated
photon polarisation tensor. We concentrate on the simple case of crossed fields
aiming at possible applications of high-power lasers to measure vacuum
birefringence. A simple next-to-leading order derivative expansion reveals that
the indices of refraction increase with frequency. This signals normal
dispersion in the small-frequency regime where the derivative expansion makes
sense. To gain information beyond that regime we determine the factorial growth
of the derivative expansion coefficients evaluating the first 80 orders by
means of computer algebra. From this we can infer a nonperturbative imaginary
part for the indices of refraction indicating absorption (pair production) as
soon as energy and intensity become (super)critical. These results compare
favourably with an analytic evaluation of the polarisation tensor asymptotics.
Kramers-Kronig relations finally allow for a nonperturbative definition of the
real parts as well and show that absorption goes hand in hand with anomalous
dispersion for sufficiently large frequencies and fields.

described by the {\em density matrix} defined by the Euclidean path integral.
This yields an ensemble of universes -- a cosmological landscape -- in a mixed
state which is shown to be dynamically more preferable than the pure quantum
state of the Hartle-Hawking type. The latter is dynamically suppressed by the
infinitely large positive action of its instanton, generated by the conformal
anomaly of quantum fields within the cosmological bootstrap (the
self-consistent back reaction of hot matter). This bootstrap suggests a
solution to the problem of boundedness of the on-shell cosmological action and
eliminates the infrared catastrophe of small cosmological constant in Euclidean
quantum gravity. The cosmological landscape turns out to be limited to a
bounded range of the cosmological constant $\Lambda_{\rm min}\leq \Lambda \leq
\Lambda_{\rm max}$. The domain $\Lambda<\Lambda_{\rm min}$ is ruled out by the
back reaction effect which we analyze by solving effective Euclidean equations
of motion. The upper cutoff is enforced by the quantum effects of vacuum energy
and the conformal anomaly mediated by a special ghost-avoidance renormalization
of the effective action. They establish a new quantum scale $\Lambda_{\rm max}$
which is determined by the coefficient of the topological Gauss-Bonnet term in
the conformal anomaly. This scale is realized as the upper bound -- the
limiting point of an infinite sequence of garland-type instantons which
constitute the full cosmological landscape. The dependence of the cosmological
constant range on particle phenomenology suggests a possible dynamical
selection mechanism for the landscape of string vacua.

"physics/0605107","Dr A. N. Mitra","A. N. Mitra","Duality : A Bridge Between Physics And Philosophy?","9 pages on dvi, LaTex file, also 2 figures as PS files",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  A generalized view of Duality is offered as a bridge between physical
sciences and the more abstract philosophical dimensions bordering on mysticism.
To that end several examples of duality are first cited from from conventional
physics sectors to illustrate the obvious powers of this principle. These
include items from reciprocity in Newtonian mechanics to the problem of
measurement duality that characterizes quantum mechanics. It is also noted that
the latter has acquired a renewed interest in recent times, consequent on the
emergence of new experimental techniques for testing the actual laboratory
outcomes of traditional gedanken experiments, hitherto taken for granted.
Against this background, the Duality principle is sought to be extended to the
mystical domain, with convincing examples from various human level experiences.

  as a beam divergence diagnostic","40 pages 18 Figures. accepted for publication in PRSTAB",,"10.1103/PhysRevSTAB.9.052802",,"physics.acc-ph",,"  We have observed the interference of optical diffraction radiation (ODR) and
optical transition radiation (OTR) produced by the interaction of a
relativistic electron beam with a micromesh foil and a mirror. The production
of forward directed ODR from electrons passing through the holes and wires of
the mesh and their separate interactions with backward OTR from the mirror are
analyzed with the help of a simulation code. By careful choice of the micromesh
properties, mesh-mirror spacing, observation wavelength and filter band pass,
the interference of the ODR produced from the unperturbed electrons passing
through the open spaces of the mesh and OTR from the mirror are observable
above a broad incoherent background from interaction of the heavily scattered
electrons passing through the mesh wires. These interferences (ODTRI) are
sensitive to the beam divergence and can be used to directly diagnose this
parameter. We compare experimental divergence values obtained using ODTRI,
conventional OTRI, for the case when front foil scattering is negligible, and
computed values obtained from transport code calculations and multiple screen
beam size measurements. We obtain good agreement in all cases.

Rost","Antiblockade in Rydberg excitation of an ultracold lattice gas","4 pages, 6 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.023002",,"physics.atom-ph",,"  It is shown that the two-step excitation scheme typically used to create an
ultracold Rydberg gas can be described with an effective two-level rate
equation, greatly reducing the complexity of the optical Bloch equations. This
allows us to solve the many-body problem of interacting cold atoms with a Monte
Carlo technique. Our results reproduce the Rydberg blockade effect. However, we
demonstrate that an Autler-Townes double peak structure in the two-step
excitation scheme, which occurs for moderate pulse lengths as used in the
experiment, can give rise to an antiblockade effect. It is observable in a
lattice gas with regularly spaced atoms. Since the antiblockade effect is
robust against a large number of lattice defects it should be experimentally
realizable with an optical lattice created by CO$_{2}$ lasers.

t=0, a wedge shape. As a wedge is scale-free, the fluid relaxation dynamics are
self-similar. We find the dynamic exponent of this self-similar flow and show
that the interface shape is given by the solution of an unusual inverse problem
of potential theory. We solve this inverse problem analytically for an almost
flat wedge, and numerically otherwise. The wedge solution is useful for
analysis of pinch-off singularities.

entropy from the point of view of condensed matter, quantum field theory and
quantum information. An explicit computation in arbitrary dimensions of the
geometric entropy of the ground state of a discretized scalar free field theory
shows the expected area law result. In this case, area law scaling is a
manifestation of a deeper reordering of the vacuum produced by majorization
relations. Furthermore, the explicit control on all the eigenvalues of the
reduced density matrix allows for a verification of entropy loss along the
renormalization group trajectory driven by the mass term. A further result of
our computation shows that single-copy entanglement also obeys area law
scaling, majorization relations and decreases along renormalization group
flows.

of the propagation illustrates how the width as a function of distance
determines the velocity and accelerations of the particle. The model entails
the disappearance of action-at-a-distance problem, and that interactions are
