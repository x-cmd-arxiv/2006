assembly history, a dependence we term `assembly bias'. Using a galaxy
formation model grafted onto the Millennium Simulation of the LCDM cosmogony,
we study how assembly bias affects galaxy clustering. We compare the original
simulation to `shuffled' versions where the galaxy populations are randomly
swapped among halos of similar mass, thus isolating the effects of correlations
between assembly history and environment at fixed mass. Such correlations are
ignored in the halo occupation distribution models often used populate dark
matter simulations with galaxies, but they are significant in our more
realistic simulation. Assembly bias enhances 2-point correlations by 10% for
galaxies with M_bJ-5logh brighter than -17, but suppresses them by a similar
amount for galaxies brighter than -20. When such samples are split by colour,
assembly bias is 5% stronger for red galaxies and 5% weaker for blue ones. Halo
central galaxies are differently affected by assembly bias than are galaxies of
all types. It almost doubles the correlation amplitude for faint red central
galaxies. Shuffling galaxies among halos of fixed formation redshift or
concentration in addition to fixed mass produces biases which are not much
smaller than when mass alone is fixed. Assembly bias must reflect a correlation
of environment with aspects of halo assembly which are not encoded in either of
these parameters. It induces effects which could compromise precision
measurements of cosmological parameters from large galaxy surveys.

  The locus of distant LIRGs in the diagram defined by Hdelta_A and D4000 is
roughly comparable to that of local LIRGs observed with IRAS, suggesting that
no trend for an evolution is detected between the local and distant LIRGs. We
obtain similar results when using either the H8 or the H$\delta_A$ Balmer

  We compute a birthrate parameter (b=SFR/<SFR>) of 4\pm1, confirming that the
distant LIRGs are currently experiencing a major phase of star formation. The
most likely duration of the bursts is 0.10 Gyr, during which the LIRGs produce
5-10 % of their current stellar mass. No evidence is found for successive
starbursts on the scale of a few times $10^7$ yr, such as those predicted by
some numerical simulations of major mergers. However, the large number density
of those galaxies suggest that they could experience between two and four LIRG

the shell are just intermediate between those of the neutral medium and
molecular clouds observed by the CO emission. The dense shell with cold HI/H_2
gas easily becomes gravitationally unstable, and breaks up into small clouds.
The cooling layer just behind the shock front also suffers from thermal
instability, and will fragment into cloudlets with some translational motions.
We suggest that the predicted cold ``dark'' HI/H_2 gas should be detected as
the HI self-absorption (HISA) feature. We have sought such features in recent
observational data, and found shell-like HISA features around the giant HII

of structure formation that incorporate galactic outflows. Our main result is
that outflow parameterizations based on momentum-driven winds as seen in local
starburst galaxies provide the best agreement with observations of CIV
absorption at z~2-5. Such models sufficiently enrich the high-z IGM to produce
a global mass density of CIV absorbers that is relatively invariant from z=5.5
to 1.5, in agreement with observations. This occurs despite an increase in the
volume-averaged metallicity by x5-10 over this redshift range, because energy
input from outflows causes a drop in the global ionization fraction of CIV.
Comparisons to observed CIV column density and linewidth distributions and
CIV-based pixel optical depth ratios provide significant constraints on wind
models. Our best-fitting models show mean IGM temperatures only slightly above
our no-outflow case, metal filling factors of just a few % with volume-weighted
metallicities around 0.001 at z~3, significant amounts of collisionally-ionized
CIV absorption, and a metallicity-density relationship that rises rapidly at
low overdensities and flattens at higher ones. In general, we find that outflow
speeds must be high enough to enrich the low-density IGM at early times but low
enough not to overheat it, and concurrently must significantly suppress early
star formation while still producing enough early metals. It is therefore
non-trivial that locally-calibrated momentum-driven wind scenarios naturally
yield the desired strength and evolution of outflows, and suggest that such
models represent a significant step towards understanding the impact of
galactic outflows on galaxies and the IGM across cosmic time.

effective at dispersing gas and rapidly injecting energy into the ISM. The
observational signature of such powerful feedback is a warm SED. In general,
simulations performed with starburst driven winds have colder spectra and
reprocess more of their emission into the infrared, resulting in higher
infrared to bolometric luminosities compared to (otherwise equivalent)

30322-023 is also remarkable in having the lowest surface gravity (log g <=

indicates that this star is presently a thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant
branch (TP-AGB) star, with no strong indication of binarity thus far (although
a signal of period 192 d is clearly present in the radial-velocity data, this
is likely due to pulsation of the stellar envelope). We show that low-mass
TP-AGB stars are not expected to be exceedingly rare in a magnitude-limited
sample such as the HK survey, because their high luminosities make it possible
to sample them over a very large volume. The strong N overabundance and the low
12C/13C ratio (4) in this star is typical of the operation of the CN cycle.
Coupled with a Na overabundance and the absence of a strong C overabundance,
this pattern seems to imply that hot-bottom burning operated in this star,
which should then have a mass of at least 2 Msun. However, the luminosity
associated with this mass would put the star at a distance of about 50 kpc, in
the outskirts of the galactic halo. We explore alternative scenarios in which
the observed abundance pattern results from some mixing mechanism yet to be
identified occurring in a single low-metallicity 0.8 Msun AGB star, or from
pollution by matter from an intermediate-mass AGB companion which has undergone
hot-bottom burning. We stress, however, that our abundances may be subject to

  AIMS. HD 210111 was selected for a detailed multisite pulsation study to
determine whether its pulsation properties differ from those of normal A stars.
  METHODS. 262 hours of high-precision photometry were obtained at the SAAO and
SSO observatories.
  RESULTS. 13 statistically significant pulsation frequencies were detected
with very small photometric amplitudes from 1 to 7 millimag in the visual. A
comparison with earlier 1994 measurements indicates a small increase in
amplitude. As a byproduct, one of the comparison stars, HD 210571, was
discovered to be a millimag variable with a frequency of 1.235 c/d and is
probably a new Gamma Doradus variable. The observed wide range of excited
frequencies from 12 to 30 c/d in HD 210111 can be explained with both the
single- and double-star hypothesis. HD 210111 is in a similar evolutionary
status to FG Vir, which also shows a wide range of excited frequencies with a
similar frequency spacing near 4 c/d. This is interpreted as successive radial
orders of the excited nonradial modes. In the double-star hypothesis previously
evoked for HD 210111, the low and the high frequencies originate in different
stars: here HD 210111 would resemble Theta^2 Tau.
  CONCLUSIONS. The pulsation of the Lambda Bootis star HD 210111 does not
differ from that of normal Delta Scuti stars.

distances to galaxies for which single stars cannot be resolved. Up to now, the
method has been calibrated mainly at red colours due to the intrinsic faintness
of blue early-type galaxies. In this paper we address the I-band calibration of
the SBF method at blue colours, the regime of dwarf elliptical galaxies (dEs).
We present deep and wide-field VI photometry of the central Fornax cluster
obtained at Las Campanas Observatory. With these data we perform an SBF
analysis of 25 dEs in the range -16.5<M_V<-11.2 mag, 0.8<(V-I)_0<1.10 mag. For
the calibration analysis we exclude eight dEs whose SBF measurement was
affected by poor seeing (FWHM ~ 1""). Our SBF data are inconsistent at the 3
sigma level with a colour independent absolute SBF magnitude Mbar_I, presenting
a problem for SBF models that predict such a flat relation. There is a weak
indication in our data (1.8 sigma) to favour a two-branch calibration over a
one-branch calibration with broad scatter in the Mbar_I - (V-I) plane. We
obtain the following one-branch empirical SBF calibration:
  Mbar_I=-2.13 (+/- 0.17) + 2.44 (+/- 1.94) * [(V-I)_0 - 1.00] mag.
  We deduce a 0.34 +/- 0.14 mag cosmic scatter of Mbar_I, which is
significantly larger than found at redder colours. This is in agreement with
those theoretical SBF models that predict Mbar_I to be more sensitive to
age-metallicity variations in the blue than in the red. We find evidence that
the fainter galaxies in our samples contain younger and more metal-rich stellar
populations than the brighter ones. The application of our empirical
calibration to published SBF measurements of Hydra and Centaurus cluster dEs
leaves the distances to both clusters unchanged.

young stellar object is reported. High resolution radio continuum maps of S140
IRS 1 reveal a highly elongated source that is perpendicular to the larger
scale bipolar molecular outflow. This picture is confirmed by location of a
small scale monopolar near-IR reflection nebula at the base of the blueshifted
lobe. A second epoch of observations over a five year baseline show little
ordered outward proper motion of clumps as would have been expected for a jet.
A third epoch, taken only 50 days after the second, did show significant
changes in the radio morphology. These radio properties can all be understood
in the context of an equatorial wind driven by radiation pressure from the
central star and inner disc acting on the gas in the surface layers of the disc
as proposed by Drew et al. (1998). This equatorial wind system is briefly
compared with the one in S106IR, and contrasted with other massive young
stellar objects that drive ionized jets.

the pulsar wind termination shock is believed to be responsible for TeV
gamma-ray signal recently reported from the binary system PSR B1259-63/SS2883.
While this process can explain the energy spectrum of the observed TeV
emission, the detected gamma-ray fluxes do not agree with the published
theoretical predictions of the TeV lightcurve. The main objective of this paper
is to show that the HESS results can be explained, under certain reasonable
assumptions, by inverse Compton scenarios of gamma-ray production in the
system. In this paper we study evolution of the energy spectra of relativistic
electrons under different assumptions about the acceleration and energy-loss
rates of electrons, and the impact of these processes on the lightcurve of IC
gamma-rays. We demonstrate that the observed TeV lightcurve can be explained
(i) by adiabatic losses which dominate over the entire trajectory of the pulsar
with a significant increase towards the periastron, or (ii) by the sub-TeV
cutoffs in the energy spectra of electrons due to the enhanced rate of Compton
losses close to the periastron. The Compton deceleration of the pulsar wind
contributes to the decrease of the nonthermal power released in the accelerated
electrons, and thus to the reduction of the IC and synchrotron components of
radiation close to the periastron. Although this effect alone cannot explain
the observed lightcurves, the Comptonization of the pulsar wind leads to the
formation of gamma-radiation with a line-type energy spectrum. While the HESS
data already constrain the Lorentz factor of the wind, $\Gamma \le 10^6$,
future observations of this object with GLAST should allow a deep probe of the
wind Lorentz factor in the range between $10^4$ and $10^6$.

marginally higher in the outer parts. The mass in these populations, along with
that in the gas component, make up for the inferred dynamical mass in the same
annular zone for a Kroupa initial mass function, with a low mass cut-off
m_l=0.4 Msun. The observed ratio of the abundances of alpha elements with
respect to Fe, is also consistent with the idea that almost all the stars in
M82 disk formed in a burst of short duration (0.3 Gyr) around 0.8 Gyr ago. We
find that the optical/near infrared colors and their gradients in the disk are
determined by the reddening with visual extinction exceeding 1 mag even in the

The disk-wide starburst activity was most likely triggered by the interaction
of M82 with its massive neighbor M81 around 1~Gyr ago. The properties of the

orders of magnitude. In this paper we show that strong bounds on the pre-BBN
evolution of the Universe may be derived, under the assumption that dark matter
is a thermal relic, by combining the dark matter relic density bound with
constraints coming from the production of cosmic-ray antiprotons by dark matter
annihilation in the Galaxy. The limits we derive can be sizable and apply to
the Hubble rate around the temperature of dark matter decoupling. For dark
matter masses lighter than 100 GeV, the bound on the Hubble-rate enhancement
ranges from a factor of a few to a factor of 30, depending on the actual
cosmological model, while for a mass of 500 GeV the bound falls in the range
50-500. Uncertainties in the derivation of the bounds and situations where the
bounds become looser are discussed. We finally discuss how these limits apply
to some specific realizations of non-standard cosmologies: a scalar-tensor

discuss a mechanism to generate a large $r_c$, assuming that it is determined

defined by a flat bulk and an inflating brane (self-accelerated or not). We
also include the flat brane limit. The quantum fluctuations of the bulk field
$\Psi$ provide an effective potential for $r_c$. For a flat brane, the 1-loop
effective potential is of the Coleman-Weinberg form, and admits a minimum for
large $r_c$ without fine tuning. When we take into account the brane curvature,
a sizeable contribution at the classical level changes this picture and the
potential develops a (minimum) maximum for the (non-) self-accelerated branch.

condensation). It is assumed that the modulus crosses an enhanced symmetry
point (ESP) in field space. Particle production at the ESP temporarily traps
the modulus resulting in a brief period of inflation. More inflation follows,
due to the flatness of the potential, since the ESP generates either an
extremum (maximum or minimum) or a flat inflection point in the scalar
potential. Eventually, the potential becomes steep again and inflation is
terminated. After reheating the modulus freezes due to cosmological friction at
a large value, such that its scalar potential is dominated by contributions due
to fluxes in the extra dimensions or other effects. The modulus remains frozen
until the present, when it can become quintessence and account for the dark
energy necessary to explain the observed accelerated expansion.

\nu(x) = \nu P_t(x)/(\sum_{y\in\Lambda}\nu P_t(y)), with P_t the transition
probabilities for the process with rates Q.
  A Fleming-Viot (fv) process is a system of N particles moving in \Lambda.
Each particle moves independently with rates Q until it hits the absorbing
state 0; but then instantaneously chooses one of the N-1 particles remaining in
\Lambda and jumps to its position. Between absorptions each particle moves with
rates Q independently.

prove existence of qsd for Q; uniqueness has been proven by Jacka and Roberts.

average fraction of nodes that remain undamaged vanishes in the large system
limit, a phenomenon we refer to as exhaustive percolation. We derive scaling
law exponents and exact results for the distribution of the number of undamaged
nodes, valid for a broad class of random networks at the exhaustive percolation
transition and in the exhaustive percolation regime. This class includes
processes that determine the set of frozen nodes in random Boolean networks
with indegree distributions that decay sufficiently rapidly with the number of
inputs. Connections between our calculational methods and previous studies of
percolation beginning from a single initial node are also pointed out. Central
to our approach is the observation that key aspects of damage spreading on a
random network are fully characterized by a single function specifying the
probability that a given node will be damaged as a function of the fraction of
damaged nodes. In addition to our analytical investigations of random networks,
we present a numerical example of exhaustive percolation on a directed lattice.

strategy of the receiver. Moreover, if the concealing property holds only
approximately, the cheat goes undetected with a high probability, which we
explicitly estimate. The proof uses an explicit formalization of general two
party protocols, which is applicable to more general situations, and a new
estimate about the continuity of the Stinespring dilation of a general quantum
channel. The result also provides a natural characterization of protocols that
fall outside the standard setting of unlimited available technology, and thus
may allow secure bit commitment. We present a new such protocol whose security,
perhaps surprisingly, relies on decoherence in the receiver's lab.

not distillable when every qubit is seperated from each other; but it makes two
separated qubit entangled if the other qubits group together. Here the feature
is applied to quantum secret sharing, a QSS protocol similar to Ekert 91
protocol of QKD is proposed. The security problem, disadvantage and advantageof
this protocol are disscused.
