consistent with the unification scheme. Also there is a tendency for the
detection rate as well as the column density for galaxies to increase with core
prominence, f_c, a statistical indicator of the orientation of the jet axis to
the line of sight. This can be understood in a scenario where radio sources are
larger than the scale of the circumnuclear HI disk so that the lines of sight
to the lobes at very large inclinations do not intersect the disk. The sources
in our sample also exhibit the known anti-correlation between HI column density
and source size. This suggests that small linear size, along with intermediate
values of core prominence, is a good recipe for detecting 21-cm absorption in
CSS and GPS objects. Some of the absorption could also be arising from clouds
which may have interacted with the radio jet. The HI column density and
velocity shift of the primary absorption component, however, show no dependence
on the degree of misalignment and the separation ratio of the radio sources.

it is possible to distinguish the metal content (Z) and star-formation history

whether their formation history is linked to their detailed morphology and
position on the Fundamental Plane. From a detailed analysis of UV-optical
spectrophotometry of the `cuspy' elliptical galaxy NGC 3605 and the giant
elliptical NGC 5018 we find that: 1) optical spectra with l > 3500 A may not
contain sufficient data to robustly uncover all the stellar populations present
in individual galaxies, even in such relatively passive objects as ellipticals,
2) the addition of the UV data approaching l = 2500 A holds the key to
establishing well-constrained sfhs, from which we can infer a formation and
evolution history which is consistent with their photometric properties, 3)
despite the superficial similarity of their spectra, the two galaxies have very
different `recent' sfhs -- the smaller, cuspy elliptical NGC 3605 contains a
high-Z population of age ~= 1 Gyr, and has a position on the fundamental plane
typical of the product of a low-z gas-rich merger (most likely at z ~ 0.08),
while the giant elliptical NGC 5018, with a sub-solar secondary population,
appears to have gained its more recent stars via mass transfer / accretion of
gas from its spiral companion, 4) despite these differences in detailed
history, more than 85% of the stellar mass of both galaxies is associated with
an old (9-12 Gyr) stellar population of near-solar Z. This pilot study provides
strong motivation for the construction and analysis of high-quality UV-optical

HS1700+6416, we predict the metal line content of the far-UV spectral range by
modelling 18 metal absorption line systems with redshifts 0.2<z<2.6 identified
in the spectrum of this quasar. For that purpose, we investigate the spectral
energy distribution of the metagalactic ionizing radiation field. Simple
photoionization models based on 8 different shapes of the ionizing background
are tested for each system. The adopted energy distributions comprise the
Haardt & Madau (2001, HM) model of metagalactic UV background as well as
typical spectra of AGN and starburst galaxies. The models are evaluated and the
favoured one is estimated. We find that the majority of the considered systems
is best reproduced with a HM-like ionizing radiation, where the HeII break,
formally located at 4 Ryd, is shifted to lower energies (~3 Ryd), probably due
to the opacity of the higher HeII Lyman series lines. The remaining systems can
be reasonably described with models based on the unmodified HM background or
the spectra of AGN or starburst galaxies. This finding supports the idea that
the UV background is spatially variable due to both IGM opacity variations and
to local sources. In comparison to an unmodified HM background, the resulting
ionizing spectrum leads to carbon abundances lower by ~0.5 dex. Furthermore, if
the ionizing radiation field as determined from metal line systems was typical
for the IGM, the expected HeII/HI ratio would be 150 to 190.

the flux from bright Galactic point sources whereas the wide field of view
permits to collect large flux from the underlying GRXE. Extensive study of the

the detector count rate with $\sim1-2$% accuracy in the energy band 17-60 keV.
The derived longitude and latitude profiles of the ridge emission are in good
agreement with the Galactic distribution of stars obtained from infrared
observations. This, along with the measured hard X-ray spectrum of the Galactic
ridge emission strongly indicates its stellar origin. The derived unit stellar
mass emissivity of the ridge in the energy band 17-60 keV, $(0.9 - 1.2)\times

agrees with that of local (in the Solar neigborhood) accreting magnetic white

addition, the shape of the obtained GRXE spectrum can be used to determine the
average mass of white dwarfs in such systems in the Galaxy as $\sim0.5

of observations when period searching. We address the best way to place a
limited number of observations to cover the dynamic range of frequencies
required by an observer. We show that an observation distribution geometrically
spaced in time can minimise aliasing effects arising from sparse sampling,
substantially improving signal detection quality. The base of the geometric
series is however a critical factor in the overall success of this strategy.
Further, we show that for such an optimal distribution observations may be
reordered, as long as the distribution of spacings is preserved, with almost no
loss of quality. This implies that optimal observing strategies can retain
significant flexibility in the face of scheduling constraints, by providing
scope for on-the-fly adaptation. Finally, we present optimal geometric
samplings for a wide range of common observing scenarios, with an emphasis on
practical application by the observer at the telescope. Such a sampling
represents the best practical empirical solution to the undersampling problem
that we are aware of. The technique has applications to robotic telescope and
satellite observing strategies, where target acquisition overheads mean that a
greater total target exposure time (and hence signal-to-noise) can often in
practice be achieved by limiting the number of observations.

with source size, as reported earlier by Pihlstr\""om et al. The HI column
density shows no significant dependence on either redshift or luminosity, which
are themselves strongly correlated. These results suggest that the environments
of radio sources on GPS/CSS scales are similar at different redshifts. Further,
in accordance with the unification scheme, the GPS/CSS galaxies have an HI
detection rate of ~40% which is significantly higher than the detection rate
(~20%) towards the GPS/CSS quasars. Also, the principal (strongest) absorption

the average age and metallicity of spiral galaxies. In this paper we
reconstruct these composite grids using simple stellar population models from
several different groups convolved with some plausible functional forms of star
formation histories at fixed metallicity. We find that the youngest populations
present (t<2 Gyr) dominate the light, and because of their presence the
age-metallicity degeneracy can be partially broken with broad-band colors,
unlike older populations. The scatter among simple stellar population models by
different authors is, however, large at ages t<2 Gyr. The dominant
uncertainties in stellar population models arise from convective core overshoot
assumptions and the treatment of the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch
phase and helium abundance may play a significant role at higher metallicities.
Real spiral galaxies are unlikely to have smooth, exponential star formation
histories, and burstiness will cause a partial reversion to the single-burst
case, which has even larger model-to-model scatter. Finally, it is emphasized
that the current composite stellar population models need some implementation
of chemical enrichment histories for the proper analysis of the observational
data.

total emitted energy. Although it shares with GRB 031203 the total energetics,
it is not an outlier with respect to the Amati correlation. We then investigate

insight into the multiplicity of young stars but only for massive, distant

a result of the amount of cold gas available during the major merger. Mergers

detection of ionized molecular gas emission at high redshift (z>2). HCO+
emission is a star formation indicator similar to HCN, tracing dense molecular
hydrogen gas (n(H_2) ~= 10^5 cm^{-3}) within star-forming molecular clouds. We
derive a lensing-corrected HCO+ line luminosity of L'(HCO+) = 3.5 x 10^9 K km/s

relationships found for low-z star-forming galaxies. However, a HCO+/HCN
luminosity ratio close to unity would not be expected for the Cloverleaf if the
recently suggested relation between this ratio and the far-infrared luminosity
were to hold. We conclude that a ratio between HCO+ and HCN luminosity close to
1 is likely due to the fact that the emission from both lines is optically
thick and thermalized and emerges from dense regions of similar volumes. The
CO, HCN and HCO+ luminosities suggest that the Cloverleaf is a composite
AGN--starburst system, in agreement with the previous finding that about 20% of

powerful central engines only indirectly, even at X-ray energies. Using high
spatial resolution and considering only galaxies that do not contain
circumnuclear starbursts, we reveal the variety of emission AGNs alone may
produce. Approximately 1% of the continuum's intrinsic flux is detected in
reflection in each case. The only hard X-ray feature is the prominent Fe K
alpha fluorescence line, with equivalent width greater than 1 keV in all
sources. The Fe line luminosity provides the best X-ray indicator of the unseen
intrinsic AGN luminosity. In detail, the morphologies of the extended soft
X-ray emission and optical line emission are similar, and line emission
dominates the soft X-ray spectra. Thus, we attribute the soft X-ray emission to
material that the central engines photoionize. Because the resulting spectra
are complex and do not reveal the AGNs directly, crude analysis techniques such
as hardness ratios would mis-classify these galaxies as hosts of intrinsically
weak, unabsorbed AGNs and would fail to identify the luminous, absorbed nuclei
that are present. We demonstrate that a three-band X-ray diagnostic can
correctly classify Compton thick AGNs, even when significant soft X-ray line
emission is present. The active nuclei produce most of the galaxies' total
observed emission over a broad spectral range, and much of their light emerges
at far-infrared wavelengths. Stellar contamination of the infrared emission can
be severe, however, making long-wavelength data alone unreliable indicators of

emitted by these stars penetrate the atomic medium around their host halos,
generating Lyman alpha photons that couple the spin and kinetic temperatures.
These creates a region we call the Lyman alpha sphere, visible in 21-cm against
the CMB, which is much larger than the HII region produced by the same star.
The spin and kinetic temperatures are strongly coupled before the X-rays can
substantially heat the medium, implying that a strong 21-cm absorption signal
from the adiabatically cooled gas in Hubble expansion around the star is
expected when the medium has not been heated previously. A central region of
emission from the gas heated by the soft X-rays is also present although with a
weaker signal than the absorption. The Lyman alpha sphere is a universal
signature that should be observed around any first star illuminating its
vicinity for the first time. The 21-cm radial profile of the Lyman alpha sphere
can be calculated as a function of the luminosity, spectrum and age of the
star. For a star of a few hundred solar masses and zero metallicity (as
expected for the first stars), the physical radius of the Lyman alpha sphere
can reach tens of kiloparsecs. The first metal-free stars should be strongly
clustered because of high cosmic biasing; this implies that the regions
producing a 21-cm absorption signal may contain more than one star and will
generally be irregular and not spherical, because of the complex distribution
of the gas. We discuss the feasiblity of detecting these Lyman alpha spheres,
which would be present at redshifts $z\sim 30$ in the Cold Dark Matter model.
Their observation would represent a direct proof of the detection of a first

the well-known turbulent diamagnetic and paramagnetic velocities. The nonlinear
drift velocities of the mean magnetic field cause the small-scale magnetic
buoyancy and magnetic pumping effects in the turbulent convection. These
phenomena are different from the large-scale magnetic buoyancy and magnetic
pumping effects which are due to the effect of the mean magnetic field on the
large-scale density stratified fluid flow. The small-scale magnetic buoyancy
and magnetic pumping can be stronger than these large-scale effects when the
mean magnetic field is smaller than the equipartition field. We discuss the
small-scale magnetic buoyancy and magnetic pumping effects in the context of
the solar and stellar turbulent convection. We demonstrate also that the
nonlinear turbulent magnetic diffusion in the turbulent convection is
anisotropic even for a weak mean magnetic field. In particular, it is enhanced
in the radial direction. The magnetic fluctuations due to the small-scale
dynamo increase the turbulent magnetic diffusion of the toroidal component of

the complexity of the model, in contrast with the partial covering model which
requires the addition of either a low metalicity (<0.03 solar) thermal plasma

requires moving, clumpy, material relatively close to the source that result in
two distinct lines of sight, with separate absorbing columns that each vary
considerably without any associated change in their covering fractions, in
order to explain the observed variability. We associate the warm absorber

the high-density inner region. Our CO(3-2) map reveals the presence of a
bipolar outflow driven by the Class I protostar Ced 110 IRS 4 but we do not

Conclusions: Cha-MMS1 appears to have already formed a compact object, either
the first hydrostatic core at the very end of the prestellar phase, or an
extremely young protostar that has not yet powered any outflow, at the very

very young and old stellar populations, with observed rates that depend on the
stellar mass and mean star-formation rates (SFRs) of their host galaxies.
Models where the SN Ia rate depends solely on host galaxy stellar mass are
ruled out with 99% confidence. Our analysis is based on 100
spectroscopically-confirmed SNe Ia, plus 24 photometrically-classified events,
all from the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) and distributed over 0.2<z<0.75.
Using multi-band photometry, we estimate stellar masses and SFRs for the SN Ia
host galaxies by fitting their broad-band spectral energy distributions with
the galaxy spectral synthesis code, PEGASE.2. We show that the SN Ia rate per
unit mass is proportional to the specific SFR of the parent galaxies -- more
vigorously star-forming galaxies host more SNe Ia per unit stellar mass,
broadly equivalent to the trend of increasing SN Ia rate in later-type galaxies
seen in the local universe. Following earlier suggestions for a simple
""two-component"" model approximating the SN Ia rate, we find bivariate linear
dependencies of the SN Ia rate on both the stellar masses and the mean SFRs of
the host systems. We also demonstrate a dependence of distant SN Ia light-curve
shapes on star-formation in the host galaxy, similar to trends observed
locally. Passive galaxies, with no star-formation, preferentially host
faster-declining/dimmer SNe Ia, while slower-declining/brighter events are only
found in systems with ongoing star-formation. We model the light-curve width
distribution in star-forming galaxies as the sum of a young component, and an
old component taken from the distribution in non-star-forming galaxies.

Keplerian to good approximation, the torques efficiently change the magnitude

stars are rapidly randomized. The galactic MBH is a good system for the
observational study of resonant relaxation. The age of the young B-stars at a

their dynamical coherence. Resonant relaxation dynamics dominates the event
rate of gravitational wave (GW) emission from inspiraling stars into MBHs of

surrounding ISM, links between star formation and AGN activity and the radio
source triggering mechanism. Here we present the results of a spectroscopic
analysis of this source, considering each of these aspects of radio source
physics.
  We find that shock ionization by the young radio source is important in the
central regions of the galaxy on scales similar to that of the radio source
itself, whilst evidence for an AGN ionization cone is observed at greater
distances. Line and continuum features require the presence of a young stellar
population, the best-fit model for which implies an age of 5x10^6 years,
significantly older than the radio source.
  Most interestingly, the relative sizes of radio source and extended emission
line region suggest that both AGN and radio source are triggered at
approximately the same time.
  If both the triggering of the radio source activity and the formation of the
young stellar population had the same underlying cause, this source provides a
sequence for the events surrounding the triggering process. We propose that the
AGN activity in 9C J1503+4528 was causedby a relatively minor interaction, and
that a super-massive black hole powering the radio jets must have been in place

externally applied longitudinal electric field is established. And then the
equations of motion for the bosonic phase fields are solved in the Fourier
space, with which the both charge and spin conductivities for the system are
calculated analytically based on the linear response theory. Generally, the ac
conductivity is an oscillation function of the strengths of electron-electron
interaction, Rashba SOC and magnetic field, as well as the driving frequency
and the measurement position in the wire. Through analysis with some examples
it is demonstrated that the modification on the conductivity due to
electron-electron interactions is more remarkable than that due to SOC, while
the effects of SOC and Zeeman splitting on the conductivity are very similar.
The spin-polarized conductivities for the system in the absence of Zeeman
effect or SOC are also discussed, respectively. The ratio of the spin-polarized
conductivities $\sigma_\uparrow/\sigma_\downarrow$ is dependent of the
electron-electron interactions for the system without SOC, while it is
independent of the electron-electron interactions for the system without Zeeman
splitting.

practically absent in the case of electron transport; (ii) Noise fluctuations

generates relic gravitational waves by amplifying their zero-point quantum
oscillations. We begin our discussion by contrasting the concepts of relic
gravitational waves and inflationary `tensor modes'. We explain and summarize
the properties of relic gravitational waves that are needed to derive their
effects on CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies. The radiation field
is characterized by four invariants I, V, E, B. We reduce the radiative
transfer equations to a single integral equation of Voltairre type and solve it
analytically and numerically. We formulate the correlation functions
C^{XX'}_{\ell} for X, X'= T, E, B and derive their amplitudes, shapes and
oscillatory features. Although all of our main conclusions are supported by
exact numerical calculations, we obtain them, in effect, analytically by
developing and using accurate approximations. We show that the TE correlation
at lower \ell's must be negative (i.e. an anticorrelation), if it is caused by
gravitational waves, and positive if it is caused by density perturbations.
This difference in TE correlation may be a signature more valuable
observationally than the lack or presence of the BB correlation, since the TE
signal is about 100 times stronger than the expected BB signal. We discuss the
detection by WMAP of the TE anticorrelation at \ell \approx 30 and show that
such an anticorrelation is possible only in the presence of a significant
amount of relic gravitational waves (within the framework of all other common
assumptions). We propose models containing considerable amounts of relic
gravitational waves that are consistent with the measured TT, TE and EE
correlations.

an explanation of multiplets of nearly degenerate seen in highly excited
hadrons. The conjecture depends on the states being insensitive to the dynamics
of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. A key question is whether this concept
is well defined in QCD. This paper shows that it is by means of an explicit
formal construction. This construction allows one to characterize this
sensitivity for any observable calculable in QCD in Euclidean space via a
functional integral. The construction depends on a generalization of the
Banks-Casher theorem. It exploits the fact that {\it all} dynamics sensitive to
spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking observables in correlation functions arise
from fermion modes of zero virtuality (in the infinite volume limit), while
such modes make {\it no} contribution to any of the dynamics which preserves
chiral symmetry. In principle this construction can be implemented in lattice
QCD. The prospect of a practical lattice implementation yielding a direct
numerical test of the concept of effective chiral restoration is discussed.

investigate the question of how to modify G combinatorially to obtain a
sequentially Cohen-Macaulay graph. We focus on modifications given by adding
configurations of whiskers to G, where to add a whisker one adds a new vertex
and an edge connecting this vertex to an existing vertex in G. We give various
sufficient conditions and necessary conditions on a subset S of the vertices of
G so that the graph G \cup W(S), obtained from G by adding a whisker to each
vertex in S, is a sequentially Cohen-Macaulay graph. For instance, we show that
if S is a vertex cover of G, then G \cup W(S) is a sequentially Cohen-Macaulay
graph. On the other hand, we show that if G \backslash S is not sequentially
Cohen-Macaulay, then G \cup W(S) is not a sequentially Cohen-Macaulay graph.
Our work is inspired by and generalizes a result of Villarreal on the use of
whiskers to get Cohen-Macaulay graphs.

parameter, the maximal invariance property of ordinary ranks is lost to the

random vectors. We show that as n grows, however, the bound is also
asymptotically attained in the cases of n-dimensional Student-t and Student-r
distributions. A complete analytical study is performed in a special case of a
Student-t distribution. We also show numerically that this effect exists for
the particular case of a n-dimensional Cauchy variable, whatever the Renyi
entropy considered, extending the results of Abe and illustrating the
analytical asymptotic study of the student-t case. In the Student-r case, we
show numerically that the same behavior occurs for uniformly distributed

interesting since they show that this asymptotic behavior cannot be considered

strips. The strips will have area $2/n$ and exhibit a variety of lengths,
orientations and anisotropies. The strips are partitioned into anisotropy
classes; each class is organized as a directed graph whose vertices all are
strips of the same anisotropy and whose edges link such strips to their ``good
continuations.'' The point-cloud data are reduced to counts that measure
membership in strips. Each anisotropy graph is reduced to a subgraph that
consist of strips with significant counts. The algorithm rejects $\mathbf{H}_0$
whenever some such subgraph contains a path that connects many consecutive
significant counts.

field is assumed to be two-dimensional and incompressible, and composed of a
steady zonal flow with an isolated maximum (a zonal jet) on which two or more
travelling Rossby waves are superimposed. The associated Lagrangian motion is
studied with the aid of KAM (Kolmogorov--Arnold--Moser) theory, including
nontrivial extensions of well-known results. These extensions include
applicability of the theory when the usual statements of nondegeneracy are

intersection of septa with the external shell generates a curve called the
suture line, which in living and most fossil Nautili is fairly uncomplicated.
In contrast, suture lines of ancient ammonoid were gently curved and during the

forward to explain the complexity of suture ammonoid lines. Calculations
presented here lend support to the hypothesis that complex suture lines aided
in counteracting the effect of the external water pressure. Additionally, it is

probability measure defined on it. The way in which a mathematical model of
this kind can explain the observed phenomena of the universe is examined in
general. It is shown that the explanation does not make use of the full
probability measure, but rather of a suitable set function deriving from it,
which defines relative typicality between single-time cylinder sets. Such a set
function can also be derived directly from the standard quantum formalism,
without the need of an underlying probability measure. The key concept for this
derivation is the {\it quantum typicality rule}, which can be considered as a
generalization of the Born rule. The result is a new formulation of quantum
mechanics, in which particles follow definite trajectories, but which is only
based on the standard formalism of quantum mechanics.

two parts, we will face a situation that, within a certain length $\xi$, the
physics of a subsystem is no longer the same as the original system. Then the
extensive properties of the thermal entropy $S($AB$)= S($A$)+S($B$)$ is
violated. This observation motivates us to introduce the concept of correlation
entropy between two points, as measured by mutual information in the
information theory, to study the critical phenomena. A rigorous relation is
established to display some drastic features of the non-vanishing correlation
entropy of the subsystem formed by any two distant particles with long-range
correlation. This relation actually indicates the universal role of the
correlation entropy in understanding critical phenomena. We also verify these
analytical studies in terms of two well-studied models for both the thermal and
quantum phase transitions: two-dimensional Ising model and one-dimensional
transverse field Ising model. Therefore, the correlation entropy provides us
with a new physical intuition in critical phenomena from the point of view of
the information theory.

decoherence in closed quantum systems. For this purpose, we present a
quantifiable definition to quantum coherence $\Xi$, and discuss in some detail
a general coherence theory and its elementary results. As expected, decoherence
is understood as a statistical process that is caused by the dynamics of the
system, similar to the growth of entropy. It appears that coherence is an
important measure that helps to understand quantum properties of a system,
e.g., the decoherence time can be derived from the coherence function $\Xi(t)$,
but not from the entropy dynamics. Moreover, the concept of decoherence time is
applicable in closed and finite systems. However, in most cases, the decay of
off-diagonal elements differs from the usual $\exp(-t/\tau_{\rm d})$ behaviour.
For concreteness, we report the form of decoherence time $\tau_{\rm d}$ in a
finite Heisenberg model with respect to the number of particles $N$, density
$n_{\rho}$, spatial dimension $D$ and $\epsilon$ in a $\eta/r^{\epsilon}$-type
of potential.
