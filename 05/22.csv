for each type of galaxy. The total gas and star mass provided by the chemical

important future probe of reionization. We consider the Multi-frequency Angular
Power Spectrum (MAPS) to quantify the statistics of the HI signal as a joint
function of the angular multipole l and frequency separation \Delta\nu. The
signal at two different frequencies is expected to get decorrelated as
\Delta\nu is increased, and quantifying this decorrelation is particularly
important in deciding the frequency resolution for future HI observations. This
is also expected to play a very crucial role in extracting the signal from
foregrounds as the signal is expected to decorrelate much faster than the
foregrounds (which are largely continuum sources) with increasing \Delta\nu. In
this paper we develop formulae relating the MAPS to different components of the
three dimensional HI power spectrum taking into account HI peculiar velocities.
We show that the flat-sky approximation provides a very good representation
over the angular scales of interest, and a final expression which is very
simple to calculate and interpret. We present results considering two models
for the HI distribution, namely, (i) DM: where the HI traces the dark matter
and (ii) PR: where the effects of patchy reionization are incorporated through
two parameters. We find that while the DM signal is largely featureless, the PR
signal peaks at the angular scales of the individual bubbles, and the signal is
considerably enhanced for large bubble size. For most cases of interest at l
\sim 100 the signal is uncorrelated beyond \Delta\nu \sim 1 MHz or even less,
whereas it occurs around \sim 0.1 MHz at l \sim 10^3. The \Delta\nu dependence
also carries an imprint of the bubble size and the bias, and is expected to be
an important probe of the reionization scenario (abridged).

from the extremely stable color during the outburst in 1994--96. The different
color behaviors imply different variation mechanisms in the two states. We then
re-visited the optical data on OJ 287 from the OJ-94 project and found as well
a probable period of 40 days in its optical variability during the late-1994

of OJ 287 during its outburst state. The first component is the normal {\sl
blazar} variation. This component has an amplitude similar to that of the
quiescent state and also may share a similar periodicity. The second component
can be taken as a `low-frequency modulation' to the first component. It may be
induced by the interaction of the assumed binary black holes in the center of
this object. The 40-day period may be related to the helical structure of the
magnetic field at the base of the jet, or to the orbital motion close to the

Pop III stars in the light curves of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs). Significant
portions of GRBs can originate in hypernovae of Pop III stars and be
gravitationally lensed by foreground Pop III stars or their remnants. If the
lens mass is on the order of $10^2-10^3M_\odot$ and the lens redshift is
greater than 10, the time delay between two lensed images of a GRB is $\approx
1$s and the image separation is $\approx 10 \mu$as. Although it is difficult to
resolve the two lensed images spatially with current facilities, the light
curves of two images are superimposed with a delay of $\approx 1$ s. GRB light
curves usually exhibit noticeable variability, where each spike is less than
1s. If a GRB is lensed, all spikes are superimposed with the same time delay.
Hence, if the autocorrelation of light curve with changing time interval is
calculated, it should show the resonance at the time delay of lensed images.
Applying this autocorrelation method to GRB light curves which are archived as
the {\it BATSE} catalogue, we demonstrate that more than half light curves can
show the recognizable resonance, if they are lensed. Furthermore, in 1821 GRBs
we actually find one candidate of GRB lensed by a Pop III star, which may be
located at redshift 20-200. The present method is quite straightforward and
therefore provides an effective tool to search for Pop III stars at redshift
greater than 10. Using this method, we may find more candidates of GRBs lensed

scenarios have been invoked to explain this group of stars. In this work, the
planets-swallowing model for V838 Mon is further investigated, taking into
account the findings that the progenitor is most likely a massive B type star.
We find that the super-Eddington luminosity during the eruption can explain the
fast rising times of the three peaks in the optical light curve. We used two
different methods to estimate the location where the planets were consumed.
There is a nice agreement between the values obtained from the luminosities of
the peaks and from their rising time scale. We estimate that the planets were
stopped at a typical distance of one solar radius from the center of the host
giant star. The planets-devouring model seems to give a satisfying explanation
to the differences in the luminosities and rising times of the three peaks in
the optical light curve of V838 Mon. The peaks may be explained by the
consumption of three planets or alternatively by three steps in the terminal
falling process of a single planet. We argue that only the binary merger and
the planets-swallowing models are consistent with the observations of the new

of the periodicity in all data sets with no apparent change in its value, we
interpret this periodicity as orbital in nature and this is consistent with a
cataclysmic variable above the period gap. We found a probable short-term
periodicity of 0.017238 +- 0.000037 d (24.82272 +- 0.05328 m) which we
interpret as the probable spin period of the white dwarf or the beat period
between the orbital and spin period. Therefore, we propose that nova V4745 Sgr
should be classified as an intermediate polar candidate, supporting the
proposed link between transition-oscillation novae and intermediate polars. The
mass-period relation for cataclysmic variables yields a secondary mass of about
0.52 +- 0.05 M_solar.

have claimed a little dark matter content, or even no dark matter. Recently,
its total mass profile M(r) has been derived by exploiting Chandra observations
of its extended and X-ray emitting interstellar medium, based on the hypothesis
of hydrostatic equilibrium for the hot gas. The resulting total mass within the
effective radius Re has been claimed to be a few times larger than found by
optical studies. Here we show that part of the discrepancy can be due to an
underestimate of the optically derived mass, and the remaining discrepancy of a
factor of ~2 can be explained by deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium of the
hot gas. By using hydrodynamical simulations tailored to reproduce the observed
hot gas properties of NGC3379, and by assuming as input for the simulations the
total mass profile derived optically, we show that i) the hot gas at the
present time has X-ray properties consistent with those observed only if it is
outflowing over most of the galactic body, and ii) an overestimate of M of the
same size found in the recent X-ray analysis is recovered when assuming
hydrostatic equilibrium. We also show that the hot gas is outflowing even for a
dark matter fraction within Re as large as derived with the standard X-ray
procedure based on the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption, which shows the
unapplicability of the method for this galaxy. Finally, we find that the whole
range of dark mass amount and distribution allowed for by optical studies is
compatible with a hot gas flow with the observed X-ray properties.

X-rays are attenuated in the clumped stellar wind, which gives characteristic

counterparts are found, and in some cases none are found. The lack of or low
number of counterparts in some cases may be due to insufficient depth in the
WFPC2 images. Particularly in late-type galaxies, the HST image in the ULX
region was often complex or crowded. We therefore address various scenarios for
the nature of the ULX since it is not known which, if any, of the sources found
are true counterparts. The optical luminosities of the sources are typically in
the range 10^4-6 L_sun. In several cases color information is available, with
the colors roughly tending to be more red in early-type galaxies. This suggests
that, in general, the (potential) counterparts found in early-type galaxies are
likely to be older stellar populations, and are probably globular clusters.
Several early-type galaxy counterparts have blue colors, which may be due to
younger stellar populations in the host galaxies, however these could also be
background sources. In spiral galaxies the sources may also be due to localized
structure in the disks rather than bound stellar systems. Alternatively some of
the counterparts in late-type galaxies may be isolated supergiant stars. The
observed X-ray/optical flux ratio is diluted by the optical emission of the
cluster in cases where the system is an X-ray binary in a cluster, particularly
in the case of a low-mass X-ray binaries in old cluster. (abridged)

result is that sheared jets may generate a large-scale magnetic field if shear

magnetic sheath surrounding the central region of a jet, and it exhibits sign
reversals in the direction of the jet axis. Typically, the magnetic field in a

a discussion of the relations between statistics of BEC fluctuations in the
grand canonical, canonical, and microcanonical ensembles.
  Next we discuss different approaches capable of providing approximate
analytical results and physical insight into the problem of fluctuations. In
particular, we describe the master equation (similar to the quantum theory of
the laser) and canonical-ensemble quasiparticle approaches which give the most
accurate and physically transparent picture of the BEC fluctuations.

works very well for the interacting gases and yields analytical formulas for
the characteristic function and all moments of the condensate fluctuations. In
most cases the ground-state occupation fluctuations are anomalously large and
are not Gaussian even in the thermodynamic limit. We clarify a crossover
between the ideal and weakly-interacting-gas statistics which is governed by a
pair-correlation squeezing mechanism.

various spatiotemporal phenomena on geographical scales. It can synchronise
populations of interacting species, stabilise them, and diversify gene pools
[1-3]. Human travelling, e.g. is responsible for the geographical spread of
human infectious disease [4-9]. In the light of increasing international trade,
intensified human mobility and an imminent influenza A epidemic [10] the
knowledge of dynamical and statistical properties of human travel is thus of
fundamental importance. Despite its crucial role, a quantitative assessment of
these properties on geographical scales remains elusive and the assumption that
humans disperse diffusively still prevails in models. Here we report on a solid
and quantitative assessment of human travelling statistics by analysing the
circulation of bank notes in the United States. Based on a comprehensive
dataset of over a million individual displacements we find that dispersal is
anomalous in two ways. First, the distribution of travelling distances decays
as a power law, indicating that trajectories of bank notes are reminiscent of
scale free random walks known as Levy flights. Secondly, the probability of
remaining in a small, spatially confined region for a time T is dominated by
algebraically long tails which attenuate the superdiffusive spread. We show
that human travelling behaviour can be described mathematically on many
spatiotemporal scales by a two parameter continuous time random walk model to a
surprising accuracy and conclude that human travel on geographical scales is an
ambivalent effectively superdiffusive process.

narrow band-gap semiconductors has been a challenging problem. Recently,
self-consistent ab initio calculations within density functional theory (DFT)
using supercell models have been successful in tackling this problem. In this
paper, we carry out such calculations in PbTe, a well-known narrow band-gap
semiconductor, for a large class of defects: cationic and anionic
substitutional impurities of different valence, and cationic and anionic
vacancies. For the cationic defects, we study a series of compounds
RPb2n-1Te2n, where R is vacancy or monovalent, divalent, or trivalent atom; for
the anionic defects, we study compounds MPb2nTe2n-1, where M is vacancy, S, Se
or I. We find that the density of states (DOS) near the top of the valence band
and the bottom of the conduction band get significantly modified for most of
these defects. This suggests that the transport properties of PbTe in the
presence of impurities can not be interpreted by simple carrier doping
concepts, confirming such ideas developed from qualitative and
semi-quantitative arguments.

presented. Starting from a general basis-independent formulation, we use
Wannier functions as an interface between the two theories. These functions are
used for the physical purpose of identifying the correlated orbitals in a
specific material, and also for the more technical purpose of interfacing DMFT
with different kinds of band-structure methods (with three different techniques
being used in the present work). We explore and compare two distinct Wannier
schemes, namely the maximally-localized-Wannier-function (MLWF) and the $N$-th
order muffin-tin-orbital (NMTO) methods. Two correlated materials with
different degrees of structural and electronic complexity, SrVO3 and BaVS3, are
investigated as case studies. SrVO3 belongs to the canonical class of
correlated transition-metal oxides, and is chosen here as a test case in view
of its simple structure and physical properties. In contrast, the sulfide BaVS3
is known for its rich and complex physics, associated with strong correlation
effects and low-dimensional characteristics. New insights into the physics
associated with the metal-insulator transition of this compound are provided,
particularly regarding correlation-induced modifications of its Fermi surface.
Additionally, the necessary formalism for implementing self-consistency over
the electronic charge density in a Wannier basis is discussed.

phase radiation is emitted in a discrete set of complex quasinormal
frequencies, whose values depend only on the black hole's mass and angular
momentum. Ringdown radiation could be detectable with large signal-to-noise
ratio by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna LISA. If more than one mode is
detected, tests of the black hole nature of the source become possible. The
detectability of different modes depends on their relative excitation, which in

``universal'', initial data-independent measure of the relative mode excitation

to zero in the extremal limit, and that the contribution of the overtones
should be more significant when the black hole is fast rotating. We also
present the first analytical calculation of the large-damping asymptotics of
the excitation factors for static black holes, including the Schwarzschild and

see how a 2-component Bose-Einstein condensate can be used to model a specific

both bi-metric pseudo-Riemannian geometries and standard single metric
pseudo-Riemannian geometries, while independently allowing the quasi-particle
excitations to exhibit a ""mass"". Furthermore, when extrapolated to extremely
high energy the quasi-particles eventually leave the phononic regime and begin
to act like free bosons. Thus this analogue spacetime exhibits an analogue of
the ""Lorentz violation"" that is now commonly believed to occur at or near the
Planck scale defined by the interplay between quantum physics and gravitational
physics. In the 2-component Bose-Einstein analogue spacetime we will show that
the mass generating mechanism for the quasi-particles is related to the size of
the Lorentz violations. This relates the ""mass hierarchy"" to the so-called

  We suppose that the solutions $v^{\epsilon}$ to these problems converge to a
unique limit. Also, it is assumed smallness of the total variation and other
technical hypotheses and it is provided a complete characterization of the
limit.
  The most interesting points are the following two.
  First, the boundary characteristic case is considered, i.e. one eigenvalue of
$A$ can be $0$.
  Second, we take into account the possibility that $B$ is not invertible. To
deal with this case, we take as hypotheses conditions that were introduced by
Kawashima and Shizuta relying on physically meaningful examples. We also
introduce a new condition of block linear degeneracy. We prove that, if it is
not satisfied, then pathological behaviours may occur.

Constructing the Evans function involves matching the solutions of a linear

becomes stiff as the spectral parameter grows. Consequently, the
Gauss--Legendre method has previously been used for such problems; however more
recently, methods based on the Magnus expansion have been proposed. Here we
extensively examine the stiff regime for a general scalar Schr\""odinger

order reduction, a fortunate cancellation when computing the Evans matching
function means that fourth-order convergence in the end result is preserved.
The Gauss--Legendre method does not suffer from order reduction, but it does
not experience the cancellation either, and thus it has the same order of
convergence in the end result. Finally we discuss the relative merits of both
methods as spectral tools.

clarifies the 'correlation' structure of the beta-binomial distribution. It is
also possible to study the correlation structures of other probability
distributions of exchangeable (homogeneous) correlated Bernoulli random
variables. We study some distribution functions and discuss their behaviors in
terms of their correlation structures.

providing additive approximations of the Jones polynomial at the k'th root of
unity, for constant k=5 and k>6, is BQP-hard. Together with the algorithmic
results of Freedman et al and Aharonov et al, this gives perhaps the most
natural BQP-complete problem known today and motivates further study of the
topic. In this paper we focus on the universality proof; we extend the
universality result of Freedman et al to k's that grow polynomially with the
number of strands and crossings in the link, thus extending the BQP-hardness of
Jones polynomial approximations to all values for which the AJL algorithm
applies, proving that for all those values, the problems are BQP-complete. As a
side benefit, we derive a fairly elementary proof of the Freedman et al density
result, without referring to advanced results from Lie algebra representation
theory, making this important result accessible to computer science audience.
We make use of two general lemmas we prove, the Bridge lemma and the Decoupling
lemma, which provide tools for establishing density of subgroups in SU(n).
Those tools seem to be of independent interest in more general contexts of
proving quantum universality. Our result also implies a completely classical
statement, that the_multiplicative_ approximations of the Jones polynomial, at
exactly the same values, are #P-hard, via a recent result due to Kuperberg.
Since the first publication of those results in their preliminary form
(arXiv:quant-ph/0605181v2), the methods we present here were used in several
other contexts. This paper is an improved and extended version of the original
results, and also includes discussions of the developments since then.

of measurement outcomes, and use it to give a simple proof that the maximally
entangled state of two d dimensional quantum systems has no local component.
That is, if we write its quantum correlations as a mixture of local
correlations and general (not necessarily quantum) correlations, the
coefficient of the local correlations must be zero. This suggests an
experimental programme to obtain as good an upper bound as possible on the
fraction of local states, and provides a lower bound on the amount of classical
communication needed to simulate a maximally entangled state in dxd dimensions.
We also prove that the quantum correlations violating the inequality are
monogamous among non-signalling correlations, and hence can be used for quantum
key distribution secure against post-quantum (but non-signalling)
eavesdroppers.

error correcting protocols designed for tolerance against qubit loss, it was
shown that these protocols have the undesirable effect of magnifying the
effects of depolarization noise. This raises the question of which general
properties of quantum error-correcting codes might explain such an apparent
trade-off between tolerance to located and unlocated error types. We extend the
counting argument behind the well-known quantum Hamming bound to derive a bound
on the weights of combinations of located and unlocated errors which are
correctable by nondegenerate quantum codes. Numerical results show that the
bound gives an excellent prediction to which combinations of unlocated and
located errors can be corrected with high probability by certain large
degenerate codes. The numerical results are explained partly by showing that
the generalized bound, like the original, is closely connected to the
information-theoretic quantity the quantum coherent information. However, we
also show that as a measure of the exact performance of quantum codes, our
generalized Hamming bound is provably far from tight.

a computer as a fixed array of computational elements, we show that cluster
