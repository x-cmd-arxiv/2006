  relative to original submission): 57 pages, including 5 embedded tables and
  19 figures",,"10.1086/508643",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a method for isolating a clean sample of red giant stars in the
outerregions of the Andromeda spiral galaxy (M31) from an ongoing spectroscopic
survey using the DEIMOS instrument on the Keck 10-m telescope. The survey aims
to study the kinematics, global structure, substructure, and metallicity of
M31's halo. Although most of our spectroscopic targets were photometrically
screened to reject foreground Milky Way dwarf star contaminants, the latter
class of objects still constitutes a substantial fraction of the observed
spectra in the sparse outer halo. Our likelihood-based method for isolating M31
red giants uses five criteria: (1) radial velocity, (2) photometry in the
intermediate-width DDO51 band to measure the strength of the MgH/Mgb absorption
features, (3) strength of the Na I 8190A absorption line doublet, (4) location
within an (I, V-I) color-magnitude diagram, and (5) comparison of photometric
(CMD-based) versus spectroscopic (Ca II 8500A triplet-based) metallicity
estimates. We also discuss K I and TiO diagnostics for giant/dwarf separation
that might be useful in future analyses. Training sets consisting of definite
M31 red giants and Galactic dwarf stars are used to derive empirical
probabilitydistribution functions for each diagnostic. These functions are used
to calculate the likelihood that a given star is a red giant in M31 versus a
Milky Way dwarf. By applying this diagnostic method to our spectroscopic data
set, we isolate 40 M31 red giants beyond a projected distance of R = 60 kpc
from the galaxy's center, including three out at R ~ 165 kpc. The ability to
identify individual M31 red giants gives us an unprecedented level of
sensitivity in studying the properties of the galaxy's outer halo.

Here we bring a unique insight onto the subject by identifying 840 galaxies
with both a post-starburst signature (strong Balmer absorption lines) and an
AGN (based on the emission line ratio). These poststarburst-AGNs account for
the 4.2% of all the galaxies in a volume-limited sample. The presence of a
post-starburst phase with an active AGN itself is of importance, suggesting
that AGNs may outlive starbursts in the starburst-AGN connection. In addition,
we have performed spatially resolved spectroscopy of three of our
poststarbusrst-AGN galaxies, obtaining some evidence that the post-starburst
region is more extended, but sharply centred around the central AGN, confirming
a spatial connection between the post-starburst and the AGN.

clusters are identified either through their X-ray emission or through their
integrated Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. We find that compared to a
phenomenological parametrization of the mass-observable relation, using our
physical model yields significantly tighter constraints in both surveys, and
offers substantially improved synergy when the two surveys are combined. These
results suggest that parametrized physical models of cluster structure will be
useful when extracting cosmological constraints from SZ and X-ray cluster

ionizing photons as compared to the actual number of hydrogen recombinations in

  We evaluate the number of ionizing photons from the population synthesis of
spectra observed in the visible, extrapolating the spectra to the extreme
ultraviolet (EUV), beyond the Lyman limit. We check for possible systematic
deviations of the predicted ionizing spectra in the EUV by comparing the ratio
of the predicted number of ionizing photons to the number of recombinations, as
measured in H$\beta$, ${\rm \Delta \log Q(H^0)}$, with the metallicity.
  We find that, as far as the number of ionizing photons is concerned, no
systematic tendency can be detected. The ${\rm H\beta}$ equivalent width can be
understood as a nebular age indicator, decreasing with age, although the
observed ${\rm H\beta}$ equivalent width can also be affected by the
contribution to the continuum by the accumulation of previous, non-ionizing
stellar populations.
  We attribute the increase of ${\rm \Delta \log Q(H^0)}$ with the age of the
burst to the fact that more and more ionizing photons escape the nebulae when
the nebulae get older, because of their increasing, expansion-induced
subfragmentation.

case study of the double-lined beta Cephei star beta Centauri. We also present
a detailed analysis of beta Centauri's line-profile variations caused by its
oscillations. We point out that a systematic error in the orbital amplitudes,
and any quantities derived from them, occurs if the radial velocities of
blended component lines are computed without spectral disentangling. This
technique is an essential ingredient in the derivation of the physical
parameters if the goal is to obtain a precision of only a few percent. We have
devised iteration schemes to obtain the orbital elements for systems whose
lines are blended throughout the orbital cycle. We find the following
parameters for beta Cen: $M_1=10.7\pm 0.1 M_\odot$ and $M_2=10.3\pm 0.1
M_\odot$, an age of $(14.1\pm 0.6)\times 10^6$ years. We deduce two oscillation
frequencies for the broad-lined primary of beta Centauri with degrees higher
than 2. We propose that our iteration schemes be used in any future derivations
of the spectroscopic orbital parameters of double-lined binaries with blended
component lines to which disentangling can be successfully applied.

concepts and tools of phylogenetic systematics widely used in biology can be
heuristically transposed to the case of galaxies. Methods: This approach that
we call ""astrocladistics"" is applied to Dwarf Galaxies of the Local Group and
provides the first evolutionary tree for real galaxies. Results: The trees that
we present here are sufficiently solid to support the existence of a
hierarchical organization in the diversity of dwarf galaxies of the Local
Group. This also shows that these galaxies all derive from a common ancestral
kind of objects. We find that some kinds of dIrrs are progenitors of both dSphs

having its own characteristics and own evolution. Conclusions: The present work
opens a new way to analyze galaxy evolution and a path towards a new
systematics of galaxies. Work on other galaxies in the Universe is in progress.

Gamma-ray bursts has been revolutionized by the Swift mission. The rapid
response of Swift shows that the non-thermal X-ray emission transitions
smoothly from the prompt phase into a decaying phase whatever the details of
the light curve. The decay is often categorized by a steep-to-shallow
transition suggesting that the prompt emission and the afterglow are two
distinct emission components. In those GRBs with an initially steeply-decaying
X-ray light curve we are probably seeing off-axis emission due to termination
of intense central engine activity. This phase is usually followed, within the
first hour, by a shallow decay, giving the appearance of a late emission hump.
The late emission hump can last for up to a day, and hence, although faint, is
energetically very significant. The energy emitted during the late emission
hump is very likely due to the forward shock being constantly refreshed by
either late central engine activity or less relativistic material emitted
during the prompt phase. In other GRBs the early X-ray emission decays
gradually following the prompt emission with no evidence for early temporal
breaks, and in these bursts the emission may be dominated by classical
afterglow emission from the external shock as the relativistic jet is slowed by
interaction with the surrounding circum-burst medium. At least half of the GRBs
observed by Swift also show erratic X-ray flaring behaviour, usually within the
first few hours. The properties of the X-ray flares suggest that they are due
to central engine activity. Overall, the observed wide variety of early
high-energy phenomena pose a major challenge to GRB models.

that includes both magnetospheric accretion and a disc wind. We perform
systematic investigations of the model parameters for the wind and the
magnetosphere to search for possible geometrical and physical conditions which
lead to the types of profiles seen in observations. We find that the hybrid
models can reproduce the wide range of profile types seen in observations, and
that the most common profile types observed occupy a large volume of parameter
space. Conversely, the most infrequently observed profile morphologies require
a very specific set of models parameters. We find our model profiles are
consistent with the canonical value of the mass-loss rate to mass-accretion
rate ratio (mu=0.1) found in earlier magneto-hydrodynamic calculations and
observations, but the models with 0.05<mu<0.2 are still in accord with observed
H-alpha profiles. We investigate the wind contribution to the line profile as a
function of model parameters, and examine the reliability of H-alpha as a mass
accretion diagnostic. Finally, we examine the H-alpha spectroscopic

to the good spatial resolution available from these observations and a proper

grid-based and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) codes. The tests are run
for a simple setup where Jupiter and Neptune mass planets on a circular orbit
open a gap in a protoplanetary disc during a few hundred orbital periods. We
compare the surface density contours, potential vorticity and smoothed radial
profiles at several times. The disc mass and gravitational torque time
evolution are analyzed with high temporal resolution. There is overall
consistency between the codes. The density profiles agree within about 5% for
the Eulerian simulations while the SPH results predict the correct shape of the
gap although have less resolution in the low density regions and weaker
planetary wakes. The disc masses after 200 orbital periods agree within 10%.
The spread is larger in the tidal torques acting on the planet which agree
within a factor 2 at the end of the simulation. In the Neptune case the
dispersion in the torques is greater than for Jupiter, possibly owing to the
contribution from the not completely cleared region close to the planet.

configurations have been used for the latter: A completely random one, and
which thus has an inhomogeneous structure, and an homogeneous ``glassy'' one,
obtained from freezing a liquid of soft disks in equilibrium. Small differences
are observed between both structures for the translational dynamics of the rod
center-of-mass. In contrast to this, the rotational dynamics in the glassy host
medium is strongly slowed down in comparison with the random one. We calculate
angular correlation functions for a wide range of rod length $L$ and density of
obstacles $\rho$ as control parameters. A two-step decay is observed for large
values of $L$ and $\rho$, in analogy with supercooled liquids at temperature
close to the glass transition. In agreement with the prediction of the Mode
Coupling Theory, a time-length and time-density scaling is obtained. In order
to get insight on the relation between the heterogeneity of the dynamics and
the structure of the host medium, we determine the deviations from Gaussianity
at different length scales. Strong deviations are obtained even at spatial
scales much larger than the rod length. The magnitude of these deviations is
independent of the nature of the host medium. This result suggests that the
large scale translational dynamics of the rod is affected only weakly by the

distribution function, is calculated by Monte Carlo integration, using an
accurate parameterized distribution function, for various particle aspect
ratios in the range 1-25. A bifurcation analysis of the free energy calculated
from the obtained equation of state is applied to find the isotropic
(I)-uniaxial nematic (N$_u$) and isotropic-tetratic nematic (N$_t$) spinodals

stability of the N$_t$ phase with respect to the isotropic phase is enhanced by
the introduction of $B_3$. Finally, we have calculated the complete phase
diagram using a variational procedure and compared the results with those
obtained from scaled particle theory and with Monte Carlo simulations carried
out for hard rectangles with various aspect ratios. The predictions of our
proposed equation of state as regards the transition densities between the
isotropic and orientationally ordered phases for small aspect ratios are in
fair agreement with simulations. Also, the critical aspect ratio below which

programs with aggregates. These definitions build on the notion of unfolding of
aggregates, and they are aimed at creating methodologies to translate logic
programs with aggregates to normal logic programs or positive programs, whose
answer set semantics can be used to defined the semantics of the original
programs. The first definition provides an alternative view of the semantics
for logic programming with aggregates described by Pelov et al.
  The second definition is similar to the traditional answer set definition for
normal logic programs, in that, given a logic program with aggregates and an
interpretation, the unfolding process produces a positive program. The paper
shows how this definition can be extended to consider aggregates in the head of
the rules.
  The proposed views of logic programming with aggregates are simple and
coincide with the ultimate stable model semantics, and with other semantic
characterizations for large classes of program (e.g., programs with monotone
aggregates and programs that are aggregate-stratified).
  Moreover, it can be directly employed to support an implementation using
available answer set solvers. The paper describes a system, called ASP^A, that
is capable of computing answer sets of programs with arbitrary (e.g.,

setting for both the additive white Gaussian noise channel and the discrete
memoryless channel. We propose a scheme called Distributed Rate Splitting to
achieve the optimal rates allowed by information theory in a distributed
manner. In this scheme, each real user creates a number of virtual users via a
power/rate splitting mechanism in the M-user Gaussian channel or via a random
switching mechanism in the M-user discrete memoryless channel. At the receiver,
all virtual users are successively decoded. Compared with other multiple-access
techniques, Distributed Rate Splitting can be implemented with lower complexity
and less coordination. Furthermore, in a symmetric setting, we show that the
rate tuple achieved by this scheme converges to the maximum equal rate point
allowed by the information-theoretic bound as the number of virtual users per
real user tends to infinity. When the capacity regions are asymmetric, we show
that a point on the dominant face can be achieved asymptotically. Finally, when
there is an unequal number of virtual users per real user, we show that
differential user rate requirements can be accommodated in a distributed
fashion.

It is also shown that, given X in a Garside group, if some power X^m is

the particular case of braid groups, this implies that a pseudo-Anosov braid
has a small power whose ultra summit set consists of rigid elements. This
solves one of the problems in the way of a polynomial solution to the conjugacy

feedforward chain of non-bursting neurons with excitatory synaptic connections.
Our results are obtained for two kinds of neuronal models, leaky
integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons and Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons with five
conductances. Over a range of parameters such as the maximum synaptic
conductance, both kinds of chains are found to have multiple attractors of
propagating bursts, with each attractor being distinguished by the number of
spikes and total duration of the propagating burst. These results make
plausible the hypothesis that sparse precisely-timed sequential bursts observed
in projection neurons of nucleus HVC of a singing zebra finch are intrinsic and
causally related.

embody the internal dynamics of mass inside a hypha with mutually excluding
particles progressing stochastically along a growing one-dimensional lattice.
The connection between long range transport of materials for growth, and the
resulting extension of the hyphal tip has not previously been addressed in the
modelling literature. We derive and analyse mean-field equations for the model
and present a phase diagram of its steady state behaviour, which we compare to
simulations. We discuss our results in the context of the filamentous fungus,
Neurospora crassa.

statistical properties are specified completely. The numerical simulation of
the complex Langevin equations is carried out using the Cholesky decomposition
for the noise covariance matrix. This internal noise, which is due to
diffusion-limited reactions, produces unavoidable spatio-temporal density
fluctuations about the mean field value. In two dimensions, this noise strictly
vanishes only in the perfectly mixed limit, a situation difficult to attain in
practice.

defining the metric on the set of density matrices. We focus first on the
simplest case of two two-level systems and show that a ``relativistic''
formulation leads to a complete analysis of the question of separability. Our
approach is based on Schmidt decomposition of density matrices for a composite
system and non-unitary transformations to a standard form. The positivity of
the density matrices is crucial for the method to work. A similar approach
works to some extent in higher dimensions, but is a less powerful tool. We
further present a numerical method for examining separability, and illustrate
the method by a numerical study of bound entanglement in a composite system of
two three-level systems.

resources can be established at a distance through the use of local
measurements without classical communication. It is thereby possible to, e.g.,
allow distant entities to randomly combine forces on a course of action which
is an element of a predetermined set of possible actions. When this protocol is
used, no one knows which action has been chosen. The protocol is intrinsically
secure in the same sense as a one-time pad. The entities must have a shared
entanglement resource, be able to measure that resource in a predetermined
reference frame, and know what they must do to carry out all of the possible
actions.

based on the equivalence class $\{e^{i\alpha(t)}\psi(t,\vec{x})\}$ which is not
a symmetry of the Schr\""{o}dinger equation. This equivalence class when
understood as defining generalized rays in the Hilbert space is not generally
consistent with the superposition principle in interference and polarization
phenomena. The hidden local gauge symmetry, which arises from the arbitrariness
of the choice of coordinates in the functional space, is then proposed as a
basic gauge symmetry in the non-adiabatic phase. This re-formulation reproduces
all the successful aspects of the non-adiabatic phase in a manner manifestly
consistent with the conventional notion of rays and the superposition
principle. The hidden local symmetry is thus identified as the natural origin
of the gauge symmetry in both of the adiabatic and non-adiabatic phases in the
absence of gauge fields, and it allows a unified treatment of all the geometric
phases. The non-adiabatic phase may well be regarded as a special case of the
adiabatic phase in this re-formulation, contrary to the customary understanding
of the adiabatic phase as a special case of the non-adiabatic phase. Some
explicit examples of geometric phases are discussed to illustrate this
re-formulation.

We directly observe the modification of the return time of the trajectory, and
