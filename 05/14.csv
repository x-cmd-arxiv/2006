inflation models from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP)
three-year data set, and also from WMAP in combination with the Sloan Digital

conclusions: 1) the Harrison--Zel'dovich model is consistent with both data
sets at a 95% confidence level; 2) there is no strong evidence for running of
the spectral index of scalar perturbations; 3) Potentials of the form V \propto
\phi^p are consistent with the data for p = 2, and are marginally consistent
with the WMAP data considered alone for p = 4, but ruled out by WMAP combined
with SDSS. We perform a ""Monte Carlo reconstruction"" of the inflationary
potential, and find that: 1) there is no evidence to support an observational
lower bound on the amplitude of gravitational waves produced during inflation;
2) models such as simple hybrid potentials which evolve toward an inflationary
late-time attractor in the space of flow parameters are strongly disfavored by
the data, 3) models selected with even a weak slow-roll prior strongly cluster
in the region favoring a ""red"" power spectrum and no running of the spectral
index, consistent with simple single-field inflation models.

find HI and H-alpha line profiles to be similar in width but different in

rotation-curves. We also find vertical velocity dispersions of the ionized disk
gas within several disk scale-lengths have a median value of 18 km/s and an 80%

for neutral atomic and molecular gas. With standard assumptions for intrinsic

excellent information for setting new constraints on models of neutron-capture
processes at low metallicity. These stars are known as s+r stars, since they
show enhancements of both s-process and r-process elements. The observed
abundance ratios for the double-enhanced stars can be explained by those of
stars that were polluted by an AGB star and subsequently accreted very
significant amounts of r-process material out of an AIC (accretion-induced
collapse) or Type 1.5 supernova. In this paper we present for the first time an
attempt to fit the elemental abundances observed in the s- and r-rich, very
metal-poor stars using a parametric model and suggest a new concept of
component coefficients to describe the contributions of the individual
neutron-capture processes to double-enhanced stars. We find that the abundance
ratios of these stars are best fitted by enrichments of s- and r-process
material. The overlap factor in the AGB stars where the observed s-process
elements were produced lies between 0.1 and 0.81. Taking into account the
dependence of the initial-final mass relations on metallicity, this wide range
of values could possibly be explained by a wide range of core-mass values of
AGB stars at low metallicity. The component coefficient of the r-process is
strongly correlated with the component coefficient of the s-process for the
double-enhanced stars. This is significant evidence that the r-process material
in double-enhanced stars comes from an AIC or Type 1.5 supernova.

role achieving, over the years, a better understanding of a number of physical
processes pertinent to a broader range of fields than just PNe studies, ranging
from atomic physics to stellar evolution. Whilst empirical techniques are
routinely employed for the analysis of the emission line spectra of such
objects, the accurate interpretation of the observational data often requires
the solution of the radiative transfer (RT) problem in the nebula, via the
application of a photoionisation code.The development of the codes has been
driven by the observational constraints available, but also compromised by the
available computer power. Modern codes are faster and more flexible, with the
ultimate goal being the achievement of a description of the observations
relying on the smallest number of parameters possible. In this light, recent
developments have been focused on the inclusion of new atomic data, the
inclusion of a realistic treatment for dust grains mixed in the ionised and
photon dominated regions (PDRs) and the expansion of some codes to PDRs with
the inclusion of chemical reaction networks. Furthermore the last few years
have seen the development of fully 3D photoionisation codes based on the Monte
Carlo method. A review of the photoionisation codes currently in use is given
here, with emphasis on recent developments, including the expansion of the
models to the 3D domain, the identification of new observational constraints

obtained. In particular, we find that for impurity problems, up to linear order
in the electric field, the present approach provides a diagrammatic method for

however, this quantum Boltzmann transport theory, constructed from the

providing new information about interplay of soft and hard physics in

to production of vector mesons off nuclear target by photons emitted by proton.
We find, that least in the case of Upsilon production it is feasible to observe
simultaneously both these processes. Such measurements would increase the
precision with which the A-dependence of exclusive onium production can be
determined. This would also enable one to estimate the amount of nuclear gluon
shadowing of generalized gluon distributions at much smaller x than that is
possible in AA collisions and to measure the cross sections for photoproduction
processes in a significantly wider energy range than that achieved in
experiments with fixed nuclear targets. We also present the cross section for

production of vector mesons off protons with large rapidity gaps and large t.
These processes probe small x dynamics of the elastic interaction of small

tubes created by the condensation of spreons near the Planck scale. Considering
preons belonging to the 27-plet of E_6, we have investigated the breakdown of
E_6 (and \widetilde{E_6}) near the Planck scale into the SU(6)\times U(1) (and
\widetilde{SU(6)}\times \widetilde{U(1)}) gauge group and shown that the six
types of strings having fluxes \Phi_n=n\Phi_0 (n=\pm 1,\pm 2,\pm 3) produce
three (and only three) generations of composite quark-leptons and bosons. The
model predicts the existence of the Family replicated gauge group [E_6]^3 near
the Planck scale. The runnings of the corresponding fine structure constants
are investigated, and the critical coupling constants at the two phase
transition points near the Planck scale are calculated. The model explains the
hierarchies of masses in the Standard Model naturally. The compactification in
a space-time with five dimensions and its influence on form-factors of
composite objects are also briefly discussed.

check this framework by reproducing the dual Abelian-Higgs model from the

very near to the border between type-I and type-II superconductors and
remarkably consistent with the recent simulations.

indispensible tools for complex state machine control and signal processing,
and now routinely incorporate CPU cores to allow execution of user software
code. At the same time, their exceptional performance permits low-power
implementation of functionality previously the exclusive domain of dedicated
analog electronics. Specific examples presented here use FPGAs as
discriminator, time-to-digital (TDC) and analog-to-digital converter (ADC). All
three cases are examples of instrumentation for current or future astroparticle
experiments.

explained by the currently accepted theory. An explanation is offered based on
a combination of low-energy 'sring${}^{1/n}$' and 'particle' dynamics. The
dynamics are described by extremely accurate nuclear mass data (unpublished
2006 and \cite{Chalmers1}) in accord with substringy dynamics (in progress,
primary). An event is analyzed with emphasis on particle Iding, their dynamics
and interactions, with implications for/by graviton(ino) with low-energy
phenomenology. Analysis is provided towards enhancing the experimental
apparatus, in computation and hardware, and should be numerically simulated for
further safety before implementation.

wave functions in a trajectory representation by examining the two rectilinear
wave functions individually, we examine a dichromatic wave function that is
synthesized from the two interfering wave functions. The physics of
interference is contained in the reduced action for the dichromatic wave
function. As this reduced action is a generator of the motion for the
dichromatic wave function, it determines the dichromatic wave function's
trajectory. The quantum effective mass renders insight into the behavior of the
trajectory. The trajectory in turn renders insight into quantum nonlocality.

source. A composite reduced action for the two correlated point sources is

through any point in Euclidian 3-space also passes simultaneously through both
point sources.
