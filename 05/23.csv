Local Group analogs: Their luminosity functions, galaxy content, fractional
galaxy type distribution, crossing times, masses, and zero-velocity surface
radii are similar to those of the Local Group. Also, the nearby groups usually
consist of two subgroups, some of which approach each other and may ultimately
merge to form a fossil group. These poor groups contrast with the less evolved,
loose and extended galaxy ``clouds'' such as the Scl group and the CVn I cloud.

Eulerian perturbations of the magnetic field. This equation, in turn, is
separated into two second-order ordinary, differential equations in $r$ and $z$

the eigensolutions are obtained by a perturbation technique, where the

intense stochastic background and more frequent bursts than assumed in earlier
background estimates, enabling experiments to probe lighter cosmic strings of
interest to string theory. Predictions are compared with instrument noise from
current and future experiments, and with confusion noise from known
astrophysical gravitational wave sources such as stellar and massive black hole
binaries. In these large-loop models, current data from millisecond pulsar
timing already suggests that the tension is less than about $10^{-10}$, a
typical value expected in strings from brane inflation. LISA will be sensitive
to stochastic backgrounds created by strings as light as $G\mu\approx

stellar populations; however, for those lightest detectable strings, bursts are

which was recently resolved by MERLIN. Observations revealed an elongated
S-like structure along which the velocities of the maser features show a linear
dependence on the impact parameter. This is consistent with a doubly-warped m=2
disc observed edge-on. Water masers and silicate dust emission (detected by
IRAS and ISO) have a common origin in O-rich material and are likely to be
co-located in the disc. We propose a detailed self-consistent model of a masing
gas-dust disc around a companion to the carbon star in a binary system, which
allows us to estimate the companion mass of 1.7 +- 0.1 M_sun, the disc radius
of 40 +-3 AU and the distance between companions of about 80 AU. Using a
dust-gas coupling model for water masing, we calculate the maser power
self-consistently, accounting for both the gas and the dust energy balances.
Comparing the simulation results with the observational data, we deduce the
main physical parameters of the masing disc, such as the gas and dust
temperatures and their densities. We also present an analysis of the stability
of the disc.

localized by the High Energy Transient Explorer 2 satellite (HETE-2): GRBs
010326B, 040802, 051211 and 060121, all of which were detected by the French
Gamma Telescope (Fregate) and localized with the Wide-field X-ray Monitor (WXM)

for determining whether these GRBs are ""short population bursts"" (SPBs) or
""long population bursts"" (LPBs). These criteria are (1) duration, (2) pulse
widths, (3) spectral hardness, (4) spectral lag, (5) energy Egamma radiated in
gamma rays (or equivalently, the kinetic energy E_KE of the GRB jet), (6)
existence of a long, soft bump following the burst, (7) location of the burst
in the host galaxy, and (8) type of host galaxy. In particular, we have
developed a likelihood method for determining the probability that a burst is
an SPB or a LPB on the basis of its T90 duration alone. A striking feature of
the resulting probability distribution is that the T90 duration at which a
burst has an equal probability of being a SPB or a LPB is T90 = 5 s, not T90 =
2 s, as is often used. All four short-duration bursts discussed in detail in
this paper have T90 durations in the Fregate 30-400 keV energy band of 1.90,
2.31, 4.25, and 1.97 sec, respectively, yielding probabilities P(S|T90) = 0.97,
0.91, 0.60, and 0.95 that these bursts are SPBs on the basis of their T90
durations alone. All four bursts also have spectral lags consistent with zero.

i=19.1 that have been spectroscopically identified in the SDSS. Our algorithm
uses morphological and color selections that are intended to identify small-
and large-separation lenses, respectively. Our selection algorithm only relies
on parameters that the SDSS standard image processing pipeline generates,
allowing easy and fast selection of lens candidates. The algorithm has been
tested against simulated SDSS images, which adopt distributions of field and
quasar parameters taken from the real SDSS data as input. Furthermore, we take
differential reddening into account. We find that our selection algorithm is
almost complete down to separations of 1'' and flux ratios of 10^-0.5. The
algorithm selects both double and quadruple lenses. At a separation of 2'',
doubles and quads are selected with similar completeness, and above (below) 2''
the selection of quads is better (worse) than for doubles. Our morphological
selection identifies a non-negligible fraction of single quasars: To remove
these we fit images of candidates with a model of two point sources and reject
those with unusually small image separations and/or large magnitude differences
between the two point sources. We estimate the efficiency of our selection
algorithm to be at least 8% at image separations smaller than 2'', comparable
to that of radio surveys. The efficiency declines as the image separation
increases, because of larger contamination from stars. We also present the
magnification factor of lensed images as a function of the image separation,
which is needed for accurate computation of magnification bias.

of astrophysical plasma fluctuations and in particular apparent in the
interplanetary medium by in situ observations. In this situation the classical
Boltzmann-Gibbs extensive thermo-statistics, applicable when microscopic
interactions and memory are short ranged, fails. Upon generalization of the
entropy function to nonextensivity, accounting for long-range interactions and
thus for correlations in the system, it is demonstrated that the corresponding
probability distributions (PDFs) are members of a family of specific power-law
distributions. In particular, the resulting theoretical bi-kappa functional
reproduces accurately the observed global leptokurtic, non-Gaussian shape of
the increment PDFs of characteristic solar wind variables on all scales.
Gradual decoupling is obtained by enhancing the spatial separation scale
corresponding to increasing kappa-values in case of slow solar wind conditions
where a Gaussian is approached in the limit of large scales. Contrary, the
scaling properties in the high speed solar wind are predominantly governed by
the mean energy or variance of the distribution. The PDFs of solar wind scalar
field differences are computed from WIND and ACE data for different time-lags
and bulk speeds and analyzed within the nonextensive theory. Consequently,
nonlocality in fluctuations, related to both, turbulence and its large scale
driving, should be related to long-range interactions in the context of
nonextensive entropy generalization, providing fundamentally the physical
background of the observed scale dependence of fluctuations in intermittent
space plasmas.

tentative counterparts for another 12 objects. This is the largest sample of
submm galaxies with statistically secure counterparts detected in the radio and
with Spitzer. We find that in most cases the 850 micron emission is dominated
by a single 24 micron source. A composite rest-frame SED shows that the submm
sources peak at longer wavelengths than those of local ULIRGs of the same
luminosity and therefore appear to be cooler. The SEDs of submm galaxies are
also different from those of their high redshift neighbours, the near-IR
selected BzK galaxies, whose mid-IR to radio SEDs are more like those of local
ULIRGs. Using 24 micron. 850 micron and 1.4 GHz observations, we fit templates
that span the mid-IR through radio to derived the integrated IR luminosity of
the submm galaxies. By themselves, 24 micron and radio fluxes are able to
predict LIR reasonably well because they are relatively insensitive to
temperature. However, the submm flux by itself consistently overpredicts LIR
when using spectral templates which obey the local ULIRG temperature-luminosity
relation. The shorter Spitzer wavelengths sample the stellar bump at the
redshifts of the submm sources, and we find that the Spitzer photometry alone
provides a model independent estimate of the redshift. Using X-ray and mid-IR
data, only 5 per cent of our secure counterparts show strong evidence for an
active galactic nucleus dominating the IR luminosity.

orbital phase zero, the H- and He-like Fe lines from both receding and
approaching jets are comparably strong and unocculted while the He-like Si line
of the receding jet is significantly weaker than that of the approaching jet.
This condition may imply the cooler parts of the receding jet are eclipsed by
the companion. The X-ray spectrum from this observation has broader emission
lines than obtained in Paper I that may arise from the divergence of a conical
outflow or from Doppler shift variations during the observation. Using recent
optical results, along with the length of the unobscured portion of the
receding jet assuming adiabatic cooling, we calculate the radius of the
companion to be 9.6+/-1.0 R_sun, about one third of the Roche lobe radius. For
a main sequence star, this corresponds to a companion mass of 35+/-7 M_sun,
giving a primary source mass of 20+/-5 M_sun. If our model is correct, this
calculation indicates the compact object is a black hole, and accretion occurs
through a wind process. In a subsequent paper, we will examine the validity of
the adiabatic cooling model of the jets and test the mode of line broadening.

apart from H2 and thus represent a large fraction of dark cloud chemistry
budget.To directly constrain the freeze-out profile of CO, the formation route
of CO2 and the carrier of the 6.8 micron band, the spatial distribution of the
CO/CO2 ice system and the 6.8 micron band carrier are measured in a nearby
dense core.
  Methods: VLT-ISAAC, ISOCAM-CVF and Spitzer-IRS archival mid-infrared (3-20
micron) spectroscopy of young stellar objects is used to construct a map of the
abundances of CO and CO2 ices in the Oph-F star-forming core, probing core
radii from 2 10^3 to 14 10^3 AU or densities from 5 10^4 to 5 10^5 cm^-3 with a
resolution of ~ 3000 AU.
  Results: The line-of-sight averaged abundances relative to water ice of both
CO and CO2 ices increase monotonously with decreasing distance to the core
center. The map traces the shape of the CO abundance profile between freeze-out
ratios of 5-60% and shows that the CO2 ice abundance increases by a factor of 2
as the CO freezes out. It is suggested that this indicates a formation route of
CO2 on a CO ice surface to produce a CO2 component dilute in CO ice, in
addition to a fraction of the CO2 formed at lower densities along with the
water ice mantle. It is predicted that the CO2 bending mode band profile should
reflect a high CO:CO2 number ratio in the densest parts of dark clouds. In
contrast to CO and CO2, the abundance of the carrier of the 6.8 micron band
remains relatively constant throughout the core. A simple freeze-out model of
the CO abundance profile is used to estimate the binding energy of CO on a CO
ice surface to 814+/-30 K.

near-unity mass ratios - are consistent with previous results for field brown
dwarf binaries. Three of the binaries have components that span the
poorly-understood transition between L dwarfs and T dwarfs. Spectral
decomposition analysis of one of these, SDSS 1021-0304AB, reveals a peculiar
flux reversal between its components, as its T5 secondary is ~30% brighter at

transition, albeit less pronounced than previously surmised. We also find that
the resolved binary fraction of L7 to T3.5 dwarfs is twice that of other L and
T dwarfs, an anomaly that can be explained by a relatively rapid evolution of
brown dwarfs through the L/T transition, perhaps driven by dynamic
(nonequilibrium) depletion of photospheric condensates.

spiral galaxy M33. Using the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space
Telescope, we have identified 64 ab-type RR Lyraes in M33. We have estimated
reddenings for these stars based on their minimum light V-I colors and
metallicities based on their periods. From the distributions of these
properties, we conclude that the RR Lyraes belong to two populations - one
associated with the halo of M33 and the other with its disk. Given that RR
Lyraes are produced by populations older than ~10 Gyr, this suggests that not
only does the field halo of M33 contain an old component, but so does its disk.
This is one of the best pieces of evidence for the existence of a halo field
component in M33. Using a relation between RR Lyrae absolute magnitude and
metallicity (Mv(RR) = 0.23[Fe/H] + 0.93), we estimate a mean distance modulus
of <(m-M)o> = 24.67 +/- 0.08 for M33. This places M33 approximately 70 kpc
beyond M31 in line-of-sight distance.

the equations are solved. Two cases are investigated: a 5Msol and a 3Msol star,

highly-reddened Type IIP supernova SN 2002hh. Bright, cool, slowly-fading
emission is detected from the direction of the supernova. Most of this flux
appears not to be driven by the supernova event but instead probably originates
in a cool, obscured star-formation region or molecular cloud along the
line-of-sight. We also show, however, that the declining component of the flux
is consistent with an SN-powered IR echo from a dusty progenitor CSM. Mid-IR
emission could also be coming from newly-condensed dust and/or an ejecta/CSM
impact but their contributions are likely to be small. For the case of a CSM-IR
echo, we infer a dust mass of as little as 0.036 M(solar) with a corresponding
CSM mass of 3.6(0.01/r(dg))M(solar) where r(dg) is the dust-to-gas mass ratio.
Such a CSM would have resulted from episodic mass loss whose rate declined
significantly about 28,000 years ago. Alternatively, an IR echo from a
surrounding, dense, dusty molecular cloud might also have been responsible for
the fading component. Either way, this is the first time that an IR echo has
been clearly identified in a Type IIP supernova. We find no evidence for or
against the proposal that Type IIP supernovae produce large amounts of dust via
grain condensation in the ejecta. However, within the CSM-IR echo scenario, the
mass of dust derived implies that the progenitors of the most common of
core-collapse supernovae may make an important contribution to the universal
dust content.

luminosity-normalized specific frequencies (T_N and S_N, respectively) of

observed U-shaped relation between S_N and V-band magnitude (M_V) of their host
galaxies.
  We adopt a biased GC formation scenario in which GC formation is truncated in
galaxy halos that are virialized at a later redshift, z_trun. T_N is derived
for galaxies with GCs today and converted into S_N for reasonable galaxy
mass-to-light-ratios (M/L). We find that T_N depends on halo mass (M_h) in the
sense that T_N can be larger in more massive halos with M_h > 10^9 M_sun, if
z_trun is as high as 15. We however find that the dependence is too weak to
explain the observed S_N-M_V relation and the wide range of S_N in low-mass
early-type galaxies with -20.5 < M_V < -16.0 mag for a reasonable constant M/L.
The M_V-dependence of S_N for the low-mass galaxies can be well reproduced, if
the mass-to-light-ratio M_h/L_V \propto M_h^{\alpha}, where \alpha is as steep
as -1. Based on these results, we propose that the origin of the observed
U-shaped S_N-M_V relation of GCSs can be understood in terms of the bimodality
in the dependence of M_h/L_V on M_h of their host galaxies. We also suggest
that the observed large dispersionin S_N in low-mass galaxies is due partly to
the large dispersion in T_N.

typically infrequent or low-amplitude outburst activity, underlining the
strength of spectroscopic selection in identifying new CVs independently of
their variability. The spectroscopic properties of short-period CVs in the HQS
suggest that most of them are still evolving towards the minimum period. Their
total number agrees with the predictions of population models within an order
of magnitude. However, the bulk of all CVs is predicted to have evolved past

initial and final tunneling constants. To study the slow universal timescale,
we develop a new numerical scheme. We compute the conductance for two systems
which have different Kondo temperatures down to a fraction of $T_{K}$ in
infinitesimal bias with this scheme. We conclude that universality is preserved
as a function of $T/ T_{K}$. We also investigate the decay rate of recently
identified SKP oscillations down to zero temperature and compare it with the
previous analytical results obtained with the perturbative renormalization
group.

the spin degree of freedom in low-dimensional semiconductor structures. The
spin Hall effect, where an electrical current drives a transverse spin current
and causes a nonequilibrium spin accumulation observed near the sample

drives an electric current, or the reverse process, in which an electrical
current generates a nonequilibrium spin polarization, are all consequences of
spin-orbit coupling. In order to observe a spin Hall effect a bias driven
current is an essential prerequisite. The spin separation is caused via
spin-orbit coupling either by Mott scattering (extrinsic spin Hall effect) or
by Rashba or Dresselhaus spin splitting of the band structure (intrinsic spin
Hall effect). Here we provide evidence for an elementary effect causing spin
separation which is fundamentally different from that of the spin Hall effect.
In contrast to the spin Hall effect it does not require an electric current to
flow: It is spin separation achieved by spin-dependent scattering of electrons
in media with suitable symmetry. We show that by free carrier (Drude)
absorption of terahertz radiation spin separation is achieved in a wide range
of temperatures from liquid helium up to room temperature. Moreover the
experimental results give evidence that simple electron gas heating by any

discuss two different dynamical feautures of networks: synchronizability and
flow of random walkers and so that they are optimized if the corresponding
Laplacian matrix have a large spectral gap. From this, we show, by developing a
numerical optimization algorithm that maximum synchronizability and fast random
walk spreading are obtained for a particular type of extremely homogeneous
regular networks, with long loops and poor modular structure, that we call
entangled networks. These turn out to be related to Ramanujan and Cage graphs.
We argue also that these graphs are very good finite-size approximations to
Bethe lattices, and provide almost or almost optimal solutions to many other
problems as, for instance, searchability in the presence of congestion or
performance of neural networks. Finally, we study how these results are
modified when studying dynamical processes controlled by a normalized (weighted

sensitive element was designed and calibrated for a frequency range of 0.5 to

modification and sensing were separated and then, in a regime where they were

devices will vastly increase speed and/or reduce power dissipation compared to
traditional charge based electronic devices. Yet, not a single spintronic
device exists today that can lend credence to this claim. Here, I show that no
spintronic device that clones conventional electronic devices, such as field
effect transistors and bipolar junction transistors, is likely to reduce power
dissipation significantly. For that to happen, spin-based devices must forsake
the transistor paradigm of switching states by physical movement of charges,
and instead, switch states by flipping spins of stationary charges. An
embodiment of this approach is the single spin logic idea proposed more than 10
years ago. Here, I revisit that idea and present estimates of the switching
speed and power dissipation. I show that the Single Spin Switch is far superior
to the Spin Field Effect Transistor (or any of its clones) in terms of power
dissipation. I also introduce the notion of matrix element engineering which
will allow one to switch devices without raising and lowering energy barriers
between logic states, thereby circumventing the kTln2 limit on energy
dissipation. Finally, I briefly discuss single spin implementations of
classical reversible (adiabatic) logic.

at the quantum-classical crossover and the Abraham-Lorentz force arises from
the accelerating charge or from other charges in the macroscopic or the

confinement described via ``dual superconductivity'' leads to a factor
$exp(-2\pi\sigma\rho^2)$, where $\sigma$ is a string tension, which is nearly

interpret the 2+1 dimensional vacuum Einstein equation as a decoupled ``dual''

flat Lorentzian metrics on S x R whose Levi--Civita connections are precisely
the lifts of this induced flat connection and the conformal class induced by

computations in exact conditional inference. To justify the algorithm, a theory
relates sampling values at each step to properties of the associated toric
ideal using computational commutative algebra. In particular, the property of
interval cell counts at each step is related to exponents on lead
indeterminates of a lexicographic Gr\""{o}bner basis. Also, the approximation of
integer programming by linear programming for sampling is related to initial
terms of a toric ideal. We apply the algorithm to examples of contingency

demonstrate that the theory is applicable and that the algorithm performs well.

method of doubling produces another design of resolution IV which doubles both
the run size and the number of factors of the initial design. On the other
hand, the projection of a design of resolution IV onto a subset of factors is
of resolution IV or higher. Recent work in the literature of projective
geometry essentially determines the structures of all regular designs of
resolution IV with $n\geq N/4+1$ in terms of doubling and projection, where $N$
is the run size and $n$ is the number of factors. These results imply that, for
instance, all regular designs of resolution IV with $5N/16<n\leq N/2$ must be
projections of the regular design of resolution IV with $N/2$ factors. We show
that, for $9N/32\leq n\leq 5N/16$, all minimum aberration designs are
projections of the design with $5N/16$ factors which is constructed by
repeatedly doubling the 2$^{5-1}$ design defined by $I=\mathit{ABCDE}$. To
prove this result, we also derive some properties of doubling, including an
identity that relates the wordlength pattern of a design to that of its double
and a result that does the same for the alias patterns of two-factor
interactions.

bubbles which correspond hadronic states with mass spectrum $m_H> 2.0$ GeV. The
density of states for Hagedorn bubbles is derived by calculating the
microcanonical ensemble for a bag of quarks and gluons with specific internal

for massless and massive flavors. We find Hagedorn bubbles are strongly
suppressed in the dilute hadronic matter and they appear just below the line of
the phase transition. The order of the phase transition depends on Hagedorn
bubble's internal color-flavor structure and the volume fluctuation as well. On

transition from the gas of known mass spectrum hadrons to another one dominated

tails of the functions of statistical distributions of impulse amplitudes are
approximated by a power function of the form f (A) = A**(-b), where A is the
impulse amplitude, and b is the power index laying in the range from 1 to 5.
Experimental confirmation is obtained to the hypothesis suggested earlier that
the impulse generation regime qualitatively corresponds to the model of on-off
intermittency. It is assumed that the model of the on-off intermittency may be
considered as one of the possible mechanisms of MIEs generation. It is found
that the majority of the analyzed statistical distributions of MIEs amplitudes
have the index b exceeding 2, the fact being typical for chaotic regimes called
the strong turbulence. In some cases the index b is close to the unity, this
fact being typical for the regimes generated in weakly turbulized medium. The
results obtained make it possible to assume that: a) at higher magnetospheric
latitudes, the plasma turbulence degree is higher that at lower latitudes, b)
in the afternoon sector of the magnetosphere, the plasma is stronger turbulized
than in the prenoon sector; c) in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres the
magnetospheric plasma is stronger turbulized in summer and winter,
respectively; d) at the growth phase of solar activity the magnetospheric
plasma is stronger turbulized than at the declining phase. The dependence of
the power index b on the solar wind parameters and IMF demonstrates the

dimension are investigated. We find that both the 30S subunit and the 16S rRNA
have fractal dimensions of 2.58 and 2.82, respectively; while the 50S subunit
as well as the 23S rRNA has the mass fractal dimension close to 3, implying a
compact three dimensional macromolecule. This finding supports the dynamic and
active role of the 30S subunit in the protein synthesis, in contrast to the
pass role of the 50S subunit.

highly-localized, evolves in time by spreading at speeds close to the speed of
light. This general phenomenon is explained by the fact that the Dirac
evolution can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a quantum random walk,
where the roles of coin and walker systems are naturally attributed to the spin
and position degrees of freedom of the particle. Initially entangled and
spatially localized spin-position states evolve with asymptotic two-horned
distributions of the position probability, familiar from earlier studies of
quantum walks. For the Dirac particle, the two horns travel apart at close to
the speed of light.

  entanglements","16 pages, Revtex",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.74.062310",,"quant-ph",,"  We propose the concept of SLOCC-equivalent basis (SEB) in the multiqubit
space. In particular, two special SEBs, the GHZ-type and the W-type basis are
introduced. They can make up a more general family of multiqubit states, the
GHZ-W-type states, which is a useful kind of entanglement for quantum
teleporatation and error correction. We completely characterize the property of
this type of states, and mainly classify the GHZ-type states and the W-type
states in a regular way, which is related to the enumerative combinatorics.
Many concrete examples are given to exhibit how our method is used for the
classification of these entangled states.

computation to continuous-variable systems, along with a proposal for an
optical implementation using squeezed-light sources, linear optics, and
homodyne detection. For universal quantum computation, a nonlinear element is
required. This can be satisfied by adding to the toolbox any single-mode
non-Gaussian measurement, while the initial cluster state itself remains
Gaussian. Homodyne detection alone suffices to perform an arbitrary multi-mode
Gaussian transformation via the cluster state. We also propose an experiment to
demonstrate cluster-based error reduction when implementing Gaussian
operations.

in a nanoscale region are coherently controlled by all-electrical methods.
Different from the standard nuclear-magnetic resonance technique, the
longitudinal magnetization of nuclear spins is directly detected by measuring
resistance, resulting in ultra-sensitive detection of the microscopic quantity
of nuclear spins. All possible coherent oscillations have been successfully
demonstrated between two levels from four nuclear spin states of I = 3/2
nuclei. Quantum information processing is discussed based on two fictitious
qubits of an I = 3/2 system and methods are described for performing arbitrary
logical gates both on one and two qubits. A scheme for quantum state tomography
based on Mz-detection is also proposed. As the starting point of quantum
manipulations, we have experimentally prepared the effective pure states for
the I = 3/2 nuclear spin system.
