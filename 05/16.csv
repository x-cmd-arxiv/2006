envelopes of massive young stellar objects (YSOs).
  Methods. The chemical evolution of gas and dust is traced, including infall
and realistic source evolution. The temperatures are determined
self-consistently. Both ad/desorption of ices using recent laboratory
temperature-programmed-desorption measurements are included.
  Results. The observed water abundance jump near 100 K is reproduced by an
evaporation front which moves outward as the luminosity increases. Ion-molecule
reactions produce water below 100 K. The age of the source is constrained to t
\~ 8 +/- 4 x 10^4 yrs since YSO formation. It is shown that the chemical
age-dating of hot cores at ~ few x 10^3 - 10^4 yr and the disappearance of hot
cores on a timescale of ~ 10^5 yr is a natural consequence of infall in a
dynamic envelope and protostellar evolution. Dynamical structures of ~ 350AU
such as disks should contain most of the complex second generation species. The
assumed order of desorption kinetics does not affect these results.

combination, allow large oscillations of the EOS which can leave oscillating
features on the (residual) Hubble diagram, and such oscillations are
potentially detectable by future observations like SNAP, or even by the
CURRENTLY ONGOING SNIa observations. Local bumps of dark energy EOS can also
leave imprints on CMB, LSS and SNIa. In cases where the bumps take place at low
redshifts and the effective EOS are close to -1, CMB and LSS observations
cannot give constraints on such possibilities. However, geometrical
observations like (future) SNIa can possibly detect such features. On the other
hand when the local bumps take place at higher redshifts beyond the
detectability of SNIa, future precise observations like Gamma-ray bursts, CMB
and LSS may possibly detect such features. In particular, we find that
bump-like dark energy EOS on high redshifts might be responsible for the
features of WMAP on ranges l \sim 30-50, which is interesting and deserves
addressing further.

a phenomenological modelling of the reheating era. At slow-roll leading order,
the constraints epsilon_1 < 0.022 and -0.07 < epsilon_2 < 0.07 are obtained at
95% CL (Confidence Level) implying a tensor-to-scalar ratio r_10 < 0.21 and a
Hubble parameter during inflation H/Mpl < 1.3 x 10^(-5). At next-to-leading
order, a tendency for epsilon_3 > 0 is observed. With regards to the exact
numerical integration, large field models, V(phi) proportional to phi^p, with p
> 3.1 are now excluded at 95% CL. Small field models, V(phi) proportional to
1-(phi/mu)^p, are still compatible with the data for all values of p. However,
if mu/Mpl < 10 is assumed, then the case p = 2 is slightly disfavoured. In
addition, mild constraints on the reheating temperature for an extreme equation
of state w_reh = -1/3 are found, namely T_reh > 2 TeV at 95% CL. Hybrid models
are disfavoured by the data, the best fit model having Delta chi^2 = +5 with
two extra parameters in comparison with large field models. Running mass models
remain compatible, but no prior independent constraints can be obtained.
Finally, superimposed oscillations of trans-Planckian origin are studied. The
vanilla slow-roll model is still the most probable one. However, the overall
statistical weight in favour of superimposed oscillations has increased in
comparison with the WMAP first year data, the amplitude of the oscillations
satisfying 2|x|sigma_0 < 0.76 at 95% CL. The best fit model leads to an
improvement of Delta chi^2 = -12 for three extra parameters. Moreover, compared
to other oscillatory patterns, the logarithmic shape is favoured.

the properties of the black hole itself, that can be derived by a detailed
examination of the relativistically broadened spectral features (especially the

show that spectral models which purport to eliminate the broad iron line in
MCG-6-30-15 by invoking a moderately high ionization absorber are ruled out by
recent high-resolution spectra from the Chandra High Energy Transmission
Gratings. We then discuss the comparison of XMM-Newton data with accretion disk
models. The ""standard'' black hole disk model of Novikov, Page and Thorne
supplemented by the so-called local corona assumption fails to produce
sufficient broadening; this indicates that the real accretion disk in
MCG-6-30-15 has significantly more centrally concentrated pattern of X-ray
irradiation that predicted by this model. We discuss two possible resolutions.
Firstly, the inner disk may be energized from torques imposed by magnetic
connections between the disk-proper and either the plunging region or the
rotating event horizon itself. Secondly, X-ray emission from a high-latitude
source (such as would be the case of the X-ray source is actually the base of a
jet) would be gravitationally focused onto the central portions of the disk. We
discuss how spectral variability may be used to examine these possibilities and
highlight the still outstanding mystery concerning the anti-correlation between
the iron line equivalent width and relative normalization of the Compton
reflection hump. We end with a few words about the exciting future of these
studies in the future era of Constellation-X and LISA.

at the boundary of a chaotic zone in the corotation region of the planet. We
find that this zone can open a gap in a particle disk as long as the collision
timescale exceeds the removal or ejection timescale in the zone. We use the
slope measured from the ring edge surface brightness profile to place an upper
limit on the planet mass. The removal timescale in the chaotic zone is used to
estimate a lower limit. The ring edge has eccentricity caused by secular
perturbations from the planet. These arguments imply that the planet has a mass

August, resulted in the first detection of radio emission from a black hole
binary at X-ray luminosities as low as 10^{-8.5} times the Eddington limit. The
measured radio flux density, of 51 \pm 7 microJy at 8.5 GHz, is the lowest
reported for an X-ray binary system so far, and is interpreted in terms of
partially self-absorbed synchrotron emission from outflowing plasma. Making use
of the estimated outer accretion rate of A0620-00 in quiescence, we demonstrate
that the outflow kinetic power must be energetically comparable to the total
accretion power associated with such rate, if it was to reach the black hole
with the standard radiative efficiency of 10 per cent. This favours a model for
quiescence in which a radiatively inefficient outflow accounts for a sizable
fraction of the missing energy, and, in turn, substantially affects the overall
dynamics of the accretion flow. Simultaneous observations in the X-ray band,
with Chandra, confirm the validity of a non-linear radio/X-ray correlation for
hard state black hole binaries down to low quiescent luminosities, thereby
contradicting some theoretical expectations. Taking the mass term into account,
the A0620-00 data lie on the extrapolation of the so called Fundamental Plane
of black hole activity, which has thus been extended by more than 2 orders of
magnitude in radio and X-ray luminosity. With the addition of the A0620-00
point, the plane relation provides an empirical proof for the scale-invariance
of the jet-accretion coupling in accreting black holes over the entire

scale bulk flows are due, not to the motion of matter with respect to the CMB,
but to the flow of dark energy with respect to matter. Indeed, when dark energy
is moving, the usual definition of the CMB rest frame as that in which the CMB
dipole vanishes is not appropriate. We find instead that the dipole vanishes
for observers at rest with respect to the cosmic center of mass, i.e. in motion
with respect to the background radiation.

We clearly resolve structures that are best explained with an optically thick
accretion disk. A simple accretion disk model fits the observed SED and
visibilities reasonably well and does not require the presence of any
additional structure such as a dusty envelope. The inclination and also the
position angle of the disk can be constrained from the multibaseline
interferometric observations. Our disk model is in general agreement with most
published near-infrared interferometric measurements. From the shape and
strength of the 8-13 micrometer spectrum the dust composition of the accretion
disk is derived for the first time. We conclude that most dust particles are
amorphous and already much larger than those typically observed in the ISM.
Although the high accretion rate of the system provides both, high temperatures
out to large radii and an effective transport mechanism to distribute
crystalline grains, we do not see any evidence for crystalline silicates
neither in the total spectrum nor in the correlated flux spectra from the inner
disk regions. Possible reasons for this non-detection are mentioned. All

observations of FU Ori and other FU Ori objects. We also address the question
whether FU Ori is in a younger evolutionary stage than a classical TTauri star.

afterglow of GRB 060218, which was interpreted as shock breakout from the thick
wind of the progenitor Wolf-Rayet (WR) star of the underlying Type Ic SN
2006aj. In this paper we present a simple model for computing the
characteristic quantities (including energy, temperature, and time-duration)
for the transient event from the shock breakout in Type Ibc supernovae produced
by the core-collapse of WR stars surrounded by dense winds. In contrast to the
case of a star without a strong wind, the shock breakout occurs in the wind
region rather than inside the star, caused by the large optical depth in the
wind. We find that, for the case of a WR star with a dense wind, the total
energy of the radiation generated by the supernova shock breakout is larger
than that in the case of the same star without a wind by a factor > 10. The
temperature can be either hotter or cooler, depending on the wind parameters.
The time-duration is larger caused by the increase in the effective radius of
the star due to the presence of a thick wind. Then, we apply the model to GRB
060218/SN 2006aj. We show that, to explain both the temperature and the total
energy of the black-body component observed in GRB 060218 by the shock
breakout, the progenitor WR star has to have an unrealistically large core
radius (the radius at optical depth of 20), larger than 100 Rsun. In spite of
this disappointing result, our model is expected to have important applications
to the observations on Type Ibc supernovae in which the detection of shock
breakout will provide important clues to the progenitors of SNe Ibc.

and black holes - is central to much of high energy astrophysics, the
mechanisms which enable this process have remained observationally elusive.
Accretion disks must transfer angular momentum for matter to travel radially
inward onto the compact object. Internal viscosity from magnetic processes and
disk winds can in principle both transfer angular momentum, but hitherto we
lacked evidence that either occurs. Here we report that an X-ray-absorbing wind
discovered in an observation of the stellar-mass black hole binary GRO J1655-40
must be powered by a magnetic process that can also drive accretion through the
disk. Detailed spectral analysis and modeling of the wind shows that it can
only be powered by pressure generated by magnetic viscosity internal to the
disk or magnetocentrifugal forces. This result demonstrates that disk accretion
onto black holes is a fundamentally magnetic process.

a significant, and currently ill-constrained, source of energy input into the

the minimum energy to which the power-law distribution of relativistic
particles is accelerated in the hotspots. This has hitherto been unknown to
within three orders of magnitude. We present direct evidence for the discovery
of this low-energy cutoff in the lobe of a Mpc-sized radio galaxy via the
existence of extended X-ray emission, inverse-Compton scattered from aged radio
plasma, and its separation by 80kpc from regions containing freshly accelerated
plasma from the hotspot. The low-energy cutoff of gamma ~ 10^4 in the hotspot
is higher than previously thought, but reconciles discrepancies with magnetic
field estimates which had been systematically lower than equipartition values.
The inverse Compton scattering of the spent synchrotron plasma is at the

many unknown or tunable parameters to explain experimental data. We explain why
such systems so often are sloppy; the system behavior depends only on a few
`stiff' combinations of the parameters and is unchanged as other `sloppy'
parameter combinations vary by orders of magnitude. We contrast examples of
sloppy models (from systems biology, variational quantum Monte Carlo, and
common data fitting) with systems which are not sloppy (multidimensional linear
regression, random matrix ensembles). We observe that the eigenvalue spectra
for the sensitivity of sloppy models have a striking, characteristic form, with
a density of logarithms of eigenvalues which is roughly constant over a large
range. We suggest that the common features of sloppy models indicate that they
may belong to a common universality class. In particular, we motivate focusing
on a Vandermonde ensemble of multiparameter nonlinear models and show in one
limit that they exhibit the universal features of sloppy models.

discussion of optical orientation of electron spins, which allows both the
creation and detection of spin-polarized carriers in semiconductors. Then we
review non-equilibrium spin flow including spin drift and diffusion caused by
electric fields and concentration gradients. A controlled spin precession is
possible both in external magnetic fields and in effective magnetic fields due
to a broken inversion symmetry. Although the Coulomb interaction does not
couple to the spin degree of freedom, it affects the spin-dependent transport
via the spin Coulomb drag. In gyrotropic media, the optical creation of
spin-oriented electrons gives rise to spin photocurrents, which reverse their
direction when the radiation helicity is changed from left-handed to
right-handed. The reverse process is possible, too, i.e., an electric current
in a gyrotropic medium gives rise to a spin polarization in the bulk of the
sample.

Waals historic work and many reliable EoSs are available for the stable fluid
region (3). For the metstable region, all available EoSs are not accurate
enough for various applications. It has been considered impossible to develop
an analytical EoS for the entire stable and metstable region 4. By virtue of a
potential energy landscape analysis combined with the Woodcock type EoS (2,5),
here we show that a fairly simple analytical equation can be obtained to
reproduce the compressibility of the entire region with high accuracy.
Therefore, all four amorphous states of matter, gas, liquid, supercooled liquid

that highly accurate EoS is necessary for applications in thermodynamic
property or liquid structure predictions. By using conventional approaches,
such as appending an attractive term of van der Waals type (6) or using the
equation within the framework of perturbation theory (1,7), it can be extended
to an EoS for various real systems, including supercooled liquids and glasses.

that of efficient operation--of reliably communicating given messages among
nodes at minimum cost in resource usage. We present a solution to the efficient
operation problem for coded packet networks, i.e., packet networks where the
contents of outgoing packets are arbitrary, causal functions of the contents of
received packets. Such networks are in contrast to conventional, routed packet
networks, where outgoing packets are restricted to being copies of received
packets and where reliability is provided by the use of retransmissions.
  This thesis introduces four considerations to coded packet networks: 1.
efficiency, 2. the lack of synchronization in packet networks, 3. the
possibility of broadcast links, and 4. packet loss. We take these
considerations and give a prescription for operation that is novel and general,

enlarges spacetime with extra coordinates conjugate to winding number, is
reformulated and its geometric and topological features examined. It is used to
formulate string theory in T-fold backgrounds with T-duality transition
functions and a quantum implementation of the constraints of the doubled
formalism is presented. This establishes the quantum equivalence to the usual
sigma-model formalism for world-sheets of arbitrary genus, provided a
topological term is added to the action. The quantisation involves a local
choice of polarisation, but the results are independent of this. The natural
dilaton of the doubled formalism is duality-invariant and so T-duality is a
perturbative symmetry for the perturbation theory in the corresponding coupling
constant. It is shown how this dilaton is related to the dilaton of the
conventional sigma-model which does transform under T-duality. The
generalisation of the doubled formalism to the superstring is given and shown
to be equivalent to the usual formulation. Finally, the formalism is
generalised to one in which the whole spacetime is doubled.

indeterminate $\ddt$, whose range is equal to the kernel of the polynomial
matrix associated to the implicit variational system. Such polynomial matrices
are useful to compute the ideal of differential forms generated by the
differentials of all possible trivializations. We introduce the notion of a
strongly closed ideal of differential forms, and prove that flatness is
equivalent to the strong closedness of the latter ideal, which, in turn, is
equivalent to the existence of solutions of the so-called generalized moving

commutation relations (CCRs), has a well-known defect in that it has a large
number of representations which are not regular and these cannot model physical
fields. Here, we construct explicitly a C*-algebra which can reproduce the CCRs
of a countably dimensional symplectic space (S,B) and such that its
representation set is exactly the full set of regular representations of the
CCRs. This construction uses Blackadar's version of infinite tensor products of
nonunital C*-algebras, and it produces a ""host algebra"" (i.e. a generalised
group algebra, explained below) for the \sigma-representation theory of the
abelian group S where \sigma(.,.):=e^{iB(.,.)/2}.
  As an easy application, it then follows that for every regular representation
of the Weyl algebra of (S,B) on a separable Hilbert space, there is a direct
integral decomposition of it into irreducible regular representations (a known
result).
  An Erratum for this paper is added at the end.

  version","40 pages, 1 figure",,,,"math.PR math.CO",,"  We generalize the asymptotic behavior of the graph distance between two
uniformly chosen nodes in the configuration model to a wide class of random
graphs. Among others, this class contains the Poissonian random graph, the
expected degree random graph and the generalized random graph (including the
classical Erdos-Renyi graph).
  In the paper we assign to each node a deterministic capacity and the
probability that there exists an edge between a pair of nodes is equal to a
function of the product of the capacities of the pair divided by the total
capacity of all the nodes. We consider capacities which are such that the
degrees of a node has uniformly bounded moments of order strictly larger than
two, so that, in particular, the degrees have finite variance. We prove that
the graph distance grows like \log_\nu N, where the \nu depends on the
capacities. In addition, the random fluctuations around this asymptotic mean
\log_\nu N are shown to be tight. We also consider the case where the
capacities are independent copies of a positive random \Lambda with
\prob{\Lambda> x}\leq cx^{1-\tau}, for some constant c and \tau>3, again
resulting in graphs where the degrees have finite variance.
  The method of proof of these results is to couple each member of the class to
the Poissonian random graph, for which we then give the complete proof by
adapting the arguments of the corresponding result for the configuration model.

at RHIC, a program of detailed quarkonia measurements is crucial to
understanding the nature of deconfinement. Lattice QCD calculations suggest a
sequential melting of the quarkonia states in the deconfined medium. Such a
melting would lead to a suppression in the measured charmonium and bottomonium
yields. However, distinguishing a true suppression from shadowing, absorption,
and recombination effects requires detailed measurements of the charmonium
states (J/psi, psi', and chi_c) and bottomonium states (Y(1S), Y(2S), and
Y(3S)). Also, since measurements are needed not only in A+A, but also in p+p
for determining primary yields and in p+A for evaluating absorption, the
detector should perform well in all collision environments. To fully realize
the program outlined above, a new detector will be required at RHIC-II. We
present a proposal for a complete quarkonia program and the abilities of a new
detector, R2D, to meet the stated requirements. Comparisons will be made with
proposed upgrades to existing RHIC detectors and with the upcoming LHC program.

seismological applications) separating air from a homogeneous, isotropic, solid
substratum overlain by a homogeneous, isotropic, solid layer (in contact with
the ground) solicited by a SH plane body wave incident in the substratum. The
analysis is first carried out in the frequency domain and subsequently in the
time domain. The frequency domain response is {\it normal} in that no
resonances are excited (a resonance is here understood to be a situation in
which the response is infinite in the absence of dissipation). The translation
of this in the time domain is that the scattered pulse is of relatively-short
duration. The duration of the pulse is shown to be largely governed by
radiation damping which shows up in the imaginary parts of the complex
eigenfrequencies of the configuration. Three methods are elaborated for the
computation of the time history and give rise to the same numerical solutions
for a large variety of configurations of interest in the geophysical setting
under the hypothesis of non-dissipative, dispersionless media. The method
appealing to the complex eigenfrequency representation is shown to be the
simplest and most physically-explicit way of obtaining the time history (under
the same hypothesis). Moreover, it is particularly suited for the case in which
modes can be excited as occurs when the incident wave is not plane or the
boundary condition is not of the stress-free variety for all transverse
coordinates on the ground plane.

subject to a transverse high-frequency AC magnetic field. The layer is treated
as a perfectly conducting liquid sheet that allows us to solve the problem
analytically for both a semi-infinite geometry with a straight edge and a thin
disk of finite radius. It is shown that the long-wave perturbations of a
straight edge are monotonically unstable when the wave number exceeds some
critical value $k_c,$ which is determined by the surface tension and the linear
density of the electromagnetic force acting on the edge. The higher the density
of electromagnetic force, the shorter the critical wavelength. The
perturbations with wavelength shorter than the critical are stabilized by the
surface tension, whereas the growth rate of long wave perturbations reduces as
$\sim k$ for wave numbers $k\to 0$. Thus, there is the fastest growing
perturbation with the wave number $k_\max=2/3 k_c$. By applying the general
approach developed for the semi-infinite sheet, we find that a circular disk
becomes linearly unstable with respect to exponentially growing perturbation
with the azimuthal wave number $m=2$ when the magnetic Bond number exceeds
$Bm_c=3\pi$. The instability characteristics agree well with the experimental
data.

under way in many industrialized countries (one important exception is Japan)
share many of the characteristics of previous historical price peaks. In
particular, we show that: (i) In the present episode real price increases are,
at least for now, of the same order of magnitude as in previous episodes,
typically of the order of 80 percent to 100 percent. (ii) Historically, price
peaks turned out to be symmetrical with respect to the peak; soft landing, i.e.
an upgoing phase followed by a plateau, has rarely (if ever) been observed.
(iii) The inflated demand is mainly boosted by investors and high-income
buyers. (iv) In the present as well as in previous episodes, the main engines
in the upgoing phase have been the hot markets which developed in major cities
such as London, Los Angeles, New York, Paris, San Francisco or Sydney. In our
conclusion, we propose a prediction for real estate prices in the West of the
United States over the period 2005-2011. We also point out that investment
funds, which already play a key role in stock markets, have in recent times
began to heavily invest in real estate. In the future, one can expect them to
become major players in property markets worldwide. The outcome of the present
episode will tell us how quickly this transformation evolves. Thus, if the
height of the present peak substantially surpasses the magnitude of previous
ones, one may infer that investment funds have been able to establish strong
communication channels between real estate assets on the one hand and financial
assets (e.g. bonds, stocks, options) on the other hand.

paper shows that the phenomenon of White flight is in fact essentially a flight
from poverty. As a confirmation, we show that the changes in White or Black
populations are highly correlated which means that White flight is always
paralleled by Black flight (and Hispanic flight as well). This broader
interpretation of White flight accounts not only for the case of northern
cities such as Cincinnati, Cleveland or Detroit, but for all population changes
at county level, provided the population density is higher than a threshold of
about 50 per square-kilometer which corresponds to moderately urbanized areas
(as can be found in states like Indiana or Virginia for instance).

view, we show that the transfer of population to the electronic ground state
originating from a wave packet launched on the excited state occurs in a
stepwise fashion. The evolution of wave packets launched on the electronic
ground state is instead more complex because the crossing seam is located close
to the bottom of the electronic excited state. We next use the mapping
formalism, which replaces the discrete electronic degrees of freedom by
continuous ones, to obtain a classical description of the coupled electronic
states. We propagate gaussian swarms of trajectories to show that this approach
can be used to calculate the populations in each electronic state. We finally
propose a very simple trajectory surface hopping model, which assumes that
trajectories have a constant probability to jump onto the other state in a
particular region of the phase space and a null hopping probability outside
from this region. Quasiclassical calculations show that this model enables a
precise estimation of complex quantities, like for example the projection of
the instantaneous probability density on given planes.

  LaTeX article, 7 figures. Submitted to Biophys. J",,,,"q-bio.QM",,"  Some species of purple bacteria as, e.g., Rhodobacter sphaeroides contain the
protein PufX. Concurrently, the light harvesting complexes 1 (LH1) form dimers
of open rings. In mutants without PufX, the LH1s are closed rings and
photosynthesis breaks down, because the ubiquinone exchange at the reaction
center is blocked. Thus, PufX is regarded essential for quinone exchange.
  In contrast to this view, which implicitly treats the LH1s as obstacles to
photosynthesis, we propose that the primary purpose of PufX is to improve the
efficiency of light harvesting by inducing the LH1 dimerization. Calculations
with a dipole model, which compare the photosynthetic efficiency of various
configurations of monomeric and dimeric core complexes, show that the dimer can
absorb photons directly into the RC about 30% more efficient, when related to
the number of bacteriochlorophylls, but that the performance of the more
sophisticated dimeric LH1 antenna degrades faster with structural
perturbations. The calculations predict an optimal orientation of the reaction
centers relative to the LH1 dimer, which agrees well with the experimentally
found configuration.
  For the increased required rigidity of the dimer additional modifications of
the LH1 subunits are necessary, which would lead to the observed ubiquinone
blockage, when PufX is missing.

increase without bounds with the effective Hilbert space dimension of the
