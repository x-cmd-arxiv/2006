We show that the fraction of very luminous (massive) superclusters in real

are generated by large-scale density perturbations which evolve very slowly.
The absence of very luminous superclusters in simulations can be explained
either by non-proper treatment of large-scale perturbations, or by some yet

beamed along the jet axis due to strong Doppler boosting. The comoving rate
density of blazar flares is assumed to follow a blazar formation rate (BFR),
modeled by analytic functions based on astronomical observations and fits to

with EGRET, separated into BL Lac object (BL) and flat spectrum radio quasar
(FSRQ) distributions, are fit with monoparametric functions for the
distributions of the jet Lorentz factor \Gamma, comoving directional power
l'_e, and spectral slope. A BFR factor ~10 x greater at z ~ 1 than at present

velocity dispersion (or circular velocity) at about the effective radius. We
adopt the singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) lens model to estimate the
velocity dispersion at the effective radius. We use radio lenses from the
Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey and the PMN-NVSS Extragalactic Lens Survey to study
how the velocity dispersions, \sigma_SIE, are related to v_{c,vir}. When we
include both the lensing probability and separation distribution as our lensing
constraints, we find \sigma_SIE /(200\kms) =

\sigma_SIE / v_{c,vir} is about 1.65^{+0.57}_{-0.37} (68% CL) but decreases to
0.65_{-0.12}^{+0.15} (68% CL) for \sigma_SIE = 260\kms. These results are
consistent with those of Seljak (2002) obtained from galaxy-galaxy weak lensing
for galaxies of around L_*. However, our results clearly suggest that the ratio
must vary significantly as \sigma_SIE is varied and are marginally discrepant
with the Seljak results at \sigma_SIE = 260\kms. The scaling \sigma_SIE \propto
v_{c,vir}^{0.22\pm 0.05} is broadly consistent with those from galaxy
occupation statistics studies and the most recent galaxy-galaxy weak lensing

  abridged","Astrophys.J.648:299-309,2006","10.1086/505902",,"astro-ph",,"  We use the Keck Deep Fields UGRI catalog of z~4, 3, and 2 UV-selected
galaxies to study the evolution of the rest-frame 1700A luminosity density at
high redshift. The ability to reliably constrain the contribution of faint
galaxies is critical and our data do so as they reach to M*+2 even at z~4 and
deeper still at lower redshifts. We find that the luminosity density at high
redshift is dominated by the hitherto poorly studied galaxies fainter than L*,
and, indeed, the the bulk of the UV light in the high-z Universe comes from
galaxies in the luminosity range L=0.1-1L*. It is these faint galaxies that
govern the behavior of the total UV luminosity density. Overall, there is a
gradual rise in luminosity density starting at z~4 or earlier, followed by a
shallow peak or a plateau within z~3--1, and then followed by the well-know
plunge at lower redshifts. Within this total picture, luminosity density in
sub-L* galaxies evolves more rapidly at high redshift, z>~2, than that in more
luminous objects. However, this is reversed at lower redshifts, z<~1, a
reversal that is reminiscent of galaxy downsizing. Within the context of the
models commonly used in the observational literature, there seemingly aren't
enough faint or bright LBGs to maintain ionization of intergalactic gas even as
late as z~4. This is particularly true at earlier epochs and even more so if
the faint-end evolutionary trends we observe at z~3 and 4 continue to higher
redshifts. Apparently the Universe must be easier to reionize than some recent
studies have assumed. Nevertheless, sub-L* galaxies do dominate the total UV
luminosity density at z>~2 and this dominance further highlights the need for
follow-up studies that will teach us more about these very numerous but thus
far largely unexplored systems.

the solar neighborhood. We also find that the GB sensibly alters the estimation
of Oort's constants in the Galactic disk; thus, in order to establish
comparisons with other kinematic studies based in older stellar populations, a
careful pruning of the GB members must be performed. Further analysis of the GB

been determined and compared with the large scale mean found from a nine-degree
polynomial fit.
  Comparison has been made of the observed standard deviation for the ratio of
these intensities with that expected from variants of our model. The basic
model adopts cosmic ray origin from supernova remnants, the particles then
diffusing through the Galaxy with our usual 'anomalous diffusion'. The variants
involve the clustering of SN, a frequency distribution for supernova explosion
energies, and 'normal', rather than 'anomalous' diffusion.
  It is found that for supernovae of unique energy, and our usual anomalous
diffusion, clustering is necessary, particularly in the Inner Galaxy. An
alternative, and preferred, situation is to adopt the model with a frequency
distribution of supernova energies. The results for the Outer Galaxy are such
that no clustering is required.

more features commonly associated with massive young stellar objects (YSOs)
surrounded by circumstellar material: a very red colour (J-K) > 2, CO bandhead
emission, hydrogen emission lines (sometimes doubly peaked), and FeII and/or
MgII emission lines. The massive YSO distribution in the CMD suggests that the

  The CO emission must come from a relatively dense (~10^{10} cm^{-3}) and hot
(T~ 2000-5000 K) region, sufficiently shielded from the intense UV radiation
field of the young massive star. The hydrogen emission is produced in an
ionised medium exposed to UV radiation. The best geometrical solution is a
dense and neutral circumstellar disk causing the CO bandhead emission, and an
ionised upper layer where the hydrogen lines are produced. We present arguments
that the circumstellar disk is more likely a remnant of the accretion process
than the result of rapid rotation and mass loss such as in Be/B[e] stars.

considerable interest. In a spin-orbit-coupled system, a nonzero spin-current
is predicted in a direction perpendicular to the applied electric field, giving
rise to a ""spin Hall effect""[2-4]. Consistent with this effect,
electrically-induced spin polarization was recently detected by optical
techniques at the edges of a semiconductor channel[5] and in two-dimensional

conductor, using a ferromagnetic electrode in combination with a tunnel barrier
to inject a spin-polarized current. In our devices, we observe an induced
voltage that results exclusively from the conversion of the injected spin
current into charge imbalance through the spin Hall effect. Such a voltage is
proportional to the component of the injected spins that is perpendicular to
the plane defined by the spin current direction and the voltage probes. These
experiments reveal opportunities for efficient spin detection without the need
for magnetic materials, which could lead to useful spintronics devices that

measured down to 180 K approaching the suggested glass transition temperature
Tg ~ 165 K. Here we present experimental evidence, obtained from Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance and Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering spectroscopies, of a
well defined decoupling of transport properties (the self-diffusion coefficient
and the average translational relaxation time), which implies the breakdown of
the Stokes-Einstein relation. We further show that such a non-monotonic
decoupling reflects the characteristics of the recently observed dynamic
crossover, at about 225 K, between the two dynamical behaviors known as fragile
and strong, which is a consequence of a change in the hydrogen bond structure
of liquid water.

equipped with a coarse-graining kernel that acts as a low-pass filter for the

interactions and a small set of free parameters (interaction couplings). This
paper focuses on the FGC-SSRF model, which is defined on the Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^{d}$ by means of interactions proportional to the squares of the
field realizations, as well as their gradient and curvature. The permissibility
criteria of FGC-SSRFs are extended by considering the impact of a
finite-bandwidth kernel. It is proved that the FGC-SSRFs are almost surely
differentiable in the case of finite bandwidth. Asymptotic explicit expressions
for the Spartan covariance function are derived for $d=1$ and $d=3$; both known
and new covariance functions are obtained depending on the value of the
FGC-SSRF shape parameter. Nonlinear dependence of the covariance integral scale
on the FGC-SSRF characteristic length is established, and it is shown that the
relation becomes linear asymptotically. The results presented in this paper are
useful in random field parameter inference, as well as in spatial interpolation
of irregularly-spaced samples.

space-time quantum fluctuations in the universe. In these proposals, the
fundamental ""fuzziness"" of distance caused by space-time quantum fluctuations
have been directly identified with fluctuations in optical paths. Phase-front
corrugations deduced from these optical-path fluctuations are then applied to
light from extragalactic point sources, and used to constrain various models of
quantum gravity. In particular, the so-called random-walk model has been
claimed to be ruled out by existing astrophysical observations from the Hubble
Space Telescope. However, when a photon propagates in three spatial dimensions,
it does not follow a specific ray, but would rather sample a finite,
three-dimensional region around that ray -- thereby averaging over space-time
quantum fluctuations all through that region. We use a simple, random-walk type
model to demonstrate that, once the appropriate wave optics is applied, the
averaging of neighboring space-time fluctuations will cause much less
distortions on the phase front. In our model, the extra suppression factor due
to diffraction is (Planck Length)/(Wavelength), which is at least 19 orders of
magnitude for astronomical observations.

cosmological evolution at late times without introducing an ad hoc tension term
for the brane. The effective four-dimensional cosmological constant is then
uplifted similar to the KKLT effect and vanishes for a brane thickness equal to
the AdS curvature size, up to the third order of the thickness. The
four-dimensional gravitational constant is then equal to the five-dimensional
one divided by the AdS curvature radius, similar to that derived by dimensional
compactification. An accelerating brane cosmology may emerge at late times
provided there is either a negative transverse pressure component in the brane
energy-momentum tensor or the effective brane cosmological constant is
positive.

the spherically symmetric Einstein-matter system, the total ADM mass M and the
area radius R of the boundary of the body, obey the inequality $2M/R\leq 8/9.$
The proof of this inequality rests on the hypotheses that the energy density is
non-increasing outwards and that the pressure is isotropic. In this work
neither of Buchdahl's hypotheses are assumed. We consider non-isotropic
spherically symmetric shells, supported in $[R_0,R_1], R_0>0,$ of matter models
for which the energy density $\rho\geq 0,$ and the radial- and tangential
pressures $p\geq 0$ and $q,$ satisfy $p+q\leq\Omega\rho, \Omega\geq 1.$ We show
a Buchdahl type inequality for shells which are thin; given an $\epsilon<1/4$
there is a $\kappa>0$ such that $2M/R_1\leq 1-\kappa$ when $R_1/R_0\leq
1+\epsilon.$ It is also shown that for a sequence of solutions such that
$R_1/R_0\to 1,$ the limit supremum of $2M/R_1$ of the sequence is bounded by
$((2\Omega+1)^2-1)/(2\Omega+1)^2.$ In particular if $\Omega=1,$ which is the
case for Vlasov matter, the boumd is $8/9.$ The latter result is motivated by
numerical simulations \cite{AR2} which indicate that for non-isotropic shells
of Vlasov matter $2M/R_1\leq 8/9,$ and moreover, that the value 8/9 is
approached for shells with $R_1/R_0\to 1$. In \cite{An2} a sequence of shells
of Vlasov matter is constructed with the properties that $R_1/R_0\to 1,$ and
that $2M/R_1$ equals 8/9 in the limit. We emphasize that in the present paper
no field equations for the matter are used, whereas in \cite{An2} the Vlasov
equation is important.

means of single photon detectors. Such an experiment can determine the bosons
parity by measurements with different angles between the polarization vector of

"math/0605422","PanKi Kim","Panki Kim and Young-Ran Lee","Generalized 3G theorem and application to relativistic stable process on
  non-smooth open sets","32 pages",,,,"math.PR math-ph math.MP",,"  Let G(x,y) and G_D(x,y) be the Green functions of rotationally invariant
symmetric \alpha-stable process in R^d and in an open set D respectively, where
0<\alpha < 2. The inequality G_D(x,y)G_D(y,z)/G_D(x,z) \le c(G(x,y)+G(y,z)) is
a very useful tool in studying (local) Schrodinger operators. When the above
inequality is true with a constant c=c(D)>0, then we say that the 3G theorem
holds in D.
  In this paper, we establish a generalized version of 3G theorem when D is a
bounded \kappa-fat open set, which includes a bounded John domain. The 3G we
consider is of the form G_D(x,y)G_D(z,w)/G_D(x,w), where y may be different
from z. When y=z, we recover the usual 3G.
  The 3G form G_D(x,y)G_D(z,w)/G_D(x,w) appears in non-local Schrodinger
operator theory. Using our generalized 3G theorem, we give a concrete class of
functions belonging to the non-local Kato class, introduced by Chen and Song,
on \kappa-fat open sets.
  As an application, we discuss relativistic \alpha-stable processes
(relativistic Hamiltonian when \alpha=1) in \kappa-fat open sets. We identify
the Martin boundary and the minimal Martin boundary with the Euclidean boundary
for relativistic \alpha-stable processes in \kappa-fat open sets. Furthermore,
we show that relative Fatou type theorem is true for relativistic stable
processes in \kappa-fat open sets.
  The main results of this paper hold for a large class of symmetric Markov
processes, as are illustrated in the last section of this paper. We also
discuss the generalized 3G theorem for a large class of symmetric stable Levy
processes.

associated to an irreducible Z/p[Out(P)]--module S, then the Krull dimension of

frequency.
  In summary, our results are as follows. A strong form of the conjecture is
true when p is odd. The situation is much more complex when p=2, but is reduced
to a question about 2--central groups (groups in which all elements of order 2
are central), making it easy to verify the conjecture for many finite
2--groups, including all groups of order 128, and all groups that can be
written as the product of groups of order 64 or less.

pairwise interaction is asymmetric and price-invariant. Asymmetric transactions
are typical for chain-trading groups who arrange their business such that
commodities move from senior to junior partners and money moves in the opposite
direction. The price-invariance of transactions means that the probability of a
pairwise interaction is a function of the ratio of incomes, which is
independent of the price scale or absolute income level. These two features
characterize the hierarchical model. The income distribution in this class of
models is a well-defined double-Pareto function, which possesses Pareto tails
for the upper and lower incomes. For gross and net upper incomes, the model
predicts definite values of the Pareto exponents, $a_{\rm gross}$ and $a_{\rm
net}$, which are stable with respect to quantitative variation of the
pair-interaction. The Pareto exponents are also stable with respect to the
choice of a demand function within two classes of status-dependent behavior of
agents: linear demand ($a_{\rm gross}=1$, $a_{\rm net}=2$) and unlimited slowly
varying demand ($a_{\rm gross}=a_{\rm net}=1$). For the sigmoidal demand that
describes limited returns, $a_{\rm gross}=a_{\rm net}=1+\alpha$, with some
$\alpha>0$ satisfying a transcendental equation. The low-income distribution
may be singular or vanishing in the neighborhood of the minimal income; in any
case, it is $L_1$-integrable and its Pareto exponent is given explicitly.
  The theory used in the present study is based on a simple balance equation
and new results from multiplicative Markov chains and exponential moments of
random geometric progressions.

flow, which is directed away from the solidification front, on the radial
solute segregation in simple solidification models. We show that the classical
Burton-Prim-Slichter (BPS) solution describing the effect of a diverging flow
on the solute incorporation into the solidifying material breaks down for the
flows converging along the solidification front. The breakdown is caused by a
divergence of the integral defining the effective boundary layer thickness
which is the basic concept of the BPS theory. Although such a divergence can
formally be avoided by restricting the axial extension of the melt to a layer
of finite height, radially uniform solute distributions are possible only for
weak melt flows with an axial velocity away from the solidification front
comparable to the growth rate. There is a critical melt velocity for each
growth rate at which the solution passes through a singularity and becomes
physically inconsistent for stronger melt flows. To resolve these
inconsistencies we consider a solidification front presented by a disk of
finite radius $R_0$ subject to a strong converging melt flow and obtain an
analytic solution showing that the radial solute concentration depends on the
radius $r$ as $\sim\ln^{1/3}(R_0/r)$ and $\sim\ln(R_0/r)$ close to the rim and
at large distances from it. The logarithmic increase of concentration is
limited in the vicinity of the symmetry axis by the diffusion becoming
effective at a distance comparable to the characteristic thickness of the
solute boundary layer. The converging flow causes a solute pile-up forming a
logarithmic concentration peak at the symmetry axis which might be an
undesirable feature for crystal growth processes.

approach to financial risk management is presented, modeling the power-law
tails of the returns distribution in terms of a Student-t distribution.
Non-Gaussian closed-form solutions for Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall are
obtained and standard formulae known in the literature under the normality
assumption are recovered as a special case. The implications of the approach
for risk management are demonstrated through an empirical analysis of financial
time series from the Italian stock market and in comparison with the results of
the most widely used procedures of quantitative finance. Particular attention
is paid to quantify the size of the errors affecting the market risk measures
obtained according to different methodologies, by employing a bootstrap
technique.

different modalities: verbal, visual, kinesthetic, social, etc. A study testing
the effectiveness of the n-coding construct in an algebra-based mechanics
course is presented. Four sections differing in the level of n-coding
opportunities were compared. Besides a traditional instruction section used as
a control group, each of the remaining three treatment sections were given
context rich problems following the 'cooperative group problem solving'
approach which differed by the level of n-coding opportunities designed into
their laboratory environment. To measure the effectiveness of the construct,
problem solving skills were assessed as was conceptual learning using the Force
Concept Inventory. However, a number of new measures taking into account
students' confidence in concepts were developed to complete the picture of
student learning. Results suggest that using the developed n-coding construct
to design context rich environments can generate learning gains in problem
solving, conceptual knowledge and concept-confidence.

dynamics for update groups of size 3. While the initial model assumes a
constant density of contrarians a for both opinions, it now depends for each
opinion on its global support. Proportionate contrarians are thus found to
indeed preserve the former case main results. However, restricting the
contrarian behavior to only the current collective majority, makes the dynamics
more complex with novel features. For a density a<a_c=1/9 of one-sided
contrarians, a chaotic basin is found in the fifty-fifty region separated from
two majority-minority point attractors, one on each side. For 1/9<a< 0.301 only
the chaotic basin survives. In the range a>0.301 the chaotic basin disappears
and the majority starts to alternate between the two opinions with a staggered
flow towards two point attractors. We then study the effect of both, decoupling
the local update time sequence from the contrarian behavior activation, and a
smoothing of the majority rule. A status quo driven bias for contrarian
activation is also considered. Introduction of unsettled agents driven in the
debate on a contrarian basis is shown to only shrink the chaotic basin. The
model may shed light to recent apparent contradictory elections with on the one
hand very tied results like in US in 2000 and in Germany in 2002 and 2005, and
on the other hand, a huge majority like in France in 2002.

models, employing them to synthesize knowledge, to explain observations, and to
forecast future system behavior. Complete specification of systems is
impossible, so models must be simplified abstractions. Thus, the art of
modeling involves deciding which system elements to include and determining how
they should be represented. We view modeling as search through a space of
candidate models that is guided by model objectives, theoretical knowledge, and
empirical data. In this contribution, we introduce a method for representing
process-based models that facilitates the discovery of models that explain
observed behavior. This representation casts dynamic systems as interacting
sets of processes that act on entities. Using this approach, a modeler first
encodes relevant ecological knowledge into a library of generic entities and
processes, then instantiates these theoretical components, and finally
assembles candidate models from these elements. We illustrate this methodology
with a model of the Ross Sea ecosystem.

commitment, introduced independently by Aharonov et al. [STOC, 2000] and Hardy
and Kent [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92 (2004)] is investigated. In this variant, the
parties require some nonzero probability of detecting a cheating, i.e. if Bob,
who commits a bit b to Alice, changes his mind during the revealing phase then
Alice detects the cheating with a positive probability (we call this property
binding); and if Alice gains information about the committed bit before the
revealing phase then Bob discovers this with positive probability (sealing). In
our paper we give quantum bit commitment scheme that is simultaneously binding
and sealing and we show that if a cheating gives epsilon advantage to a
malicious Alice then Bob can detect the cheating with a probability
Omega(epsilon^2). If Bob cheats then Alice's probability of detecting the
cheating is greater than some fixed constant lambda>0. This improves the
probabilities of cheating detections shown by Hardy and Kent and the scheme by
Aharonov et al. who presented a protocol that is either binding or sealing, but
not simultaneously both. To construct a cheat sensitive quantum bit commitment
