  added to the source",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20065026",,"astro-ph",,"  CONTEXT.The mass assembly is believed to be the dominant process of early
galaxy formation. This mechanism of galaxy building can proceed either by
repeated major mergers with other systems, or by means of accretion of matter
from the surrounding regions. AIMS.In this paper we compare the properties of
local disk galaxies that appear isolated, i.e. not tidally affected by other
galaxies during the last few Gyr within the volume given by cz<= 5000 km/s,
with those galaxies at z values from 0.25 to 5.
  METHODS.Effective radii for 203 isolated galaxies and 1645 galaxies from the
RC3 have been collected and the two samples have been analyzed statistically. A
similar comparison has been made with half light radii studied at high z from
the literature.
  RESULTS.We found that isolated galaxies are in general smaller than other
present epoch galaxies from the RC3. We notice the lack of systems larger than
7 kpc among them. Their size distribution appears to be similar to that of
galaxies at 1.4 <= z <= 2. The models of the merging history also indicate that
the isolated galaxies did stop their merging process at about that redshift,
evolving passively since then. The galaxy density seems to have remained
unchanged since that epoch.
  CONCLUSIONS.Isolated galaxies appears to be the end products of the merging
process as proposed in the hierarchical accretion scenario at around z=1.4. For
this class of galaxies this was the last significant merging event in their
lives and have evolved passively since then. This is confirmed by the
analytical estimate of the merging fraction with z and by the comparison with
sizes of distant galaxies.

Spectrograph (STIS) of five young massive star clusters in the starburst galaxy
M82. A detailed analysis is performed for one cluster `M82-A1' and its
immediate environment in the starburst core. From HST archive images, we find
that it is elliptical with an effective radius of 3.0+/-0.5 pc and is
surrounded by a compact (r=4.5+/-0.5 pc) H II region. We determine the age and
reddening of M82-A1 using synthetic spectra from population synthesis models by
fitting both the continuum energy distribution and the depth of the Balmer
jump. We find an age of 6.4+/-0.5 Myr and a photometric mass estimate of M=7-13
x 10^5 solar masses. We associate its formation with the most recent starburst
event 4-6 Myr ago. We find that the oxygen abundance of the H II region
surrounding M82-A1 is solar or slightly higher. The H II region has a high
pressure P/k = 1-2 x 10^7 cm^-3 K. The diffuse gas in region A has a slightly
lower pressure, which together with the broad H alpha emission line width,
suggests that both the thermal and turbulent pressures in the M82 starburst
core are unusually high. We discuss how this environment has affected the
evolution of the cluster wind for M82-A1. We find that the high pressure may
have caused the pressure-driven bubble to stall. We also obtain spectroscopic
ages for clusters B1-2 and B2-1 in the `fossil' starburst region and for the
intermediate age clusters F and L. These are consistent with earlier studies
and demonstrate that star formation activity, sufficiently intense to produce
super star clusters, has been going on in M82 during the past Gyr, perhaps in
discrete and localized episodes.

Carina field velocities from archived VLT+GIRAFFE spectra with r<=r_lim,
demonstrate a nearly constant Carina velocity dispersion to just beyond r =

extended Carina population represents tidal debris from the dSph. Of 65 giant
candidates at large angular radii from the Carina center for which MIKE spectra
have been obtained 94% are associated either with Carina or a second, newly
discovered diffuse, but strongly radial velocity-coherent (velocity dispersion

two brightest optical knots, A and B, into five individual young massive
clusters along our slit, A1-4 and B1 respectively. From Starburst99 (Leitherer

optical, we derive ages that are consistent with the formation of two separate
burst events, of ~4+/-1 Myr and <3 Myr for knots A (A1-4) and B (B1). An LMC
metallicity is measured for both knots, while nebular HeII 4686 is observed in
knot B and perhaps in knot A. We detect underlying broad wings on the strongest
nebular emission lines indicating velocities up to 600 km/s. We estimate that
there are ~95 early WN stars and ~35 early WC stars in Tol89-A, using empirical
template spectra of LMC WR stars from Crowther and Hadfield. Remarkably, we
also detect ~ three mid WNs in the smallest (mass) cluster in Tol89-A, A4. From
the strength of nebular H beta, we obtain N(O) ~690 and 2800 for knots A and B.
We also employ a complementary approach using Starburst99 models, in which the
O star content is inferred from the stellar continuum, and the WR population is
obtained from spectral synthesis of optical WR features using the grids from
Smith et al. We find reasonable agreement between the two methods for the O
star content and the N(WR)/N(O) ratio but find that the WR subtype distribution
is in error in the Starburst99 models, with far too few WN stars being
predicted. We attribute this failure to the neglect of rotational mixing in
evolutionary models. [abridged]

leading arm length representing ~2.5-3.0 Gyr of dynamical (i.e. tidal
stripping) age. This is direct evidence that there can be significant chemical
differences between current dSph satellites and the bulk of the stars they have
contributed to the halo. Our results suggest that Sgr experienced a significant
change in binding energy over the past several Gyr, which has substantially
decreased its tidal boundary across a radial range over which there must have
been a significant metallicity gradient in the progenitor galaxy. By accounting
for MDF variation along the debris arms, we approximate the MDF Sgr would have
had several Gyr ago. We also analyze the MDF of a moving group of M giants we
previously discovered towards the North Galactic Cap having opposite radial
velocities to the infalling Sgr leading arm stars there and propose that most
of these represent Sgr trailing arm stars overlapping the Sgr leading arm in
this part of the sky. If so, these trailing arm stars further demonstrate the
strong MDF evolution within the Sgr stream.

for solar physicists, as have the elemental abundances it seems to imply. We
modelled solar CO line formation using a realistic, ab initio, time-dependent

observations from the space-based ATMOS experiment. We employed weak 12C16O,
13C16O and 12C18O lines from the fundamental and first overtone bands to
determine the solar carbon abundance, as well as the 12C/13C and 16O/18O
isotopic ratios. A weighted carbon abundance of log epsilonC = 8.39 +-0.05 was
found. We note with satisfaction that the derived abundance is identical to our
recent 3D determination based on CI, [C I], C2 and CH lines. Identical
calculations were carried out using 1D models, but only the 3D model was able
to produce abundance agreement between different CO lines and the other atomic
and molecular diagnostics. Solar 12C/13C and 16O/18O ratios were measured as
86.8+3.9-3.7 (delta13C = 30+46-44) and 479+29-28 (delta18O = 41+67-59),
respectively. These values may require current theories of solar system
formation to be revised. Excellent agreement was seen between observed and
predicted weak CO line shapes, without invoking micro- or macroturbulence.
Agreement breaks down for the strongest CO lines however, which are formed in
very high atmospheric layers. The simplest explanation is that temperatures are
overestimated in the highest layers of the 3D simulation. Thus, our analysis
supports the presence of a COmosphere above the traditional photospheric
temperature minimum, with an average temperature of less than 4000K. The
shortcoming of the model atmosphere is not surprising, given that it was never
intended to properly describe such high layers.

astrophysical magnetohydrodynamical code ZEUS-MP that includes a
non-equilibrium treatment of the formation and destruction of H2. We examine
two different approximations to treat the shielding of H2 against
photodissociation: a local approximation, which gives us a solid lower bound on
the amount of shielding, and a method based on ray-tracing that is considerably
more accurate in some circumstances but that produces results that are harder
to clearly interpret. Either approximation allows one to perform
three-dimensional high-resolution simulations of cloud formation with only
modest computational resources. We also include a detailed treatment of the
thermal behaviour of the gas.
  In this paper, we focus on the problem of molecular cloud formation in
gravitationally unstable, initially static gas. We show that in these
conditions, and for initial densities consistent with those observed in the
cold, neutral atomic phase of the interstellar medium, H2 formation occurs on a
timescale t > 10 Myr, comparable to or longer than the gravitational free-fall
timescale of the cloud. We also show that the collapsing gas very quickly
reaches thermal equilibrium and that the equation of state of the gas is
generally softer than isothermal.
  Finally, we demonstrate that although these results show little sensitivity
to variations in most of our simulation parameters, they are highly sensitive
to the assumed initial density n_i. Reducing n_i significantly increases the
cloud formation timescale and decreases the amount of hydrogen ultimately
converted to H2. (Abridged).

simulations that demonstrate that H2 formation occurs rapidly in turbulent gas.
Starting with purely atomic hydrogen, large quantities of molecular hydrogen
can be produced on timescales of 1 -- 2 Myr, given turbulent velocity
dispersions and magnetic field strengths consistent with observations.
Moreover, as our simulations underestimate the effectiveness of H2
self-shielding and dust absorption, we can be confident that the molecular
fractions that we compute are strong lower limits on the true values. The
formation of large quantities of H2 on the timescale required by rapid cloud
formation models therefore appears to be entirely plausible.
  We also investigate the density and temperature distributions of gas in our
model clouds. We show that the density probability distribution function is
approximately log-normal, with a dispersion that agrees well with the
prediction of Padoan, Nordlund & Jones (1997). The temperature distribution is
similar to that of a polytrope, with an effective polytropic index gamma_eff
\simeq 0.8, although at low gas densities, the scatter of the actual gas
temperature around this mean value is considerable, and the polytropic
approximation does not capture the full range of behaviour of the gas.

from z=0 to z=4; ii) the observed local relation between the black hole mass
m_{BH} and the mass of the host galaxy. At low redshift the inclusion of AGN

explain helioseismological data, which show that the solar tachocline thickness
is at most 5% of the solar radius, despite the fact that, due to radiative
spreading, this transition layer should have thickened to a much more
significant value during the sun's evolution. Starting from the first principle
with the physically plausible assumption that turbulence is driven externally
(e.g. by plumes penetrating from the convection zone), we derive turbulent
(eddy) viscosity in the radial (vertical) and azimuthal (horizontal) directions
by incorporating the crucial effects of shearing due to radial and latitudinal
differential rotations in the tachocline. We show that the simultaneous
presence of both shears induces effectively a much more efficient momentum
transport in the horizontal plane than in the radial direction. In particular,
in the case of strong radial turbulence (driven by overshooting plumes from the
convection zone), the ratio of the radial to horizontal eddy viscosity is
proportional to ${\cal A}^{-1/3}$, where ${\cal A}$ is the strength of the
shear due to radial differential rotation. In comparison, in the case of
horizontally driven turbulence, this ratio becomes of order $-\epsilon^2$, with
negative radial eddy viscosity. Here, $\epsilon$ ($\ll 1$) is the ratio of the
radial to latitudinal shear. The resulting anisotropy in momentum transport
could thus be sufficiently strong to operate as a mechanism for the tachocline
confinement against spreading.

key reaction is the deuteron exchange in the reaction between HD, the reservoir
of deuterium in dark interstellar clouds, and the H3+ molecular ion, leading to
the production of the H2D+ molecule, and the low temperature in dark
interstellar clouds favors this production. Furthermore, the presence of
multiply deuterated species have incited our group to proceed further and
consider the subsequent reaction of H2D+ with HD, leading to D2H+ (first
detected by Vastel et al. 2004), which can further react with HD to produce
D3+. In prestellar cores, where CO was found to be depleted (Bacmann et al.
2003), this production should be increased, as CO would normally destroy H3+.
The first model including D2H+ and D3+ (Roberts, Herbst & Millar 2003)
predicted that these molecules should be as abundant as H2D+ (see contribution
by H. Roberts). The first detection of the D2H+ was made possible by the recent

such a reduction naturally arises in a model proposed recently to explain the
characteristics of the 0.7 anomaly in quantum point contacts in terms of a
quasi-bound state, due to the emergence of two conducting channels. We
calculate the shot noise as a function of temperature, applied voltage and
magnetic field, and demonstrate an excellent agreement with experiments. It is
predicted that with decreasing temperature, voltage and magnetic field, the dip
in the shot noise is suppressed due to the Kondo effect.

of transmitted signals, we consider a design of complementary set matrices
whose column sequences satisfy a correlation constraint. The design algorithm
recursively builds a collection of $2^{t+1}$ mutually orthogonal (MO)
complementary set matrices starting from a companion pair of sequences. We
relate correlation properties of column sequences to that of the companion pair
and illustrate how to select an appropriate companion pair to ensure that a
given column correlation constraint is satisfied. For $t=0$, companion pair
properties directly determine matrix column correlation properties. For $t\geq
1$, reducing correlation merits of the companion pair may lead to improved
column correlation properties. However, further decrease of the maximum
out-off-phase aperiodic autocorrelation of column sequences is not possible
once the companion pair correlation merit is less than a threshold determined
by $t$. We also reveal a design of the companion pair which leads to
complementary set matrices with Golay column sequences. Exhaustive search for
companion pairs satisfying a column correlation constraint is infeasible for
medium and long sequences. We instead search for two shorter length sequences
by minimizing a cost function in terms of their autocorrelation and
crosscorrelation merits. Furthermore, an improved cost function which helps in
reducing the maximum out-off-phase column correlation is derived based on the
properties of the companion pair. By exploiting the well-known Welch bound,
sufficient conditions for the existence of companion pairs which satisfy a set

baryon resonances, using a general framework based on the flavor symmetry.
Assuming that the Theta+ belongs to an antidecuplet representation which mixes
with an octet, we calculate the mass spectra of the flavor partners of the
Theta+ based on the SU(3) symmetry. The decay widths of the Theta+ and nucleon
partners are analyzed for the consistency check of the mixing angle obtained
from the masses. It is found that a suitable choice of the mixing angle
successfully reproduces the observed masses of exotics, when their spin and
parity are assigned to be J^P=3/2^-, together with other nonexotic resonances
of J^P=3/2^-. The decay widths of Theta -> KN, N(1520) -> pi N, and N(1700) ->
pi N are also reproduced simultaneously. We then evaluate two-meson couplings
of Theta+, using experimental information of nucleon partners decaying into pi
pi N channels, in which the two pions are in scalar- and vector-type
correlations. We examine two assignments of spin and parity J^P=1/2^+ and
3/2^-, for which the experimental spectra of known resonances with exotic
baryons are properly reproduced by an octet-antidecuplet representation mixing
scheme. Using the obtained coupling constants, total cross sections of the
reactions pi- p -> K- Theta+ and K+ p -> pi+ Theta+ are calculated. Substantial
interference of two terms may occur in the reaction processes for the J^P=1/2^+
case, whereas the interference effect is rather small for the 3/2^- case.

noncommutative space of Penrose tilings is interpreted as a non-Hausdorff orbit
space of a compact, ultrametric space under the action of its local isometry
group. This is generalized to compact, locally rigid, ultrametric spaces. The
local isometry types and the local similarity types in those spaces can be
analyzed using groupoid C^*-algebras.
  The concept of a locally rigid action of a countable group \Gamma on a
compact, ultrametric space by local similarities is introduced. It is proved
that there is a faithful unitary representation of \Gamma into the germ
groupoid C^*-algebra of the action. The prototypical example is the standard
action of Thompson's group V on the ultrametric Cantor set. In this case, the
C^*-algebra is the Cuntz algebra O_2 and representations originally due to
Birget and Nekrashevych are recovered.
  End spaces of trees are sources of ultrametric spaces. Some connections are
made between locally rigid, ultrametric spaces and a concept in the theory of
tree lattices of Bass and Lubotzky.

that it is not possible to increase the efficiency, prove this conjecture for
several important special cases, and provide extensive numerical results for
the general case.

knowledge of the state and the amount of decoherence based on indirect
continuous measurement. The purpose of this information extraction is to
determine the feedback in order to control decoherence based on an ``output
equation"", described by a bilinear form. An interacting bilinear form of
control system is used instead of master equation to analyze the dynamic
properties of the system. The analysis of continuous measurement on a
decohering quantum system has not been extensively studied before.

  electrons","submitted to Phys. Lett. B","Phys. Lett. B641 (2006) 18","10.1016/j.physletb.2006.07.054",,"quant-ph",,"  The Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP) is one of the basic principles of modern
physics and, even if there are no compelling reasons to doubt its validity, it
is still debated today because an intuitive, elementary explanation is still
missing, and because of its unique stand among the basic symmetries of physics.
The present paper reports a new limit on the probability that PEP is violated
by electrons, in a search for a shifted K$_\alpha$ line in copper: the presence
of this line in the soft X-ray copper fluorescence would signal a transition to
a ground state already occupied by 2 electrons. The obtained value, ${1/2}
\beta^{2} \leq 4.5\times 10^{-28}$, improves the existing limit by almost two
orders of magnitude.
