both the scintillation light and the ionisation charge generated in the liquid
by interacting particles and radiation. The instrument design is driven by both
the physics requirements and by the technology requirements surrounding the use
of liquid xenon. These include considerations of key performance parameters,
such as the efficiency of scintillation light collection, restrictions placed
on the use of materials to control the inherent radioactivity levels,
attainment of high vacuum levels and chemical contamination control. The
successful solution has involved a number of novel design and manufacturing
features which will be of specific use to future generations of direct dark
matter search experiments as they struggle with similar and progressively more
demanding requirements.

  and many minor changes also in response to referee",,"10.1086/521292",,"astro-ph",,"  The nature of ultracompact H II regions (UCHRs) remains poorly determined. In
particular, they are about an order of magnitude more common than would be
expected if they formed around young massive stars and lasted for one dynamical
time, around 10^4 yr. We here perform three-dimensional numerical simulations
of the expansion of an H II region into self-gravitating, radiatively cooled
gas, both with and without supersonic turbulent flows. In the laminar case, we
find that H II region expansion in a collapsing core produces nearly spherical
shells, even if the ionizing source is off-center in the core. This agrees with
analytic models of blast waves in power-law media. In the turbulent case, we
find that the H II region does not disrupt the central collapsing region, but
rather sweeps up a shell of gas in which further collapse occurs. Although this
does not constitute triggering, as the swept-up gas would eventually have
collapsed anyway, it does expose the collapsing regions to ionizing radiation.
We suggest that these regions of secondary collapse, which will not all
themselves form massive stars, may form the bulk of observed UCHRs. As the
larger shell will take over 10^5 years to complete its evolution, this could
solve the timescale problem. Our suggestion is supported by the ubiquitous
observation of more diffuse emission surrounding UCHRs.

we construct self-similar shock solutions for such an expansion and depletion

galaxies. There is evidence that this is related to the age of the galaxy. In
this paper new X-ray observations are presented for three early-type galaxies
that show evidence of youth, in order to investigate their X-ray components and
properties. NGC 5363 and NGC 2865 were found to have X-ray emission dominated
by purely discrete stellar sources. Limits are set on the mass distribution in
one of the galaxies observed with XMM-Newton, NGC 4382, which contains
significant hot gas. We detect the X-ray emission in NGC 4382 out to 4r$_e$.
The mass-to-light ratio is consistent with a stellar origin in the inner
regions but rises steadily to values indicative of some dark matter by 4r$_e$.
These results are set in context with other data drawn from the literature, for
galaxies with ages estimated from dynamical or spectroscopic indicators. Ages
obtained from optical spectroscopy represent central luminosity weighted
stellar ages. We examine the X-ray evolution with age, normalised by B and K
band luminosities. Low values of Log(L$_X$/L$_B$) and Log(L$_X$/L$_K$) are
found for all galaxies with ages between 1 and 4 Gyrs. Luminous X-ray emission
only appears in older galaxies. This suggests that the interstellar medium is
removed and then it takes several gigayears for hot gas halos to build up,
following a merger. A possible mechanism for gas expulsion might be associated
with feedback from an active nucleus triggered during a merger.

to observe the burst for 7.1 days and detect it for 1.4 days. The X-ray light
curve showed a classic decay pattern; the afterglow was too faint for a jet
break to be detected. No optical, infrared or ultraviolet counterpart was
discovered despite deep searches within 14 hours of the burst. Two particular
features of the prompt emission make GRB 050717 a very unusual burst. First,
the peak of the nu Fnu spectrum was observed to be 2401(-568/+781) keV for the
main peak, which is the highest value of Epeak ever observed. Secondly, the
spectral lag for GRB 050717 was determined to be 2.5 +- 2.6 ms, consistent with
zero and unusually short for a long burst. This lag measurement suggests that
this burst has a high intrinsic luminosity and hence is at high redshift (z >

diffuse source sensitivity of FUSE, upper limits on non-detected objects are
quite sensitive in many cases. Estimated total luminosities in O~VI span a

mechanisms on scales smaller than 8 "" are excluded. High-resolution continuum

occurs outside the ISCO, while the opposite is true for q<~0.24. When tidal
disruption occurs sufficiently far outside the ISCO, mass is transferred
unstably from the neutron star to the black hole, resulting in the complete
disruption of the neutron star. When tidal disruption occurs slightly within

molecular species (4 already presented in the first part of this series): CO,
CS, N2H+, NH3, CH3OH, SO, C3H2, HC3N, C2S, HCN, H2CO, HCO+, and DCO+. Using a
physical model of core structure and a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, we
determine for each core a self-consistent set abundances that fits
simultaneously the observed radial profile of integrated intensity and the
emergent spectrum towards the core center (for abundant species, optically thin
isopologues are used). From this work, we find that L1498 and L1517B have
similar abundance patterns, with most species suffering a significant drop
toward the core center. This occurs for CO, CS, CH3OH, SO, C3H2, HC3N, C2S,
HCN, H2CO, HCO+, and DCO+, which we fit with profiles having a sharp central
hole. The size of this hole varies with molecule: DCO+, HCN, and HC3N have the
smallest holes while SO, C2S and CO have the largest holes. Only N2H+ and NH3
are present in the gas phase at the core centers. From the different behavior
of molecules, we select SO, C2S, and CH3OH as the most sensitive tracers of

the short-duration burst GRB 060121, which is the first observed to clearly
outshine its host galaxy (by a factor >10^2). A photometric redshift for this
event places the progenitor at a most probable redshift of z = 4.6, with a less
probable scenario of z = 1.7. In either case, GRB 060121 could be the
farthermost short-duration GRB detected to date and implies an
isotropic-equivalent energy release in gamma-rays comparable to that seen in
long-duration bursts. We discuss the implications of the released energy on the
nature of the progenitor. These results suggest that GRB 060121 may belong to a
family of energetic short-duration events, lying at z > 1 and whose optical
afterglows would outshine their host galaxies, unlike the first short-duration
GRBs observed in 2005. The possibility of GRB 060121 being an intermediate

survey of obscured Milky Way clusters to determine whether our Galaxy is still
forming such objects. Near-infrared spectral classification of some probable
cluster members was used to derive the distances to the cluster candidates.
Isochrone analysis of deep near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams allowed us to
obtain age and mass estimates. We report the physical parameters of three
cluster candidates:
  RCW87 is approx. 25 Myr old, located at a distance of D=7.6 Kpc in the
general direction of the Galactic center. Adding the mass of the suspected
cluster members we obtain an estimated total cluster mass of approx. 10300
solar masses. The mid-infrared photometry indicates that some next-generation
star formation is on-going in the associated HII region, probably triggered by
supernovae or stellar wind from the older stars in RCW87.
  The brightest member of [BDSB2003]164 is an O5V type star, based on our
spectroscopy. This limits the cluster age to less than a few million years. The
estimated total mass is approx. 1760 solar masses and the distance is D=3.2
Kpc.
  [DBSB2003]172 lacks central concentration and most likely this is not a
cluster but an extended star forming region.
  The high mass of RCW87 -- if confirmed -- puts this object in line with
Arches and Quintuplet, among the most young massive clusters in the Galaxy.
Further study is necessary to confirm this important result.

here, are not steeper than the cluster IMFs except in rare cases. This is true
even though low mass clusters generally outnumber high mass clusters and the
average maximum stellar mass in a cluster scales with the cluster mass. The
implication is that the mass distribution function for clusters and
associations is a power law with a slope of -2 or shallower. Steeper slopes,

  This thesis combines imaging and spectroscopy of GPS/CSS sources at different
wavelengths, and all our studies lead to the same conclusion: the presence and
expansion of powerful radio sources clearly affect the properties and evolution
of their hosts. All chapters of the thesis find evidence of strong interaction
between the host and the radio source. Furthermore, the radio source and host
can significantly affect each others evolution. However, this influence takes
place in different ways. The influence that the host has on the radio source is
somehow indirect. However it can completely change its destiny: depending of
the contents, distribution and density of the gas, the radio source will die
early, expand and grow into the large FR sources, or remain confined inside its
host. In contrast, the influence of the radio source on its host seems to be
more direct and takes place during its expansion through the host: the radio
source will affect the kinematics and ionization of the emission line gas, and
may change the star formation history of the host.

medium. Previous numerical simulations have demonstrated that the thermal
instability in a shock-compressed layer produces the supersonic turbulent
motion that does not decay. In this paper we focus on two- and
three-dimensional numerical simulations of the non-linear development of simple
thermal instability incorporating physical viscosity but without any external
forcing, in order to isolate the effects of various processes responsible for
the long-lasting turbulent motion. As the initial condition for our
simulations, we set up spatially uniform gas with thermally unstable
temperature in a box with periodic boundaries. After the linear growth stage of
the thermal instability, two-phase medium forms where cold clumps are embedded
in warm medium, and turbulent fluid flow clearly visible as translational
motions of the cold clumps does not decay in a viscous dissipation timescale.
The amplitude of the turbulent velocity increases when we reduce the Prandtl
number that is the non-dimensional ratio of kinetic viscosity to thermal
conduction: the saturation amplitude does not change when we increase the
viscosity and thermal conduction coefficients simultaneously in order to keep
the Prandtl number. This shows that the thermal conduction plays an important
role in maintaining turbulent motions against viscous dissipation. The
amplitude also increases when we increase the ratio of the computational domain
length $L$ to the cooling length $\lambda_{\rm c}$ that is defined by the
product of the cooling time and the sound speed, as long as $L \la 100

dominated by the high-energy component of the jet, not by the radio synchrotron

a second synchrotron component or to IC scattering of ambient photons. In the
former case, we argue that the acceleration of protons exceeding 10^16 eV or

model, into which highly relativistic Doppler beaming has to be incorporated,
requires very low-energy electrons (~ 1 MeV). The present polarization data in

important to establish the radiation mechanism responsible for the high-energy

antiferromagnetically through spacer layers. The general structure of the phase
diagrams is analysed. At a high ratio of uniaxial anisotropy to
antiferromagnetic interlayer exchange, only a succession of collinear magnetic
states is possible. With increasing field first-order (metamagnetic)
transitions occur from the antiferromagnetic ground-state to a set of
degenerate ferrimagnetic states and to the saturated ferromagnetic state. At
low anisotropies, a first-order transition from the antiferromagnetic
ground-state to an inhomogeneous spin-flop state occurs. Between these two
regions, transitional magnetic phases occupy the range of intermediate
anisotropies. Detailed and quantitative phase diagrams are given for the basic
model of antiferromagnetic multilayer systems with N = 2 to 16 layers. The

numbers of layers are analysed by two different representations of the magnetic

a metal, but its Fermi surface is broken up into disconnected segments known as
Fermi arcs. Using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we show that the
anisotropy of the pseudogap in momentum space and the resulting arcs depend
only on the ratio T/T*(x), where T*(x) is the temperature below which the
pseudogap first develops at a given hole doping x. In particular, the arcs
collapse linearly with T/T* and extrapolate to zero extent as T goes to 0. This
suggests that the T = 0 pseudogap state is a nodal liquid, a strange metallic
state whose gapless excitations are located only at points in momentum space,

solution where part of the volume is influenced by a porous medium. To this
end, we study the impact of long-range-correlated quenched disorder on the
entropy and scaling properties of $f$-arm star polymers in a good solvent. We
assume that the disorder is correlated on the polymer length scale with a
power-law decay of the pair correlation function $g(r) \sim r^{-a}$. Applying
the field-theoretical renormalization group approach we show in a double
expansion in $\epsilon=4-d$ and $\delta=4-a$ that there is a range of
correlation strengths $\delta$ for which the disorder changes the scaling
behavior of star polymers. In a second approach we calculate for fixed space
dimension $d=3$ and different values of the correlation parameter $a$ the
corresponding scaling exponents $\gamma_f$ that govern entropic effects. We
find that $\gamma_f-1$, the deviation of $\gamma_f$ from its mean field value
is amplified by the disorder once we increase $\delta$ beyond a threshold. The
consequences for a solution of diluted chain and star polymers of equal
molecular weight inside a porous medium are: star polymers exert a higher
osmotic pressure than chain polymers and in general higher branched star
polymers are expelled more strongly from the correlated porous medium.
Surprisingly, polymer chains will prefer a stronger correlated medium to a less
or uncorrelated medium of the same density while the opposite is the case for
star polymers.

guaranteed to be tight in terms of the asymptotic order. The Boolean framework
proposed herein further admits a composite search for even tighter results. For
comparison, a refinement of the algorithm is capable of exhausting all stopping

approximately 1.67*10^25 trials if a brute force approach is taken. These

transmission pattern is identical, with the exception of a possible time shift,
at all nodes, removing spatial correlation of transmissions to network
strucutre. Data for all neighbors resides in the same encrypted packet. Each
neighbor then decides which subset of the data in a packet to forward onwards
using a routing protocol whose details are orthogonal to the proposed scheme.
We analyze the basic scheme, exploring the tradeoffs in terms of frequency of
transmission and packet size. We also explore adaptive and time changing
patterns and analyze their performance under a number of representative

performance of these protocols is impacted by physical voids, and localization
errors. Accordingly, virtual coordinate systems (VCS) were proposed as an
alternative approach that is resilient to localization errors and that
naturally routes around physical voids. However, we show that VCS is vulnerable
to different forms of the void problem and the performance of greedy routing on
VCS is worse than that of geographic forwarding. We show that these anomalies
are due to the integral nature of VCS, which causes quantization noise in the
estimate of connectivity and node location. We propose an aligned virtual
coordinate system (AVCS) on which the greedy routing success can be
significantly improved. With our approach, and for the first time, we show that
greedy routing on VCS out-performs that on physical coordinate systems even in
the absence of localization errors. We compare AVCS against some of the most

desirable to run jobs in background of a computer which can take considerable

the techniques for the programs written in other languages like C, C++, F77,

sharing its independent parts into all other remote computers available in the
network. Doing the parallelization, we can perform large computational
operations within a very short period of time, and therefore, the efficiency of
the numerical works can be achieved. Parallel computation supports any version
of mathematica and it also works significantly well even if different versions
of mathematica are installed in different computers. All the operations studied
in this article run under any supported operating system like Unix, Windows,
Macintosh, etc. For the sake of our illustrations, here we concentrate all the
discussions only for the Unix based operating system.

stationary black hole that is ``rotating''--i.e., is such that the stationary
Killing field is not everywhere normal to the horizon--must be axisymmetric.
The proof of this result in 4-dimensions relies on the fact that the orbits of
the stationary Killing field on the horizon have the property that they must
return to the same null geodesic generator of the horizon after a certain
period, $P$. This latter property follows, in turn, from the fact that the
cross-sections of the horizon are two-dimensional spheres. However, in
spacetimes of dimension greater than 4, it is no longer true that the orbits of
the stationary Killing field on the horizon must return to the same null
geodesic generator. In this paper, we prove that, nevertheless, a higher
dimensional stationary black hole that is rotating must be axisymmetric. No
assumptions are made concerning the topology of the horizon cross-sections
other than that they are compact. However, we assume that the horizon is
non-degenerate and, as in the 4-dimensional proof, that the spacetime is
analytic.

discrepancy between the CP asymmetry S_{psi K_S} and large values of |V_ub| and
to obtain for the mass difference Delta M_s < (Delta M_s)_SM as suggested by
the recent result by the CDF collaboration. We also identify a scenario in
which simultaneously significant enhancements of the CP asymmetries S_{phi psi}
and A_SL^q relative to the SM are possible, while satisfying all existing
constraints, in particular from the B -> X_s gamma decay and A_CP(B -> X_s
