clearly separated branches on the standard optical diagnostic diagrams. We
derive a new empirical classification scheme which cleanly separates
star-forming galaxies, composite AGN-HII galaxies, Seyferts and LINERs and we
study the host galaxy properties of these different classes of objects. LINERs
are older, more massive, less dusty and more concentrated, and have higher
velocity dispersions and lower [OIII] luminosities than Seyfert galaxies. We
consider the quantity L[OIII]/sigma^4, which is an indicator of the black hole
accretion rate relative to the Eddington rate. Remarkably, we find that at
fixed L[OIII]/sigma^4, all differences between Seyfert and LINER host
properties disappear. LINERs and Seyferts form a continuous sequence, with
LINERs dominant at low L/L(EDD) and Seyferts dominant at high L/L(EDD). These
results suggest that the majority of LINERs are AGN and that the Seyfert/LINER
dichotomy is analogous to the high/low-state transition for X-ray binary
systems. We apply theoretical photoionization models and show that pure LINERs
require a harder ionizing radiation field with lower ionization parameter than
Seyfert galaxies, consistent with the low and high X-ray binary states.

emission would be a significant factor in the thermal energy budget, affecting
temperature and the rate of hydrogen escape from the exosphere. Hot Jupiters
are predicted to have up to 10$^5$ times Jupiter's H$_3^+$ emission because
they experience extreme stellar irradiation and enhanced interactions may occur
between the planetary magnetosphere and the stellar wind. Direct (but
unresolved) detection of an extrasolar planet, or the establishment of useful
upper limits, may be possible because a small but significant fraction of the
total energy received by the planet is re-radiated in a few narrow lines of
H$_3^+$ within which the flux from the star is limited.
  We present the observing strategy and results of our search for emission from
the Q(1,0) transition of H$_3^+$ (3.953~$\mu$m) from extrasolar planets
orbiting six late-type dwarfs using CSHELL, the high-resolution echelle
spectrograph on NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). We exploited the
time-dependent Doppler shift of the planet, which can be as large as 150 km
s$^{-1}$, by differencing spectra between nights, thereby removing the stellar
photospheric signal and telluric lines. We set limits on the H$_3^+$ emission
from each of these systems and compare them with models in the literature.
Ideal candidates for future searches are intrinsically faint stars, such as M
dwarfs, at very close distances.

magnetic flux density that depends on the GOES class. We also examine the
relationship between these parameters and find weak correlation between
temporal and spatial scales of flares. We estimate reconnection inflow
velocity, coronal Alfven velocity, and reconnection rate using above observed

km/s and the Alfven velocities in the corona are in the range from 10^3 to 10^4

reconnection rate in a flare tends to decrease as the GOES class of the flare
increases. This value is within one order of magnitude from the theoretical
maximum value predicted by the Petschek model, although the dependence of the
reconnection rate on the magnetic Reynolds number tends to be stronger than

target radial velocity, within a typical accuracy of ~+-20km/s. The observed
candidates have been robustly classified according to their radial velocity and
shape parameters that allowed us to confidently discriminate between point
sources and extended objects even from low-spatial-resolution imagery. Results
- In our set of 76 candidates clusters we found: 42 newly-confirmed bona-fide
M~31 clusters, 12 background galaxies, 17 foreground Galactic stars, 2 HII
regions belonging to M31 and 3 unclassified (possibly M31 clusters or
foreground stars) objects. The classification of a few other candidates not
included in our survey has been also reassessed on various observational bases.
All the sources of radial velocity estimates for M31 known globular clusters
available in the literature have been compared and checked, and a homogeneous
general list has been obtained for 349 confirmed clusters with radial velocity.
Conclusions - Our results suggest that a significant number of genuine clusters
(~> 100) is still hidden among the plethora of known candidates proposed by
various authors. Hence our knowledge of the globular cluster system of the M31
galaxy is still far from complete even in terms of simple membership.

galaxy clusters are **not** expected to be self-similar, even when the only
energy sources available are gravity and shock-wave heating. In particular, we
investigate the scaling relations between mass, luminosity and temperature of
galaxy groups and clusters in the absence of radiative processes. Theoretical
expectations are derived from a polytropic model of the intracluster medium and
compared with the results of high-resolution adiabatic gasdynamical
simulations. It is shown that, in addition to the well-known relation between
the mass and concentration of the dark matter halo, the effective polytropic
index of the gas also varies systematically with cluster mass, and therefore
neither the dark matter nor the gas profiles are exactly self-similar. It is
remarkable, though, that the effects of concentration and polytropic index tend
to cancel each other, leading to scaling relations whose logarithmic slopes
roughly match the predictions of the most basic self-similar models. We provide
a phenomenological fit to the relation between polytropic index and
concentration, as well as a self-consistent scheme to derive the non-linear
scaling relations expected for any cosmology and the best-fit normalizations of
the M-T, L-T and F-T relations appropriate for a Lambda-CDM universe. The
predicted scaling relations reproduce observational data reasonably well for
massive clusters, where the effects of cooling and star formation are expected
to play a minor role.

relativistic jets. It is more than probable, that also many of the FR I radio
galaxies, believed to be the parent population of BL Lacs, are TeV sources, for
which Doppler-hidden nuclear gamma-ray radiation may be only too weak to be
directly observed. Here we show, however, that about one percent of the total
time-averaged TeV radiation produced by the active nuclei of low-power FR I
radio sources is inevitably absorbed and re-processed by photon-photon
annihilation on the starlight photon field, and the following emission of the
created and quickly isotropized electron-positron pairs. In the case of the
radio galaxy Centaurus A, we found that the discussed mechanism can give a
distinctive observable feature in the form of an isotropic gamma-ray halo. It
results from the electron-positron pairs injected to the interstellar medium of
the inner parts of the elliptical host by the absorption process, and
upscattering starlight radiation via the inverse-Compton process mainly to the
GeV-TeV photon energy range. Such a galactic gamma-ray halo is expected to
possess a characteristic spectrum peaking at ~0.1 TeV photon energies, and the
photon flux strong enough to be detected by modern Cherenkov Telescopes and, in
the future, by GLAST. These findings should apply as well to the other nearby
FR I sources.

postulate that the He II 4686 line comes from the acceleration zone of the
secondary stellar wind. We attribute the large increase in the line intensity
to a slight increase in the density of the secondary stellar wind in its
acceleration zone. The increase in density could be due to the ionization and
subsequent deceleration of the wind by the enhanced X-ray emission arising from
the shocked secondary wind further downstream or to accretion of the primary
stellar wind. Accretion around the secondary equatorial plane gives rise to
collimation of the secondary wind, which increases its density, hence enhancing
the He II 4686 emission line. In contrast with previous explanations, the
presently proposed model does not require a prohibitively high X-ray flux to
directly photoionize the He.

this paper we show that any spatially-varying director pattern may be a source

tensor $\Sb=(\grad \nn)(\grad \nn)^T$ possesses two distinct nonzero
eigenvalues. The eigenvalue difference may be used as a measure of the expected
biaxiality. Furthermore, the corresponding eigenvectors indicate the directions
in which the order tensor \QQ is induced to break the uniaxial symmetry about

tool, such as for discovery of the network topology at the IP level. In prior
work, authors on this technical report have shown how to improve the efficiency
of route tracing from multiple cooperating monitors. However, it is not unusual
for a route tracing monitor to operate in isolation. Somewhat different
strategies are required for this case, and this report is the first systematic
study of those requirements. Standard traceroute is inefficient when used
repeatedly towards multiple destinations, as it repeatedly probes the same
interfaces close to the source. Others have recognized this inefficiency and
have proposed tracing backwards from the destinations and stopping probing upon
encounter with a previously-seen interface. One of this technical report's
contributions is to quantify for the first time the efficiency of this
approach. Another contribution is to describe the effect of non-responding
destinations on this efficiency. Since a large portion of destination machines
do not reply to probe packets, backwards probing from the destination is often
infeasible. We propose an algorithm to tackle non-responding destinations, and

  This paper presents a general method for constructing labeling schemes for
dynamic trees. Our method is based on extending an existing {\em static} tree
labeling scheme to the dynamic setting. This approach fits many natural
functions on trees, such as ancestry relation, routing (in both the adversary
and the designer port models), nearest common ancestor etc.. Our resulting
dynamic schemes incur overheads (over the static scheme) on the label size and
on the communication complexity. Informally, for any function $k(n)$ and any
static $F$-labeling scheme on trees, we present an $F$-labeling scheme on
dynamic trees incurring multiplicative overhead factors
  (over the static scheme) of $O(\log_{k(n)} n)$ on the label size and
$O(k(n)\log_{k(n)} n)$ on the amortized message complexity. In particular, by
setting $k(n)=n^{\epsilon}$ for any $0<\epsilon<1$, we obtain dynamic labeling

10^-4-10^-5. Various missions aimed at improving such limits by several orders
of magnitude have more or less recently been proposed like LATOR, ASTROD,
BepiColombo and GAIA. They involve the use of various spacecraft, to be
launched along interplanetary trajectories, for measuring the effects of the
solar gravity on the propagation of electromagnetic waves. In this paper we
investigate what is needed to measure the combination nu=(2+2gamma-beta)/3 of
the post-Newtonian gravitoelectric Einstein perigee precession of a test
particle to an accuracy of about 10^-5 with a pair of drag-free spacecraft in
the Earth's gravitational field. It turns out that the latest gravity models
from the dedicated CHAMP and GRACE missions would allow to reduce the
systematic error of gravitational origin just to this demanding level of
accuracy. In regard to the non-gravitational errors, the spectral noise density
of the drag-free sensors required to reach such level of accuracy would amounts
to 10^-8-10^-9 cm s^-2 Hz^-1/2 over very low frequencies. Although not yet
obtainable with the present technologies, such level of compensation is much
less demanding than those required for, e.g., LISA. As a by-product, an
independent measurement of the post-Newtonian gravitomagnetic Lense-Thirring
effect with a 0.9% accuracy would be possible as well. The forthcoming Earth
gravity models from CHAMP and GRACE will further reduce the systematic
gravitational errors in both of such tests.

the retardation effects cause a small deviation of the string from the straight
line. We first give general arguments constraining the string shape. Then, we
find analytical and numerical solutions for the string deformation induced by
retardation effects. We finally discuss the influence of the curved string on
the energy spectrum of the model.

hadron in heavy-ion collisions has attracted considerable interest. In
particular, unexpected large angle structures on the away side (opposite to the
trigger) have been found. Several explanations have been brought forward, among
them Mach shockwaves and Cherenkov radiation. Most of these scenarios are
characterized by radial symmetry around the parton axis, thus angular
correlations also determine the rapidity dependence of the correlation. If the
observed correlations are remnants of an away side parton after interaction
with the medium created in the collision, pQCD allows to calculate the
distribution $P(y)$ of the away side partons in rapidity.
  The measured correlation then arises as a folding of $P(y)$ and the rapidity
structure of the correlation taking into account the detector acceptance. This
places non-trivial and rather stringent constraints on the underlying scenario.
We investigate these dependences and demonstrate that Mach shockwaves survive
this folding procedure well whereas Cherenkov radiation scenarios face new
challenges.

uplifting, some of the vacua become dS, whereas some others remain AdS. The
near-BPS walls separating these vacua may be seen as bubble walls in the theory
of vacuum decay. As an outcome of our investigation of the BPS walls, we found
that the decay rate of dS vacua to a collapsing space with a negative vacuum
energy can be quite large. The parts of space that experience a decay to a
collapsing space, or to a Minkowski vacuum, never return back to dS space. The
channels of irreversible vacuum decay serve as sinks for the probability flow.
The existence of such sinks is a distinguishing feature of the landscape. We
show that it strongly affects the probability distributions in string
cosmology.

theory, space-time is described as a non-differentiable continuum, which
implies it is fractal, i.e., explicitly dependent on internal scale variables.
Owing to the principle of relativity that has been extended to scales, these
scale variables can themselves become functions of the space-time coordinates.
Therefore, a coupling is expected between displacements in the fractal
space-time and the transformations of these scale variables. In previous works,
an Abelian gauge theory (electromagnetism) has been derived as a consequence of
this coupling for global dilations and/or contractions. We consider here more
general transformations of the scale variables by taking into account separate
dilations for each of them, which yield non-Abelian gauge theories. We identify
these transformations with the usual gauge transformations. The gauge fields
naturally appear as a new geometric contribution to the total variation of the
action involving these scale variables, while the gauge charges emerge as the
generators of the scale transformation group. A generalized action is
identified with the scale-relativistic invariant. The gauge charges are the
conservative quantities, conjugates of the scale variables through the action,
which find their origin in the symmetries of the ``scale-space''. We thus found
in a geometric way and recover the expression for the covariant derivative of
gauge theory. Adding the requirement that under the scale transformations the
fermion multiplets and the boson fields transform such that the derived
Lagrangian remains invariant, we obtain gauge theories as a consequence of
scale symmetries issued from a geometric space-time description.

orientifold setup as suggested in arXiv:hep-th/0511099. The non-Kaehler
backgrounds we obtain in type IIA are non-trivially fibered due to their
construction from IIB via T-duality with Neveu-Schwarz flux. We demonstrate
that these non-Kaehler manifolds are not half-flat and show that a symplectic

  We also review the construction of new non-Kaehler backgrounds in type I and
heterotic theory as proposed in arXiv:hep-th/0408192. They are found by a
series of T- and S-duality and can be argued to be related by geometric
transitions as well. A local toy model is provided that fulfills the flux
equations of motion in IIB and the torsional relation in heterotic theory, and
that is consistent with the U-duality relating both theories. For the heterotic
theory we also propose a global solution that fulfills the torsional relation
because it is similar to the Maldacena-Nunez background.

  Berkeley",,,,"math.ST cs.IT math.IT stat.TH",,"  The problem of consistently estimating the sparsity pattern of a vector
$\betastar \in \real^\mdim$ based on observations contaminated by noise arises
in various contexts, including subset selection in regression, structure
estimation in graphical models, sparse approximation, and signal denoising. We
analyze the behavior of $\ell_1$-constrained quadratic programming (QP), also
referred to as the Lasso, for recovering the sparsity pattern. Our main result
is to establish a sharp relation between the problem dimension $\mdim$, the
number $\spindex$ of non-zero elements in $\betastar$, and the number of
observations $\numobs$ that are required for reliable recovery. For a broad
class of Gaussian ensembles satisfying mutual incoherence conditions, we
establish existence and compute explicit values of thresholds $\ThreshLow$ and
$\ThreshUp$ with the following properties: for any $\epsilon > 0$, if $\numobs
> 2 (\ThreshUp + \epsilon) \log (\mdim - \spindex) + \spindex + 1$, then the
Lasso succeeds in recovering the sparsity pattern with probability converging
to one for large problems, whereas for $\numobs < 2 (\ThreshLow - \epsilon)
\log (\mdim - \spindex) + \spindex + 1$, then the probability of successful
recovery converges to zero. For the special case of the uniform Gaussian
ensemble, we show that $\ThreshLow = \ThreshUp = 1$, so that the threshold is
sharp and exactly determined.

Euler-Lagrange equation. We prove, developing the corresponding fractional

these constructions are coherents, i.e. that the embedding procedure is
compatible with the fractional calculus of variations. We then extend our

following a previous work of F. Riewe, we obtain a fractional Ostrogradski
formalism which allows us to derive non-conservative dynamical systems via a
fractional generalized least-action principle. We also discuss the Whittaker

range- including that for outdoor applications. The shape of the light pulse
shows in general two decay processes: a single dominant process above room

the intensities is temperature-dependent; the second (slow) decay component is
negligible at room temperatures, but, by -20C, it contributes up to 40 percents
of the total light and has a duration of several microseconds. We discuss the
profound effect this new understanding of the light output has on the pulse
height analysis instrumentation. We introduce a theoretical model to explain
the experimental results. In addition, we describe a unique technique for
correcting both amplitude and shape temperature changes inside the NaI(Tl)

obtained by our model, which is consistent with the Pareto law in the real
observation. In addition, the analysis of the generated scale-free network

explore the conditions under which division of labor leads to optimized system
output, as measured by the rate of production of a given product. We consider
two models: In the first model, we consider the flow of some resource into a
compartment, and the conversion of this resource into some product. In the
second model, we consider the resource-limited growth of autoreplicating
systems. In this case, we divide the replication and metabolic tasks among
different agents. The general features that emerge from our models is that
division of labor is favored when the resource to agent ratio is at
intermediate values, and when the time cost associated with transporting
intermediate products is small compared to characteristic process times. We
discuss the results of this paper in the context of simulations with digital
life. We also argue that division of labor in the context of our replication
model suggests an evolutionary basis for the emergence of the stem-cell-based
tissue architecture in complex organisms.

  Interpretation of Phi-values","26 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables",,,,"q-bio.BM",,"  Phi-values are experimental measures of the effects of mutations on the
folding kinetics of a protein. A central question is which structural
information Phi-values contain about the transition state of folding.
Traditionally, a Phi-value is interpreted as the 'nativeness' of a mutated
residue in the transition state. However, this interpretation is often
problematic because it assumes a linear relation between the nativeness of the
residue and its free-energy contribution. We present here a better structural
interpretation of Phi-values for mutations within a given helix. Our
interpretation is based on a simple physical model that distinguishes between
secondary and tertiary free-energy contributions of helical residues. From a
linear fit of our model to the experimental data, we obtain two structural
parameters: the extent of helix formation in the transition state, and the
nativeness of tertiary interactions in the transition state. We apply our model
to all proteins with well-characterized helices for which more than 10
Phi-values are available: protein A, CI2, and protein L. The model captures
nonclassical Phi-values <0 or >1 in these helices, and explains how different
mutations at a given site can lead to different Phi-values.

way that after some decoherence occurs, most of the information can be restored
by a suitable decoding operation. For this purpose, we incorporate redundancy
by mapping a given initial quantum state to a messenger state on a
larger-dimensional Hilbert space via a $C^*$-algebra embedding. Our noise model
for the transmission is a phase damping channel which admits a noiseless or
decoherence-free subspace or subsystem. More precisely, the transmission
channel is obtained from convex combinations of a set of lowest rank yes/no
measurements that leave a component of the messenger state unchanged. The
objective of our encoding is to distribute quantum information optimally across
the noise-susceptible component of the transmission when the noiseless
component is not large enough to contain all the quantum information to be
transmitted. We derive simple geometric conditions for optimal encoding and
construct examples.

Interestingly, the best protocols involve large number of measurements. We show
that in the absence of noise, these protocols can yield one secret bit per
