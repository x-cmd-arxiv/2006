variability at optical and near-infrared wavelengths using the VLT/UVES and the
Keck/NIRSPEC spectrographs, respectively. The UVES radial velocity data
obtained over 14 nights spanning a baseline of 841 days shows significant
variability with an amplitude of 3.5 km s$^{-1}$. The periodogram analysis of
the UVES data indicates a possible period between 2.5 hours and 3.7 hours,
which is likely due to the rotation of the brown dwarf. However, the NIRSPEC
data obtained over 6 nights shows an rms dispersion of only 0.36 km s$^{-1}$
and do not follow the periodic trend. These results indicate that the
variability seen with UVES is likely to be due to rotationally modulated
inhomogeneous surface features. We suggest that future planet searches around
very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs using radial velocities will be better
conducted in the near-infrared than in the optical.

galaxy age, and outflow rate are chosen randomly from ranges predetermined to
be relevant. Predicted abundance ratios from each simulation are collectively
overplotted onto the data to test its viability. We present our results both
with and without observational scatter applied to the model points. Our study
shows that most trial combinations of input parameters, including a simulation
comprising only simple models with instantaneous recycling, are successful in
reproducing the observed morphology of the N/O plateau once observational
scatter is added. Therefore simulations which include delay of nitrogen
injection are no longer favored over those which propose that most nitrogen is
produced by massive stars, if only the plateau morphology is used as the
principal constraint. The one scenario which clearly cannot explain plateau
morphology is one in which galaxy ages are allowed to range below 250 Myr. We
conclude that the present data for the N/O plateau are insufficient by
themselves for identifying the portion of the stellar mass spectrum most

consistent with the GRB data at the level of several tests. If we assume the

Om_Lambda=0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.30}$ (1sigma); the flat-geometry case is within

the low number of usable GRBs we cannot yet constrain well the possible

D74 (2006) 083515","10.1103/PhysRevD.74.083515",,"astro-ph",,"  We discuss how an extended foreground of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) can account for the anomalies in the low multipoles of the CMB
anisotropies. The distortion needed to account for the anomalies is consistent
with a cold spot with the spatial geometry of the Local Supercluster (LSC) and
a temperature quadrupole of order DeltaT_2^2 ~ 50 microK^2. If this hypothetic
foreground is subtracted from the CMB data, the amplitude of the quadrupole
(l=2) is substantially increased, and the statistically improbable alignment of
the quadrupole with the octopole (l=3) is substantially weakened, increasing
dramatically the likelihood of the ""cleaned"" maps. By placing the foreground on
random locations and then computing the likelihood of the cleaned maps we can
estimate the most likely place for this foreground. Although the 1-year WMAP
data clearly points the location of this hypothetical foreground to the LSC or
its specular image (i.e., the vicinity of the poles of the cosmic dipole axis),
the three-year data seems to point to these locations as well as the north
ecliptic pole. We show that this is consistent with the symmetries of the
cosmic quadrupole. We also discuss a possible mechanism that could have
generated this foreground: the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect caused by hot
electrons in the LSC. We argue that the temperature and density of the hot gas
which are necessary to generate such an effect, though in the upper end of the
expected range of values, are marginally consistent with present observations
of the X-ray background of spectral distortions of the CMB.

uniform surface density distribution, expected if Poynting-Robertson and
stellar wind drag are the dominant grain removal processes, and using a single
temperature black body, expected if the dust is located in a narrow ring around
the star. The IRS spectra of many objects are better modeled with a single

distribution of grain temperatures, based on our black body fits, peaks at Tgr

explained if the grains are icy. If planets dynamically clear the central

dispersions. We examine the brightest group galaxies (BGGs), finding that,
while the luminosity of the BGG correlates with its total group luminosity, the
fraction of group luminosity contained in the BGG decreases with increasing

can be in the thousands for Super-Kamiokande. The rate of occurrence of these
accreting disks in the Galaxy is predicted to be on the order of 10^-5 yr^-1,
yet there is little observational evidence to provide an upper limit on their
formation rate. It would therefore be useful to discriminate between neutrinos
which have been produced in a proto-neutron star and those which have been
produced accretion disks. In order to distinguish between the two scenarios,
either the time profile of the neutrino luminosity or the relative fluxes of
different neutrino flavors may be considered. There are some signals that would
clearly point to one scenario or the other.

improved morphological, temporal, and spectral characteristics of X-rays from
these planets. Both auroral and non-auroral (low-latitude) 'disk' X-ray
emissions have been observed on Earth and Jupiter. X-rays have been detected
from Saturn's disk, but no convincing evidence for X-ray aurora on Saturn has
been observed. The non-auroral disk X-ray emissions from Jupiter, Saturn, and
Earth, are mostly produced due to scattering of solar X-rays. X-ray aurora on
Earth is mainly generated via bremsstrahlung from precipitating electrons and
on Jupiter via charge exchange of highlyionized energetic heavy ions
precipitating into the polar atmosphere. Recent unpublished work suggests that
at higher (>2 keV) energies electron bremsstrahlung also plays a role in
Jupiter's X-ray aurora. This paper summarizes the recent results of X-ray
observations on Jupiter, Saturn, and Earth mainly in the soft energy (~0.1-2.0

flows away to large distances in a comet-shape tail, reproducing on a smaller

the observations from radio to TeV energies. Acceleration at the shock provides
high energy electrons that steadily emit synchrotron in X-rays and inverse
Compton scatter stellar light to gamma-rays. Electrons streaming out of the

adequately reproduced for standard values of the parameters. The morphology of

simultaneously the quasars and several reference stars used to spatially
deconvolve the data. Applying the MCS deconvolution method, we are able to
separate the individual spectra of the quasar and of the underlying host
galaxy. Contrary to some previous claims, we find that luminous quasars are not
exclusively hosted by massive ellipticals. Most quasar host galaxies harbour
large amounts of gas, irrespective of their morphological type. Moreover, the
stellar content of half of the hosts is a young Sc-like population, associated
with a rather low metallicity interstellar medium. A significant fraction of
the galaxies contain gas ionized at large distances by the quasar radiation.
This large distance ionization is always associated with signs of gravitational
interactions (as detected from images or disturbed rotation curves). The
spectra of the quasars themselves provide evidence that gravitational
interactions bring dust and gas in the immediate surrounding of the super
massive black hole, allowing to feed it. The quasar activity might thus be
triggered (1) in young gas-rich spiral galaxies by local events and (2) in more
evolved galaxies by gravitational interactions or collisions. The latter
mechanism gives rises to the most powerful quasars. Finally, we derive mass
models for the isolated spiral host galaxies and we show that the most reliable
estimators of the systemic redshift in the quasar spectrum are the tips of the
Ha and Hb lines.

EW_rest and tend to have strong (EW_rest >20A) Lyman-alpha emissions; i.e.,
there is a deficiency of strong Lyman-alpha emission in luminous LBGs. There
seems to be a threshold UV luminosity for the deficiency; it is M_1400 = -21.5
\~ -21.0 mag, which is close to or somewhat brighter than the M* of the UV
luminosity function at z~5 and 6. Since the large EW_rest of Lyman-alpha
emission can be seen among the faint LBGs, the fraction of Lyman-alpha emitters
in LBGs may change rather abruptly with the UV luminosity. If the weakness of
Lyman-alpha emission is due to dust absorption, the deficiency suggests that
luminous LBGs at z=5-6 tend to be in dusty and more chemically evolved
environments and started star formation earlier than faint ones, though other
causes cannot be ruled out.

  X-ray flares on gas-phase chemistry","12 pages, 8 figures, accepted by A & A",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20065308",,"astro-ph",,"  Context. Recent observations of the X-ray emission from T Tauri stars in the
Orion nebula have shown that they undergo frequent outbursts in their X-ray
luminosity. These X-ray flares are characterised by increases in luminosity by
two orders of magnitude, a typical duration of less than one day, and a
significant hardening of the X-ray spectrum.
  Aims. It is unknown what effect these X-ray flares will have on the
ionisation fraction and dead-zone structure in protoplanetary disks. We present
the results of calculations designed to address this question.
  Methods. We have performed calculations of the ionisation fraction in a
standard $\alpha$-disk model using two different chemical reaction networks. We
include in our models ionisation due to X-rays from the central star, and
calculate the time-dependent ionisation fraction and dead--zone structure for
the inner 10 AU of a protoplanetary disk model.
  Results. We find that the disk response to X-ray flares depends on whether
the plasma temperature increases during flares and/or whether heavy metals
(such as magnesium) are present in the gas phase. Under favourable conditions
the outer disk dead--zone can disappear altogether,and the dead-zone located
between 0.5 < R < 2 AU can disappear and reappear in phase with the X-ray
luminosity.
  Conclusions. X-ray flares can have a significant effect on the dead-zone
structure in protoplanetary disks. Caution is required in interpreting this
result as the duration of X-ray bursts is considerably shorter than the growth
time of MHD turbulence due to the magnetorotational instability.

measurements down to r' \simeq 20 for all northern objects between -5 degrees <
b < +5 degrees. IPHAS thus provides a unique resource, both for studying the
emission line properties of known CVs and for constructing a new CV sample
selected solely on the basis of Halpha excess. Our goal here is to carry out
the first task and prepare the way for the second. In order to achieve this, we
analyze data on 19 CVs already contained in the IPHAS data base and supplement
this with identical observations of 52 CVs outside the galactic plane.
  Our key results are as follows: (i) the recovery rate of known CVs as Halpha
emitters in a survey like IPHAS is \simeq 70 per cent; (ii) of the \simeq 30
per cent of CVs which were not recovered \simeq 75 per cent were clearly
detected but did not exhibit a significant Halpha excess at the time of our
observations; (iii) the recovery rate depends only weakly on CV type; (iv) the
recovery rate depends only weakly on orbital period; (v) short-period dwarf
novae tend to have the strongest Halpha lines. These results imply that
photometric emission line searches provide an efficient way of constructing CV
samples that are not biased against detection of intrinsically faint,
short-period systems.

that the missed clusters are typically low contrast systems when observed
optically. We employ four different statistical tests to test for the presence
of substructure using optical two-dimensional data, finding that approximately
35% of the clusters show strong signs of substructure. However, the results are
test-dependent, with variations also due to the magnitude range and radius
utilized.We have also performed a comparison of X-ray luminosity and
temperature with optical galaxy counts (richness). We find that the slope and
scatter of the relations between richness and the X-ray properties are heavily
dependent on the density contrast of the clusters. The selection of
substructure-free systems does not improve the correlation between X-ray
luminosity and richness, but this comparison also shows much larger scatter
than one obtained using the X-ray temperature. In the latter case, the sample
is significantly reduced because temperature measurements are available only
for the most massive (and thus high contrast) systems. However, the comparison
between temperature and richness is very sensitive to the exclusion of clusters
showing signs of substructure. The correlation of X-ray luminosity and richness
is based on the largest sample to date ($\sim$ 750 clusters), while tests
involving temperature use a similar number of objects as previous works
($\lsim$100). The results presented here are in good agreement with existing
literature.

accretion rates of their disks scale strongly with the central stellar mass,
approximately $\mdot \propto M_*^2$. No dependence of accretion rate on stellar
mass is predicted by the simplest version of the layered disk model of Gammie
(1996), in which non-thermal ionization of upper disk layers allows accretion
to occur via the magnetorotational instability. We show that a minor
modification of Gammie's model to include heating by irradiation from the
central star yields a modest dependence of $\mdot$ upon the mass of the central
star. A purely viscous disk model could provide a strong dependence of
accretion rate on stellar mass if the initial disk radius (before much viscous
evolution has occurred) has a strong dependence on stellar mass. However, it is
far from clear that at least the most massive pre-main sequence disks can be
totally magnetically activated by X-rays or cosmic rays. We suggest that a
combination of effects are responsible for the observed dependence, with the
lowest-mass stars having the lowest mass disks, which can be thoroughly
magnetically active, while the higher-mass stars have higher mass disks which
have layered accretion and relatively inactive or ``dead'' central zones at
some radii. In such dead zones, we suggest that gravitational instabilities may
play a role in allowing accretion to proceed. In this connection, we emphasize
the uncertainty in disk masses derived from dust emission, and argue that T
Tauri disk masses have been systematically underestimated by conventional
analyses. Further study of accretion rates, especially in the lowest-mass
stars, would help to clarify the mechanisms of accretion in T Tauri stars.

present near and inside the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). This
finding suggests that such flows may be more luminous than predicted by the
standard accretion disk model. Here we apply a prescription for heat
dissipation within the simulated accretion flows to estimate their implied
radiative efficiency. We assume that dissipation is proportional to the current
density squared, and find that the resulting azimuthally-averaged and
shell-integrated radial profile is well-matched to the radial heat dissipation
profile of the standard disk model for the region outside the ISCO,
particularly when it is adjusted to account for additional stress at the ISCO.
In contrast to the standard model, however, the dissipation profile derived
from the current density continues past the ISCO and through the plunging
region. The total predicted dissipation rate is between $\simeq 30%$ and
$\simeq 100%$ greater than that predicted by the standard model, depending on
the black hole spin. Most of the additional dissipation takes place just
outside the ISCO. To predict luminosities, we assume instantaneous radiation
and zero optical depth, but allow for photon capture. The net radiative
efficiency seen by a distant observer is increased relative to the standard
model by $\simeq 25%$--80%, with the largest fractional increase for
intermediate black hole spins because the increase in dissipation from enhanced
stress that occurs for rapid spin is partially offset by the increased
likelihood that the additional photons will be captured by the hole.

order a physical system can posses is profoundly affected by its
dimensionality. Conventional long-range order, like in a ferromagnet or a
crystal, is common in three-dimensional (3D) systems at low temperature.
However, in two-dimensional (2D) systems with a continuous symmetry, true
long-range order is destroyed by thermal fluctuations at any finite
temperature. Consequently, in contrast to the 3D case, a uniform 2D fluid of
identical bosons cannot undergo Bose-Einstein condensation. Nevertheless, it
can form a ""quasi-condensate"" and become superfluid below a finite critical
temperature. The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) theory associates this
phase transition with the emergence of a topological order, resulting from the
pairing of vortices with opposite circulations. Above the critical temperature,
proliferation of unbound vortices is expected. Here we report the observation
of a BKT-type crossover in a trapped quantum degenerate gas of rubidium atoms.
Using a matter wave heterodyning technique, we observe both the long-wavelength
fluctuations of the quasi-condensate phase and the free vortices. At low
temperatures, the gas is quasi-coherent on the length scale set by the system
size. As the temperature is increased, the loss of long-range coherence
coincides with the onset of proliferation of free vortices. Our results provide
direct experimental evidence for the microscopic mechanism underlying the BKT
theory, and raise new questions regarding coherence and superfluidity in
mesoscopic systems.

We construct a controllable expansion at the QCP in two steps: we first create
a new, non Fermi-liquid ``zero-order'' Eliashberg-type theory, and then
demonstrate that the residual interaction effects are small. We prove that this
approach is justified under two conditions: the interaction should be smaller
than the fermionic bandwidth, and either the band mass $m_B$ should be much
smaller than $m = p_F/v_F$, or the number of fermionic flavors $N$ should be
large. For an SU(2) symmetric ferromagnetic QCP, we find that the Eliashberg
theory itself includes a set of singular renormalizations which can be
understood as a consequence of an effective long-range dynamic interaction
between quasi-particles, generated by the Landau damping term. These singular
renormalizations give rise to a negative non-analytic $q^{3/2}$ correction to
the static spin susceptibility, and destroy a ferromagnetic QCP. We demonstrate
that this effect can be understood in the framework of the $\phi^4$ theory of
quantum criticality. We also show that the non-analytic $q^{3/2}$ correction to
the bosonic propagator is specific to the SU(2) symmetric case. For systems
with a scalar order parameter, the $q^{3/2}$ contributions from individual
diagrams cancel out in the full expression of the susceptibility, and the QCP
remains stable.

rate performance curve of a wide class of LDPC codes of moderate length. The
traditional method to estimate code performance in the higher SNR region is to
use a sum of the contributions of the most dominant error events to the
probability of error. These dominant error events will be both code and decoder
dependent, consisting of low-weight codewords as well as non-codeword events if
ML decoding is not used. For even moderate length codes, it is not feasible to
find all of these dominant error events with a brute force search. The proposed
method provides a convenient way to evaluate very low bit error rate
performance of an LDPC code without requiring knowledge of the complete error
event weight spectrum or resorting to a Monte Carlo simulation. This new method
can be applied to various types of decoding such as the full belief propagation
version of the message passing algorithm or the commonly used min-sum
approximation to belief propagation. The proposed method allows one to
efficiently see error performance at bit error rates that were previously out
of reach of Monte Carlo methods. This result will provide a solid foundation
for the analysis and design of LDPC codes and decoders that are required to
provide a guaranteed very low bit error rate performance at certain SNRs.

be defined {\em unitarily} within the standard Fock space quantization of the
scalar field.
  Evolution between two arbitrary slices of an arbitrary foliation of the flat
spacetime can be built out of a restricted class of evolutions (and their
inverses). The restricted evolution is from an initial flat slice to an
arbitrary (in general, curved) slice of the flat spacetime and can be
decomposed into (i) `time' evolution in which the spatial Minkowskian
coordinates serve as spatial coordinates on the initial and the final slice,
followed by (ii) the action of a spatial diffeomorphism of the final slice on
the data obtained from (i). We show that although the functional evolution of
(i) is unitarily implemented in the quantum theory, generic spatial
diffeomorphisms of (ii) are not. Our results imply that a Tomanaga-Schwinger

because the total Newtonian energy of the system E_N (and not just the
Newtonian gravitational potential energy E_g^N) decreases for such contraction.
In the era of General Relativity (GR) too, it is justifiably believed that
gravitational contraction must release radiation energy. However no GR version
of (Newtonian) Helmholtz- Kelvin (HK) process has ever been derived. Here, for
the first time, we derive the GR version of the appropriate virial theorem and
Helmholtz Kelvin mechanism by simply equating the well known expressions for
the gravitational mass and the Inertial Mass of a spherically symmetric static
fluid. Simultaneously, we show that the GR counterparts of global ``internal

actually different from what have been used so far. Existence of this GR HK
process asserts that, in Einstein gravity too, gravitational collapse must be
accompanied by emission of radiation irrespective of the details of the

maximal twist large cutoff effects are generated when the quark mass becomes of
O(a Lambda_QCD^2). In general, these effects can be suppressed in two ways:
either by choosing the critical quark mass in an ""optimal way"", or by adding
the Clover term to the twisted action. We investigate the second option by
performing a quenched lattice QCD simulation with twisted Clover fermions and
pion masses as low as 280 MeV. We show that the Clover term is indeed efficient
in reducing the large cutoff effects. In particular, the so-called bending
phenomenon observed in the determination of the pion decay constant is cured in
this way. In addition, by using maximally twisted Clover fermions, we provide a
non-perturbative determination of the vector current renormalization constant
Z_V as well as of the non-perturbatively renormalized light quark masses.
Finally, we calculate the connected contribution to the charged-neutral
pseudoscalar meson mass splitting, finding that the introduction of the Clover
term in the twisted action is also beneficial, in the quenched approximation,
in reducing cutoff effects related to the isospin symmetry breaking at finite
lattice spacing.

The lattice vector current for QQbar annihilation is expressed as a linear
combination of lattice operators with quantum numbers L=0, J^P=1^-, and the
coefficients are determined by matching this lattice current to the
corresponding continuum current in QCD to O(v^2) to one-loop. The annihilation
channel gives a complex amplitude and a proper choice for the contours of

with a careful choice of subtraction functions in the numerical integration,
the Coulomb-exchange and infrared singularities appearing in the amplitudes are
successfully treated. The matching coefficients are given as a function of the
heavy quark mass Ma in lattice units. An automated vertex generation program
written in Python is employed, allowing us to use a realistic NRQCD action and
an improved gluon lattice action. A change in the definition of either action
is easily accommodated in this procedure. The final result is applicable to the
electromagnetic decays of heavy quarkonia, notably the Upsilon meson.

seem to predict an inverted mass hierarchy and a mixing matrix with a texture
based on a very close approximation to the bi-maximal mixing. The resulting
formulas for the mass squared differences can naturally accomodate the
available data if the unique free parameter ($a$) gets very small values

(according to our method) a large breaking scale $<\phi>\sim10^{6}-10^{7}$ TeV

formulated to accommodate such a principle, and that in such a theory the
observed cosmological constant is a fluctuation about a zero value. This
fluctuation arises from an uncertainty relation involving the cosmological
constant and the effective volume of spacetime. The measured, small vacuum
energy is dynamically tied to the large size of the universe, thus violating
naive decoupling between small and large scales. The numerical value is related
to the scale of cosmological supersymmetry breaking, supersymmetry being needed

potentials for the complex structure moduli. We choose the compact dimensions
to be described locally by a deformed conifold, creating a large hierarchy. We
demonstrate that the presence of a black hole typically will not change the
minimum of the moduli potential in a substantial way. However, we also point
out a couple of possible loop-holes, which in some cases could lead to
interesting physical consequences such as changes in the hierarchy.

algebras, such as their classification in terms of matrix algebras, the
connection to orthogonal and Spin groups, and their representation theory. A
number of lower-dimensional examples are worked out in a systematic way using
so called norm functions, while general applications of representation theory
include normed division algebras and vector fields on spheres.

telephone systems. The paper studies multiserver retrial queueing systems with
$n$ servers. Arrival process is a quite general point process. An arriving
customer occupies one of free servers. If upon arrival all servers are busy,
then the customer waits for his service in orbit, and after random time retries
more and more to occupy a server. The orbit has one waiting space only, and
arriving customer, who finds all servers busy and the waiting space occupied,
losses from the system. Time intervals between possible retrials are assumed to
have arbitrary distribution (the retrial scheme is exactly explained in the
paper). The paper provides analysis of this system. Specifically the paper
studies optimal number of servers to decrease the loss proportion to a given
value. The representation obtained for loss proportion enables us to solve the
problem numerically. The algorithm for numerical solution includes effective
simulation, which meets the challenge of rare events problem in simulation.

studying two-dimensional flows via the braiding of a large number of particle
trajectories. Our approach is a generalization of Moussafir's technique for
braids on the sphere. Previous methods for computing topological entropies
include the Bestvina--Handel train-track algorithm and matrix representations
of the braid group. However, the Bestvina--Handel algorithm quickly becomes
computationally intractable for large braid words, and matrix methods give only
lower bounds, which are often poor for large braids. Our method is
computationally fast and appears to give exponential convergence towards the
exact entropy. As an illustration we apply our approach to the braiding of both
periodic and aperiodic trajectories in the sine flow. The efficiency of the
method allows us to explore how much extra information about flow entropy is
encoded in the braid as the number of trajectories becomes large.

connection between the telescope and PC computer was also created and programed
by students involved in the Project. This has allowed students to use their
equipment to perform serious scientific measurements concerning the single
cosmic ray muon flux at ground level and below. These measurements were then
analyzed with the programs based on the 'nowadays' knowledge on statistics. An
overview of the apparatus, methods and results were presented at several
students conferences and recently won the first prize in a national competition
of high school students scientific work. The telescope itself, in spite of its
'scientific' purposes, is built in such a way that it is hung on a wall in a
school physics lab and counts muons continuously. This can help to raise the
interest for studying physics among others. At present a few (3) groups of
young participants of the Roland Maze Project have already built their own
telescopes for their schools and some others are working on it. This work is a
perfect example of what can be done by young people when respective
opportunities are created by more experienced researchers and a little help and

written in terms of the eigenspectrum of a matrix we call the modularity
matrix, which plays a role in community detection similar to that played by the
graph Laplacian in graph partitioning calculations. This result leads us to a
number of possible algorithms for detecting community structure, as well as
several other results, including a spectral measure of bipartite structure in
networks and a new centrality measure that identifies those vertices that
occupy central positions within the communities to which they belong. The
algorithms and measures proposed are illustrated with applications to a variety
of real-world complex networks.

annotation of gene function based on several characteristics of protein
sequences including phylogenic descriptors, sequence based attributes, and
predicted secondary structure. We discuss three Bayesian models and compare
their performance in terms of predictive accuracy. These models are the
ordinary multinomial logit (MNL) model, a hierarchical model based on a set of
nested MNL models, and a MNL model with a prior that introduces correlations
between the parameters for classes that are nearby in the hierarchy. We also
provide a new scheme for combining different sources of information. We use
these models to predict the functional class of Open Reading Frames (ORFs) from
the E. coli genome. The results from all three models show substantial
improvement over previous methods, which were based on the C5 algorithm. The
MNL model using a prior based on the hierarchy outperforms both the
non-hierarchical MNL model and the nested MNL model. In contrast to previous
attempts at combining these sources of information, our approach results in a
higher accuracy rate when compared to models that use each data source alone.
Together, these results show that gene function can be predicted with higher
accuracy than previously achieved, using Bayesian models that incorporate
suitable prior information.

$D>2$, while for orientable surfaces with boundaries it is possible to
construct them for arbitrary dimension $D$. We give a method to obtain planar
homological codes based on the construction of quantum codes on compact
surfaces without boundaries. We show how the original Shor's 9-qubit code can
be visualized as a homological quantum code. We study the problem of
constructing quantum codes with optimal encoding rate. In the particular case
of toric codes we construct an optimal family and give an explicit proof of its
optimality. For homological quantum codes on surfaces of arbitrary genus we
also construct a family of codes asymptotically attaining the maximum possible

operation is found to be possible, significantly reducing the gate operation
