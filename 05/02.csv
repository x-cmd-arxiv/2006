pulsar in the Large Magellanic Cloud, using data acquired with the RXTE. During
this campaign the pulsar experienced 23 sudden increases in frequency
(``glitches'') amounting to a total gain of over six ppm of rotation frequency
superposed on its gradual spindown of d(nu)/d(t) = -2e-10 Hz/s. The time
interval from one glitch to the next obeys a strong linear correlation to the
amplitude of the first glitch, with a mean slope of about 400 days ppm (6.5
days per uHz), such that these intervals can be predicted to within a few days,
an accuracy which has never before been seen in any other pulsar. There appears
to be an upper limit of ~40 uHz for the size of glitches in_all_ pulsars, with
the 1999 April glitch of J0537 as the largest so far. The change in the
spindown of J0537 across the glitches, Delta(d(nu)/d(t)), appears to have the
same hard lower limit of -1.5e-13 Hz/s, as, again, that observed in all other
pulsars. The spindown continues to increase in the long term,
d(d(nu)/d(t))/d(t) = -1e-21 Hz/s/s, and thus the timing age of J0537 (-0.5 nu
d(nu)/d(t)) continues to decrease at a rate of nearly one year every year,
consistent with movement of its magnetic moment away from its rotational axis
by one radian every 10,000 years, or about one meter per year. J0537 was likely
to have been born as a nearly-aligned rotator spinning at 75-80 Hz, with a
|d(nu)/d(t)| considerably smaller than its current value of 2e-10 Hz/s. The
pulse profile of J0537 consists of a single pulse which is found to be flat at
its peak for at least 0.02 cycles.

Furenlid, Brault, and Testerman (1984) have been re-reduced. An approximate
telluric atmospheric model was determined for each FTS scan. Large-scale
features produced by O3 and O2 dimer were computed and divided out. The solar
continuum level was found by fitting a smooth curve to high points in each
scan. The scans were normalized to the fitted continuum to produce a residual
flux spectrum for each FTS scan. The telluric line spectrum was computed using
HITRAN and other line data for H2O, O2, and CO2. The line parameters were
adjusted for an approximate match to the observed spectra. The scans were
divided by the computed telluric spectra to produce residual irradiance
spectra. Artifacts from wavelength mismatches, deep lines, etc, were removed by
hand and replaced by linear interpolation. Overlapping scans were fitted
together to make a continuous spectrum from 300 to 1000 nm. All the above steps
were iterative. The monochromatic error varies from 0.1 to 1.0 percent. The
residual spectrum was calibrated two different ways: First by normalizing it to
the continuum of theoretical solar model ASUN (Kurucz 1992), and second, by
degrading the spectrum to the resolution of the observed irradiance (Thuillier
et al. 2004) to determine a normalization function that was then applied to the
high resolution spectrum.

highest redshift object, NDWFS J142516.3+325409, z=5.85, is the
lowest-luminosity z>5.8 quasar currently known. We compare mid-infrared
techniques for identifying z>5 quasars to more traditional optical techniques
and show that mid-infrared colors allow for selection of high-redshift quasars
even at redshifts where quasars lie near the optical stellar locus and at z>7
where optical selection is impossible. Using the superb multi-wavelength
coverage available in the NDWFS Bootes field, we construct the spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of high-redshift quasars from observed Bw-band to 24
microns (rest-frame 600 Angstroms - 3.7 microns). We show that the three
high-redshift quasars have quite similar SEDs, and the rest-frame composite SED
of low-redshift quasars from the literature shows little evolution compared to
our high-redshift objects. We compare the number of z>5 quasars we have
discovered to the expected number from published quasar luminosity functions.
While analyses of the quasar luminosity function are tenuous based on only
three objects, we find that a relatively steep luminosity function with Psi
L^(-3.2) provides the best agreement with the number of high-redshift quasars
discovered in our survey.

40 GC molecular clouds. Using the LTE approximation, we derived the physical
properties of GC molecular clouds and the abundances of the complex

magnitude from 2.4x10^{-8} to 1.1x10^{-6}. The abundance of the other complex
organic molecules relative to that of CH3OH is basically independent of the
CH3OH abundance, with variations of only a factor 4-8. The abundances of
complex organic molecules in the GC are compared with those measured in hot
cores and hot corinos, in which these complex molecules are also abundant. We
find that both the abundance and the abundance ratios of the complex molecules
relative to CH3OH in hot cores are similar to those found in the GC clouds.
However, hot corinos show different abundance ratios than observed in hot cores
and in GC clouds. The rather constant abundance of all the complex molecules
relative to CH3OH suggests that all complex molecules are ejected from grain
mantles by shocks. Frequent (similar 10^{5}years) shocks with velocities >6km/s
are required to explain the high abundances in gas phase of complex organic
molecules in the GC molecular clouds. The rather uniform abundance ratios in
the GC clouds and in Galactic hot cores indicate a similar average composition
of grain mantles in both kinds of regions. The Sickle and the Thermal Radio
Arches, affected by UV radiation, show different relative abundances in the
complex organic molecules due to the differentially photodissociation of these

parameters of low-mass compact binaries, comprising white dwarfs (WDs), neutron
stars (NSs) or black holes (BHs), while battling the amplitude, frequency, and
phase modulations of their signals. We show that Doppler-phase modulation aids
sky-position resolution in every direction, improving it especially for sources
near the poles of the ecliptic coordinate system. However, it increases the
frequency estimation error by a factor of over 1.5 at any sky position, and at
f=3 mHz. Since accounting for Doppler-phase modulation is absolutely essential
at all LISA frequencies and for all chirp masses in order to avoid a fractional
loss of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of more than 30%, LISA science will be
simultaneously aided and limited by it. For a source with f > 2.5mHz, searching
for its frequency evolution for 1 year worsens the error in the frequency
estimation by a factor of over 3.5 relative to that of sources with f < 1mHz.
Increasing the integration time to 2 years reduces this relative error factor
to about 2, which still adversely affects the resolvability of the galactic
binary confusion noise. Thus, unless the mission lifetime is increased several
folds, the only other recourse available for reducing the errors is to exclude
the chirp parameter from ones search templates. Doing so improves the
SNR-normalized parameter estimates. This works for the lightest binaries since
their SNR itself does not suffer from that exclusion. However, for binaries
involving a neutron star, a black hole, or both, the SNR and, therefore, the
parameter estimation, can take a significant hit, thus, severely affecting the
ability to resolve such members in LISA's confusion noise.

the degree to which the ISM is molecular. The formulation is different in high

galaxies. The low scatter in the L-Z and M-Z relationships are difficult to

binary using the Keck sodium laser guide star adaptive optics system. With an
integrated-light spectral type of T3.5, this binary provides a new benchmark
for studying the distinctive J-band brightening previously noted among early
and mid-T dwarfs, using two brown dwarfs with different spectral types but
having a common metallicity and age and very similar surface gravities. We
estimate spectral types of T1.5+/-0.5 and T5.5+/-0.5 for the two components
based on their near-IR colors, consistent with modeling the integrated-light
spectrum as the blend of two components. The observed near-IR flux ratios are
unique compared to all previously known substellar binaries: the component that
is fainter at H and K' is brighter at J. This inversion of the near-IR fluxes
is a manifestation of the J-band brightening within this individual binary
system. Therefore, SDSS 1534+1615 demonstrates that the brightening can be
intrinsic to ultracool photospheres (e.g., arising from cloud disruption and/or
rapid increase in cloud sedimentation) and does not necessarily result from
physical variations among the observed ensemble of T dwarfs (e.g., a range in
masses, ages and/or metallicities). We suggest that the apparently large
amplitude of the J-band brightening may be due to a high incidence of
unresolved binaries and that the true amplitude of the phenomenon could be more
modest. This scenario would imply that truly single objects in these spectral
subclasses are relatively rare, in agreement with the small effective
temperature range inferred for the L/T transition.

emitters in Abell 851 catalogued by Martin et al. (2000). The optical spectra
obtained from the Keck I Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) and Keck II
Deep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) have confirmed [OII]3727
emission in narrowband-selected cluster [OII] candidates at a 85% success rate
for faint (i <~ 25) blue (g-i < 1) galaxies. The rate for the successful
detection of [OII] emission is a strong function of galaxy color, generally
proving the efficacy of narrowband [OII] search supplemented with broadband
colors in selecting faint cluster galaxies with recent star formation. Balmer
decrement-derived reddening measurements show a high degree of reddening
[E(B-V) >~ 0.5] in a significant fraction of this population. Even after
correcting for dust extinction, the [OII]/Ha line flux ratio for the
high-E(B-V) galaxies remains generally lower by a factor of ~2 than the mean
[OII]/Ha ratios reported by the studies of nearby galaxies. The strength of
[OII] equivalent width shows a negative trend with galaxy luminosity while the
Ha equivalent width does not appear to depend as strongly on luminosity. This
in part is due to the high amount of reddening observed in luminous galaxies.
Furthermore, emission line ratio diagnostics show that AGN-like galaxies are
abundant in the high luminosity end of the cluster [OII]-emitting sample, with
only moderately strong [OII] equivalent widths, consistent with a scenario of
galaxy evolution connecting AGNs and suppression of star-forming activity in
massive galaxies.

(~55%) of cluster [OII] emitters show strong Balmer absorptions (>4A in
equivalent width at Hd). These e(a) spectra have been attributed to dusty
starburst galaxies, an interpretation supported by our reddening measurements,
which show a high frequency of very reddened [EBV>0.5] [OII] emitters. Our
spectral modeling requires starburst ages >1Gyr, shorter than the cluster
crossing timescale. We argue that this starburst phase occurs during cluster
infall based on the radial velocity distribution of the cluster [OII] emitters,
which present a deficit of systems near the cluster systemic velocity. The
spatial segregation of some redshifted and blueshifted groups strongly
indicates that the accretion was recent. Throughout the cluster, the fraction
in [OII] emitters is a strong function of the local galaxy density. Our
analysis supports previous suggestions that dusty starburst galaxies arise at
the expense of gas-rich spiral galaxies. In addition, we describe a fainter
[OII]-emitting population, comprised largely of dwarf galaxies and find an even
stronger suppression of [OII] emission in high density environments among this
subsample, indicative of more effective destruction by harassment and/or
gas-stripping. Comparison to previous morphological studies, limited to the
core of A851, suggests that galaxy-galaxy interactions may trigger the
starbursts. The high e(a) galaxy fraction in A851 compared to that in the
field, however, suggests that some cluster-specific mechanism, likely related
to the dynamical assembly of the cluster, also contributes to the high number
of starbursts. (abridged)

stars in more massive galaxies tend to have formed earlier and over a shorter
time span. We show that this phenomenon is not necessarily ""anti-hierarchical""
but rather has its natural roots in the bottom-up clustering process of
dark-matter haloes. While the main progenitor does indeed show an opposite
effect, the integrated mass in all the progenitors down to a given minimum mass
shows a robust downsizing that is qualitatively similar to what has been
observed. These results are derived analytically from the standard extended
Press Schechter (EPS) theory, and are confirmed by merger trees based on EPS or
drawn from N-body simulations. The downsizing is valid for any minimum mass, as
long as it is the same for all haloes at any given time, but the effect is
weaker for smaller minimum mass. If efficient star formation is triggered by
atomic cooling, then a minimum halo mass arises naturally from the minimum
virial temperature for cooling, T~10^4 K, though for such a small minimum mass
the effect is weaker than observed. Baryonic feedback effects, which are
expected to stretch the duration of star formation in small galaxies and shut
it down in massive haloes at late epochs, are likely to play a subsequent role
in shaping up the final downsizing behaviour. Other appearances of downsizing,
such as the decline with time of the typical mass of star-forming galaxies, may
not be attributed to the gravitational clustering process but rather arise from
the gas processes.

other globular clusters (mainly Ferraro et al. 1997b; Ferraro et al 2003; and
Piotto et al. 2004). Using a ""bright"" sample selected in the same way as
Ferraro et al. 1997b, we found a bimodal radial distribution similar to those
found in three other luminous clusters. When the radial distributions for
different clusters are scaled using the core radius, there is good
cluster-to-cluster agreement in the size of the core straggler sample and the
center of the ""zone of avoidance"". However, M5 has the smallest fraction of
stragglers in the zone of avoidance of any of the clusters measured to date,
and its zone of avoidance appears to be wider (in r / r_c) than that of M3,
which has a very similar surface brightness profile. Both of these facts
indicate that M5's straggler population has dynamically evolved to a larger
extent than M3. Using an ultraviolet sample from Hubble Space Telescope
selected in the same way as Ferraro et al. 2003 and Ferraro et al. 2004, we

the many-multiplet (MM) method. For reliable results this method requires very
accurate relative laboratory wavelengths for a number of UV resonance
transitions from several different ionic species. For this purpose laboratory
wavelengths and wavenumbers of 23 UV lines from MgI, MgII, TiII, CrII, MnII,
FeII and ZnII have been measured using high-resolution Fourier Transform (FT)
spectrometry. The spectra of the different ions (except for one FeII line, one
MgI line and the TiII lines) are all measured simultaneously in the same FT
spectrometry recording by using a composite hollow cathode as a light source.
This decreases the relative uncertainties of all the wavelengths. In addition
to any measurement uncertainty, the wavelength uncertainty is determined by
that of the ArII calibration lines, by possible pressure shifts and by
illumination effects. The absolute wavenumbers have uncertainties of typically
0.001 to 0.002 cm^(-1) (0.06 to 0.1 mAA at 2500 AA), while the relative
wavenumbers for strong, symmetric lines in the same spectral recording have
uncertainties of 0.0005 cm^(-1) (0.03 mAA at 2500 AA) or better, depending
mostly on uncertainties in the line fitting procedure. This high relative
precision greatly reduces the potential for systematic effects in the MM
method, while the new TiII measurements now allow these transitions to be used

stochastic method which requires only the signs of the first derivatives of the
energy. The latter method performs significantly better. The energy for large
systems deviates by only approx. 0.06% from its exact value (calculated using
unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations). The spin correlations are also well
reproduced, falling approx. 2% below the exact ones at long distances. The

distribution of the static local magnetic field at the proton sites in the
paramagnetic metal (PM) and antiferromagnetic insulator (AFI) phases, along
with the changes that occur at the PM$-$AFI phase transition. The spectra have
six main peaks that are significantly broadened and shifted at low $T$. The
origin of these features is attributed to the large dipolar field from the 3d
Fe$^{3+}$ ion moments (spin $S_{\rm{d}}$ = 5/2). Their amplitude and
$T-$dependence are modeled using a modified Brillouin function that includes a
mean field approximation for the total exchange interaction ($J_{0}$) between
one Fe$^{3+}$ ion and its two nearest neighbors. A good fit is obtained using
$J_{0}$ = $-$ 1.7 K. At temperatures below the PM$-$AFI transition temperature
$T_{MI}$ = 3.5 K, an extra peak appears on the high frequency side of the

linewidth and the frequency shift of the spectral distribution are
discontinuous, consistent with the transition being first-order. These

developed based on fibre-optic components, which are insensitive to mechanical
vibrations and acoustic noise, have sub-MHz linewidth, and remain frequency
stabilised for weeks at a time. A compact, transportable vacuum system has been
built, and used for laser cooling and magneto-optical trapping. We will use a
mixture of quantum degenerate gases, bosonic $^{87}$Rb and fermionic $^{40}$K,
in order to find the optimal conditions for precision and sensitivity of

can quantitatively measure the distance between two graphs and construct random

literature. The nature of the dK-series implies that it will also capture any
future metrics that may be proposed. Using our approach, we construct graphs
for d=0,1,2,3 and demonstrate that these graphs reproduce, with increasing
accuracy, important properties of measured and modeled Internet topologies. We
find that the d=2 case is sufficient for most practical purposes, while d=3
essentially reconstructs the Internet AS- and router-level topologies exactly.

significant improvement to the set of tools available to network topology and

specific variant of the query problem (in some cases, $f$ is the identity
function). Our results have two kinds of consequences. First, they can be
easily translated in the relational (i.e., classical) setting. Previously known
bounds for some query problems are improved and new tractable cases are then

D74 (2006) 014501","10.1103/PhysRevD.74.014501",,"hep-lat hep-ph nucl-th",,"  Motivated by questions about the QCD deconfining phase transition, we studied
in two previous papers Model A (Glauber) dynamics of 2D and 3D Potts models,
focusing on structure factor evolution under heating (heating in the gauge
theory notation, i.e., cooling of the spin systems). In the present paper we
set for 3D Potts models (Ising and 3-state) the scale of the dynamical effects
by comparing to equilibrium results at first and second order phase transition
temperatures, obtained by re-weighting from a multicanonical ensemble. Our
finding is that the dynamics entirely overwhelms the critical and non-critical
equilibrium effects.
  In the second half of the paper we extend our results by investigating the
Glauber dynamics of pure SU(3) lattice gauge on $N_{\tau} N_{\sigma}^3$
lattices directly under heating quenches from the confined into the deconfined
regime. The exponential growth factors of the initial response are calculated,
which give Debye screening mass estimates. The quench leads to competing vacuum
domains of distinct $Z_3$ triality, which delay equilibration of pure gauge
theory forever, while their role in full QCD remains a subtle question. As in
spin systems we find for pure SU(3) gauge theory a dynamical growth of
structure factors, reaching maxima which scale approximately with the volume of
the system, before settling down to equilibrium. Their influence on various
observables is studied and different lattice sizes are simulated to illustrate
an approach to a finite volume continuum limit. Strong correlations are found
during the dynamical process, but not in the deconfined phase at equilibrium.

field theories where distinct fields are used to describe different infrared
momentum regions for the same particle. The formalism leads to extra
subtractions in certain diagrams and to a new way of thinking about
factorization of modes in quantum field theory. In non-relativistic field
theories, the subtractions remove unphysical pinch singularities in box type
diagrams, and give a derivation of the known pull-up mechanism between soft and
ultrasoft fields which is required by the renormalization group evolution. In a
field theory for energetic particles, the soft-collinear effective theory
(SCET), the subtractions allow the theory to be defined with different infrared
and ultraviolet regulators, remove double counting between soft, ultrasoft, and
collinear modes, and give results which reproduce the infrared divergences of
the full theory. Our analysis shows that convolution divergences in
factorization formul\ae occur due to an overlap of momentum regions. We propose
a method that avoids this double counting, which helps to resolve a long
standing puzzle with singularities in collinear factorization in QCD. The
analysis gives evidence for a factorization in rapidity space in exclusive
decays.

that can produce accelerated cosmological expansion, with pressure to density
ratio $w=-1/3$ at early times, and with $w=-2/3$ at late times when the lattice
scale becomes large compared to the wall thickness. For walls of tension
$T_{I}$, the relevant X type junctions could be unstable (for a sufficiently
acute intersection angle $\alpha$) against separation into a pair of Y type
junctions joined by a compound wall, only if the tension $T_{II}$ of the latter
were less than $2T_{I}$ (and for an approximately right-angled intersection if
it were less that $\sqrt{2} T_{I}$) which can not occur in the class considered
here. In an extensive category of multicomponent scalar field models of forced
harmonic (linear or non-linear) type it is shown how the relevant tension --
which is the same as the surface energy density $U$ of the wall -- can be
calculated as the minimum (geodesic) distance between the relevant vacuum
states as measured on the space of field values $\Phi^i$ using a positive
definite (Riemannian) energy metric $dU^2=\tilde G_{ij} d\Phi^i d\Phi^j$ that
is obtained from the usual kinetic metric (which is flat for a model with
ordinary linear kinetic part) by application of a conformal factor proportional
to the relevant potential function $V$. For suitably periodic potential
functions there will be corresponding periodic configurations -- with parallel
walls characterised by incrementation of a winding number -- in which the
condition for stability of large scale bunching modes is shown to be satisfied
automatically. It is suggested that such a configuration -- with a lattice
lengthscale comparable to intergalactic separation distances -- might have been

incomplete markets. Namely, we study the No Good Deals pricing technique based
on coherent risk. Two forms of this technique are presented: one defines a good
deal as a trade with negative risk; the other one defines a good deal as a
trade with unusually high RAROC. For each technique, the fundamental theorem of
asset pricing and the form of the fair price interval are presented. The model
considered includes static as well as dynamic models, models with an infinite
number of assets, models with transaction costs, and models with portfolio
constraints. In particular, we prove that in a model with proportional
transaction costs the fair price interval converges to the fair price interval
in a frictionless model as the coefficient of transaction costs tends to zero.
Moreover, we study some problems in the ``pure'' theory of risk measures: we
present a simple geometric solution of the capital allocation problem and apply
it to define the coherent risk contribution. The mathematical tools employed
are probability theory, functional analysis, and finite-dimensional convex
analysis.

distinguished by E. Cartan during his famous construction of the canonical
coframe for this type of distributions on some 14-dimensional principal bundle

construction of the canonical frame. We give rather simple answer to this

classical notion of the osculating quadric for curves in the projective plane.
Our method is a particular case of a general procedure for construction of
algebra-geometric structures for a wide class of distributions, which will be
described elsewhere. We also relate the fundamental invariant of

validity of the CD method due to an invoked large E2 component that was also
shown to arise from a misunderstanding of the CD method. In spite of the good
agreement between DC and CD data the slope of the astrophysical cross section
factor (S17) can not be extracted with high accuracy due to a discrepancy
between the recent DC data as well as a discrepancy of the three reports of the
GSI CD data. The slope is directly related to the d-wave component that
dominates at higher energies and must be subtracted from measured data to
extrapolate to zero energy. Hence the uncertainty of the measured slope leads
to an additional uncertainty of the extrapolated zero energy cross section
factor, S17(0). This uncertainty must be alleviated by future experiments to

calculate the binding energy of normal nuclei as well as strange hypernuclei.
The neutron (Sn) and proton (Sp) separation energies of all hypernuclei with
neutral hyperons Lambda, double Lambda or charged hyperons Cascade(-), Theta(+)
inside are calculated using BWMH mass formula. The normal neutron and proton
driplines get modified due to the addition of the hyperon(s)(Lambda, double

hypernuclei containing the charged hyperon(s) like those with neutral
hyperon(s) have similar nucleon separation energies like core nuclei if proton
number instead of net charge is used in the symmetry term. Due to the effect of
opposite charges present in Theta(+) and Cascade(-), hyperons their
corresponding driplines get separated from each other. All the hyperons modify
mean field potential due to strong hyperon-nucleon coupling. Addition of a
single charged hyperon in normal nuclei affects the entire proton drip line
more prominently than that by neutral hyperon. The neutral hyperonic effect on
proton dripline is significant for lighter nuclei than for heavier ones whereas
both the charged as well as neutral hyperons affect almost the entire neutron

inherent noise processes in those communication schemes and the statistical
nature of eavesdropper detection based on error statistics. On the other hand,
with sufficient resources, a practical/non-ideal realization of the KLJN cipher
can arbitrarily approach the idealized limit and outperform even the idealized
quantum communicator schemes because the non-ideality-effects are determined
and controlled by the design. The cable resistance issue analyzed by Scheuer

time window to build a sufficient statistics and the actual information leak
can be designed. We show that Scheuer's and Yariv's numerical result of 1%

Moreover, choosing thicker or shorter wires can arbitrarily reduce this voltage
drop further; the same conclusion holds even according to the equations of

related to the closed classical electron orbits in crossed static fields

one-dimensional cluster states with individually acting linear optical quantum
gates, entangled pairs and vacuum modes. As the known linear optics gates have
a limited maximum success probability, as we show, this amounts to finding the
optimal classical strategy of fusing pieces of linear cluster states. A formal
notion of classical configurations and strategies is introduced for
probabilistic non-faulty gates. We study the asymptotic performance of
strategies that can be simply described, and prove ultimate bounds to the
performance of the globally optimal strategy. The arguments employ methods of
random walks and convex optimization. This optimal strategy is also the one

for two level system and for the decaying one. Instead of simple projection
postulate approach, a more realistic model of a detector interacting with the
environment is used. The influence of the environment is taken into account
using the quantum trajectory method. The simulation of the measurement for a
single system exhibits the probabilistic behavior showing the collapse of the
wave-packet. When a large ensemble is analysed using the quantum trajectory
method, the results are the same as those produced using the density matrix
method. The results of numerical calculations are compared with the analytical
expressions for the decay rate of the measured system and a good agreement is
found. Since the analytical expressions depend on the duration of the
measurement only, the agreement with the numerical calculations shows that
otherparameters of the model are not important.

interferometer by using a properly designed random phase modulation. Different
from other approaches, the sensitivity improvement does not depend on
increasing optical powers or utilizing the quantum properties of light.
Moreover the requirements for optical losses and the quantum efficiencies of
photodetection systems might be lower than the quantum approaches and the
sensitivity improvement is frequency independent in all detection band.

  Channel with Correlated Noise; A General Expression","10 pages, 5 eps figure",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Entanglement and entanglement-assisted are useful resources to enhance the
mutual information of the Pauli channels, when the noise on consecutive uses of
the channel has some partial correlations. In this paper, We study quantum
communication channels with correlated noise and derive a general expression
for the mutual information of quantum channel, for the product, maximally
entangled state coding and entanglement-assisted systems with correlated noise
in the Pauli quantum channels. Hence, we suggest more efficient coding in the
entanglement-assisted systems for the transmission of classical information and
derive a general expression for the entanglement-assisted classical capacity.
Our results show that in the presence of memory, a higher amount of classical
information is transmitted by two or four consecutive uses of
entanglement-assisted systems.

q-deformation of the classical Poisson bracket in order to formulate a
generalized q-deformed dynamics in the classical regime. The obtained
q-deformed Poisson bracket appears invariant under the action of the
q-symplectic group of transformations. In this framework we introduce the
q-deformed Hamilton's equations and we derive the evolution equation for some
simple q-deformed mechanical systems governed by a scalar potential dependent
only on the coordinate variable. It appears that the q-deformed Hamiltonian,
which is the generator of the equation of motion, is generally not conserved in
time but, in correspondence, a new constant of motion is generated. Finally, by
following the standard canonical quantization rule, we compare the well known
q-deformed Heisenberg algebra with the algebra generated by the q-deformed
Poisson bracket.
