tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, which define the plane of slow-roll inflationary
models. We find that while the Bayesian evidence supports the conclusion that
$n_S \neq 1$, the data are not yet powerful enough to do so at a strong or
decisive level. If tensors are assumed absent, the current odds are
approximately 8 to 1 in favour of $n_S \neq 1$ under our assumptions, when
WMAP3 data is used together with external data sets. WMAP3 data on its own is
unable to distinguish between the two models. Further, inclusion of $r$ as a
parameter weakens the conclusion against the Harrison-Zel'dovich case (n_S = 1,
r=0), albeit in a prior-dependent way. In appendices we describe the CosmoNest
code in detail, noting its ability to supply posterior samples as well as to
accurately compute the Bayesian evidence. We make a first public release of

source metric perturbations via their energy-momentum tensor, the unequal-time

  Methods: WFILAS uses deep images taken with the Wide Field Imager (WFI) on
the ESO/MPI 2.2m telescope in three narrowband (70 A), one encompassing
intermediate band (220 A) and two broadband filters, B and R. We use the novel
technique of an encompassing intermediate band filter to exclude false
detections. Images taken with broadband B and R filters are used to remove low
redshift galaxies from our sample.
  Results: We present a sample of seven Lya emitting galaxy candidates, two of
which are spectroscopically confirmed. Compared to other surveys all our
candidates are bright, the results of this survey complements other narrowband
surveys at this redshift. Most of our candidates are in the regime of bright
luminosities, beyond the reach of less voluminous surveys. Adding our
candidates to those of another survey increases the derived luminosity density
by ~30%. We also find potential clustering in the Chandra Deep Field South,
supporting overdensities discovered by other surveys. Based on a FORS2/VLT
spectrum we additionally present the analysis of the second confirmed Lya
emitting galaxy in our sample. We find that it is the brightest Lya emitting
galaxy (1 x 10^-16 erg s^-1 cm^-2) at this redshift to date and the second
confirmed candidate of our survey. Both objects exhibit the presence of a
possible second Lya component redward of the line.

the new method is that one only has to solve a single mode of the scalar field
perturbation equation backward in time from the end of inflation to the stage
at which the perturbation is within the Hubble horizon, at which the initial

(GMCs). The effect of these encounters has previously been studied analytically
for two cases: 1) head-on encounters, for which the cluster moves through the
centre of the GMC and 2) distant encounters, where the encounter distance p >
3*R_n, with p the encounter parameter and R_n the radius of the GMC. We
introduce an expression for the energy gain of the cluster due to GMC
encounters valid for all values of p and R_n. This analytical result is
confronted with results from N-body simulations and excellent agreement is
found. From the simulations we find that the fractional mass loss is only 25%
of the fractional energy gain. This is because stars escape with velocities
much higher than the escape velocity. Based on the mass loss, we derive a
disruption time for star clusters due to encounters with GMCs of the form t_dis
[Gyr] = 2.0*S*(M_c/10^4 M_sun)^gamma, with S=1 for the solar neighbourhood and
inversely proportional with the global GMC density and gamma=1-3lambda, with
lambda the index that relates the cluster half-mass radius to the cluster mass
(r_h ~ M_c^lambda). The observed shallow relation between cluster radius and
mass (e.g. lambda=0.1), makes the index (gamma=0.7) similar to the index found
both from observations and from simulations of clusters dissolving in tidal
fields (gamma=0.62). The constant of 2.0 Gyr, which is the disruption time of a
10^4 M_sun cluster in the solar neighbourhood, is close to the value of 1.3 Gyr
which was empirically determined from the age distribution of open clusters.
This suggests that the combined effect of GMC encounters, stellar evolution and
galactic tidal field can explain the lack of old open clusters in the solar
neighbourhood.

study of KS 1947+300 across a wide X-ray band (0.1--100.0 keV) is attempted for
the first time here. Timing analysis of the data clearly shows a 18.7 s
pulsation in the X-ray light curves in the above energy band. The pulse profile
of KS 1947+300 is characterized by a broad peak with sharp rise followed by a
narrow dip. The dip in the pulse profile shows a very strong energy dependence.
Broad-band pulse-phase-averaged spectroscopy obtained with three of the
BeppoSAX instruments shows that the energy spectrum in the 0.1--100 keV energy
band has three components, a Comptonized component, a ~0.6 keV blackbody
component, and a narrow and weak iron emission line at 6.7 keV with a low
column density of material in the line of sight. We place an upper limit on the
equivalent width of the iron K_\alpha line at 6.4 keV of ~13 eV (for a width of
100 eV). Assuming a spherical blackbody emitting region and the distance of the
source to be 10 kpc, the radius of the emitting region is found to be in the
range of 14--22 km, which rules out the inner accretion disk as the soft X-ray
emitting region.

approximation (LDA), the high-energy band structure is obtained, while screened
Coulomb interactions are derived from the constrained LDA and the GW method.
The renormalization of the kinetic energy is determined from the GW method. By
these downfolding procedures, an effective Hamiltonian at low energies is
derived. Applying the path integral renormalization group method to this
Hamiltonian, we obtain ground state properties such as the magnetic and orbital
orders. Obtained results are consistent with experiments within available data.
We find that ${\rm Sr_{2}VO_{4}}$ is close to the metal-insulator transition.
Furthermore, because of the coexistence and competition of ferromagnetic and
antiferromgnetic exchange interactions in this system, an antiferromagnetic and
orbital-ordered state with a nontrivial and large unit cell structure is
predicted in the ground state. The calculated optical conductivity shows
characteristic shoulder structure in agreement with the experimental results.
This suggests an orbital selective reduction of the Mott gap.

Necessary and sufficient conditions for generalized successive refinability are

having its applications in low power CMOS, quantum computing, nanotechnology,
and optical computing. The classical set of gates such as AND, OR, and EXOR are
not reversible. Recently a 4 * 4 reversible gate called TSG is proposed. The
most significant aspect of the proposed gate is that it can work singly as a
reversible full adder, that is reversible full adder can now be implemented
with a single gate only. This paper proposes a NXN reversible multiplier using
TSG gate. It is based on two concepts. The partial products can be generated in
parallel with a delay of d using Fredkin gates and thereafter the addition can
be reduced to log2N steps by using reversible parallel adder designed from TSG
gates. Similar multiplier architecture in conventional arithmetic (using
conventional logic) has been reported in existing literature, but the proposed
one in this paper is totally based on reversible logic and reversible cells as
its building block. A 4x4 architecture of the proposed reversible multiplier is
also designed. It is demonstrated that the proposed multiplier architecture
using the TSG gate is much better and optimized, compared to its existing
counterparts in literature; in terms of number of reversible gates and garbage
outputs. Thus, this paper provides the initial threshold to building of more
complex system which can execute more complicated operations using reversible
logic.

non-analyticities in the classical treatment resemble issues in the comparison
of classical and quantum formalisms. We also show that semi-classical

manifold. Still, this suggests a connection to the first-order success of Bohr
theory in describing the phenomenology of atomic quantum states. The
approximate nature of the semi-classical treatment of three dimensional atomic

physics from microscopic scales and yields as output predictions of bulk,

have been used to model systems as ``small'' as heavy ions in collisions, and
as large as the universe itself, with ``intermediate'' sized objects like

discuss the mathematical and theoretical physics underpinnings of the

approach championed by Brandon Carter and his collaborators, in which a crucial
element is to distinguish the momenta that are conjugate to the particle number
density currents. This approach differs from the ``standard'' text-book
derivation of the equations of motion from the divergence of the stress-energy
tensor, in that one explicitly obtains the relativistic Euler equation as an
``integrability'' condition on the relativistic vorticity. We discuss the
conservation laws and the equations of motion in detail, and provide a number
of (in our opinion) interesting and relevant applications of the general
theory.

a scalar field phi that decays and reheats the plasma to a temperature T_{RH}

numerically study the neutralino relic density as a function of these reheating

theory. The string theory low-energy effective action necessarily describes
both a graviton and a dilaton, and we concentrate on the Callan-Myers-Perry
solution in d-dimensions, describing stringy corrections to the Schwarzschild
geometry. We develop the perturbation theory for the higher-derivative
corrected action, along the guidelines of the Ishibashi-Kodama framework,
focusing on tensor type gravitational perturbations. The potential obtained
allows us to address the perturbative stability of the black hole solution,
where we prove stability in any dimension. The equation describing
gravitational perturbations to the Callan-Myers-Perry geometry also allows for
a study of greybody factors and quasinormal frequencies. We address
gravitational scattering at low frequencies, computing corrections arising from
the curvature-squared term in the stringy action. We find that the absorption
cross-section receives \alpha' corrections, even though it is still
proportional to the area of the black hole event-horizon. We also suggest an
expression for the absorption cross-section which could be valid to all orders
in \alpha'.

energy class. This problem was studied by Gustafson-Nakanishi-Tsai \cite{GNT}
in the 3-dimensional case using the endpoint Strichartz estimate.
  To prove asymptotic stability of solitary waves, we need to show that a
dispersive part $v(t,x)$ of a solution belongs to $L^2_t(0,\infty;X)$ for some
space $X$. In the 1-dimensional case, this property does not follow from the
Strichartz estimate alone.
  In this paper, we prove that the local smoothing effect of Kato type holds
global in time and combine this estimate with the Strichartz estimate to show
$\|(1+x^2)^{-3/4}v\|_{L^\infty_xL^2_t}<\infty$, which implies the asymptotic
stability of a solitary wave.

generalization of property (T) which can be viewed as an analogue for the
vanishing of 1-cohomology into the left regular representation of a group. We
show that L^2-rigidity passes to normalizers and is satisfied by nonamenable
II_1 factors which are non-prime, have property $\Gamma$, or are weakly rigid.
As a consequence we obtain that if $M$ is a free product of diffuse von Neumann
algebras, or if $M = L\Gamma$ where $\Gamma$ is a finitely generated group with
$b_1^{(2)}(\Gamma) > 0$, then any nonamenable regular subfactor of $M$ is prime
and does not have properties $\Gamma$ or (T). In particular this gives a new
approach for showing primeness of all nonamenable subfactors of a free group
factor thus recovering a well known recent result of N. Ozawa.

use the fourth-order model to derive a relation between the direct-cascade and
the inverse-cascade Kolmogorov constants which is in a good qualitative
agreement with the laboratory and numerical experiments. We obtain a steady
state solution where both the enstrophy and the energy cascades are present
simultaneously and we discuss it in context of the Nastrom-Gage spectrum
observed in atmospheric turbulence. We also consider the effect of the bottom
friction onto the cascade solutions, and show that it leads to an additional
decrease and finite-wavenumber cutoffs of the respective cascade spectra.

used to obtain intermediate-coupling coefficients, and second-order RMBPT is
used to determine the matrix elements. A detailed discussion of the various
contributions to the dipole matrix elements and energy levels is given for
nickellike tungsten (Z = 74). The contributions from negative-energy states are

snowdrift game are studied in a well-mixed population or fully-connected
network and in a square lattice. The snowdrift game, which is a possible
alternative to the prisoner's dilemma game in studying cooperative phenomena in
competing populations, consists of two types of strategies, C (cooperators) and
D (defectors). In a fully-connected network, it is found that either C lives
with D or the loners take over the whole population. In a square lattice, three
possible situations are found: a uniform C-population, C lives with D, and the
coexistence of all three characters. The presence of loners is found to enhance
cooperation in a square lattice by enhancing the payoff of cooperators. The
results are discussed in terms of the effects in restricting a player to
compete only with his nearest neighbors in a square lattice, as opposed to
competing with all players in a fully-connected network.

each has had associated with it a complex and in places, contested history. The
episodes also reveal ways mathematical structures provide resources for new
