than any clusters in lenticular and spiral galaxies. Most of these extremely
alpha-enriched globular clusters are old (t > 8 Gyr) and cover the metallicity
range -1 <~ [Z/H] <~ 0. A comparison with supernova yield models suggests that
the progenitor gas clouds of these globular clusters must have been
predominantly enriched by massive stars (>~20 M_sol) with little contribution
from lower-mass stars. The measured [alpha/Fe] ratios are also consistent with
yields of very massive pair-instability supernovae (~130-190 M_sol). Both
scenarios imply that the chemical enrichment of the progenitor gas was
completed on extremely short timescales of the order of a few Myr. Given the
lower [alpha/Fe] average ratios of the diffuse stellar population in early-type
galaxies, our results suggest that these extremely alpha-enhanced globular
clusters could be members of the very first generation of star clusters formed,
and that their formation epochs would predate the formation of the majority of

explain the origin of galaxies. In these lecture notes, I first present a

the main aspects of primordial perturbation generation and evolution are
pedagogically detached. Next, I focus on the ``dark side'' of galaxy formation,
presenting a review on LCDM halo assembling and properties, and on the main
candidates for non-baryonic dark matter. It is shown how the nature of
elemental particles can influence on the features of galaxies and their
systems. Finally, the complex processes of baryon dissipation inside the
non-linearly evolving CDM halos, formation of disks and spheroids, and
transformation of gas into stars are briefly described, remarking on the
possibility of a few driving factors and parameters able to explain the main
body of galaxy properties. A summary and a discussion of some of the issues and

enhanced alpha to iron element ratio relative to solar abundances and follows
the same relation as typical starbursts between its properties (luminosity,
size, and temperature) and those of the starburst galaxy (star formation rate,
dust temperature, galaxy mass). These results are consistent with the X-ray gas
having been produced by shocks driven by a galactic superwind. The FUSE
observations of VV 114 show strong, broad interstellar absorption lines with a
pronounced blueshifted component(similar to what is seen in LBGs). This implies
an outflow of material moving at 300-400 km/s relative to VV 114. The
properties of the strong OVI absorption line are consistent with radiative
cooling at the interface between the hot outrushing gas seen in X-rays and the
cooler material seen in the other outflowing ions in the FUSE data. We show
that the wind in VV114 has not created a ``tunnel'' that enables more than a
small fraction (< few percent) of the ionizing photons from VV114 to escape
into the IGM. Taken together, these data provide a more complete physical basis

constructed using the Hubble Deep Field. Our source distribution reproduces the
observed redshift distribution of multiply imaged sources in Abell 1689. The
cosmology recovery depends on the number of image families with known
spectroscopic redshifts and the number of stacked clusters. Our simulations
suggest that constraints comparable to those derived from other competing
established techniques on a constant dark energy equation of state can be
obtained using 10 to 40 clusters with 5 or more families of multiple images. We
have also studied the observational errors in the image redshifts and

that the ratio of the advection cooling rate, $Q_{\rm adv}$, to the viscous
heating rate, $Q_{\rm vis}$, i.e., $f=Q_{\rm adv}/Q_{\rm vis}$, can be
represented by an analytical form dependent on the radius and the mass
accretion rate. The new analytic solutions can be characterized by the
photon-trapping radius, $\rtrap$, inside which the accretion time is less than
the photon diffusion time in the vertical direction; the nature of the
solutions changes significantly as this radius is crossed. Inside the trapping
radius,
  $f$ approaches $f \propto r^0$, which corresponds to the advection-dominated
limit ($f \sim 1$), whereas outside the trapping radius, the radial dependence
of $f$ changes to $f \propto r^{-2}$, which corresponds to the
radiative-cooling-dominated limit. The analytical formula for $f$ derived here
smoothly connects these two regimes. The set of new analytic solutions
reproduces well the global disk structure obtained by numerical integration
over a wide range of mass accretion rates, including the supercritical
accretion regime. In particular, the effective temperature profiles for our new
solutions are in good agreement with those obtained from numerical solutions.
Therefore, the new solutions will provide a useful tool not only for evaluating
the observational properties of accretion flows, but also for investigating the
mass evolution of black holes in the presence of supercritical accretion flows.

few kpc of the remnants of advanced mergers of galaxies with a view to
understand the relaxation in the central regions. For this, we analyze the
images from the 2MASS archival data for a selected sample of 12 merging
galaxies, which show signs of interaction but have a single nucleus. The
central regions are fitted by elliptical isophotes whose centres are allowed to
vary to get the best fit. The centres of isophotes show a striking sloshing
pattern with a spatial variation of up to 20-30 % within the central 1 kpc.
This indicates mass asymmetry and a dynamically unrelaxed behaviour. Next, we
Fourier-analyze the galaxy images while keeping the centre constant and measure
the deviation from axisymmetry in terms of the fractional Fourier amplitudes
(A_1, A_2 etc) as a function of radius. All mergers show a high value of
lopsidedness (upto A_1 ~ 0.2) in the central 5 kpc. The m=2 asymmetry is even
stronger, with values of A_2 upto ~ 0.3, and in three cases these are shown to
represent bars. The corresponding values denoting non-axisymmetry in inner
regions of a control sample of eight non-merger galaxies are found to be
several times smaller. Surprisingly, this central asymmetry is seen even in
mergers where the outer regions have relaxed into a smooth elliptical-like
r^{1/4} profile or a spiral-like exponential profile. Thus the central
asymmetry is long-lived, estimated to be ~ 1 Gyr, and hence lasts for over 100
local dynamical timescales. These central asymmetries are expected to play a
key role in the future dynamical evolution of the central region of a merger,

  orbits?","LaTeX, 2 pages, 1 figure. Contribution to ""Globular Clusters: Guides
  to Galaxies"", March 6th-10th, 2006",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In the last decade, observational studies have shown the existence of tidal
streams in the outer part of many galactic globular clusters. The most striking
examples of clusters with well defined tidal tails are represented by Palomar 5
and NGC 5466 (both observed in the framework of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey),
which show structures elongated for 4 kpc and 1 kpc in length, respectively.
Unfortunately, most of the observational studies about globular clusters (GCs)
do not cover such a large field of the sky as the SDSS does. In this framework,
by mean of a parallel, adaptive tree-code, we performed detailed N-body
simulations of GCs moving in a realistic three-components (bulge, disk and
halo) Milky Way potential, in order to clarify whether and to what extent tails
in the clusters outer regions (few tidal radii) are tracers of the local orbits
and, also, if some kind of correlation exists among the cluster orbital phase
and the orientation of such streams.

both $^7$Li and $^6$Li have abundance plateaus with respect to the metallicity.
Abundances of $^7$Li are about a factor three lower than the primordial
abundance predicted by standard big-bang nucleosynthesis (SBBN), and $^6$Li
abundances are $\sim 1/20$ of $^7$Li, whereas SBBN predicts negligible amounts
of $^6$Li compared to the detected level. These discrepancies suggest that
$^6$Li has another cosmological or Galactic origin than the SBBN. Furthermore,
it would appear that $^7$Li (and also $^6$Li) has been depleted from its
primordial abundance by some post-BBN processes. In this paper we study the
possibility that the radiative decay of long-lived particles has affected the
cosmological lithium abundances. We calculate the non-thermal nucleosynthesis
associated with the radiative decay and explore the allowed region of the
parameters specifying the properties of long-lived particles. We also impose
constraints from observations of the CMB energy spectrum. We find that
non-thermal nucleosynthesis produces $^6$Li at the level detected in metal poor
halo stars (MPHSs), when the lifetime of the unstable particles is of the order
$\sim 10^8-10^{12}$~s and their initial abundance with respect to that of the
photons is $\sim (10^{-13}-10^{-12}~{\rm GeV})/E_{\gamma 0}$, where $E_{\gamma
0}$ is the emitted photon energy in the radiative decay. We conclude that the
most likely nucleosynthetic scenario involves two different processes. First, a
non-thermal cosmological nucleosynthesis associated with the radiative decay of
unstable particles; and second, the stellar depletion of both of the primordial
lithium isotopic abundances.

evolved Wolf-Rayet star winds, and these are important for deriving metal
abundances and testing stellar evolution models. In addition, because these
optically thin lines form at large radius in the wind, their resolved profiles
carry an imprint of the asymptotic structure of the wind flow. This work
presents model forbidden line profile shapes formed in axisymmetric winds. It
is well-known that an optically thin emission line formed in a spherical wind
expanding at constant velocity yields a flat-topped emission profile shape.
Simulated forbidden lines are produced for a model stellar wind with an
axisymmetric density distribution that treats the latitudinal ionization
self-consistently and examines the influence of the ion stage on the profile
shape. The resulting line profiles are symmetric about line centre. Within a
given atomic species, profile shapes can vary between centrally peaked, doubly
peaked, and approximately flat-topped in appearance depending on the ion stage
(relative to the dominant ion) and viewing inclination. Although application to
Wolf-Rayet star winds is emphasized, the concepts are also relevant to other
classes of hot stars such as luminous blue variables and Be/B[e] stars.

at small radii deviate from their global best-fit R^(1/m) model, being
significantly flatter. The break-radius values are comparable with those

with our results for the entire range of molecular weights considered. However,
with detailed topological information available in our calculations, our
estimate of the `rheologically relevant' linear segment length is smaller than
that estimated by them. We use a numerical method based on tube model of
polymer melts to calculate the rheological properties of such molecules.
Results are in good agreement with experiment, except that in the case of the
largest molecular weight samples our estimate of the zero-shear viscosity is
significantly lower than the experimental findings. Using acid concentration as
an indicator for closeness to the gelation transition, we show that the
high-molecular-weight polymers considered are at the limit of mean-field
behavior - which possibly is the reason for this disagreement. For a truly
mean-field gelation class of model polymers, we numerically calculate the
rheological properties for a range of segment lengths. Our calculations show
that the tube theory with dynamical dilation predicts that, very close to the

dominated by the contribution from constraint-release Rouse motion and the

despite the drastic change in the system's behaviour, observing the transition
can sometimes be subtle. The hallmark of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) and
superfluidity in trapped, weakly interacting Bose gases is the sudden
appearance of a dense central core inside a thermal cloud. In strongly
interacting gases, such as the recently observed fermionic superfluids, this
clear separation between the superfluid and the normal parts of the cloud is no
longer given. Condensates of fermion pairs could be detected only using
magnetic field sweeps into the weakly interacting regime. The quantitative
description of these sweeps presents a major theoretical challenge. Here we
demonstrate that the superfluid phase transition can be directly observed by
sudden changes in the shape of the clouds, in complete analogy to the case of
weakly interacting Bose gases. By preparing unequal mixtures of the two spin
components involved in the pairing, we greatly enhance the contrast between the
superfluid core and the normal component. Furthermore, the non-interacting
wings of excess atoms serve as a direct and reliable thermometer. Even in the
normal state, strong interactions significantly deform the density profile of
the majority spin component. We show that it is these interactions which drive
the normal-to-superfluid transition at the critical population imbalance of
70(5)%.

leads to a complex fourth-order equation. The interatomic potential function
used to describe the metal state have a hard repulsive wall, and that of
nonmetal state is the same as potential function of non-polar fluid with
induced dipole intermolecular interaction. Metal-nonmetal transition occurs in
the liquid density range 11-8 g/cm3, and a density dependent interaction
potential which gradually changes from a pure metal interaction to a nonmetal
interaction, on going from metal state to nonmetal state in the transition
region, is used. Well-depth and the position of potential minimum are presented
as temperature dependent quantities; their calculated values for the metal
state are typically within 5.0% and 0.33% of the experimental value,
respectively. The calculated well-depth for nonmetal state is smaller than the
experimental value indicating the effect of high pressure PVT data used, which
pushes a pair of mercury atom further together into the repulsive side. In the
transition region, calculated well-depths are 2-3 order of magnitudes larger
than for the metal state, and contain a sharp rising edge and a steep falling
having a singularity characteristic of phase transition.

asperities will exert time-dependent deformations of the rubber surface
resulting in viscoelastic energy dissipation in the rubber, which gives a
contribution to the sliding friction. Most surfaces of solids have roughness on
many different length scales, and when calculating the friction force it is
necessary to include the viscoelastic deformations on all length scales. The
energy dissipation will result in local heating of the rubber. Since the
viscoelastic properties of rubber-like materials are extremely strongly
temperature dependent, it is necessary to include the local temperature
increase in the analysis. At very low sliding velocity the temperature increase
is negligible because of heat diffusion, but already for velocities of order
0.01 m/s the local heating may be very important. Here I study the influence of
the local heating on the rubber friction, and I show that in a typical case the
temperature increase results in a decrease in rubber friction with increasing
sliding velocity for v > 0.01 m/s. This may result in stick-slip instabilities,
and is of crucial importance in many practical applications, e.g., for the
tire-road friction, and in particular for ABS-breaking systems.

those considered in earlier work, turn out to be important. Without those,
supposedly non-spinning black holes have appreciable quasi-local spin;
furthermore, the Komar-mass condition and effective potential method agree only

sequence of quasi-circular orbits for non-spinning black-hole binaries, and

compare the method to a number of other multivariate methods, in particular
Artificial Neural Networks, the likelihood method and the recently presented

For the conditions of the early universe where the background medium consists
of a charge-symmetric plasma, the pure B-field contribution to the neutrino
dispersion relation is proportional to (e B)^2 and thus comparable to the
contribution of the magnetized plasma. The neutrino self-energy operator Sigma
(p) is calculated also for the case of high-energy neutrinos, which corresponds
to the crossed field approximation. The probability of the neutrino decay nu to
e^- W^+ is calculated from the imaginary part of the Sigma (p) operator. A
simple analytical result is obtained for the most interesting region of
parameters which was not considered earlier. The external magnetic field
contribution into the neutrino magnetic moment is calculated. The result
obtained corrects the formulas existed earlier. We show qualitatively that the
effect of ``neutrino spin light'' discussed in the literature has no physical
region of realization because of the medium influence on photon dispersion.

the Migdal's regularization approach (``meromorphization''), if one applies it
to 3-point function for scalar currents made of scalar quarks. We found that
the asymptotic 1/Q^2 behavior of F_M (Q^2) is generated by soft Feynman
mechanism rather than by short distance dynamics, which causes very late onset
of the 1/Q^2 asymptotic behavior. Using meromorphization for spin-1/2 quarks,
we demonstrated that resulting form factor F^{spinor}_M (Q^2) has 1/Q^4
asymptotic behavior. Now, owing to the late onset of this asymptotic pattern,
  F^{spinor}_M (Q^2) imitates the 1/Q^2 behavior in the few GeV^2 region.
  We discuss analogy between meromorphization and local quark-hadron duality
model for the pion form factor, and show that adding the O(\alpha_s) correction
to the spectral function brings in the hard pQCD contribution that has the
dimensional counting $1/Q^2$ behavior at large Q^2. At accessible Q^2, the
O(\alpha_s) term is a rather small fraction of the total result. We conclude
that the ``observed'' quark counting rules for hadronic form factors is an
approximate phenomenon resulting from Feynman mechanism in its preasymptotic

graphs with edge-transitive factors. A factorisation of a complete graph $K_n$
is a partition of its edges into disjoint classes. Each class of edges in a
factorisation of $K_n$ corresponds to a spanning subgraph called a factor. If
all the factors are isomorphic to one another, then a factorisation of $K_n$ is
called an isomorphic factorisation. A homogeneous factorisation of a complete
graph is an isomorphic factorisation where there exists a group $G$ which
permutes the factors transitively, and a normal subgroup $M$ of $G$ such that
each factor is $M$-vertex-transitive. If $M$ also acts edge-transitively on
each factor, then a homogeneous factorisation of $K_n$ is called an
edge-transitive homogeneous factorisation. The aim of this thesis is to study
edge-transitive homogeneous factorisations of $K_n$. We achieve a nearly
complete explicit classification except for the case where $G$ is an affine
2-homogeneous group of the form $Z_p^R \rtimes G_0$, where $G_0 \leq \Gamma
L(1,p^R)$. In this case, we obtain necessary and sufficient arithmetic
conditions on certain parameters for such factorisations to exist, and give a
generic construction that specifies the homogeneous factorisation completely,
given that the conditions on the parameters hold. Moreover, we give two
constructions of infinite families of examples where we specify the parameters
explicitly. In the second infinite family, the arc-transitive factors are
generalisations of certain arc-transitive, self-complementary graphs

particle beams, as they repeatedly pass through nonlinear focusing elements,
aiming to maximize the beam's luminosity properties in the storage rings of a
high energy accelerator. In the case of hadron beams, whose charge distribution
can be considered as ""frozen"" within a cylindrical core of small radius
compared to the beam's dynamical aperture, analytical formulas have been
recently derived \cite{BenTurc} for the contribution of space charges within
first order Hamiltonian perturbation theory. These formulas involve
distribution functions which, in general, do not lead to expressions that can
be evaluated in closed form. In this paper, we apply this theory to an example
of a charge distribution, whose effect on the dynamics can be derived
explicitly and in closed form, both in the case of 2--dimensional as well as
4--dimensional mapping models of hadron beams. We find that, even for very
small values of the ""perveance"" (strength of the space charge effect) the long
term stability of the dynamics changes considerably. In the flat beam case, the
outer invariant ""tori"" surrounding the origin disappear, decreasing the size of
the beam's dynamical aperture, while beyond a certain threshold the beam is
almost entirely lost. Analogous results in mapping models of beams with
2-dimensional cross section demonstrate that in that case also, even for weak
tune depressions, orbital diffusion is enhanced and many particles whose motion
was bounded now escape to infinity, indicating that space charges can impose
significant limitations on the beam's luminosity.

$\left<\cdot\right>$, in terms of the Reynolds number $\Rey = U\ell/\nu$, where
$U^{2}= L^{-2}\left<\|\bu\|_{2}^{2}\right>$ and $\ell$ is the forcing scale. In
particular, the Constantin-Foias-Temam upper bound \cite{CFT} on the attractor
dimension converts to $a_{\ell}^{2}\Rey(1 + \ln\Rey)^{1/3}$, while the estimate
for the inverse Kraichnan length is $(a_{\ell}^{2}\Rey)^{1/2}$, where
$a_{\ell}$ is the aspect ratio of the forcing. Other inverse length scales,
based on time averages, and associated with higher derivatives, are estimated
in a similar manner. The second task is to address the issue of intermittency :
it is shown how the time axis is broken up into very short intervals on which
various quantities have lower bounds, larger than long time-averages, which are
themselves interspersed by longer, more quiescent, intervals of time.

produce strong controllable short pulses of THz radiation. The high efficiency
of the technique is based on excitation of maximal THz coherence by applying
resonant optical pulses to the medium. The excited coherence in the medium is
connected to macroscopic polarization coupled to THz radiation. We have
performed detailed simulations by solving the coupled density matrix and
Maxwell equations. By using a simple $V$-type energy scheme for ruby, we have
demonstrated that the energy of generated THz pulses ranges from hundreds of
pico-Joules to nano-Joules at room temperature and micro-Joules at liquid
helium temperature, with pulse durations from picoseconds to tens of
nanoseconds. We have also suggested a coherent ruby source that lases on two
optical wavelengths and simultaneously generates THz radiation. We discussed
also possibilities of extension of the technique to different solid-state
materials.

logarithmic in the number of qubits sent, we achieve a dramatic improvement

  France (2006)",,,,"quant-ph math-ph math.MP",,"  The study of Mutually Unbiased Bases continues to be developed vigorously,
and presents several challenges in the Quantum Information Theory. Two
orthonormal bases in $\mathbb C^d, B {and} B'$ are said mutually unbiased if
$\forall b\in B, b'\in B'$ the scalar product $b\cdot b'$ has modulus
$d^{-1/2}$. In particular this property has been introduced in order to allow
an optimization of the measurement-driven quantum evolution process of any
state $\psi \in \mathbb C^d$ when measured in the mutually unbiased bases
$B\_{j} {of} \mathbb C^d$. At present it is an open problem to find the maximal
umber of mutually Unbiased Bases when $d$ is not a power of a prime number.
\noindent In this article, we revisit the problem of finding Mutually Unbiased
Bases (MUB's) in any dimension $d$. The method is very elementary, using the
simple unitary matrices introduced by Schwinger in 1960, together with their
diagonalizations. The Vandermonde matrix based on the $d$-th roots of unity
plays a major role. This allows us to show the existence of a set of 3 MUB's in
any dimension, to give conditions for existence of more than 3 MUB's for $d$
even or odd number, and to recover the known result of existence of $d+1$ MUB's
for $d$ a prime number. Furthermore the construction of these MUB's is very
explicit. As a by-product, we recover results about Gauss Sums, known in number
theory, but which have apparently not been previously derived from MUB
properties.

networks, and can also serve as an elementary operation in quantum computers.
Teleportation was first demonstrated as a transfer of a quantum state of light
onto another light beam; later developments used optical relays and
demonstrated entanglement swapping for continuous variables. The teleportation
of a quantum state between two single material particles (trapped ions) has now
also been achieved. Here we demonstrate teleportation between objects of a
different nature - light and matter, which respectively represent 'flying' and
'stationary' media. A quantum state encoded in a light pulse is teleported onto
a macroscopic object (an atomic ensemble containing 10^12 caesium atoms).
Deterministic teleportation is achieved for sets of coherent states with mean
photon number (n) up to a few hundred. The fidelities are 0.58+-0.02 for n=20
and 0.60+-0.02 for n=5 - higher than any classical state transfer can possibly
achieve. Besides being of fundamental interest, teleportation using a
macroscopic atomic ensemble is relevant for the practical implementation of a
quantum repeater. An important factor for the implementation of quantum
networks is the teleportation distance between transmitter and receiver; this
is 0.5 metres in the present experiment. As our experiment uses propagating
light to achieve the entanglement of light and atoms required for
teleportation, the present approach should be scalable to longer distances.
