ago for a Phase A study (now almost completed) for a future flight (2009)
aboard the Columbus Exposed Payload Facility of the International Space
Station. The main instrument, based on MCP optics with Lobster-eye geometry,
has an energy passband from 0.1 to 3.5 keV, an unprecedented daily sensitivity
of 2x10^{-12} erg cm^{-2}s$^{-1}, and it is capable to scan, during each orbit,
the entire sky with an angular resolution of 4--6 arcmin. This X-ray telescope
is flanked by a Gamma Ray Burst Monitor, with the minimum requirement of
recognizing true GRBs from other transient events. In this paper we describe
the GRBM. In addition to the minimum requirement, the instrument proposed is
capable to roughly localize GRBs which occur in the Lobster FOV (162x22.5
degrees) and to significantly extend the scientific capabilities of the main
instrument for the study of GRBs and X-ray transients. The combination of the
two instruments will allow an unprecedented spectral coverage (from 0.1 up to
300/700 keV) for a sensitive study of the GRB prompt emission in the passband
where GRBs and X-Ray Flashes emit most of their energy. The low-energy spectral
band (0.1-10 keV) is of key importance for the study of the GRB environment and
the search of transient absorption and emission features from GRBs, both goals
being crucial for unveiling the GRB phenomenon. The entire energy band of
Lobster-ISS is not covered by either the Swift satellite or other GRB missions
foreseen in the next decade.

themselves have long been studied both observationally and theoretically. Here
we test the influence of large-scales structures and tidal fields on the shapes

high-resolution N-body simulation of a $\Lambda$CDM universe, together with the
results of Colberg et al. (2005), who identified filaments connecting pairs of
clusters. We find that cluster pairs connected by a filament are strongly
aligned with the cluster-cluster axis, whereas unconnected ones are not. For
smaller, galaxy-size halos, there also is an alignment signal, but its strength
is independent of whether the halo is part of an obvious large-scale structure.
Additionally, we find no measureable dependence of galaxy halo shape on
membership of a filament. We also quantify the influence of tidal fields and
find that these do correlate strongly with alignments of halos. The alignments
of most halos are thus caused by tidal fields, with cluster-size halos being
strongly aligned through the added mechanism of infall of matter from
filaments.

galaxies selected from the SDSS DR2 on the basis of their concentrated light
profiles, for which we have previously derived median-likelihood estimates of
stellar metallicity, light-weighted age and stellar mass. Our analysis provides
the most unambiguous demonstration to date of the fact that both relations are
primarily sequences in stellar mass and that total stellar metallicity,
alpha-elements-to-iron abundance ratio and light-weighted age all increase with
mass along the two relations. For high-mass ellipticals, the dispersion in age
is small and consistent with the error. At the low-mass end, there is a tail
towards younger ages, which dominates the scatter in colour and index strength
at fixed mass. A small, but detectable, intrinsic scatter in the
mass-metallicity relation also contributes to the scatter in the two
observational scaling relations, even at high masses. Our results suggest that
the chemical composition of an early-type galaxy is more tightly related to its
dynamical mass (including stars and dark matter) than to its stellar mass. The
ratio between stellar mass and dynamical mass appears to decrease from the
least massive to the most massive galaxies in our sample.

date have tried to model the cosmic gas as an ideal, inviscid fluid, where only
a small amount of (unwanted) numerical viscosity is present, arising from
practical limitations of the numerical method employed, and with a strength
that depends on numerical resolution. However, the physical viscosity of the
gas in hot galaxy clusters may in fact not be negligible, suggesting that a
self-consistent treatment that accounts for the internal gas friction would be
more appropriate. To allow such simulations using the smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) method, we derive a novel SPH formulation of the
Navier-Stokes and general heat transfer equations and implement them in the
GADGET-2 code. We include both shear and bulk viscosity stress tensors, as well
as saturation criteria that limit viscous stress transport where appropriate.
Adopting Braginskii's parameterization for the shear viscosity of hot gaseous
plasmas, we then study the influence of viscosity on the interplay between
AGN-inflated bubbles and the surrounding intracluster medium (ICM). We find
that certain bubble properties like morphology, maximum clustercentric radius
reached, or survival time depend quite sensitively on the assumed level of
viscosity. Interestingly, the sound waves launched into the ICM by the bubble
injection are damped by physical viscosity, establishing a non-local heating
process. Finally, we carry out cosmological simulations of galaxy cluster
formation with a viscous intracluster medium. Viscosity modifies the dynamics
of mergers and the motion of substructures through the cluster atmosphere.
Substructures are generally more efficiently stripped of their gas, leading to
prominent long gaseous tails behind infalling massive halos. (Abridged)

remains close to zero near the detector.
  The ABCD formula assigns a (wrapped) phase to the amplitudes A to D of an
interference pattern shifted by multiples of 90 degrees in phase. We study the
interplay between a wide band pass of the optics and the dispersion of the air
in the compensating delay, which leads to small deviations between the ABCD

moderate positive luminosity evolution up to z~1.5, consistent with the passive

found to evolve passively, gradually increasing out to z~0.5-1 but flattening,
or even declining, at higher redshift. Conversely, the 24 micron galaxy LF,
which is more sensitive to obscured star formation and/or AGN activity,
undergoes strong positive evolution, with the derived IR energy density and SFR
density proportional to (1+z)^gamma with gamma=4.5^{+0.7}_{-0.6} and the

observed in the Helix Nebula. We show that the properties of the globules,
their number, mass, separation, and overall geometry strongly support a
scenario in which globules are formed by the fragmentation of a swept-up shell
as opposed to models in which the knots form in the AGB wind. We show that the
RT or other instabilities which lead to the break-up of shells formed in the
nebulae by fast winds or ionization fronts can produce arrays of globules with
the overall geometry and within the mass range observed. We also show that the
presence of a magnetic field in the circumstellar gas may play an important
role in controlling the fragmentation process. Using field strengths measured
in the precursor AGB envelopes, we find that close to the central star where
the fields are relatively strong, the wavelengths of unstable MRT modes are
larger than the shell dimensions, and the fragmentation of the shell is
suppressed. The wavelength of the most unstable MRT mode decreases with
increasing distance from the star, and when it becomes comparable to the shell
thickness, it can lead to the sudden, rapid break-up of an accelerating shell.
For typical nebula parameters, the model results in numerous fragments with a
mass scale and a separation scale similar to those observed. Our results
provide a link between global models of PN shaping in which shells form via
winds and ionization fronts, and the formation of small scale structures in the
nebulae.

near-solar metal abundance. The fraction of GC candidates matched with point
sources decreases with decreasing GC luminosity. The X-ray luminosities of the
matched point sources are not correlated with the luminosity or color of the

this study, the physical origin of the quadrupole field is analyzed and traced
to a current of electrons that flows along the lines in and out of the inner
reconnection region to maintain charge neutrality. The role of the quadrupole
magnetic field in the overall dynamics of the reconnection process is
discussed. In addition, the bipolar poloidal electric field is estimated and
its effect on ion motions is emphasized.

remains incompletely understood. Here it is argued that the oxic transition,
which took place between approximately 2.3 and 0.5 Gyr ago, required a great
proliferation of cyanobacteria, and this in turn depended on their ability to
fix nitrogen via the nitrogenase enzyme system. However, the ability to fix
nitrogen was not a panacea, and the rate of biospheric oxygenation may still
have been affected by nitrogen constraints on cyanobacterial expansion.
Evidence is presented for why cyanobacteria probably have a great need for
fixed nitrogen than other prokaryotes, underscoring the importance of their
ability to fix nitrogen. The connection between nitrogen fixation and the
evolution of photosynthesis is demonstrated by the similarities between
nitrogenase and enzymes critical for the biosynthesis of (bacterio)chlorophyll.
It is hypothesized that biospheric oxygenation would not have occurred if the
emergence of cyanobacteria had not been preceded by the evolution of nitrogen
fixation, and if these organisms had not also acquired the ability to fix
nitrogen at the beginning of or very early in their history. The evolution of
nitrogen fixation also appears to have been a precondition for the evolution of
(bacterio)chlorophyll-based photosynthesis. Given that some form of chlorophyll
is obligatory for true photosynthesis, and its light absorption and chemical
properties make it a ""universal pigment,"" it may be predicted that the
evolution of nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis are also closely linked on
other Earth- like planets.

consistent with the inclination previously found for the orbit of the close
companion. The wide orbit also has low eccentricity, suggesting that the three
stars were formed at the same time.
  The brightness ratio between the two B stars was also measured at lambda =
442nm and 700nm. The brightness ratio and colour index are consistent with the
previous classification of lambda Sco A as B1.5 and lambda Sco B as B2.
Evolutionary models show that the two stars lie on the main sequence. Since
they have have the same age and luminosity class (IV) the mass-luminosity
relation can be used to determine the mass ratio of the two stars: M_B/M_A =
0.76+/-0.04.
  The spectroscopic data have been reanalyzed using the interferometric values
for P, T, e and omega, leading to revised values for a_1sin i and the mass
function. The individual masses can be found from the mass ratio, the mass
function, spectrum synthesis and the requirement that the age of both
components must be the same: M_A = 10.4+/-1.3 Msun and M_B = 8.1+/-1.0 Msun.
  The masses, angular semimajor axis and the period of the system can be used
to determine the dynamical parallax. We find the distance to lambda Sco to be
112+/-5 pc, which is approximately a factor of two closer than the HIPPARCOS

0.34$\pm0.11c$ (H$_{0}$=72 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$), which results in a
kinematic age of 2200$\pm$700 yr. Assuming that two hot spots are moving apart
at equal speeds, we derive an advance speed of 0.17$\pm0.06c$. The radio lobe
spectra show a high frequency steepening, as expected if energetic electrons
lose energy by synchrotron radiation. The spectral break decreases with the
distance from the hot spot in the northern component of CTD~93. This tendency
is expected from the basic scenario of radio lobe evolution involving particle
acceleration at the hot spots, with the radio lobes populated by high energy
electrons which have leaked from the hot spots. Although a core-jet morphology
for CTD~93 has previously been proposed, these results indicate that the
morphology is similar to that of Compact Symmetric Object (CSO). From the
spectral fits in the northern component we found a break frequency of 3.7 GHz
at the edge of the lobe. The resultant spectral age is $\sim$300 yr assuming
the equipartition magnetic field. This requires the advance speed of 0.26$c$,

results strongly support the hypothesis that CSOs are young radio sources.

different spectra of ionising radiation: a power law (goes as nu^{-0.5}),
miniquasar, starburst, and a time-varying spectrum that evolves from a
starburst spectrum to a power law. The RT is sufficiently resolved in time and
space to correctly model both the ionisation state and the temperature across
the ionisation front. We find the post-ionisation temperature of the reionised
intergalactic medium (IGM) is sensitive to the spectrum of the source of
ionising radiation, which may be used to place strong constraints on the nature
of the sources of reionisation. Radiative transfer effects also produce large
fluctuations in the HeII to HI number density ratio eta. The spread in values
is smaller than measured, except for the time-varying spectrum. For this case,
the spread evolves as the spectral nature of the ionising background changes.
Large values for eta are found in partially ionised HeII as the power-law
spectrum begins to dominate the starburst, suggesting that the large eta values
measured may be indicating the onset of the HeII reionisation epoch.

dynamics in liquids and glasses at microscopic length scales and terahertz
frequency region based on the mode-coupling theory for ideal liquid-glass
transition. We focus on recently investigated issues from
inelastic-X-ray-scattering and computer-simulation studies for dynamic
structure factors and longitudinal and transversal current spectra: the
anomalous dispersion of the high-frequency sound velocity and the nature of the
low-frequency excitation called the boson peak. It will be discussed how the
sound mode interferes with other low-lying modes present in the system.
Thereby, we provide a systematic explanation of the anomalous sound-velocity
dispersion in systems -- ranging from high temperature liquid down to deep
inside the glass state -- in terms of the contributions from the
structural-relaxation processes and from vibrational excitations called the
anomalous-oscillation peak (AOP). A possibility of observing negative
dispersion -- the {\em decrease} of the sound velocity upon increase of the
wave number -- is argued when the sound-velocity dispersion is dominated by the
contribution from the vibrational dynamics. We also show that the low-frequency
excitation, observable in both of the glass-state longitudinal and transversal
current spectra at the same resonance frequency, is the manifestation of the
AOP. As a consequence of the presence of the AOP in the transversal current
spectra, it is predicted that the transversal sound velocity also exhibits the
anomalous dispersion. These results of the theory are demonstrated for a model
of the Lennard-Jones system.

this algorithm enables effective computation and easy implementation. Fractal
networks are viewed as comprising a skeleton and shortcuts. The skeleton,
embedded underneath the original network, is a special type of spanning tree
based on the edge betweenness centrality; it provides a scaffold for the
fractality of the network. When the skeleton is regarded as a branching tree,
it exhibits a plateau in the mean branching number as a function of the
distance from a root. Based on these observations, we construct a fractal
network model by combining a random branching tree and local shortcuts. The
scaffold branching tree can be either critical or supercritical, depending on
the small-worldness of a given network. For the network constructed from the
critical (supercritical) branching tree, the average number of vertices within
a given box grows with the lateral size of the box according to a power-law (an
exponential) form in the cluster-growing method. The distribution of box
masses, i.e., the number of vertices within each box, follows a power law
P_m(M) sim M^{-eta}. The exponent eta depends on the box lateral size ell_B.
For small values of ell_B, eta is equal to the degree exponent gamma of a given
scale-free network, whereas eta approaches the exponent tau=gamma/(gamma-1) as
ell_B increases, which is the exponent of the cluster-size distribution of the
random branching tree. We also study the perimeter of a given box as a function
of the box mass.

increased. However, in the strongly interacting region the central polarization
increases most rapidly close to the mean-field critical temperature, which is
known to be substantially higher than the critical temperature for
superfluidity. This indicates that most of the phase separation occurs in the
fluctuation region prior to superfluidity and that the polarization in the
actual superfluid is modest.

deal with complex distributions over multiple random variables. The problem of
efficient representation of probability distributions is central in term of
computational efficiency in the field of probabilistic reasoning. The main
problem arises when dealing with joint probability distributions over a set of
random variables: they are always represented using huge probability arrays. In
this paper, a new method based on binary-tree representation is introduced in
order to store efficiently very large joint distributions. Our approach
approximates any multidimensional joint distributions using an adaptive
discretization of the space. We make the assumption that the lower is the
probability mass of a particular region of feature space, the larger is the
discretization step. This assumption leads to a very optimized representation
in term of time and memory. The other advantages of our approach are the
ability to refine dynamically the distribution every time it is needed leading
to a more accurate representation of the probability distribution and to an
anytime representation of the distribution.

as the unversal force. All other forces then arise as these properties are
peeled off. For instance, relaxing (i) but retaining (ii) will lead to Maxwell
electromagnetic force. This unified outlook makes interesting suggestions and
predictions: if there exists a new force, it can only be a short range
non-abelian vector or a scalar field, and there should exist in an appropriate
space duality relations between weak and electric, and between strong and
gravity.

with a scalar charge. The particle produces a retarded scalar field which
interacts with the particle and influences its motion via the action of a

and decompose the scalar field in spherical-harmonic modes. Although each mode
is bounded at the position of the particle, a mode-sum evaluation of the
self-force requires regularization because the sum does not converge: the
retarded field is infinite at the position of the particle. The regularization
procedure involves the computation of regularization parameters, which are
obtained from a mode decomposition of the Detweiler-Whiting singular field;
these are subtracted from the modes of the retarded field, and the result is a
mode-sum that converges to the actual self-force. We present such a computation
in this paper. There are two main aspects of our work that are new. First, we
define the regularization parameters as scalar quantities by referring them to
a tetrad decomposition of the singular field. Second, we calculate four sets of
regularization parameters (denoted schematically by A, B, C, and D) instead of
the usual three (A, B, and C). As proof of principle that our methods are
reliable, we calculate the self-force acting on a scalar charge in circular

  Entropy and the Principle of Chiral Ordering","68 pages, 1 figure; v2: minor changes in sections 2 and 8.1",,,,"hep-lat hep-ph hep-th nucl-th",,"  In this series of articles we describe a systematic approach to studying QCD
vacuum structure using the methods of lattice gauge theory. Our framework
incorporates four major components. (i) The recently established existence of
space-time order at all scales (fundamental structure) observed directly in
typical configurations of regularized path-integral ensembles. (ii) The notion
of scale-dependent vacuum structure (effective structure) providing the means
for representing and quantifying the influence of fluctuations at various
scales on physical observables (phenomena). (iii) The unified description of
gauge and fermionic aspects of the theory which facilitates a high level of
space-time order in the path-integral ensembles. (iv) The strict ``Bottom-Up''
approach wherein the process of identifying the vacuum structure proceeds
inductively, using the information from valid lattice QCD ensembles as the only
input. In this work we first elaborate on the meaning of the notion of
space-time order in a given configuration which is conceptually at the heart of
the path-integral approach to vacuum structure. It is argued that the
algorithmic complexity of binary strings associated with coarse-grained
descriptions of the configuration provides a relevant quantitative measure. The
corresponding ensemble averages define the ranking of different lattice
theories at given cutoff by the degree of space-time order generated via their

configuration, chiral orderings, in which the transformed gauge connection
represents an effective matrix phase acquired by chiral fermion when hopping
over a given link. It is proposed that chiral orderings facilitate the
evolution in the set of actions which increases the degree of space-time order
while preserving the physical content of the theory, and should thus be used in
the search for the fundamental QCD vacuum structure. The relation to
renormalization group ideas is discussed, and the first step in general
formulation of effective lattice QCD realizing the notion of scale-dependent
vacuum structure is given.

the directions along which the AdS-brane worldvolume extends are restricted by
requiring that the isometry on the AdS-brane worldvolume and the Lorentz

X^{\mu_1 ... \mu_n} and associated coordinate frame fields {\gamma_{\mu_1 ...

than four dimensions suggests that it could serve as a realization of
Kaluza-Klein idea. The ""extra dimensions"" are not just the ordinary extra
dimensions, they are related to the volume degrees of freedom, therefore they
are physical, and need not be compactified. Gauge fields are due to the metric
of Clifford space. It turns out that amongst the latter gauge fields there also
exist higher grade, antisymmetric fields of the Kalb-Ramond type, and their
non-Abelian generalization. All those fields are naturally coupled to the

type of obstruction to a principal graph, thanks to a recent result of
P.Etingof, D.Nikshych, and V.Ostrik. We show that the sequence of the graphs
given by Haagerup as candidates of principal graphs of subfactors, are not
realized as principal graphs for 7<n <= 27 using GAP program. We further
utilize Mathematica to extend the statement to 27 <n <= 55. We conjecture that
none of the graphs are principal graphs for all n>7, and give an evidence using
Mathematica for smaller graphs among them for n>55. The problem for the case
n=7 remains open, however, it is highly likely that it would be realized as a
principal graph, thanks to numerical computation by Ikeda.

of the discrete system depends on numerical approximation methods for the
integrals occurring in the enlarged system. As a result of the discretization,
a system of linear polynomial difference equations is derived for the unknown

elimination of all the partial derivatives. The elimination can be achieved by
selecting a proper elimination ranking and by computing a Gr\""obner basis of
the linear difference ideal generated by the polynomials in the discrete
system. For these purposes we use the difference form of Janet-like Gr\""obner

weakening of the spin-orbit splitting among low-j neutron orbits. The present

persists as one reaches the neutron-rich isotone 42Si. Yet the proton removal
from 48Ca results in a significant erosion of the N=28 shell in 42Si. Finally,
the removal of s1/2 protons from 48Ca causes a ~50% reduction of the spin-orbit

docking can evaluate the energies of billions of docked conformations on a grid

interactions potentials that substantially improve the docking results. The
basic idea is approximating the interaction matrix by its eigenvectors
corresponding to the few dominant eigenvalues, resulting in an energy
expression written as the sum of a few correlation functions, and solving the
problem by repeated FFT calculations. In addition to describing how the method
is implemented, we present a novel class of structure based pairwise
intermolecular potentials. The DARS (Decoys As the Reference State) potentials
are extracted from structures of protein-protein complexes and use large sets
of docked conformations as decoys to derive atom pair distributions in the

enzyme-inhibitor complexes. With the new FFT-based program, DARS provides much
better docking results than the earlier approaches, in many cases generating
50\% more near-native docked conformations. Although the potential is far from

spin-$s$ is investigated. The entanglement is witnessed by the thermal energy
which equals to the minimum energy of any separable state. There is a
characteristic temperature below that an entangled thermal state exists. The
characteristic temperature for thermal entanglement is increased with spin $s$.
When the total number of lattice is increased, the characteristic temperature
decreases and then approaches a constant. This effect shows that the thermal
entanglement can be detected in a real solid state system of larger number of
lattices for finite temperature. The comparison of negativity and entanglement
witness is obtained from the separability of the unentangled states. It is

of the thermal entanglement in a spin-$s$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain.

asymmetric Pauli channels where two consecutive uses of the channels are
correlated. It is evident from our study that in the presence of memory, a
higher amount of classical information is transmitted over quantum channels if
there exists prior entanglement as compared to product and entangled state
coding.

evolution of quantum decay to discuss a regime where quantum decay is
nonexponential at all times. We find that the interference between the
exponential and nonexponential terms of the survival amplitude modifies the
usual exponential decay regime in systems where the ratio of the resonance
energy to the decay width, is less than 0.3. We suggest that such regime could
be observed in semiconductor double-barrier resonant quantum structures with
appropriate parameters.

that ensures its pseudo-Hermiticity. This condition is always satisfied
whenever the operator acts in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space. Hence weak
pseudo-Hermiticity and pseudo-Hermiticity are equivalent in finite-dimensions.
This equivalence extends to a much larger class of operators. Quantum systems
whose Hamiltonian is selected from among these operators correspond to
pseudo-Hermitian quantum systems possessing certain symmetries.

computing in optical fibers, which enables the feedforward feature, is
proposed. This scheme uses the time-bin encoding of qubits. Following
previously suggested methods of applying arbitrary one-qubit gates in optical
fibers, two different ways for the realization of fusion gate types I and II
for cluster production are proposed: a fully time-bin based encoding scheme and
a combination of time-bin and polarization based encoding scheme. Also the
methods of measurement in any desired bases for the purpose of the processing
of cluster state computing for both these encodings are explained.
