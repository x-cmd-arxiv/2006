energy' studies. We construct models in terms of the dimensionless second and
third derivatives of the scale factor a(t) with respect to cosmic time t,
namely the present-day value of the deceleration parameter q_0 and the cosmic
jerk parameter, j(t). An elegant feature of this parameterization is that all
LCDM models have j(t)=1 (constant), which facilitates simple tests for
departures from the LCDM paradigm. Applying our model to the three best
available sets of redshift-independent distance measurements, from type Ia
supernovae and X-ray cluster gas mass fraction measurements, we obtain clear
statistical evidence for a late time transition from a decelerating to an
accelerating phase. For a flat model with constant jerk, j(t)=j, we measure
q_0=-0.81+-0.14 and j=2.16+0.81-0.75, results that are consistent with LCDM at
about the 1sigma confidence level. A standard `dynamical' analysis of the same
data, employing the Friedmann equations and modeling the dark energy as a fluid
with an equation of state parameter, w (constant), gives
Omega_m=0.306+0.042-0.040 and w=-1.15+0.14-0.18, also consistent with LCDM at
about the 1sigma level. In comparison to dynamical analyses, the kinematical
approach uses a different model set and employs a minimum of prior information,
being independent of any particular gravity theory. The results obtained with
this new approach therefore provide important additional information and we
argue that both kinematical and dynamical techniques should be employed in
future dark energy studies, where possible. Our results provide further
interesting support for the concordance LCDM paradigm.

us to search for superbursts in data from the BeppoSAX Wide Field Cameras of
ten luminous LMXBs, most of which do not exhibit normal type-I X-ray bursts. We
found no superbursts and determine a lower limit on the recurrence time which
varies between 30 and 76 days (90% confidence). All recurrence time limits
except one are longer than the observed recurrence time for GX 17+2. This
difference can be understood if the mass accretion rate in GX 17+2 is several
tens of percent higher than in the other sources; alternatively, the accreted
material in GX 17+2 might be hydrogen deficient, leading to larger carbon
yields than in the other sources. We compare our results to the latest models
of superbursts. As our search method is indiscriminate of the burst ignition
scenario, the recurrence time limits may also be applied to other bursts of
similar duration and brightness.

evolve to a carbon core explosion similar to what is widely accepted as an
explanation for the SN I phenomenon. This should happen when their
carbon-oxygen core grows thanks to the helium shell burning above the core. We
found that in the mass range of about 1.7-2.2 Msun, indeed this can happen.
  The main new insight we believe we gained is the crucial importance of an
""early"" off-center ignition of carbon, which at a later stage prevents the
carbon which forms below the helium burning shell and ignites, from burning the
carbon all the way to the center. When helium is almost depleted in the
convective envelope by the helium burning shell at its bottom, the now
super-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen core contracts, and the residual
degenerate carbon at the center is ignited, resulting in a runaway similar to
the classical SN I scenario.
  Since the structure and behavior of the carbon-oxygen core of the helium
stars of our interest is very similar to that of a mass accreting carbon-oxygen
star, we also thoroughly examined the behavior of carbon-oxygen stars. We
discovered that the models which ignite carbon off-center (in the mass range of
about 1.05-1.18 Msun, depending on the carbon mass fraction) present an
interesting SN I progenitor scenario of their own, since whereas in the
standard scenario runaway always takes place at the same density of about 2E9
gr/cm3, in our case, due to the small amount of carbon ignited, we get a whole
range of densities from 1E9 up to 6E9 gr/cm3.

brightness in the 6.7 keV line demonstrates very good correspondence with the
near-infrared surface brightness over the whole Galaxy, supporting the notion
that the GRXE consists mostly of integrated emission from weak Galactic X-ray

to these uncertainties and leads to a remarkable improvement over the results

creating situations where the wind termination shock arrives very close to the

unusually blue at early epochs (U-B ~ -0.9 about three days after explosion)
which indicates very high continuum temperatures. The spectra show relatively
narrow P-Cygni features, suggesting ejecta velocities lower than observed in
more typical SNe IIP. The earliest spectra show weak absorption features in the

describe also the intensity and angular emission pattern outside the cavity.
This constant flux (CF) basis is dictated by the Green function which arises
when formulating the steady state Maxwell-Bloch equations as a self-consistent
linear response problem. This basis is similar to the quasi-bound state basis
which is familiar in resonator theory and it obeys biorthogonality relations
with a set of dual functions. Within a single-pole approximation for the Green
function the lasing modes are proportional to these CF states and their
intensities and lasing frequencies are determined by a set of non-linear
equations. When a near threshold approximation is made to these equations a
generalized version of the Haken-Sauermann equations for multi-mode lasing is
obtained, appropriate for open cavities. Illustrative results from these
equations are given for single and few mode lasing states, for the case of

polarization is associated with all electron states below the Fermi surface and
produces the original intrinsic spin-Hall current, while the disorder-mediated

two-dimensional semiconductor, the spin-Hall conductivity no longer always
vanishes. Depending on the sample size in the micrometer range, it can be
positive, zero or negative with a maximum absolute value reaching as large as
$e/8\pi$ order of magnitude at low temperatures. As the sample size increases,
the total spin-Hall conductivity oscillates with a decreasing amplitude. We
also discuss the temperature dependence of the spin-Hall conductivity for

the quark still has relatively large dynamical mass, which is generated by
spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking.On the other hand, when the spin

this article, we provide a firm theoretical justification for the absence of

some input from string theory. The LSP may be unstable without the R-parity
and, indeed, some dimension-5 R-parity violating operators may be generated in

contrast to the two-flavor case, we find a positive Delta^6 term and hence an
Omega(Delta) that is bounded from below for all the structures that we analyze.
This means that we are able to evaluate Delta and Omega as a function of the
splitting between Fermi surfaces for all the structures we consider. We find
two structures with particularly robust values of Delta and the condensation
energy, within a factor of two of those for the CFL phase which is known to
characterize QCD at asymptotically large densities. The robustness of these
phases results in their being favored over wide ranges of density. However, it
also implies that the Ginzburg-Landau approximation is not quantitatively
reliable. We develop qualitative insights into what makes a crystal structure
favorable, and use these to winnow the possibilities. The two structures that
we find to be most favorable are both built from condensates with face-centered

structures of increased productivity. Motivated by this scenario, we introduce
a simplified two-dimensional kinematic flow describing the wake of an island in
a stream, and study the conditions under which there is a net transport of
substances across the wake. For small vorticity values in the wake, it acts as
a barrier, but there is a transition when increasing vorticity so that for
values appropriate to the Canary area, it entrains fluid and enhances

depends on both the tumor size and the condition of immune system as well as on

vaccine therapy becomes more effective when used without time delay from a
prescribed date of vaccination after surgery and is ineffective without

tumor remission under vaccine therapy. Our study of successive chemo/immuno,

pencils of lines in the projective plane of order two. In one of the pencils,
which we call the kernel, the observables on two lines share a base of Bell
states. In the complement of the kernel, the eight vertices/observables are
joined by twelve lines which form the edges of a cube. A substantial part of
the paper is devoted to showing that the nature of this geometry has much to do
with the structure of the projective lines defined over the rings that are the
direct product of $n$ copies of the Galois field GF(2), with $n$ = 2, 3 and 4.

  typos","Phys. Rev. A 75, 012308 (2007)","10.1103/PhysRevA.75.012308",,"quant-ph",,"  We study the dynamics of quantum systems under classical and quantum noise,
focusing on decoherence in qubit systems. Classical noise is described by a
random process leading to a stochastic temporal evolution of a closed quantum
system, whereas quantum noise originates from the coupling of the microscopic
quantum system to its macroscopic environment. We derive deterministic master
equations describing the average evolution of the quantum system under
classical continuous-time Markovian noise and two sets of master equations
under quantum noise. Strikingly, these three equations of motion are shown to
be equivalent in the case of classical random telegraph noise and proper
quantum environments. Hence fully quantum-mechanical models within the Born
approximation can be mapped to a quantum system under classical noise.
Furthermore, we apply the derived equations together with pulse optimization
techniques to achieve high-fidelity one-qubit operations under random telegraph
noise, and hence fight decoherence in these systems of great practical
interest.

a microscopic calculation of the recoil of a source atom imbedded in a
dielectric medium. We find that the source atom recoils with the canonical
photon momentum $n\hbar k_{0,}$ where $n$ is the index of refraction and $\hbar
k_{0}$ is the photon momentum calculated at the source atom atomic frequency
$\omega_{0}$. We also show explicitly how the energy is conserved with the
photon inside the medium.

"quant-ph/0605243","Jeffrey Bub","Jeffrey Bub","Quantum computation from a quantum logical perspective","17 pages, no figures. The title has been changed, misprints and minor
  errors have been corrected, and some clarifying remarks have been added",,,,"quant-ph",,"  It is well-known that Shor's factorization algorithm, Simon's period-finding
algorithm, and Deutsch's original XOR algorithm can all be formulated as
solutions to a hidden subgroup problem. Here the salient features of the
information-processing in the three algorithms are presented from a different
perspective, in terms of the way in which the algorithms exploit the
non-Boolean quantum logic represented by the projective geometry of Hilbert
space. From this quantum logical perspective, the XOR algorithm appears
directly as a special case of Simon's algorithm, and all three algorithms can
be seen as exploiting the non-Boolean logic represented by the subspace
structure of Hilbert space in a similar way. Essentially, a global property of
a function (such as a period, or a disjunctive property) is encoded as a
subspace in Hilbert space representing a quantum proposition, which can then be
efficiently distinguished from alternative propositions, corresponding to
alternative global properties, by a measurement (or sequence of measurements)
that identifies the target proposition as the proposition represented by the
subspace containing the final state produced by the algorithm.
