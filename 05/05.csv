atomic processes, in particular with the increase in opacity between 0.7-2 keV

soft excess either through reflection or transmission, and both scenarios can
fit the spectra equally well as long as there is strong velocity shear to smear
out the characteristic narrow atomic features. Here we use orthogonal

to study the effects of galaxy interactions on colours and metallicities. We
find that galaxy-galaxy interactions can produce a bimodal colour distribution
with galaxies with significant recent star formation activity contributing
mainly to blue colours. In the simulations, the colours and the fractions of
recently formed stars of galaxies in pairs depend on environment more strongly
than those of galaxies without a close companion, suggesting that interactions
play an important role in galaxy evolution. If the metallicity of the stellar
populations is used as the chemical indicator, we find that the simulated
galaxies determine luminosity-metallicity and stellar mass-metallicity
relations which do not depend on the presence of a close companion. However, in
the case of the luminosity-metallicity relation, at a given level of
enrichment, we detect a systematic displacement of the relation to brighter
magnitudes for active star forming systems. Regardless of relative distance and
current level of star formation activity, galaxies in pairs have stellar
populations with higher level of enrichment than galaxies without a close
companion. In the case of the gas component, this is no longer valid for
galaxies in pairs with passive star formation which only show an excess of
metals for very close pair members, consequence of an important recent past
star formation activity. (Abridged).

PKS2136+141. Multi-frequency Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) images show a
bending jet making a turn-around of 210 degrees in the plane of the sky, which
is, to our knowledge, the largest ever observed change in the position angle of
an astrophysical jet. Images taken at six different frequencies, from 2.3 to 43
GHz, reveal a spiral-like trajectory, which is likely a sign of an intrinsic
helical geometry. A space-VLBI image, taken with the HALCA satellite at 5 GHz
and having comparable resolution to our ground-based 15 GHz data, confirms that
the bend is a frequency-independent structure. VLBA monitoring data at 15 GHz,
covering eight years of observations, show knots in the jet clearly deviating
from ballistic motion, which suggests that the bending may be caused by a
growing helical Kelvin-Helmholtz normal mode. The jet appearance suggests a
helical wave at a frequency well below the ""resonant"" frequency of the jet,
which indicates that the wave is driven by a periodic perturbation at the base
of the jet. We fit the observed structure in the source with a helical twist,
and we find that a simple isothermal model with a constant wave speed and
wavelength gives a good fit. The measured apparent velocities indicate some
degree of acceleration along the jet, which together with an observed change in
the apparent half-opening angle of the jet allow us to estimate the changes in
the angle between the local jet direction and our line of sight. We suggest
that the jet in PKS2136+141 is distorted by a helical Kelvin-Helmholtz normal
mode externally driven into the jet (e.g. by precession), and that our line of
sight falls within the opening angle of the helix cone.

systems that can harbor potentially habitable, Earth-like planets. We present
results of 460 N-body simulations of terrestrial accretion from a disk of Moon-
to Mars-sized planetary embryos. We systematically vary the orbital semimajor
axis of a Jupiter-mass giant planet between 1.6 and 6 AU, and eccentricity
between 0 and 0.4. We find that for Sun-like stars, giant planets inside
roughly 2.5 AU inhibit the growth of 0.3 Earth-mass planets in the habitable
zone. If planets accrete water from volatile-rich embryos past 2-2.5 AU, then
water-rich habitable planets can only form in systems with giant planets beyond
3.5 AU. Giant planets with significant orbital eccentricities inhibit both
accretion and water delivery. The majority of the current sample of extra-solar

their resonant interactions to drift and can alter the torques exerted between
the planet and the disc. We analyse the time-dependent dynamics of a
non-coorbital corotation resonance under these circumstances. The ratio of the
resonant torque in a steady state to the value given by Goldreich & Tremaine
(1979) depends essentially on two dimensionless quantities: a dimensionless
turbulent diffusion time-scale and a dimensionless radial drift speed. When the
drift speed is comparable to the libration speed and the viscosity is small,
the torque can become much larger than the unsaturated value in the absence of
migration, but is still proportional to the large-scale vortensity gradient in
the disc. Fluid that is trapped in the resonance and drifts with it acquires a
vortensity anomaly relative to its surroundings. If the anomaly is limited by
viscous diffusion in a steady state, the resulting torque is inversely
proportional to the viscosity, although a long time may be required to achieve
this state. A further, viscosity-independent, contribution to the torque comes
from fluid that streams through the resonant region. In other cases, torque
oscillations occur before the steady value is achieved. We discuss the
significance of these results for the evolution of eccentricity in
protoplanetary systems. We also describe the possible application of these
findings to the coorbital region and the concept of runaway (or type III)
migration. [Abridged]

features distinctly associated with the spiral arms, described as spurs or
feathers in optical and IR observations of many spiral galaxies, requires a
sufficiently strong spiral potential in self gravitating models. Unlike
independently-growing ''background'' filaments, the orientation of arm spurs
depends on galactic location. Inside corotation, spurs emanate outward, on the
convex side of the arm; outside corotation, spurs grow inward, on the concave
side of the arm. Based on spacing, orientation, and the relation to arm clumps,
it is possible to distinguish ''true spurs'' that originate as instabilities in

much tighter constraints upon the temperature and geometry of the reprocessing
region than previously possible. A single-zone black body reprocessing model
for this burst suggests a rise in temperatures during the burst from 18,000 to
35,000K and an emitting area comparable to that expected for the disk and/or
irradiated companion star. The lags, a mean of 4.0s and range of 2.5s, are
consistent with those expected within the binary. The single-zone black body
model cannot reproduce the ratio of optical to ultraviolet flux during the
burst, however. The discrepancy, corresponding to underpredicting the optical
by more than a factor of two, seems too large to explain with deviations from a
local black body spectrum and more likely indicates that a range of
reprocessing temperatures are required, as would be expected, with cooler
regions not contributing to the UV. Comparable results are derived from other
bursts, and in particular the lag and smearing both appear shorter when the
companion star is on the near side of the disk as predicted. The burst observed
by HST also yielded a spectrum of the reprocessed light. [Abridged]

account for many time-dependent pulsar phenomena that are otherwise difficult
to explain. Neutral material avoids propeller ejection and injects sufficient
charges -- after heating, evaporation, and ionization -- to alter current flows
and pair-production and thus trigger, detune, or extinguish coherent emission.
Relevant phenomena, with time scales from seconds to months, include nulls,
rotating radio transients (RRATs), rapid changes in pulse profile (``mode
changes''), variable subpulse drift rates, quasi-periodic bursts from B1931+24,
and torque variations. Over the 10 Myr lifetime of a canonical pulsar with
trillion-gauss surface magnetic field, less than a millionth of an Earth mass
of material is needed to modulate the Goldreich-Julian current by 100%.
Circumpulsar material originates from metal-rich, supernova fallback gas that
aggregates into asteroids. Debris disks can inject sufficient material on time
scales of interest, yet be too tenuous to form large planets detectable in
pulse timing data. Asteroid migration results from collisions and the
radiation-driven Yarkovsky and Poynting-Robertson effects. For B1931+24, an
asteroid in a $\sim 40$~day elliptical orbit pollutes the magnetosphere
stochastically through collisions with other debris. Injection is less likely
for hot, young and highly magnetized pulsars or millisecond pulsars that
pre-ionize any debris material well outside their small magnetospheres.
Injection effects will therefore be most prominent in long-period, cooler
pulsars, consistent with the distribution of relevant objects in perid and
period derivative. A pulsar's spin history and its radiation-beam orientation
may influence whether it displays nulling, RRATs and other effects.

and angular velocities. In all models, protostars of simeq 10^-3 Msun are
formed at n simeq 10^22 cm^-3 in accordance with one-dimensional calculations.
By this epoch, the magnetic flux density is amplified by 10 orders of magnitude
from the initial value. Consequently, the formed protostar possesses the
magnetic field of \sim 10^6 G that is much larger than the flux density of the
present counterparts, reflecting the fact that the dissipation of a magnetic
field is ineffective in primordial gas clouds. If the initial magnetic field B
> 10^-9 (n/10^3 cm^-3)^2/3 G, the protostellar jet is launched and its
velocities reaches \sim 70 km s^-1 by the time the protostellar mass becomes
(4-6) times 10^-3 Msun, and a fraction (3-10%) of the accreting matter is blown
off from the central region. Owing to the interaction of these ejecta with
surrounding matter, expanding bow shocks are created at both heads of the jet.
If this jet continues to sweep out the surrounding gas that otherwise accretes
onto the central star or circumstellar disk, the final mass of the first star
can be substantially reduced. In addition, dense post-shock regions behind the
bow shocks are expected to promote the chemical reactions (formation of H_2 and
HD), and this provides possible environments for subsequent low-mass star
formation in the early universe.

luminosity, so called the Baldwin effect, plays an important role in studying
the physics of the broad line region of AGNs. Using the archived ultraviolet
spectra obtained by IUE, HST, and HUT in 1978-2002, we investigated the
intrinsic CIV Baldwin effect of a well-studied Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4151. Both
its continuum flux and CIV emission-line flux varied about two orders of
magnitude in more than two decades, making it one of the best targets for
studying the slope variation of the Baldwin effect. We fitted the CIV line
profile of the 490 archived UV spectra of NGC 4151 with the same model
consisting of a few Gaussian components, and derived the slope in the log-log
plot for the total flux of CIV emission line against the UV continuum flux in
different observation epochs.We found that the slope is not constant for NGC
4151, as it varies from 0.58 in the highest flux epoch to 0.83 in the lowest
flux epoch. The slope evidently decreases as the continuum flux increases,
which reinforces the previous findings of the non-constant slope in the H_beta
Baldwin effect of NGC 5548 and the CIV Baldwin effect of Fairall 9. Our result
suggests that such a non-constant slope may not be unusual for AGNs. Its
physical origin is probably related to the different non-linear responses of
the emission line to the variable ionizing continuum caused by the different
accretion modes at different luminosity levels. We briefly discuss the effects
of various absorption components in the CIV line profile of NGC 4151 and argue
that the slope variation is not driven mainly by the absorption effect.
Intensive, long-term and high resolution spectral observations of strongly
variable AGNs are needed in the future to confirm our result.

This QSO provides the second line of sight with the HeII absorption resolved
into a Ly alpha forest structure. Since HS1700+6416 is slightly less redshifted
(z=2.72) than HE2347-4342, we only probe the post-reionization phase of HeII,
seen in the evolution of the HeII opacity, which is consistent with a simple
power law. The HeII/HI ratio eta is estimated using a line profile-fitting
procedure and an apparent optical depth approach, respectively. The expected
metal line absorption in the far-UV is taken into account as well as molecular
absorption of galactic H_2. About 27% of the eta values are affected by metal
line absorption. In order to investigate the applicability of the analysis
methods, we create simple artificial spectra based on the statistical
properties of the HI Ly alpha forest. The analysis of the artificial data
demonstrates that the apparent optical depth method as well as the line
profile-fitting procedure lead to confident results for restricted data samples
only (12.0 < log N(HI) < 13.0). The reasons are saturation in the case of the
apparent optical depth and thermal line widths in the case of the profile fits.
Furthermore, applying the methods to the unrestricted data set may mimic a
correlation between eta and the strength of the HI absorption. For the
restricted data samples a scatter of 10 - 15% in eta would be expected even if
the underlying value is constant. The observed scatter is significantly larger
than expected, indicating that the intergalactic radiation background is indeed
fluctuating. In the redshift range 2.58 < z < 2.72, where the data quality is
best, we find eta ~ 100, suggesting a contribution of soft sources like
galaxies to the UV background.

concordance LCDM cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. Galaxies (or Dark
Matter particles) are first selected in cylinders of given radius (from 0.5 to
1.5 Mpc/h) and ~200 Mpc/h length. Cluster members are then identified by
applying a suitable interloper removal algorithm.
  Two cluster mass estimators are considered: the virial mass estimator (Mvir),
and a mass estimator (Msigma) based entirely on the cluster velocity dispersion
estimate. Mvir overestimates the true mass by ~10%, and Msigma underestimates
the true mass by ~15%, on average, for sample sizes of > 60 cluster members.
For smaller sample sizes, the bias of the virial mass estimator substantially
increases, while the Msigma estimator becomes essentially unbiased. The
dispersion of both mass estimates increases by a factor ~2 as the number of
cluster members decreases from ~400 to ~20. The bias in the Mvir estimates is
reduced in clusters without significant evidence for subclustering, and when
only early-type galaxies are selected.
  Radially-dependent incompleteness can drastically affect Mvir estimates, but
leaves the Msigma estimates almost unaffected. Other observational effects,
like centering and velocity errors, and different observational apertures, have
little effect on the mass estimates. (Abridged)

boxy remnants which is caused by the suppression of box orbits and the change
of the projected shape of minor-axis tube orbits in the more axisymmetric
remnants. The isophotal shape of 3:1 remnants and the global kinematic
properties of 1:1 and 3:1 remnants are only weakly affected by the presence of
gas. 1:1 remnants are slowly rotating whereas 3:1 remnants are fast rotating
and discy. The shape of the stellar LOSVD is strongly influenced by gas. The
LOSVDs of collisionless remnants have broad leading wings while their gaseous
counterparts show steep leading wings, more consistent with observations of
elliptical galaxies. We show that this change is also caused by the suppressed
populating of box orbits and it is amplified by the formation of extended gas
discs in the merger remnants. If elliptical galaxies have formed from mergers
our results indicate that massive, slowly rotating boxy elliptical galaxies can
not have formed from dissipative mergers of discs. Pure stellar (dry) mergers
are the more likely candidates. On the other hand lower mass, fast rotating and
discy ellipticals can have formed from dissipative (wet) mergers of early-type
discs. So far, only unequal-mass disc mergers with gas can successfully explain

are currently used to estimate the black hole mass of AGNs. Particularly we
demonstrate the importance of two correlations: one between the black hole mass
and the stellar velocity dispersion and another one between the broad line
region (BLR) size and the optical continuum luminosity. Besides applying these
relations in deriving black hole masses of various types of AGNs, we also
employed the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies to estimate the central
velocity dispersions of AGN host galaxies, and then the black hole masses of
AGNs including BL Lac objects. In addition, we derived another empirical
relation between the BLR size and H_beta emission line luminosity from AGNs
with the BLR size measured by reverberation mapping studies, and argued that
more accurate black hole masses of extremely radio-loud AGNs could be obtained
with it than using the usual R-L_{5100\AA} relation because of the jet

to be inconsistent with a perturbative approach. Any tendency to accelerate the

[SIV]/[NeII] ratio < 0.35. We investigate possible origins for this relation

under constant pressure and neglect gravity. We assume that the granular
density is greater than the melting point of the equilibrium phase diagram of
elastic hard spheres. We employ a Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics with constitutive
relations all of which (except the shear viscosity) diverge at the crystal
packing density, while the shear viscosity diverges at a smaller density. The
phase diagram of the steady flow is described by three parameters: an effective
Mach number, a scaled energy loss parameter, and an integer number m: the
number of half-oscillations in a mechanical analogy that appears in this
problem. In a steady shear flow the viscous heating is balanced by energy
dissipation via inelastic collisions. This balance can have different forms,
producing either a uniform shear flow or a variety of more complicated,
nonlinear density, velocity and temperature profiles. In particular, the model
predicts a variety of multi-layer two-phase steady shear flows with sharp
interphase boundaries. Such a flow may include a few zero-shear (solid-like)
layers, each of which moving as a whole, separated by fluid-like regions. As we

flow through the boundaries of the ""solid"" layers. A linear stability analysis

transport processes that may be described by a Master Equation, such as
electron, neutron and photon transport, and more exotic variants thereof. We
base our algorithm on a Markov process on a Voronoi-Delaunay grid, a
nonperiodic lattice which is derived from a random point process that is chosen
to optimally represent certain properties of the medium through which the
transport occurs. Our grid is locally translation and rotation invariant in the
mean. We illustrate our approach by means of a particular example, in which the
expectation value of the length of a grid line corresponds to the local mean
free path. In this example, the lattice is a direct representation of the `free
path space' of the medium. Subsequently, transport is defined as simply moving
particles from one node to the next, interactions taking place at each point.
We derive the statistical properties of such lattices, describe the limiting
behavior, and show how interactions are incorporated as global coefficients.
Two elementary linear transport problems are discussed: that of free ballistic
transport, and the transport of particles through a scattering medium. We also
mention a combination of these two. We discuss the efficiency of our method,
showing that it is much faster than most other methods, because the operation
count does not scale with the number of sources. (ABRIDGED)

information to a destination and each user also has private (confidential)

channel outputs, and hence may obtain the confidential information sent by each
other from channel outputs they receive. However, each user views the other
user as a wire-tapper, and wishes to keep its confidential information as
secret as possible from the other user. The level of secrecy of the
confidential information is measured by the equivocation rate, i.e., the
entropy rate of the confidential information conditioned on channel outputs at
the wire-tapper. The performance measure of interest for the GMAC with
confidential messages is the rate-equivocation tuple that includes the common
rate, two private rates and two equivocation rates as components. The set that
includes all these achievable rate-equivocation tuples is referred to as the
capacity-equivocation region. The GMAC with one confidential message set is
first studied, where only one user (user 1) has private (confidential)
information for the destination. Inner and outer bounds on the
capacity-equivocation region are derived, and the capacity-equivocation are
established for some classes of channels including the Gaussian GMAC.
Furthermore, the secrecy capacity region is established, which is the set of
all achievable rates with user 2 being perfectly ignorant of confidential
messages of user 1. For the GMAC with two confidential message sets, where both
users have confidential messages for the destination, an inner bound on the

the observed experimental features, with a surprisingly high accuracy. This
points in the direction of a universal behavior of users, who - despite the
complexity of their own cognitive processes and the uncoordinated and selfish

channels to support user cooperation. In the first channel, the Partially

relay and transmit to the other user through a relay link. An achievable rate
region is derived based on the relay using the decode-and-forward scheme. An
outer bound on the capacity region is derived and is shown to be tighter than
the cut-set bound. For the special case where the Partially Cooperative RBC is
degraded, the achievable rate region is shown to be tight and provides the
capacity region. Gaussian Partially Cooperative RBCs and Partially Cooperative
RBCs with feedback are further studied. In the second channel model being
studied in the paper, the Fully Cooperative Relay Broadcast Channel, both users
can act as relay nodes and transmit to each other through relay links. This is
a more general model than the Partially Cooperative RBC. All the results for
Partially Cooperative RBCs are correspondingly generalized to the Fully

larger achievable rate region than the AWGN Partially Cooperative RBC. The
results illustrate that relaying and user cooperation are powerful techniques

that the oblique $T$ parameter is within the allowed range indicating that the

moreover they fall in the 70-plet, as expected in constituent quark models for

cut-off signal at $M > 2*500$ GeV in the di-jet-correlation function by
detecting the subsequent, Hawking-decay products of the LXD-BHs, namely either
multiple high energy ($> 100$ GeV) SM Mono-Jets (i.e. away-side jet missing),
sprayed off the evaporating BHs isentropically into all directions or the
thermalization of the multiple overlapping Hawking-radiation in a
Heckler-Kapusta-Plasma. Microcanonical quantum statistical calculations of the
Hawking evaporation process for these LXD-BHs show that cold black hole
remnants (BHRs) of Mass $\sim M_f$ remain leftover as the ashes of these
spectacular Di-Jet-suppressed events. Strong Di-Jet suppression is also
expected with Heavy Ion beams at the LHC, due to Quark-Gluon-Plasma induced jet
attenuation at medium to low jet energies, $p_t < 200$ GeV. The (Mono-)Jets in
these events can be used to trigger for Tsunami-emission of secondary
compressed QCD-matter at well defined Mach-angles, both at the trigger side and
at the awayside (missing) jet. The Machshock-angles allow for a direct

Hawking evaporation discovered recently by Horowitz. Catalyzed vacuum bubble

Schwarzschild black holes for which massive particles produced in the Hawking

work is that it combines geometrization of electromagnetic field and
geometrization of material field within the unique topological idea. According
to the suggested topological interpretation, the Dirac equations for a free
particle and for a hydrogen atom prove to be the group--theoretical relations
that account for the symmetry properties of localized microscopic deviations of
the space--time geometry from the pseudoeuclidean one (closed topological
4-manifolds). These equations happen to be written in universal covering spaces
of the above manifolds. It is shown that ""long derivatives"" in Dirac equation

the Weyl noneuclidean 4-space and that electromagnetic potentials can be
considered as connectivities in this space. The gauge invariance of
electromagnetic field proves to be a natural consequence of the basic
principles of the proposed geometrical interpretation. Within the suggested

relationship to the family of Renyi's $\alpha$-entropies. Question of selecting
the value of $\alpha$ most appropriate for the purpose of measuring Ess is

  The conjecture is known to be true for p = 1 (I) and for p \ge 2 (J).
  We prove the conjecture for a subinterval of (1,2), and show the conjectured
upper bound to be true within a subexponential factor (in the dimension) for
all 1 < p < 2. In fact, for p bounded away from 1, the conjectured upper bound
is true within a constant factor.
  This leads to a mild (subexponential) improvement in deterministic

its simplest periodic orbits (SPOs). In particular, we show that there is a
relatively high $q$ mode $(q=2(N+1)/{3})$ of the linear lattice, having one
particle fixed every two oppositely moving ones (called SPO2 here), which can
be exactly continued to the nonlinear case for $N=5+3m, m=0,1,2,...$ and whose
first destabilization, $E_{2u}$, as the energy (or $\beta$) increases for {\it
any} fixed $N$, practically {\it coincides} with the onset of a ``weak'' form
of chaos preceding the break down of FPU recurrences, as predicted recently in
a similar study of the continuation of a very low ($q=3$) mode of the
corresponding linear chain. This energy threshold per particle behaves like
$\frac{E_{2u}}{N}\propto N^{-2}$. We also follow exactly the properties of
another SPO (with $q=(N+1)/{2}$) in which fixed and moving particles are
interchanged (called SPO1 here) and which destabilizes at higher energies than
SPO2, since $\frac{E_{1u}}{N}\propto N^{-1}$. We find that, immediately after
their first destabilization, these SPOs have different (positive) Lyapunov
spectra in their vicinity. However, as the energy increases further (at fixed
$N$), these spectra converge to {\it the same} exponentially decreasing
function, thus providing strong evidence that the chaotic regions around SPO1
and SPO2 have ``merged'' and large scale chaos has spread throughout the
lattice.

Given the relative success of some physical few-discs modeling of this system
all the simulations were implemented in small systems. The temperature T was
used as a tunning parameter. It plays the role of external perturbations. Power
laws were obtained for the distribution of times between reversals. When the
system size was increased the exponent of the power law asymptotically tended
towards values very near -1.5, generally accepted as the right value for this

different. Atom interferometry has already been used for a large variety of
studies: measurements of atomic properties and of inertial effects
(accelerations and rotations), new access to some fundamental constants,
observation of quantum decoherence, etc. We review the techniques used for a
coherent manipulation of atomic waves and the main applications of atom
interferometers.

biorthogonal eigenfunctions $\phi_\lambda$ and define the value $r_\lambda =
(\phi_\lambda|\phi_\lambda)/<\phi_\lambda|\phi_\lambda>$ that characterizes the
phase rigidity of the eigenfunctions $\phi_\lambda$. In the scenario with
avoided level crossings, $r_\lambda$ varies between 1 and 0 due to the mutual
influence of neighboring resonances. The variation of $r_\lambda$ may be
considered as an internal property of an {\it open} quantum system. In the
literature, the phase rigidity $\rho$ of the scattering wave function
$\Psi^E_C$ is considered. Since $\Psi^E_C$ can be represented in the interior
of the system by the $\phi_\lambda$, the phase rigidity $\rho$ of the
$\Psi^E_C$ is related to the $r_\lambda$ and therefore also to the mutual
influence of neighboring resonances. As a consequence, the reduction of the
phase rigidity $\rho$ to values smaller than 1 should be considered, at least
partly, as an internal property of an open quantum system in the overlapping
regime. The relation to measurable values such as the transmission through a
quantum dot, follows from the fact that the transmission is, in any case,
resonant with respect to the effective Hamiltonian. We illustrate the relation
between phase rigidity $\rho$ and transmission numerically for small open
cavities.

A 73, 062301 (2006)","10.1103/PhysRevA.73.062301",,"quant-ph",,"  A necessary and sufficient condition is given for general exact remote state
preparation (RSP) protocols to be oblivious, that is, no information about the
target state can be retrieved from the classical message. A novel criterion in
terms of commutation relations is also derived for the existence of
deterministic exact protocols in which Alice's measurement eigenstates are
related to each other by fixed linear operators similar to Bob's unitaries. For
non-maximally entangled resources, it provides an easy way to search for RSP
protocols. As an example, we show how to reduce the case of partially entangled
resources to that of maximally entangled ones, and we construct RSP protocols
exploiting the structure of the irreducible representations of Abelian groups.
