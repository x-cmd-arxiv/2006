of these models of inflation, which arise in the Gauss-Bonnet braneworld
scenario: Gauss-Bonnet (GB), Randall-Sundrum (RS), and 4D general relativity
(GR). We consider the large-field potential $V \propto \phi^p$ in both
commutative and noncommutative spacetimes, and find that in the cases of the GB
and GR patch cosmologies, the quadratic potential is observationally favored,
while the quartic potential is ruled out in most patches. Strong noncommutative
inflation is excluded in all cases because it leads to a blue-tilted scalar
spectral index.

torus around the central engine. The compact sizes (only a few pc) determined
in recent high-resolution observations require that the obscuring matter be
clumpy and located inside the region where the black-hole gravity dominates
over the galactic bulge. This location is in line with the scenario depicting
the torus as the region of the clumpy wind coming off the accretion disk in
which the clouds are dusty and optically thick. We study here the outflow
scenario within the framework of hydromagnetic disk winds, incorporating the
cloud properties determined from detailed modeling of the IR emission from
clumpy tori. We find that torus clouds were likely detected in recent water
maser observations of NGC 3079. In the wind scenario, the AGN main dynamic
channel for release of accreted mass seems to be switching at low luminosities
from torus outflow to radio jets. The torus disappears when the bolometric
luminosity decreases below about \E{42} erg/sec because the accretion onto the
central black hole can no longer sustain the required cloud outflow rate. This
disappearance seems to have been observed in both LINERs and radio galaxies.
With further luminosity decrease, suppression of cloud outflow spreads radially
inward from the disk's dusty, molecular region into its atomic, ionized zone,
resulting in disappearance of the broad emission line region at lower
luminosities, yet to be determined.

other features which suggest that their immediate dynamical environment is
neither static nor in equilibrium. In Cold Dark Matter (CDM) theories, such
non-equilibrium features are expected in the inner regions of many dark haloes
as a result of recent hierarchical growth. We used the excellent statistics
provided by the very large Millennium Simulation to study (i) how the
distribution of position and velocity asymmetries predicted for halo cores by
the concordance LCDM cosmogony depends on halo mass, and (ii) how much of the
dark matter in the inner core has been added at relatively recent times.
Asymmetries are typically larger in more massive haloes. Thus 20% of cluster
halos have density centre separated from barycentre by more than 20% of the
virial radius, while only 7% of Milky Way halos have such large asymmetries.
About 40% of all cluster halos have a mean core velocity which differs from the
barycentre velocity by more than a quarter of the characteristic halo circular
velocity, whereas only 10% of Milky Way halos have such large velocity offsets.
About 25% of all cluster haloes have acquired more than a quarter of the mass
currently in their inner 10kpc through mergers since z=1. The corresponding
percentage of Milky Way haloes is 15%. These numbers seem quite compatible with
the levels of asymmetry seen in the observable regions of galaxies, but
quantitative comparison requires more detailed modelling of the observable
components.

ballistic one-dimensional conductors. Similarly, thermal conductance at
temperature $T$ is expected to be limited by the quantum of thermal conductance
of one mode, $G_{\rm Q} = \frac{\pi k_{\rm B}^2}{6\hbar}T$, when physical
dimensions are small in comparison to characteristic wavelength of the
carriers. The relation between $\sigma_{\rm Q}$ and $G_{\rm Q}$ obeys the
Wiedemann-Franz law for ballistic electrons (apart from factor 2 in
$\sigma_{\rm Q}$ due to spin degeneracy), but somewhat amazingly the same
expression of $G_{\rm Q}$ is expected to hold also for phonons and photons, or
any other particles with arbitrary exclusion statistics. The single-mode heat
conductance is particularly relevant in nano-structures, e.g., when studying
heat conduction by phonons in dielectric materials, or cooling of electrons in
metals at very low temperatures. Here we show, based on our experimental
results, that at low temperatures heat is transferred by photon radiation, in
our case along a superconducting line, when electron-phonon as well as normal
electronic heat conduction are frozen out. Thermal conductance is limited by
$G_{\rm Q}$, approaching this value towards low temperatures. Our observation
has implications on, e.g., performance and design of ultra-sensitive bolometers
and electronic micro-refrigerators, whose operation is largely dependent on
weak thermal coupling between the device and its environment.

  of references. Editorial and spelling corrections; more acknowledgements",,,,"math.CO math.RA",,"  The Tutte equations are ported (or set-pointed) when the equations F(N) = g_e
F(N/e) + r_e F(N\e) are omitted for elements e in a distinguished set called
ports. Solutions F can distinguish different orientations of the same matroid.
A ported extensor with ground set is a decomposible element in the exterior
algebra over a vector space with a given basis, called the ground set,
containing a distinguished subset called ports. These can represent ported
matroids and have analogous dualization, deletion and contraction operations. A
ported extensor function is defined using dualization, port element renaming,
exterior multiplication, and contraction of non-ports. We prove that this
function satisfies a sign-corrected variant of the Tutte equations over
exterior algebra. For non-ported unimodular, i.e., regular matroids, our
function reduces to the basis generating function and for graphs the Laplacian
(or Kirchhoff) determinant. In general, the function value, as an extensor,
signifies the space of solutions to Kirchhoff's and Ohm's electricity equations
after projection to the variables associated to the ports. Combinatorial
interpretation of various determinants (the Plucker coordinates) generalize the
matrix tree theorem and forest enumeration expressions for electrical
resistance. The corank-nullity polynomial, basis expansions with activities,
and a geometric lattice expansion generalize to ported Tutte functions of
oriented matroids. The ported Tutte functions are parametrized, which raises
the problem of how to generalize known characterizations of parameterized
non-ported Tutte functions.

operator. We addressed synchronization problem of an array of the linearly
coupled map lattices of identical discrete time systems.
  The synchronization rate is determined by the second largest eigenvalue of
the transition probability matrix. Algebraic properties of the Bose-Mesner
algebra with an associated scheme with definite spectrum has been used in order
to study the stability of the coupled map lattice. Associated schemes play a
key role and may lead to analytical methods in studying the stability of the
dynamical systems. The relation between the coupling parameters and the chaotic
region is presented. It is shown that the feasible region is analytically
determined by the number of couplings (i.e, by increasing the number of coupled
maps the feasible region is restricted). It is very easy to apply our criteria
to the system being studied and they encompass a wide range of coupling schemes
including most of the popularly used ones in the literature.

of information coded by the ""binding sequences"" within the promoter regions is
provided as input. The length distribution for the promoter regions is fixed by
comparing the k-core analysis of the model network with that of yeast. Our
results strongly point to the possibility that the observed topological
features are generic to networks formed via sequence-matching between random
strings obeying certain length distributions.
