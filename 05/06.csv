be seen when infall motion dominates over rotational motion. Further evidence
for infalling gas is found in the HCO+ blue asymmetric line profiles and red
asymmetric opacity profiles. We also performed CO J=3->2 and J=1->0

than 250 h of observation and almost 16,000 data points. For LQ Peg WHT
spectroscopic data have been analysed as well.
  The light curves show a wide range of variability on different time scales
from minutes to months. We detect for the first time a brightness variation of
0.05 mag in amplitude in V1193 Ori on the same timescale as the orbital period,
which we interpret as the result of the irradiation of the secondary. A 20-min
quasi-periodic oscillation is also detected. The mean brightness of the system
has changed by 0.5 mag on a three-month interval, while the flickering was
halved. In LQ Peg a 0.05 mag modulation was revealed with a period of about 3
h. The flickering was much smaller, of the order of 0.025 mag. A possible
quasi-periodic oscillation could exist near 30 min. For this object, the WHT
spectra are single-peaked and do not show any radial-velocity variations. The
data of LD 317 show a decrease in the mean magnitude of the system. No periodic
signal was detected but this is certainly attributable to the very large
flickering observed: between 0.07 and 0.1 mag. For V795 Her, the 2.8-hour
modulation, thought to be a superhump arising from the precession of the disc,
is present. We show that this modulation is not stable in terms of periodicity,
amplitude, and phase. Finally, for MCT 2347-3144, a clear modulation is seen in
a first dataset obtained in October 2002. This modulation is absent in August
2003, when the system was brighter and showed much more flickering.

nebulosity to be from an infrared light echo caused by reprocessed thermal
emission from dust heated by the outward-propagating radiation from the 2002
eruption. The detection of an IR light echo provides an opportunity to estimate
the mass in dust of the echo material and hence constrain its origin. We
estimate the dust mass of the light echo to be on the order of a solar mass -
thereby implying the total gas plus dust mass to be considerably more - too
massive for the echo material to be the ejecta from previous
outburst/mass-losing events. This is therefore suggestive that a significant
fraction of the matter seen through the light echo is interstellar in origin.
Unresolved emission at 24 and 70um is also seen at the position of the central
star possibly indicating the presence of hot dust freshly condensed in the
outburst ejecta.

systematically more metal-poor with increasing radius, shifting from <[Fe/H]> =

(defined as the structural components with R^{-2} power law and de Vaucouleurs

a radiative transfer model. The observed UV colours of nearby galaxies show a
reddening relative to their expected intrinsic colours. Some authors argued
that the Milky Way dust cannot reproduce the reddening because of the prominent
2175 \AA absorption bump. Other authors proposed a reduction mechanism of the
bump strength in an {\it attenuation law} derived from the ratio of the
observed intensity to the intrinsic one through an age-selective attenuation
(i.e., young stars are more attenuated selectively). We newly find that the
wavelength dependence of the scattering albedo also has a strong effect on the
UV colour; an albedo decreasing toward shorter wavelengths (except for the
absorption bump range) produces a significant UV reddening. After comparing the
observed UV colours of nearby normal galaxies with those expected from
radiative transfer simulations assumed several dust models, we find two sorts
of dust suitable for these galaxies: (1) dust with a bump and a smaller albedo
for a shorter wavelength (except for the bump range), and (2) dust without any
bump but with an almost constant albedo. If very small carbonaceous grains

relative weakness, or their significant line widths arising from
predissociation, minimizes potential problems from large optical depths at line
center in absorption measurements. Predissociating line widths could generally
be extracted from the spectra thanks to the profile simulations used in the
analysis. In many cases, these simulations allowed us to consider e and f

delta from measurements of four independant |V_{ij}|^2, or three of them and a
ratio, in the leptonic sector. To quantify our approach, using unitarity, we
derive simple expressions in terms of four independant |V_{ij}|^2 for
cos(delta) and an expression for sin^2(delta) from J^2. Thus, depending on the
values of |V_{ij}| and their accuracy, we can set meaningful limits on |delta|.
To illustrate numerically, if |V_{u1}|^2 is close to 0.1 with a 10% precision,
and if |V_{e3}^2 is larger than 0.005 and for values of |V_{e2}|^2 and
|V_{u3}|^2 that stay within +-0.1 of the current experimental data leads to a
bound pi/2 < |delta| < pi. Alternatively, a certain combination of parameters
with values of |V_{e3}|^2 larger than 0.01 leads to a closed bound of 73 <
|delta| < 103. In general, we find that it is better to use |V_{u1}|^2 or
|V_{t1}|^2 as the fourth independant |V_{ij}|^2 and that over most of the
parameter space, delta is least sensitive to |V_{e3}|^2. With just three
independant measurements (solar, atmospheric and reactor) it is impossible to
set limits on the CP phase. In this respect, we study the use of ultra high
energy cosmic (UHCR) neutrino fluxes as the additional fourth information. We
find that within the SM, neutrino fluxes of all three flavours will be very
similar but that pushing current neutrino data to their extreme values still
allowed, ratios of cosmic neutrino fluxes can differ by up to 20%; such large
discrepancies could imply negligibly small CP-violation. We also study a non
radiative neutrino decay model and find that the neutrino fluxes can differ by
a factor of up to 3 within this model and that an accuracy of 10% on the
neutrino fluxes is sufficient to set interestin limits on delta.

last few years, generated a lot of interest in the so-called tribimaximal type.
This form may be naturally associated with the possibility of a discrete
permutation symmetry ($S_3$) among the three generations. However, trying to
implement this attractive symmetry has resulted in some problems and it seems
to have fallen out of favor. We suggest an approach in which the $S_3$ holds to
first approximation, somewhat in the manner of the old SU(3) flavor symmetry of
the three flavor quark model. It is shown that in the case of the neutrino
sector, a presently large experimentally allowed region can be fairly well
described in this first approximation.
  We briefly discuss the nature of the perturbations which are the analogs of
the Gell-Mann Okubo perturbations but confine our attention for the most part
to the $S_3$ invariant model. We postulate that the $S_3$ invariant mass
spectrum consists of non zero masses for the $(\tau,b,t)$ and zero masses for
the other charged fermions but approximately degenerate masses for the three
neutrinos. The mixing matrices are assumed to be trivial for the charged
fermions but of tribimaximal type for the neutrinos in the first approximation.
It is shown that this can be implemented by allowing complex entries for the
mass matrix and spontaneous breakdown of the $S_3$ invariance of the
Lagrangian.

energy correction to the unextended dilaton theories that can affect the

extended dilaton models with the purpose of showing that they predict a
noncommutativity in curved space-time, which is locally described by a Moyal
star product in the low energy limit. We also conjecture a probable
generalization of this result, which provides a strong evidence that the
noncommutativity is described by a certain star product which is not of the

B-35. Such new type stratified target was mounted on goniometer head inside the
betatron toroid. The target is consisted of the W-C-W layers placed on Si
substrate. The photographs of the angular distributions of the radiation
generated in the target by 20-33 MeV electrons have shown the waveguide effect
of the three-layer structure on x-rays generated in the target. The effect
proved in an angular distribution of radiation as an additional narrow peak of
guided x-rays intensity inside a wide cone of usual Bremsstrahlung.

for non-zero detuning of the Raman transitions. New physical phenomena are
encountered, including cooling to non-zero velocities, combinations of Sisyphus

policy involving both topological and geographical measures. In this model, at
each time step, a new node, having randomly assigned coordinates in a $1 \times
1$ square, is added and connected to a previously existing node $i$, which
minimizes the quantity $r_i^2/k_i^\alpha$, where $r_i$ is the geographical
distance, $k_i$ the degree, and $\alpha$ a free parameter. The degree
distribution obeys a power-law form when $\alpha=1$, and an exponential form
when $\alpha=0$. When $\alpha$ is in the interval $(0,1)$, the network exhibits
a stretched exponential distribution. We prove that the average topological
distance increases in a logarithmic scale of the network size, indicating the
existence of the small-world property. Furthermore, we obtain the geographical
edge-length distribution, the total geographical length of all edges, and the
average geographical distance of the whole network. Interestingly, we found
that the total edge-length will sharply increase when $\alpha$ exceeds the
critical value $\alpha_c=1$, and the average geographical distance has an upper
bound independent of the network size. All the results are obtained
analytically with some reasonable approximations, which are well verified by
simulations.

(LHM) disk is exploited to superimpose a source of electromagnetic radiation
onto its mirror image, formed as a result of reflection from a perfect electric
conductor (PEC) or a perfect magnetic conductor (PMC). The superposition of a
vertical wire-dipole antenna with its PEC-image results in an increase of the
radiation resistance of the antenna compared to that of an antenna emitting in
free space. On the other hand, if the same antenna is coupled to a PMC-image it
is shown that the result is the formation of a non-radiating configuration. The
finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) analysis is performed and this allows a
detailed characterization of the systems. It is shown that the non-radiating
system allows relatively large amounts of electromagnetic energy to be stored
in the LHM-disk and that is indicative of strong electromagnetic fields inside
the material. This property is employed in a second-harmonic generation (SHG)
process and the potential of a non-radiating configuration as an efficient
nonlinear device is demonstrated.

so that numerical tests are necessary to deal with the limiting situations of

of basis functions is presented to describe the scattering of light by
spherical particles (Mie scattering) in the Chandrasekhar-Sekera
representation. These basis functions can be implemented in a new algorithm to
calculate the Mie scattering amplitudes, which leads straightforwardly to all
the scattering quantities. In contrast to the traditional implementation, this
set of basis functions implies to natural numerical convergence to the above
mentioned limiting cases, which are thoroughly discussed.

similarly, but a cusp correction at the nucleus requires generalizing the
