observation at early epochs, is very successful in describing the structure of
the evolved universe on large and intermediate scales. Unfortunately, serious
contradictions remain on smaller, galactic scales. Among the major small-scale
problems is a significant and persistent discrepancy between observations of
nearby galaxies, which imply that galactic dark matter (DM) haloes have a
density profile with a flat core, and the cosmological model, which predicts
that the haloes should have divergent density (a cusp) at the centre. Here we
use numerical N-body simulations to show that random bulk motions of gas in
small primordial galaxies, of the magnitude expected in these systems, result
in a flattening of the central DM cusp on short timescales (of order 10^8
years). Gas bulk motions in early galaxies are driven by supernova explosions
which result from ongoing star formation. Our mechanism is general and would
have operated in all star-forming galaxies at redshifts z>~ 10. Once removed,
the cusp cannot be reintroduced during the subsequent mergers involved in the
build-up of larger galaxies. As a consequence, in the present universe both
small and large galaxies would have flat DM core density profiles, in agreement
with observations.

the Lyman-$\alpha$ intensity field associated with first luminous sources that

shows explicitly that recoil sources an absorption feature, whose magnitude
increases with the relative importance of recoil compared to Doppler
broadening. This spectrum depends on the Lyman-alpha line profile, but
approximating it with the absorption profile appropriate to the Lorentzian
wings of natural broadening accurately reproduces the results for a full Voigt
profile so long as T<1000 K in the IGM. This approximation allows us to obtain
simple analytic formulae for the total scattering rate of Lyman-alpha photons
and the accompanying energy exchange rate. Our power series solutions converge
rapidly for photons that redshift into the Lyman-alpha resonance as well as for
photons injected at line center. We confirm previous calculations showing that
heating through this mechanism is quite slow and probably negligible compared
to other sources. We then show that energy exchange during the scattering of
higher-order Lyman-series photons can be much more important than naively
predicted by recoil arguments. However, the resulting heating is still
completely negligible.

apertures. The magnitude of the dissipative phase slips shows that they occur
simultaneously in all the apertures when the temperature is around 10 mK below
the superfluid transition, and subsequently lose their simultaneity as the
temperature is lowered. We find that when periodic synchronous phase slippage
occurs, the synchronicity exists from the very first phase slip, and therefore
is not due to mode locking of interacting oscillators. When the system is
allowed to relax freely from a given initial energy, the total number of phase
slips that occur and the energy left in the system after the last phase slip
depends reproducibly on the initial energy. We find the energy remaining after
the final phase slip is a periodic function of the initial system energy. This
dependence directly reveals the discrete and dissipative nature of the phase
slips and is a powerful diagnostic for investigation of synchronicity in the
array. When the array slips synchronously, this periodic energy function is a
sharp sawtooth. As the temperature is lowered and the degree of synchronicity
drops, the peak of this sawtooth becomes rounded, suggesting a broadening of
the time interval over which the array slips. The underlying mechanism for the
higher temperature synchronous behavior and the following loss of synchronicity
at lower temperatures is not yet understood. We discuss the implications of our
measurements and pose several questions that need to be resolved by a theory
explaining the synchronous behavior in this quantum system. An understanding of
the array phase slip process is essential to the optimization of superfluid

mechanics is discussed in the broader context of formal dynamical systems,
including computer programmes. In this context classical thermodynamics appears
as a particular theory suited to a subset of all dynamical systems. A
statistical mechanics similar to the one derived with the microcanonical
ensemble emerges from dynamical systems provided it contains, 1) a finite
non-integrable part of its phase space which is, 2) ergodic at a satisfactory
degree after a finite time. The integrable part of phase space provides the
constraints that shape the particular system macroscopical properties, and the
chaotic part provides well behaved statistical properties over a relevant
finite time. More generic semi-ergodic systems lead to intermittent behaviour,
thus may be unsuited for a statistical description of steady states. Following
these lines of thought, in a second part non-extensive hierarchical systems
with statistical scale-invariance and power law interactions are explored. Only
the virial constraint, consistent with their microdynamics, is included. No
assumptions of classical thermodynamics are used, in particular extensivity and
local homogeneity. In the limit of a large hierarchical range new constraints
emerge in some conditions that depend on the interaction law range. In
particular for the gravitational case, a velocity-site scaling relation is
derived which is consistant with the ones empirically observed in the fractal
interstellar medium.

Several properties of these ferromagnets can be evaluated analytically in the
SU(4) symmetric limit, including the full collective mode spectrum at integer
fillings. By constructing explicit wave functions we show that the lowest
energy skyrmion states carry charge $\pm 1$ for {\em any} integer filling, and
that skyrmions are the lowest energy charged excitations for graphene Landau

show that the tricritical point emerges as an endpoint of the first-order

box-counting method, called the node-covering method, to quantify the
self-similar properties of 43 cellular networks: the minimal number $N_V$ of
boxes of size $\ell$ needed to cover all the nodes of a cellular network was
found to scale as the power law $N_V \sim (\ell+1)^{-D_V}$ with a fractal
dimension $D_V=3.53\pm0.26$. We propose a new box-counting method based on
edge-covering, which outperforms the node-covering approach when applied to
strictly self-similar model networks, such as the Sierpinski network. The
minimal number $N_E$ of boxes of size $\ell$ in the edge-covering method is
obtained with the simulated annealing algorithm. We take into account the
possible discrete scale symmetry of networks (artifactual and/or real), which
is visualized in terms of log-periodic oscillations in the dependence of the
logarithm of $N_E$ as a function of the logarithm of $\ell$. In this way, we
are able to remove the bias of the estimator of the fractal dimension, existing
for finite networks. With this new methodology, we find that $N_E$ scales with
respect to $\ell$ as a power law $N_E \sim \ell^{-D_E}$ with $D_E=2.67\pm0.15$
for the 43 cellular networks previously analyzed by Song, Havlin and Makse
(2005). Bootstrap tests suggest that the analyzed cellular networks may have a
significant log-periodicity qualifying a discrete hierarchy with a scaling
ratio close to 2. In sum, we propose that our method of edge-covering with
simulated annealing and log-periodic sampling minimizes the significant bias in
the determination of fractal dimensions in log-log regressions.

this process is not observable in realistic seesaw models for neutrino masses.

circumvented leading to an enhanced and observable rate for $N-\bar{N}$

r_3, r_4) \in R^4 such that r_1 + r_2 = r_3 + r_4 is at least |R|^{2+\epsilon},
\epsilon>0. This statement shows that the set R is highly structured. We also
discuss some of the generalizations and applications of our result.

Strongly collective $K^{\pi}=0^{+}$ and $2^{+}$ excitation modes carrying 10-20
Weisskopf units in the intrinsic isoscalar quadrupole transition strengths are
obtained at about 3 MeV. There are two reasons for the enhancement of the
transition strengths. First, the quasiparticle wave functions generating these
modes possess spatially very extended structure. The asymptotic selection rules
characterizing the $\beta$ and $\gamma$ vibrations in stable deformed nuclei
are thus strongly violated. Second, the dynamic pairing effects act strongly to
enhance the collectivity of these modes. It is suggested that the lowest

incident in the substratum, the response in the substratum is a single
specularly-reflected body wave. When the stress-free condition, equivalent to
vanishing surface impedance, is relaxed by the introduction of a {spatially-
constant, non- vanishing surface impedance}, the response in the substratum is
again a single reflected body wave whose amplitude is less than the one in the
situation of a stress-free ground. When the stress-free condition is relaxed by
the introduction of a a {spatially-modulated surface impedance}, which

one or several surface wave amplitudes can become large. It is shown, that at

impedance is either constant or vanishes. Also, when the solicitation is

be considerably longer, for a spatially-modulated impedance surface than for a

phenotype, organism life expectancy, is directly related to genotype i.e. the
stability of its proteins which can be determined exactly in the model.
Simulating the model on a computer, we consistently observe the Big Bang
scenario whereby exponential population growth ensues as favorable
sequence-structure combinations (precursors of stable proteins) are discovered.
After that, random diversity of the structural space abruptly collapses into a
small set of preferred structural motifs. We observe that protein folds remain
stable and abundant in the population at time scales much greater than mutation
or organism lifetime, and the distribution of the lifetimes of dominant folds
in a population approximately follows a power law. The separation of
evolutionary time scales between discovery of new folds and generation of new
sequences gives rise to emergence of protein families and superfamilies whose
sizes are power-law distributed, closely matching the same distributions for
real proteins. The network of structural similarities of the universe of
evolved proteins has the same scale-free like character as the actual protein
domain universe graph (PDUG). Further, the model predicts that ancient protein
domains represent a highly connected and clustered subset of all protein
domains, in complete agreement with reality. Together, these results provide a
microscopic first principles picture of how protein structures and gene
families evolved in the course of evolution.
