the CFHT Legacy Survey Deep. This work aims at building a mass-selected sample
of clusters. METHODS: We use the deep i' band images to perform weak lensing
mass reconstructions and to identify high convergence peaks. Thanks to the
availability of deep ugriz exposures, sources are selected from their
photometric redshifts. We also use lensing tomography to derive an estimate of
the lens redshift. After considering the raw statistics of peaks we check
whether they can be associated to a clear optical counterpart or to published
X-ray selected clusters. RESULTS: Among the 14 peaks found above a
signal-to-noise detection threshold nu=3.5, eight are secure detections with
estimated redshift 0.15<zl<0.6 and a velocity dispersion 450<sigma\_v<600 km/s.
This low mass range is accessible thanks to the high density of background
sources. We also use photometric redshifts of sources to test the effect of
contamination by source-lens clustering for clusters detection. This latter
turns out to play a minor role in our cluster sample. We study the intersection
between the shear-selected clusters and XMM/LSS X-ray clusters in the D1 field.

with longer timescales of their formation and lower star formation (SF)

to form populations of young/ intermediate-age massive star clusters (MSCs)
with masses exceeding 10^4 Msol. Their formation is widely believed to be
accidental process fully depending on external factors. From analysis of data
available on the populations and their hosts, including populous star clusters
in the LMC, we find that their most probable mean metallicities fall within
-0.7<=[Fe/H]<=-0.3, as the peak metallicities of MRGCs do, irrespective of
sings of interaction. Moreover, both the disk giant metallicity distribution
function (MDF) in the LMC and the MDFs for old giants in the halos of massive
spheroids exhibit significant increasing toward [Fe/H]~-0.5. That is in
agreement with a correlation found between SF activity in galaxies and their
metallicity. The formation of both the old MRGCs in spheroids and MSC
populations in irregulars probably occurs approximately at the same stage of
the host galaxies' chemical evolution and is related to the essentially
increased SF activity in the hosts around the same metallicity that is achieved
very soon in massive spheroids, later in lower-mass spheroids, and much more
later in irregulars. (Abridged)

assuming that a very simple estimator of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)

function estimation. The simple estimator used is the peak of the smoothed
correlation function, which provides a variance in the BAO scale that is close
to optimal, if appropriate low-pass filtering is applied to the density field.
While maximum-likelihood estimators can eliminate biases if the form of the
systematic error is fully modeled, we estimate the potential effects of un- or
mis-modelled systematic errors. Non-linear structure growth using the Smith et
al. (2003) prescription biases the acoustic scale by <0.3% at z>1 under the
correlation-function estimator. The biases due to representative but simplistic
models of scale-dependent galaxy bias are below 1% at z>1 for bias behaviour in
the realms suggested by halo model calculations, which is expected to be below
statistical errors for a 1000 sq.degs. spectroscopic survey. The distance bias
due to a survey window function errors is given in a simple closed form and it
is shown it has to be kept below 2% not to bias acoustic scale more than 1% at
z=1, although the actual tolerance can be larger depending upon galaxy bias.
These biases are comparable to statistical errors for ambitious surveys if no
correction is made for them. We show that RMS photometric zero-point errors (at
limiting magnitude 25 mag) below 0.14 mag and 0.01 mag for redshift z=1 (red
galaxies) and z=3 (Lyman-break galaxies), respectively, are required in order

redshifts, one can obtain the differential ages, the derivative of redshift $z$
with respect to the cosmic time $t$ (i.e. ${\rm d} z/{\rm d}t$). Thus, the
Hubble parameter $H(z)$ can be measured through the relation $H(z)=-({\rm d}
z/{\rm d}t)/(1+z)$. By comparing the measured Hubble parameter at different
redshifts with the theoretical one containing free cosmological parameters, one
can constrain current cosmological models. In this paper, we use this method to
present the constraint on a spatially flat Friedman-Robert-Walker Universe with
a matter component and a holographic dark energy component, in which the
parameter $c$ plays a significant role in this dark energy model. Firstly we
consider three fixed values of $c$=0.6, 1.0 and 1.4 in the fitting of data. If
we set $c$ free, the best fitting values are $c=0.26$, $\Omega_{\rm m0}=0.16$,
$h=0.9998$. It is shown that the holographic dark energy behaves like a
quintom-type at the $1\sigma$ level. This result is consistent with some other
independent cosmological constrains, which imply that $c<1.0$ is favored. We
also test the results derived from the differential ages using another
independent method based on the lookback time to galaxy clusters and the age of
the universe. It shows that our results are reliable.

  meeting (October 2005)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Jets from young stars represent one of the most striking signposts of star
formation. The phenomenon has been researched for over two decades and there is
now general agreement that such jets are generated as a by-product of
accretion; most likely by the accretion disk itself. Thus they mimic what
occurs in more exotic objects such as active galactic nuclei and micro-quasars.
The precise mechanism for their production however remains a mystery. To a
large degree, progress is hampered observationally by the embedded nature of
many jet sources as well as a lack of spatial resolution: Crude estimates, as
well as more sophisticated models, nevertheless suggest that jets are
accelerated and focused on scales of a few AU at most.
  It is only in the past few years however that we have begun to probe such
scales in detail using classical T Tauri stars as touchstones. Application of
adaptive optics, data provided by the HST, use of specialised techniques such
as spectro-astrometry, and the development of spectral diagnostic tools, are
beginning to reveal conditions in the jet launch zone. This has helped
enormously to constrain models. Further improvements in the quality of the
observational data are expected when the new generation of interferometers come
on-line. Here we review some of the most dramatic findings in this area since
Protostars and Planets~IV including indications for jet rotation, i.e. that
they transport angular momentum. We will also show how measurements, such as
those of width and the velocity field close to the source, suggest jets are
initially launched as warm magneto-centrifugal disk winds. (abridged)

interpreting the data, found the surface brightness of galaxies to be inversely
proportional to about the third power of (1+z), while the contemporary big-bang
cosmology predicts that the surface brightness is inversely proportional to the
fourth power of (1+z). In contrast, these surface brightness observations are
in agreement with the predictions of the plasma-redshift cosmology. Lubin and
Sandage (2001) and Barden et al. (2005), who surmised the big-bang expansion,
interpreted the observations to indicate that the diameters of galaxies are
inversely proportional to (1+z). In contrast, when assuming plasma-redshift
cosmology, the diameters of galaxies are observed to be constant independent of
redshift and any expansion. Lubin and Sandage (2001) and Barden et al. (2005),
when using big-bang cosmology, observed the average absolute magnitude of
galaxies to decrease with redshift; while in plasma redshift cosmology it is a
constant. Lubin and Sandage and Barden et al. suggested that a coherent
evolution could explain the discrepancy between the observed relations and
those predicted in the big-bang cosmology. We have failed to find support for
this explanation. We consider the observed relations between the redshift and

robust confirmations of plasma-redshift cosmology.

galaxy NGC 1596, which was recently found to have counter-rotating ionized gas
in its center (<15""). We find a large HI envelope associated with a nearby
companion, the dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 1602. The HI covers a region
\~11.9'x13.4' (62x70 kpc^2) and the total HI mass detected is 2.5+/-0.1x10^9
Msun (assuming an 18 Mpc distance). The HI is centered on NGC 1602 but appears
to have two tidal tails, one of which crosses over NGC 1596. The HI located at
the position of NGC 1596 has a velocity gradient in the same sense as the
ionized gas, i.e. opposite to the stellar rotation. Both the existence of a
large gas reservoir and the velocity gradient of the HI and the ionized gas
strongly suggest that the ionized gas in NGC 1596 originated from NGC 1602.
  From the length of the HI tails we conclude that the interaction started at
least 1 Gyr ago, but the unsettled, asymmetric distribution of the ionized gas
suggests that the accretion occured more recently. NGC 1596 thus provides a
good example where the presence of counter-rotating gas can be directly linked
to an accretion event. After the accretion has stopped or the merging is
complete, NGC 1596 may evolve to a system with more extended counter-rotating
gas but no obvious signature of interaction. There is a substantial local HI
peak in one of the two tails, where we also find a faint stellar counterpart.
The M_HI/L_B ratio in this region is too high for a normal dwarf elliptical or
a low surface brightness galaxy, so we conclude that a tidal dwarf is currently
forming there.

million years in age, an epoch that may coincide with the late stages of planet

100 low-mass stars that are likely members of the eta Chamaeleontis (~6 Myr),
TW Hydrae (~8 Myr), beta Pictoris (~12 Myr) and Tucanae-Horologium (~30 Myr)
groups. Our data were collected over 12 nights between 2004 December - 2005
July on the Magellan Clay 6.5m telescope. Based on H$\alpha$ line profiles,
along with a variety of other emission lines, we find clear evidence of
on-going accretion in three out of 11 eta Cha stars and two out of 32 TW Hydrae
members. None of the 57 beta Pic or Tuc-Hor members shows measurable signs of
accretion. Together, these results imply significant evolution of the disk
accretion process within the first several Myr of a low-mass star's life. While
a few disks can continue to accrete for up to ~10 Myr, our findings suggest
that disks accreting for beyond that timescale are rather rare. This result
provides an indirect constraint on the timescale for gas dissipation in inner
disks and, in turn, on gas giant planet formation. All accretors in our sample
are slow rotators, whereas non-accretors cover a large range in rotational
velocities. This may hint at rotational braking by disks at ages up to ~8 Myr.
Our multi-epoch spectra confirm that emission-line variability is common even
in somewhat older T Tauri stars, among which accretors tend to show
particularly strong variations. Thus, our results indicate that accretion and
wind activity undergo significant and sustained variations throughout the
lifetime of accretion disks.

increases come in short, discrete events which are highly correlated with group
accretion events within the cluster. In evolved clusters we find that ~10-15%
of the clusters' luminosity is at ICL surface brightness. The morphological
structure of the ICL changes with time, evolving from a complex of filaments
and small-scale, relatively high surface brightness features early in a
cluster's history, to a more diffuse and amorphous cluster-scale ICL envelope
at later times. Finally, we also see a correlation between the evolution of ICL
at different surface brightnesses, including a time delay between the evolution
of faint and extremely faint surface brightness features which is traced to the

work to include random initial conditions for the scalar fields, and explore
the predictions for density perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio. The
tensor-to-scalar ratio depends only on the number of e-foldings and is
independent of the number of fields, their masses, and their initial
conditions. It therefore always has the same value as for a single massive
field. By contrast, the scalar spectral index has significant dependence on
model parameters. While normally multi-field inflation models make predictions
for observable quantities which depend also on the unknown field initial
conditions, we find evidence of a `thermodynamic' regime whereby the predicted
spectral index becomes independent of initial conditions if there are enough

of the stellar light. The IR emission in M81 can be modeled with three
components: 1) cold dust with a temperature <T_c>=18+-2 K, concentrated near
the HII regions but also presenting a diffuse distribution; 2) warm dust with
T_w=53+-7 K, directly linked with the HII regions; and 3) aromatic molecules,
with diffuse morphology peaking around the HII regions. We derive several
relationships to obtain total IR luminosities from IR monochromatic fluxes, and
we compare five different star formation rate (SFR) estimators for HII regions
in M81 and M51: the UV, Halpha, and three estimators based on Spitzer data. We
find that the Halpha luminosity absorbed by dust correlates tightly with the 24
microns emission. The correlation with the total IR luminosity is not as good.
Important variations from galaxy to galaxy are found when estimating the total
SFR with the 24 microns or the total IR emission alone. The most reliable
estimations of the total SFRs are obtained by combining the Halpha emission (or
the UV) and an IR luminosity (especially the 24 microns emission), which probe
the unobscured and obscured SF, respectively. For the entire M81 galaxy, about
50% of the total SF is obscured by dust. The percentage of obscured SF ranges
from 60% in the inner regions of the galaxy to 30% in the outer zones.

Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile with a maximum radius set at $r=r_{200}$,
where the enclosed matter has an overdensity of 200 times the critical density.
The choice of $r=r_{200}$ is somewhat arbitrary. It is not the collapsed
(virial) radius, but does give $r \sim$ 1 Mpc for rich clusters, which is a
typical X-ray size. Weak lensing measurements, however, reveal halo radii well
in excess of $r_{200}$. Is there a surface that places an absolute limit on the
extension of a halo? To answer the question, we derived analytically the
solution for circular orbits around a mass concentration in an expanding flat
Universe, to show that an outermost orbit exists at $v/r = H$, where $v$ is the
orbital speed and $H$ is the Hubble constant. The solution, parametrized as
$r_2$, is independent of model assumptions on structure formation, and {\it is
the radius at which the furthest particle can be regarded as part of the bound
system}. We present observational evidence in support of dark matter halos
reaching at least as far out as $r=r_2$. An interesting consequence that
emerges concerns the behavior of rotation curves. Near $r=r_2$ velocities will
be biased low. As a result, the mass of many galaxy groups may have been
underestimated. At $r=r_2$ there is an abrupt cutoff in the curve, irrespective
of the halo profile. An important cosmological test can therefore be performed
if velocity disperion data are available out to 10 Mpc radii for nearby
clusters (less at higher redshifts). For Virgo it appears that there is no such

(Ludwig et al. 1999). These MLT--\alpha^2D stellar models and tracks are very
similar to those computed with non--grey ATLAS9 atmospheric boundary conditions
and Full Spectrum of Turbulence (FST) convection model both in the atmosphere
and in the interior. The comparison of the new tracks with the location on the
HR diagram of pre--MS binariesis not completely satisfactory, as some binary
components are located at too low \teff. Besides, the pre--MS lithium depletion
in the MLT--\alpha^2D tracks is still much larger than that expected from the
observations of lithium in young open clusters. This result is similar to that
of FST models. Thus, in spite of the fact that 2D RHD models should provide a
better convection description than any local model, their introduction is not
sufficient to reconcile theory and observations. Lithium depletion in young
clusters points towards a convection efficiency which, in pre--MS, should be
smaller than in the MS. The pre--MS lithium depletion decreases significantly

We keep to coupled DE (cDE) models known to fit linear observables. To
implement the PS-ST approach, we start from reviewing and extending the results
of a previous work on the growth of a spherical top-hat fluctuation in cDE
models, confirming their most intriguing astrophysical feature, i.e. a
significant baryon-DM segregation, occurring well before the onset of any
hydrodynamical effect. Accordingly, the predicted mass function depends on how
halo masses are measured. For any option, however, the coupling causes a
distortion of the mass function, still at z=0. Furthermore, the z-dependence of
cDE mass functions is mostly displaced, in respect to LambdaCDM, in the
opposite way of uncoupled dynamical DE. This is an aspect of the basic
underlying result, that even a little DM-DE coupling induces relevant
modifications in the non-linear evolution. Therefore, without causing great
shifts in linear astrophysical observables, the DM-baryon segregation induced
by the coupling can have an impact on a number of cosmological problems, it

metallicities at a given velocity dispersion than cluster galaxies, which
display only super-solar metallicities. On average cluster, as well as,
isolated galaxies show non-solar abundance ratios in alpha-elements, suggesting
that, independent of galactic environment, star formation occurred on short

shocks, strong UV fields, cosmic rays and X-rays. We present below the first

coalescences of massive black hole binaries at cosmological distances
detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). An electromagnetic
precursor, during the last year of gravitational wave (GW)-driven inspiral, or
an afterglow within few years after coalescence, may highlight the position in
the sky of galaxies hosting LISA sources. We show that observations of
precursors and afterglows are mutually exclusive, depending on the mass of the
primary black hole. Precursors are expected to occur in binaries where the
primary (more massive) black hole is heavier than ~10^7 \Msun. They may
correspond to on-off states of accretion, i.e., to a bright X-ray source
decaying into quiescence before black hole coalescence, and are likely
associated to disturbed galaxies showing signs of ongoing starbursts.
Coalescences of lighter binaries, with masses <5x10^6 \Msun, lack of any
precursor, as gas is expected to be consumed long before the GW-driven orbital
decay. Such events would not be hosted by (massive) galaxies with an associated
starburst, given the slow binary inspiral time compared to the typical time
scale of starbursts. By contrast, coalescence, for such light binaries, is
followed by an electromagnetic afterglow, i.e., an off-on accretion state
rising in <20 yrs. Using a cosmological merger tree algorithm, we show that
future X-ray missions such as XEUS will be able to identify, in 20 yrs
operation, almost all the massive BH binary detectable by LISA, and, in only 5
yrs, all the LISA sources at z>6.

that most of the objects need a non-negligible power-law contribution. When no
spectral fitting can be performed (data with low signal-to-noise ratio), the
Color-Color diagrams allow us to roughly estimate physical parameters such as
column density, temperature of the thermal model or spectral index for a
power-law and therefore to better constrain the origin of the X-ray emission.

the evolution of star clusters at various metallicities over a Hubble time is
compared to observed sets of Lick indices of varying completeness and
precision. A dedicated chi^2 - minimisation procedure selects the best model
including 1-sigma uncertainties on age and metallicity. We discuss the age and
metallicity sensitivities of individual indices and show that these
sensitivities themselves depend on age and metallicity; thus, we extend
Worthey's (1994) concept of a ""metallicity sensitivity parameter"" for an old
stellar population at solar metallicity to younger clusters of different
metallicities. We find that indices at low metallicity are generally more age
sensitive than at high metallicity. Our aim is to provide a robust and reliable

equation for any relative orientation of in-plane magnetizations, arbitrary
transparency of interfaces, and mismatch of Fermi wave vectors. Both spin
singlet and triplet superconducting correlations are taken into account, and
the Josephson current is calculated as a function of the ferromagnetic layers
thicknesses and of the angle $\alpha$ between their magnetizations. We find
that the critical Josephson current $I_c$ is a monotonic function of $\alpha$
when the junction is far enough from $0-\pi$ transitions. This holds when
ferromagnets are relatively weak. For stronger ferromagnets, variation of
$\alpha$ induces switching between 0 and $\pi$ states and $I_c(\alpha)$ is
non-monotonic function, displaying characteristic dips at the transitions.
However, the non-monotonicity is the effect of a weaker influence of the
exchange potential in the case of non-parallel magnetizations. No substantial
impact of spin-triplet superconducting correlations on the Josephson current
has been found in the clean limit. Experimental control of the critical current
and $0-\pi$ transitions by varying the angle between magnetizations is
suggested.

related to the shape of the tail decay; $q<1$ for compact-support including
parabola $(q=0)$; $1<q\leq3$ for heavy-tail including Cauchy $(q=2)$. This
addendum clarifies the transformation $q'=((3q-1)/(q+1))$ within the algorithm
is due to a difference in the dimensions d of the generalized logarithm and the
generalized distribution. The transformation is clarified by the decomposition
of $q=1+2\kappa/(1+d\kappa)$, where the shape parameter $-1<\kappa\leq\infty$
quantifies the magnitude of the deformation from exponential. A simpler
specification for the generalized Box- M\""uller algorithm is provided using the
shape of the tail decay.
  Original: The q-Gaussian distribution is known to be an attractor of certain
correlated systems, and is the distribution which, under appropriate
constraints, maximizes the entropy Sq, basis of nonextensive statistical
mechanics. This theory is postulated as a natural extension of the standard
(Boltzmann-Gibbs) statistical mechanics, and may explain the ubiquitous
appearance of heavy-tailed distributions in both natural and man-made systems.
The q-Gaussian distribution is also used as a numerical tool, for example as a
visiting distribution in Generalized Simulated Annealing. We develop and
present a simple, easy to implement numerical method for generating random
deviates from a q-Gaussian distribution based upon a generalization of the well
known Box-Muller method. Our method is suitable for a larger range of q values,
q<3, than has previously appeared in the literature, and can generate deviates
from q-Gaussian distributions of arbitrary width and center. MATLAB code

fundamental problem. Unfortunately, experimental data often do not directly
reveal structure due to inherent limitations such as imprecision in timing or
other observation mechanisms. We consider the problem of inferring network
structure in the form of a directed graph from co-occurrence observations. Each
observation arises from a transmission made over the network and indicates
which vertices carry the transmission without explicitly conveying their order
in the path. Without order information, there are an exponential number of
feasible graphs which agree with the observed data equally well. Yet, the basic
physical principles underlying most networks strongly suggest that all feasible
graphs are not equally likely. In particular, vertices that co-occur in many
observations are probably closely connected. Previous approaches to this
problem are based on ad hoc heuristics. We model the experimental observations
as independent realizations of a random walk on the underlying graph, subjected
to a random permutation which accounts for the lack of order information.
Treating the permutations as missing data, we derive an exact
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating the random walk
parameters. For long transmission paths the exact E-step may be computationally
intractable, so we also describe an efficient Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) algorithm
and derive conditions which ensure convergence of the MCEM algorithm with high
probability. Simulations and experiments with Internet measurements demonstrate
the promise of this approach.

We call this problem the sensor cover problem. This problem arises in the
context of covering a region with sensors. For example, suppose you wish to
monitor activity along a fence by sensors placed at various fixed locations.
Each sensor has a range and limited battery life. The problem is to schedule
when to turn on the sensors so that the fence is fully monitored for as long as
possible. This one dimensional problem involves intervals on the real line.
Associating a duration to each yields a set of rectangles in space and time,
each specified by a pair of fixed horizontal endpoints and a height. The
objective is to assign a position to each rectangle to maximize the height at
which the spanning interval is fully covered. We call this one dimensional

packing constraint, the problem is identical to dynamic storage allocation, a
scheduling problem that is a restricted case of the strip packing problem. We
show that the restricted strip covering problem is NP-hard and present an O(log
log n)-approximation algorithm. We present better approximations or exact
algorithms for some special cases. For the uniform-duration case of restricted
strip covering we give a polynomial-time, exact algorithm but prove that the
uniform-duration case for higher-dimensional regions is NP-hard. Finally, we
consider regions that are arbitrary sets, and we present an O(log

organizes time series into few intervals having uniform characteristics
(flatness, linearity, modality, monotonicity and so on). For scalability, we
require fast linear time algorithms. The popular piecewise linear model can
determine where the data goes up or down and at what rate. Unfortunately, when
the data does not follow a linear model, the computation of the local slope
creates overfitting. We propose an adaptive time series model where the
polynomial degree of each interval vary (constant, linear and so on). Given a
number of regressors, the cost of each interval is its polynomial degree:
constant intervals cost 1 regressor, linear intervals cost 2 regressors, and so
on. Our goal is to minimize the Euclidean (l_2) error for a given model
complexity. Experimentally, we investigate the model where intervals can be
either constant or linear. Over synthetic random walks, historical stock market
prices, and electrocardiograms, the adaptive model provides a more accurate
segmentation than the piecewise linear model without increasing the
cross-validation error or the running time, while providing a richer vocabulary
to applications. Implementation issues, such as numerical stability and
real-world performance, are discussed.

of FDESs. We note that the controllability of events in Qiu's work is fuzzy but
the observability of events is crisp, and, the observability of events in Cao
and Ying's work is also crisp although the controllability is not completely
crisp since the controllable events can be disabled with any degrees. Motivated
by the necessity to consider the situation that the events may be observed or
controlled with some membership degrees, in this paper, we establish the
supervisory control theory of FDESs with partial observations, in which both
the observability and controllability of events are fuzzy instead. We formalize
the notions of fuzzy controllability condition and fuzzy observability
condition. And Controllability and Observability Theorem of FDESs is set up in
a more generic framework. In particular, we present a detailed computing flow

this result can decide the existence of supervisors. Also, we use this

a new method and different from classical case. A number of examples are

in the spinfoam formalism. Within the 3d toy model introduced in gr-qc/0512102,
we test how the spinfoam formalism can be used to construct the perturbative
expansion of graviton amplitudes. Although the 3d graviton is a pure gauge, one
can choose to work in a gauge where it is not zero and thus reproduce the
structure of the 4d perturbative calculations. We compute explicitly the next
to leading and next to next to leading orders, corresponding to one-loop and
two-loop corrections. We show that while the first arises entirely from the
expansion of the Regge action around the flat background, the latter receives
contributions from the microscopic, non Regge-like, quantum geometry.
Surprisingly, this new contribution reduces the magnitude of the next to next
to leading order. It thus appears that the spinfoam formalism is likely to
substantially modify the conventional perturbative expansion at higher orders.
  This result supports the interest in this approach. We then address a number
of open issues in the rest of the paper. First, we discuss the boundary state
ansatz, which is a key ingredient in the whole construction. We propose a way
to enhance the ansatz in order to make the edge lengths and dihedral angles
conjugate variables in a mathematically well-defined way. Second, we show that
the leading order is stable against different choices of the face weights of
the spinfoam model; the next to leading order, on the other hand, is changed in
a simple way, and we show that the topological face weight minimizes it.
Finally, we extend the leading order result to the case of a regular, but not
equilateral, tetrahedron.

the intuitive picture of quantum geometry using spin networks and powerful

quantum gravity suffers from a quantum ambiguity, due to the presence of a free
(Barbero-Immirzi) parameter. Following recent progress on the conformal
decomposition of gravitational fields, we present a new phase space for general
relativity. In addition to spin-gauge symmetry, the new phase space also
incorporates conformal symmetry making the description parameter free. The
Barbero-Immirzi ambiguity is shown to occur only if the conformal symmetry is
gauge-fixed prior to quantization. By withholding its full symmetries, the new
phase space offers a promising platform for the future development of loop
quantum gravity. This paper aims to provide an exposition, at a reduced
technical level, of the above theoretical advances and their background
developments. Further details are referred to cited references.

of the ultraviolet divergences in qed, they do not resolve the issues of
constructive field theory, or show the validity of qed except as a perturbation
theory. I present a rigorous construction of quantum and classical
electrodynamics from fundamental principles of quantum theory. Hilbert space of
dimension N is justified from statements about measurements with finite range
and resolution. Using linear combinations of basis kets, a continuum of kets,
|x> for x in R^3, is constructed such that the inner product can be expressed
as a finite sum or as an integral. Vectors are smooth wave functions such that
differential operators are defined and the choice of basis has no affect on
underlying physics. Quantum field operators, phi(x) for x in R^4, are
constructed from creation and annihilation operators on Fock space, obey
quantum covariance and locality, and are suitable for a description of particle
interactions under the Feynman-St\""uckelberg interpretation. It is shown that
the formulation is consistent and that any dependency on a lattice arises from
measurement, not from underlying physics. In consequence, and because the
continuum is constructed from linear combinations of basis kets, it is not
required to take the limit N-->oo. Quantum fields are defined on a continuum,
and are operator valued functions, not distributions. The interacting Dirac
equation, Maxwell's equations and the Lorentz force law are derived, showing
that qed is a complete theory of the electromagnetic interaction, not just a
perturbation theory and that bare mass and charge are the physical values. Up
to the accuracy of measurement, predictions of perturbation theory are
identical to those of standard qed with all loop divergences removed. The
standard perturbation expansion is asymptotic to the finite expansion given
here.

in QCD in the light of the AdS-QCD correspondence. Recently, a tantalizing
parallelism was suggested between Migdal's work and a family of holographic
duals of QCD. Despite the intriguing similarities, both approaches face a major
drawback: the spectrum is in conflict with well-tested Regge scaling. However,
it has recently been shown that holographic duals can be modified to accomodate
Regge behavior. Therefore, it is interesting to understand whether Regge
behavior can also be achieved in Migdal's approach. In this paper we
investigate this issue. We find that Migdal's approach, which is based on a
modified Pade approximant, is closely related to the issue of quark-hadron
duality breakdown in QCD.

subdominant Fayet--Iliopoulos D-term whose presence explicitly breaks a
D-parity in the inflaton-waterfall sector. This scenario of inflation, which is
called F_D-term hybrid model for brevity, can naturally predict lepton number
violation at the electroweak scale, by tying the mu-parameter of the MSSM to an
SO(3)-symmetric Majorana mass m_N, via the vacuum expectation value of the
inflaton field. We show how a negative Hubble-induced mass term in a
next-to-minimal extension of supergravity helps to accommodate the present CMB
data and considerably weaken the strict constraints on the theoretical
parameters, resulting from cosmic string effects on the power spectrum P_R. The
usual gravitino overabundance constraint may be significantly relaxed in this
model, once the enormous entropy release from the late decays of the ultraheavy
waterfall gauge particles is properly considered. As the Universe enters a
second thermalization phase involving a very low reheat temperature, which
might be as low as about 0.3 TeV, thermal electroweak-scale resonant
leptogenesis provides a viable mechanism for successful baryogenesis, while
thermal right-handed sneutrinos emerge as new possible candidates for solving
the cold dark matter problem. In addition, we discuss grand unified theory
realizations of F_D-term hybrid inflation devoid of cosmic strings and
monopoles, based on the complete breaking of an SU(2) subgroup. The F_D-term
hybrid model offers rich particle-physics phenomenology, which could be probed
at high-energy colliders, as well as in low-energy experiments of lepton
flavour or number violation.

For a tachyon potential with only the leading term, such fixed points are
possible. On non-compact target spaces, we introduce a small non-zero tachyon
and compute the correction to the Euclidean 2d black hole (cigar) solution at
second order in perturbation theory with a tachyon potential containing a cubic
term as well. The corrections to the metric, tachyon and dilaton are
well-behaved at this order and tachyon `hair' persists. We also briefly discuss
solutions to the RG flow equations in the presence of a tachyon that suggest a
comparison to dynamical fixed point solutions obtained by Yang and Zwiebach.

dependent background with a null singularity are explored. It is shown the
appearance of a 2d entanglement entropy dynamically generated by the
background. For asymptotically flat observers, the vacuum close to the
singularity is unitarily inequivalent to the vacuum at $\tau = -\infty$ and it
is shown that the 2d entanglement entropy diverges close to this point. As a
consequence, the positive time region is inaccessible for observers in $\tau
=-\infty$. For a stationary measure, the vacuum at finite time is seen by those
observers as a thermal state and the information loss is encoded as a heat bath
of string states.

hole dynamics. The difficulties in understanding such dynamics stems from the
proliferation of scales involved when one attempts to simultaneously describe
all of the relevant dynamical degrees of freedom. These range from the modes
that describe the black hole horizon, which are responsible for dissipative
effects, to the long wavelength gravitational radiation that drains mechanical
energy from macroscopic black hole bound states. We approach the problem from a
Wilsonian point of view, by building a tower of theories of gravity each of
which is valid at different scales. The methodology leads to multiple new
results in diverse topics including phase transitions of Kaluza-Klein black
holes and the interactions of spinning black hole in non-relativistic orbits.
Moreover, our methods tie together speculative ideas regarding dualities for
black hole horizons to real physical measurements in gravitational wave
detectors.

As it is known, in the canonical Weyl-Moyal approach the model is inconsistent,
basically due to the separation of the amplitudes into planar and nonplanar
parts. We prove that if instead a coherent basis representation is used, the
model becomes renormalizable and free of the aforementioned difficulty. We also
show that, although the coherent states procedure breaks Lorentz symmetry in
odd dimensions, in the Gross-Neveu model this breaking can be kept under
control by assuming the noncommutativity parameters to be small enough. We also
make some remarks on some ordering prescriptions used in the literature.

models of QCD's gap equation can simultaneously admit two inequivalent
dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB) solutions and a solution that is
unambiguously connected with the realisation of chiral symmetry in the Wigner
mode. The Wigner solution and one of the DCSB solutions are destabilised by a
current-quark mass and both disappear when that mass exceeds a critical value.
This critical value also bounds the domain on which the surviving DCSB solution
possesses a chiral expansion. This value can therefore be viewed as an upper
bound on the domain within which a perturbative expansion in the current-quark
mass around the chiral limit is uniformly valid for physical quantities. For a
pseudoscalar meson constituted of equal mass current-quarks, it corresponds to
a mass m_{0^-}~0.45GeV. In our discussion we employ properties of the two DCSB
solutions of the gap equation that enable a valid definition of <bar-q q> in
the presence of a nonzero current-mass. The behaviour of this condensate
indicates that the essentially dynamical component of chiral symmetry breaking
decreases with increasing current-quark mass.

connected by positive feedback. Hysteresis is assumed to emerge from the
intrinsic properties of the cells. We consider the recurrent networks
containing either bistable or multistable neurons. We apply our analysis to the
oculomotor velocity-to-position neural integrator that calculates the eye
positions from the inputs that carry information about eye angular velocity.
Using the analysis of the system in the parameter space we show the following.
The direction of hysteresis in the neuronal response may be reversed for the
system with recurrent connections compared to the case of unconnected neurons.
Thus, for the NMDA receptor based bistability the firing rates after ON
saccades may be higher than after OFF saccades for the same eye position. We
suggest that this is an emergent property due to the presence of global
recurrent feedback. The reversal of hysteresis occurs only when the size of
hysteresis differs from neuron to neuron. We also relate the macroscopic leak
time-constant of the integrator to the rate of microscopic spontaneous
noise-driven transitions in the hysteretic units. Finally, we argue that the
presence of neurons with small hysteresis may remove the threshold for
integration.

of the conflicting requirements of achieving coherent control and preservation
of quantum coherence in a large scale quantum system. Moreover, the system
should be compatible with miniaturization and integration of quantum circuits.
Mesoscopic solid state systems such as superconducting islands and quantum dots
feature robust control techniques using local electrical signals and
self-evident scaling based on advances in fabrication; however, in general the
quantum states of solid state devices tend to decohere rapidly. In contrast,
quantum optical systems based on trapped ions and neutral atoms exhibit
dramatically better coherence properties, while miniaturization of atomic and
molecular systems, and their integration with mesoscopic electrical circuits,
remains an important challenge. Below we describe methods for the integration
of a single particle system -- an isolated polar molecule -- with mesoscopic
solid state devices in a way that produces robust, coherent, quantum-level
control. The methods described include the trapping, cooling, detection,
coherent manipulation and quantum coupling of isolated polar molecules at
sub-micron dimensions near cryogenic stripline microwave resonators. We show
that electrostatically trapped polar molecules can exhibit strong confinement
and fast, purely electrical gate control. Furthermore, the effect of electrical
noise sources, a key issue in quantum information processing, can be suppressed
to very low levels via appropriate preparation and manipulation of the polar
molecules. Our setup provides a scalable cavity QED-type quantum computer
architecture, where entanglement of distant qubits stored in long-lived
rotational molecular states is achieved via exchange of microwave photons.

control the size of the valence hole wave function near the semiconductor
surface. This proposal for coherent manipulation of individual ionic spins and
controlled coupling of ionic spins via electrical gates alone may find
applications in extremely high density information storage and in scalable
