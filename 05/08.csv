estimated their expansion velocities to be no higher than 15-20 km/s; the

sputtering yields for the combinations of dust and ion species of interest to

in shock are calculated by taking into account the size distribution of each
dust species, together with the time evolution of temperature and density of
gas in spherically symmetric shocks. The results of calculations show that the
efficiency of dust destruction depends not only on the sputtering yield but
also on the initial size distribution of each grain species. The efficiency of
dust destruction increases with increasing $E_{\rm 51}$ and/or increasing
$n_{{\rm H}, 0}$, but is almost independent of $M_{\rm pr}$ as long as $E_{\rm

evolution in the dust layer of a protoplanetary disk due to the gravitational
instability and dust settling toward the midplane. We assume the region where
the radial pressure gradient at equilibrium is negligible so that the
shear-induced instability is avoided, and also restrict to an axisymmetric
perturbation as a first step of nonlinear numerical simulations of the
gravitational instability. We find that there are two different evolutional
paths of the gravitational instability depending on the nondimensional gas
friction time, which is defined as the product of the gas friction time and the
Keplerian angular velocity. If the nondimensional gas friction time is equal to
0.01, the gravitational instability grows faster than dust settling. On the
other hand, if the nondimensional gas friction time is equal to 0.1, dust
aggregates settle sufficiently before the gravitational instability grows. In
the latter case, an approximate analytical calculation reveals that dust
settling is faster than the growth of the gravitational instability regardless
of the dust density at the midplane. Thus, the dust layer becomes extremely
thin and may reach a few tenth of the material density of the dust before the
gravitational instability grows.

(M/M_sun-0.74)^{0.053}-6.65$, which is valid for stellar masses greater than
0.77 M_sun. While no strict information is gathered for the chemical
composition of the cluster, as a result of degeneracy in the colour-magnitude

were obtained from high-resolution TEM images by composition evaluation by
lattice fringe analysis. The measured profiles can be well described applying
the segregation model of Muraki et al. [Appl. Phys. Lett. 61 (1992) 557].
Calculated photoluminescence peak positions on the basis of the measured

Evaluating experimental In-concentration profiles it is found that the
transition from the two-dimensional to the three-dimensional growth mode occurs
if the indium content in the In-floating layer exceeds 1.1+/-0.2 monolayers.
The measured exponential decrease of the In-concentration within the cap layer
on top of the islands reveals that the In-floating layer is not consumed during
island formation. The segregation efficiency above the islands is increased
compared to the quantum wells which is explained tentatively by
strain-dependent lattice-site selection of In. In addition, In0.25Ga0.75As

equivalent complexity to the construction of Euclidean minimum spanning trees.
The results are extended to arbitrary ball graphs with a sub-quadratic running

  For unit ball graphs, the spanners have a small separator decomposition which

Specifically, we focus on the Cabibbo-allowed decays $\bar B\to D^{**}\pi$ and
$\bar D^{**}_sD^{(*)}$, where $D^{**}$ denotes generically a p-wave charmed
meson. While the measured color-allowed decays $\bar B^0\to D^{**+}\pi^-$ are
consistent with the theoretical expectation, the experimental observation of
$B^-\to D^{**0}\pi^-$ for the broad $D^{**}$ states is astonishing as it
requires that the color-suppressed contribution dominates over the
color-allowed one, even though the former is $1/m_b$ suppressed in the heavy
quark limit. In order to accommodate the data of $\bar B\to D^{**}\pi^-$, it is
found that $a_2/a_1\approx -0.5$ with a sign opposite to that in $\bar B\to
D\pi$ decays, where $a_1$ and $a_2$ are the effective Wilson coefficients for
color-allowed and color-suppressed decay amplitudes, respectively. The decay
constants and form factors for $D^{**}$ and the Isgur-Wise functions
$\tau_{1/2}(\omega)$ and $\tau_{3/2}(\omega)$ are extracted from the data of
$B\to D^{**}\pi$ decays. The Isgur-Wise functions calculated in the covariant
light-front quark model are in good agreement with experiment. The neutral
modes $\bar B^0\to D^{**0}\pi^0$ for $D^{**}=D^*_0(2400),D'_1(2430)$ and $\bar
B^0\to D'^0_1(2430)\omega$ are predicted to have branching ratios of order
$10^{-4}$ which are also supported by isospin argument. The decay constants of
$D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D'_{s1}(2460)$ are inferred from the measurements of
$\bar B\to D_s^{**-}D$ to be $58\sim 86$ MeV and $130\sim 200$ MeV,

Hagedorn hadron mass spectrum: It is a consequence of the second law applied to
a relativistic gas, and the relativistic equivalence between inertial mass and
its heat content. The Hagedorn temperature occurs in the limit as the number of
particles and their internal energy diverge such that their ratio remains
constant. The divergences in the $N$ particle entropy, energy, and free energy
result when this condition is imposed upon a mixture of ideal gases, one
conserving particle number and the other not. The analogy with a droplet in the
presence of vapor explains why the pressure of the droplet continues to
increase as the temperature rises finally leading to its break up when the
Hagedorn temperature is reached. The adiabatic condition relating the particle
volume to the Hagedorn temperature is asymptotic. Since it is a limiting
temperature, and not a critical one, there can be no phase transition of
whatever kind, and the original density of states used to derive such a phase
transition is not thermodynamically admissible because its partition function

be performed appear at various locations over time, and we have a collection of

a request, we incur a cost equal to the distance traveled by the dispatched
server. The goal is to find a strategy for choosing which server to dispatch to
each incoming request which keeps the average service cost as small as
possible.
  In the model considered in this paper, the locations of service requests are
drawn according to an IID random process. We show that, given a statistical
description of this process, we can compute a simple decentralized
state-feedback policy which achieves an average cost within a factor of two of
the cost achieved by an optimal state-feedback policy. In addition, we

conditions for the generic solution to converge toward an equilibrium or
towards the set of equilibria (quasiconvergence). In this paper, we provide new
formulations of these results in terms of the measure-theoretic notion of
prevalence. For monotone reaction-diffusion systems with Neumann boundary
conditions on convex domains, we show that the set of continuous initial data
corresponding to solutions that converge to a spatially homogeneous equilibrium
is prevalent. We also extend a previous generic convergence result to allow its
use on Sobolev spaces. Careful attention is given to the measurability of the
various sets involved.

later up to some additional, technical assumptions. We construct an explicit

verifying Ruan's conjecture. In the $A_n$-case, the family
$H^*(Z)(q_1,...,q_n)$ is not defined for $q_1=...=q_n=-1$. This implies that
the conjecture should be slightly modified. We propose a new conjecture in the
$A_n$-case which we prove in the $A_2$-case by constructing an explicit

deterministic limit. In this work, we will introduce a notion by which a
stochastic system has something like a Markov partition for deterministic
systems. For a chosen class of the noise profiles the Frobenius-Perron operator
associated to the noisy system is exactly represented by a stochastic
transition matrix of a finite size K. This feature allows us to introduce for
these stochastic systems a basis--Markov partition, defined herein,
irrespectively of whether the deterministic system possesses a Markov partition
or not. We show that in the deterministic limit, corresponding to K -->
infinity, the sequence of invariant measures of the noisy systems tends, in the
weak sense, to the invariant measure of the deterministic system. Thus by
introducing a small additive noise one may approximate transition matrices and
invariant measures of deterministic dynamical systems.

information about spin-dependent nuclear forces. If a resonant horizontal
electric field acts on a deuteron beam circulating into a storage ring, the
tensor electric polarizability stimulates the buildup of the vertical
polarization of the deuteron (the Baryshevsky effect). General formulas
describing this effect have been derived. Calculated formulas agree with the
earlier obtained results. The problem of the influence of tensor electric
polarizability on spin dynamics in such a deuteron electric-dipole-moment
experiment in storage rings has been investigated. Doubling the resonant
frequency used in this experiment dramatically amplifies the Baryshevsky effect
and provides the opportunity to make high-precision measurements of the
deuteron's tensor electric polarizability.

using large-angle quasi-elastic scattering, that is a good counterpart of
fusion reaction. Towards a reconciliation of the apparent anomaly in the
diffuseness parameter for fusion reactions, we also discuss possible
ingredients which are missing in present nuclear reaction models. Those include
a deviation from the frozen density approximation, the effect of
antisymmetrization and the role of coordinate dependent moment of inertia for
the relative motion between the colliding nuclei.

matter and fields. In Section:1 we will discuss the completeness of real
numbers in the context of an alternate definition of the straight line as a
geometric continuum. According to this definition, points are not regarded as
the basic constituents of a line segment and a line segment is considered to be
a fundamental geometric object. This definition is in particular suitable to
coordinatize different points on the straight line preserving the order
properties of real numbers. Geometrically fundamental nature of line segments
are required in physical theories like the string theory. We will discuss the
cardinality of rational numbers in the later half of Section:1. We will first
discuss what we do in an actual process of counting and define functions
well-defined on the set of all positive integers. We will follow an alternate
approach that depends on the Hausdorff topology of real numbers to demonstrate
that the set of positive rationals can have a greater cardinality than the set
of positive integers. This approach is more consistent with an actual act of
counting. This article indicates that the axiom of choice can be a better
technique to prove theorems that use second-countability. This is important for
the metrization theorems and physics of spacetime. In Section:2 we will discuss
an improved proof of the Poisson's equation. We will show that the self energy
of a point charge can be zero in the potential approach to evaluate it. In
Section:3 we will discuss a few aspects of the equivalence of the Schwarzschild
coordinates and the Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates. In Section:4 we will make a
few comments on general physics including the special theory of relativity and
hydrodynamics.

Doppler-Fizeau formula that is not the same as 1905 Einstein's one.
Longitudinally, Einstein's formula and Poincare's formula are the same. The
question of an experimental test is connected with the possibility or the
impossibility of directly measuring the relativistic transverse effect.
Hasselkamp's 1978 experiment becomes a crucial experiment because Poincare's
relativistic kinematics predicts an expansion of sapce directly connected with
the Doppler-Fizeau effect for the remote objects.

social process, where pairs of partners emerge in a community. The choice was
performed on a basis of attractive resources and of random initial preferences.
An efficiency of the process, defined as the probability of finding a partner,
was found to depend on the community size. Here we demonstrate, that if the
resources are not relevant, the efficiency is equal to unity; everybody finds a
partner. With this new formulation, about 80 percent of community members enter
to dyads; the remaining 20 percent form triads.

complex network theory. In particular, we analyse the topology of Orwell's
\textit{1984} focusing on the local properties of the network, such as the
properties of the nearest neighbors and the clustering coefficient. We find a
composite power law behavior for both the average nearest neighbor's degree and
average clustering coefficient as a function of the vertex degree. This implies
the existence of different functional classes of vertices. Furthermore we find
that the second order vertex correlations are an essential component of the
network architecture. To model our empirical results we extend a previously
introduced model for language due to Dorogovtsev and Mendes. We propose an
accelerated growing network model that contains three growth mechanisms: linear
preferential attachment, local preferential attachment and the random growth of
a pre-determined small finite subset of initial vertices. We find that with
these elementary stochastic rules we are able to produce a network showing
syntactic-like structures.

comprising a light mixer, a PMT together with its divider and a {\it 3-in-1}
card, which provides shaping, amplification and integration for the signals.
This instrument needs to be qualified before being assembled on the detector. A
PMT-Block test bench has been developed for this purpose. This test bench is a
system which allows fast, albeit accurate enough, measurements of the main
properties of a complete PMT-Block. The system, both hardware and software, and
the protocol used for the PMT-Blocks characterisation are described in detail

the first to the second cavity, leaving the photons entangled in their
polarization degree of freedom. The feasibility of this implementation and some
practical considerations are discussed for both, microwave and optical regimes.
In particular, Monte Carlo wave function simulations have been performed with
state-of-the-art parameter values to evaluate the success probability of the

classical situation, where it is almost hopeless to achieve more than a
constant success probability without knowing the value of $\eps$.
