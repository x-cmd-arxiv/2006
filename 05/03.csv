These elements may be produced in PN progenitors by s-process nucleosynthesis,
and brought to the stellar envelope by third dredge-up (TDU). We have searched
for [Kr III] 2.199 and [Se IV] 2.287 $\mu$m in 120 PNe, and detected one or
both lines in 79 objects, for a detection rate of 66%. In order to determine
abundances of Se and Kr, we have added these elements to the atomic database of
the photoionization code CLOUDY, and constructed a large grid of models to
derive corrections for unobserved ionization stages. Se and Kr are enriched in
73% of the PNe in which they have been detected, and exhibit a wide range of
abundances, from roughly solar to enriched by a factor of 10 or more. These
enrichments are interpreted as evidence for the operation of the s-process and
TDU in the progenitor stars. In line with theoretical expectations, Kr is more
strongly enhanced than Se, and the abundances of both elements are correlated
with the carbon abundance. Kr and Se are strongly enhanced in Type I PNe, which
may be evidence for the operation of the $^{22}$Ne neutron source in
intermediate-mass AGB stars. These results constitute the first broad
characterization of s-process enrichments in PNe as a population, and reveal
the impact of low- and intermediate-mass stars on the chemical evolution of
trans-iron elements in the Galaxy.

enhancement and depletion across the range of PNe progenitor masses, making it
an alternate metallicity tracer to the canonical oxygen. If S can be reliably

popular prescriptions for massive binary parameters. We explore a range of true

distribution of companion masses, and a range of power-law slopes, \beta,
describing the distribution of orbital separations. We also consider
distributions of secondary masses described by a Miller-Scalo type initial mass
function and by a two-component IMF that includes a substantial ``twin''
population with M_2 ~ M_1. We show that binary fractions F<0.7 are considerably
less probable than F>0.8. Thus, the true binary fraction is high. For F=1.0 and
a distribution of orbital separations near the canonical Opik's Law
distribution (i.e., flat; \beta=0), the power law slope of the mass ratio
distribution is \alpha= -0.6 - 0.0. For F~0.8, \alpha is somewhat larger, in
the range -0.4 - 1.0. In any case, the secondary star mass function is
inconsistent with a Miller-Scalo -like IMF unless the lower end is truncated
below ~ 2--4 solar masses. In other words, massive stars preferentially have
massive companions. The best fitting models are described by a Salpeter or
Miller-Scalo IMF for 60% of secondary star masses with the other 40% of
secondaries having M_2 ~ M_1, i.e., ``twins''. These best-fitting model
parameters simultaneously predict the fraction of type Ib/c supernovae to be
30-40% of all core-collapse supernovae, in agreement with recent observational
estimates.

velocity-independent ``spin temperature'' T_s determined by a competition
between 21-cm radiative transitions, spin-changing collisions, and (at lower
redshifts) Lyman-alpha scattering. However we show here that, if the
collisional time is comparable to the radiative time, the spin temperature will
depend on atomic velocity, T_s=T_s(v), and one must replace the usual hyperfine
level rate equations with a Boltzmann equation describing the spin and velocity
dependence of the HI distribution function. We construct here the Boltzmann
equation relevant to the cosmic dark ages and solve it using a basis-function
method. Accounting for the actual spin-resolved atomic velocity distribution
results in up to a 2 per cent suppression of the 21-cm emissivity, and a
redshift and angular-projection dependent suppression or enhancement of the
linear power spectrum of 21-cm fluctuations of up to 5 per cent. The effect on
the 21-cm line profile is more dramatic -- its full-width at half maximum

behavior of bursts. In the rest frame of the source the found correlation reads
L_iso\propto E_pk^1.62 T_0.45^-0.49. We find other strong correlations, but at
the cost of increasing the number of variables, involving the variability and
the isotropic energy of the prompt emission. With respect to the previous tight
correlations found in GRBs the newly found correlation does not require any
information from the afterglow phase of the bursts, nor any model-dependent
assumption. In the popular scenario in which we are receiving beamed radiation
originating in a fireball pointing at us, the found correlation preserves its
form in the comoving frame. This helps to explain the small scatter of the
correlation, and underlines the role of the local brightness (i.e. the
brightness of the visible fraction of the fireball surface). This correlation
has been found for 19 objects, and it is hard to establish if any selection
bias affects it. Its connection with the prompt local brightness is promising,
but a solid physical understanding is still to be found. Despite all that, we
find that some properties of the correlation, which we discuss, support its
true existence, and this has important implications for the GRB physics.
Furthermore, it is possible to use such correlation as an accurate redshift
estimator, and its tightness will allow us to use it as a tool to constrain the

resolution and wavelength coverage, but we implement a strict, uniform set of
search criteria to derive a well-defined statistical sample. We identify 15
strong MgII absorbers along 14 GRB sightlines (nearly every sightline exhibits
at least one absorber) with spectra covering a total pathlength Delta z = 15.5

absorber systems along the same path length to quasar sightlines is only 3.8.
The roughly four times higher incidence along GRB sightlines is inconsistent
with a statistical fluctuation at greater than 99.9% c.l. Several effects could
explain the result: (i) dust within the MgII absorbers obscures faint quasars
giving a lower observed incidence along quasar sightlines; (ii) the gas is
intrinsic to the GRB event; (iii) the GRB are gravitationally lensed by these
absorbers. We present strong arguments against the first two effects and also

quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) at z = 1.78 to 2.71. Half of the chosen quasars
are bright at mm wavelengths (250 or 350 GHz) while the other half were not
detected at mm wavelengths; the former QSOs were detected at 1.4 GHz, in most
cases at high significance (S/N > ~7), but only three of the latter sources
were detected at radio frequencies, and only at lower significance (S/N ~ 3).
The data are consistent with a correlation between the mm and radio fluxes
indicating a physical connection between the mechanisms responsible for the
radio and mm emission. However, this conclusion is based on data which includes
many upper limits, and deeper observations are clearly needed to verify this
correlation.
  All eight mm detected QSOs are detected in the radio continuum, with radio
flux densities consistent with the radio-to-FIR correlation for low z star
forming galaxies. However, four of these have flatter spectral indices than is
typical for star forming galaxies (i.e. greater than -0.5) suggesting that
radiation from the central AGN dominates the observed radio emission. All the
sources detected at 1.4 GHz are spatially unresolved, with the size limits
typically < 1'' = 6 kpc. High star formation rate galaxies at low redshift are
typically nuclear starbursts, with sizes < 1 kpc. Hence, the current radio size
limits are insufficient to constrain the emission model (AGN or starburst).

to vary during the investigation. We agree with previous studies that under
standard assumptions of binary evolution the formation rate and number of

order of magnitude less than what is indicated by observations. We find that
the common-envelope process cannot be manipulated to produce significant

mass-loss rate from helium stars adopted in the standard model, to a rate that

also leads to favourable results. We stress that constraints on the X-ray

are the division of the shear field into E- and B-mode shear, where
gravitational lensing only produces the former. As shown in a recent note, all
currently used E-/B-mode separation methods for the shear correlation functions
xi_pm require them to be measured to arbitrarily small and/or large separations
which is of course not feasible in practice.
  Methods. We derive second-order shear statistics which provide a clean
separation into E- and B-modes from measurements of xi_pm(theta) over a finite
interval only. We call these new statistics the circle and ring statistics,
respectively; the latter is obtained by an integral over the former. The
mathematical properties of these new shear statistics are obtained, as well as
specific expressions for applying them to observed data.
  Results. It is shown that an E-/B-mode separation can be performed on
measurements of xi_pm over a finite interval in angular separation, using the
ring statistics. We furthermore generalize this result to derive the most
general class of second-order shear statistics which provide a separation of E-
and B-mode shear on a given angular interval theta_min <= theta <= theta_max.
Our results will be of practical use particularly for future cosmic shear
surveys where highly precise measurements of the shear will become available
and where control of systematics will be mandatory.

Evidence is summarized that the interstellar medium is highly turbulent, driven
on different length scales by various energetic processes. Large-scale
turbulence determines the formation of structures like filaments and shells in
the diffuse interstellar medium. It also regulates the formation of dense, cold
molecular clouds. Molecular clouds are now believed to be transient objects
that form on timescales of order 1e7 yrs in regions where HI gas is compressed
and cools. Supersonic turbulence in the compressed HI slab is generated by a
combination of hydrodynamical instabilities, coupled with cooling. Turbulent
dissipation is compensated by the kinetic energy input of the inflow. Molecular
hydrogen eventually forms when the surface density in the slab reaches a
threshold value of 1e21 cm^-2 at which point further cooling triggers the onset
of star formation by gravitational collapse. A few Myrs later, the newly formed
stars and resulting supernovae will disperse their molecular surrounding and
generate new expanding shells that drive again turbulence in the diffuse gas
and trigger the formation of a next generation of cold clouds. Although a
consistent scenario of interstellar medium dynamics and star formation is
emerging many details are still unclear and require more detailed work on
microphysical processes as well as a better understanding of supersonic,
compressible turbulence.

self-consistent N-body simulations of barred galaxies and compare them with
both photometric and kinematic observational data for M31. In particular, we
rely on the near infrared photometry presented in a companion paper. We compare
isodensity contours to isophotal contours and the light profile along cuts
parallel to the galaxy major axis and offset towards the North, or the South,
to mass profiles along similar cuts on the model. All these comparisons, as
well as position velocity diagrams for the gaseous component, give us strong
arguments that M31 is barred. We compare four fiducial N-body models to the

strength, length and orientation. Our `best' models, although not meant to be
exact models of M31, reproduce in a very satisfactory way the main relevant
observations. We present arguments that M31 has both a classical and a
boxy/peanut bulge. Its pseudo-ring-like structure at roughly 50' is near the
outer Lindblad resonance of the bar and could thus be an outer ring, as often
observed in barred galaxies. The shape of the isophotes also argues that the
vertically thin part of the M31 bar extends considerably further out than its
boxy bulge, i.e. that the boxy bulge is only part of the bar, thus confirming
predictions from orbital structure studies and from previous N-body

high photon sensitivity and low energy threshold. Below a few hundred GeV
energy, the so-called muon background becomes so intense, that it can
deteriorate the sensitivity of telescopes (the so-called muon-wall problem).
  From general considerations it can be anticipated that the signature of these

simulations show that the pulses from muons have a very narrow time profile
that is well below the time resolutions of nearly all currently operating

Closed equipotential surfaces corresponding to stationary toroidal discs are
allowed only in the spacetimes admitting stable circular geodesics. The last
closed surface crosses itself in the cusp(s) enabling outflow(s) of matter from
the torus due to the violation of hydrostatic equilibrium. The repulsive
cosmological constant, $\Lambda >0$, implies the existence of the outer cusp
(with a stabilizing effect on the tori because of ""excretion"", i.e., outflow of
matter from the torus into the outer space) and the strong collimation of open
equipotential surfaces along the rotational axis. Both the effects take place
nearby the so-called static radius where the gravitational attraction is just
balanced by the cosmic repulsion. The plus-family discs (which are always
corotating in the black-hole backgrounds but can be counterrotating, even with
negative energy of the fluid elements, in some naked singularity backgrounds)
are thicker and more extended than the minus-family ones (which are always
counterrotating in all backgrounds). If the parameters of naked-singularity
spacetimes are very close to the parameters of extreme black-hole spacetimes,
the family of possible disc-like configurations includes members with two
isolated discs where the inner one is always a counterrotating accretion disc.

onto a one-component system governed by effective macroion interactions. Linear
response of microions to the electrostatic potential of the macroions results
in a screened-Coulomb (Yukawa) effective pair potential and a one-body volume
energy, while nonlinear response modifies the effective interactions [A. R.
Denton, \PR E {\bf 70}, 031404 (2004)]. The volume energy and effective pair
potential are taken as input to a variational free energy, based on
thermodynamic perturbation theory. For both linear and first-order nonlinear
effective interactions, a coexistence analysis applied to aqueous suspensions

immediate consequence is that the logarithm of the normalization function can
be identified with the entropy, instead of the q-deformed logarithm. It has
been noted that such entropy coincides with Renyi entropy rather than Tsallis
entropy, it is non-additive, tends to the standard canonical entropy as the
power index tends to infinity and is consistent with the free energy formula
proposed in [S. Abe et. al. Phys. Lett. A 281, 126 (2001)]. It is also shown

between local and nonlocal nonlinearity. For a strong local nonlinearity, it is
shown that the creation of v quanta on one site excites a soliton band formed
by bound states involving v quanta trapped on the same site. The energy is
first localized on the excited site over a significant timescale and then
slowly delocalizes along the lattice. As when increasing the nonlocal
nonlinearity, a faster dynamics occurs and the energy propagates more rapidly
along the lattice. Nevertheless, the larger is the number of quanta, the slower
is the dynamics. However, it is shown that when the nonlocal nonlinearity
reaches a critical value, the lattice suddenly supports a very fast energy
propagation whose dynamics is almost independent on the number of quanta. The
energy is transfered by specific bound states formed by the superimposition of
states involving v-p quanta trapped on one site and p quanta trapped on the

independent quanta and they exhibit a dynamics which is insensitive to the

and charge modulations. Moderate on-site and intra-site electron-phonon
couplings lead to a competition of different spin-Peierls and dimerized states.
In the former case two electrons belong to the unit cell and we expect a
paramagnetic band insulator state, while lattice dimerization leads to a Mott
insulating state with quasi long range antiferromagnetic order. The zero
temperature phase diagram is obtained as a function of intra-site and
inter-site electron-phonon couplings, analytically in the $J\to 0$ limit and
numerically at finite J/t.

of supermassive black hole (BH) binaries up to very high redshifts. LISA can
measure mass parameters of such coalescences to a relative accuracy of
$10^{-4}-10^{-6}$, for sources at a distance of 3 Gpc. The problem of parameter
estimation of massive nonspinning binary black holes using post-Newtonian (PN)
phasing formula is studied in the context of LISA. Specifically, the
performance of the 3.5PN templates is contrasted against its 2PN counterpart
using a waveform which is averaged over the LISA pattern functions. The
improvement due to the higher order corrections to the phasing formula is
examined by calculating the errors in the estimation of mass parameters at each
order. The estimation of the mass parameters ${\cal M}$ and $\eta$ are
significantly enhanced by using the 3.5PN waveform instead of the 2PN one. For
an equal mass binary of $2\times10^6M_\odot$ at a luminosity distance of 3 Gpc,
the improvement in chirp mass is $\sim 11%$ and that of $\eta$ is $\sim 39%$.
Estimation of coalescence time $t_c$ worsens by 43%. The improvement is larger
for the unequal mass binary mergers. These results are compared to the ones
obtained using a non-pattern averaged waveform. The errors depend very much on
the location and orientation of the source and general conclusions cannot be
drawn without performing Monte Carlo simulations. Finally the effect of the
choice of the lower frequency cut-off for LISA on the parameter estimation is
studied.

equations of motion that are historically called non-Lagrangian equations. Our
viewpoint of this problem is the following: despite the fact that a set of

Euler-Lagrange equations, one can reformulate such a set in an equivalent
first-order form which can always be treated as the Euler-Lagrange equations of
a certain action. We construct such an action explicitly. It turns out that in
the general case the hamiltonization and canonical quantization of such an
action are non-trivial problems, since the theory involves time-dependent
constraints. We adopt the general approach of hamiltonization and canonical
quantization for such theories (Gitman, Tyutin, 1990) to the case under
consideration. There exists an ambiguity (not reduced to a total time
derivative) in associating a Lagrange function with a given set of equations.
We present a complete description of this ambiguity. The proposed scheme is
applied to the quantization of a general quadratic theory. In addition, we
consider the quantization of a damped oscillator and of a radiating point-like
charge.

found the most general local form of an hyperkahler torsion space in four

finding an hyperkahler torsion metric is reduced to solve a quadratic
differential system.

space metric of several $(n>1)$ identical matter hypermultiplets for the
type-IIA superstrings compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold, near conifold
singularities, even taking into account non-perturbative D-instanton quantum
corrections. The metric in consideration is ""toric hyperkahler"" if we do not
take into account the gravitational corrections.
  - It is constructed a family of toric hyperkahler spaces in eight dimensions.
This spaces are lifted to backgrounds of the eleven dimensional supergravity
preserving certain ammount of supersymmetry, with and without the presence of
fluxes. Several type IIA and IIB backgrounds have been found by reduction along

weak {\it and} strong coupling, can be expressed entirely in terms of constant
Polyakov lines which are $SU (N)$ matrices. In showing this we have taken into
account that there are no Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the fact that
the 10 dimensional blackhole solution sits at a point in $S^5$. We show that
the phase of the gauge theory in which the eigenvalue spectrum has a gap
corresponds to supergravity saddle points in the bulk theory. We identify the
third order $N = \infty$ phase transition with the blackhole-string transition.
This singularity can be resolved using a double scaling limit in the transition
region where the large N expansion is organized in terms of powers of
$N^{-2/3}$. The $N = \infty$ transition now becomes a smooth crossover in terms
of a renormalized string coupling constant, reflecting the physics of large but
finite N. Multiply wound Polyakov lines condense in the crossover region. We
also discuss the implications of our results for the resolution of the
singularity of the Lorenztian section of the small Schwarzschild blackhole.

established a pseudo-normal form for proper holomoprhic mappings between balls

characterization for all proper holomorphic maps with geometric rank one,
which, in particular, includes the following as an immediate application:
Theorem: Any rational holomorphic map from B^n into B^N with $4\le n\le N\le
3n-4$ is equivalent to the D'Angelo map
$$F_{\theta}(z',w)=(z',(\cos\theta)w,(\sin\theta)z_1w, ...,
(\sin\theta)z_{n-1}w, (\sin\theta)w^2, 0'), 0\le \theta\leq \pi/2.$$ It is a
well-known (but also quite trivial) fact that any non-constant rational CR map
from a piece of the sphere $\partial {B^n}$ into the sphere $\partial {B^N}$
can be extended as a proper rational holomoprhic map from $B^n$ into $B^N$
($N\ge n\ge 2$). By using the rationality theorem that the authors established
in [HJX05], one sees that the the above theorem (and also the main theorem of
the paper) holds in the same way for any non-constant $C^3$-smooth CR map from
a piece of $\partial {B^n}$ into $\partial{B^N}$. The paper [Math. Res. Lett.

presented for surfaces immersed in the ${\frak su}(2)$ algebra and we show that

in the input channel, we identify four different regimes of the pulses coupling

stop, thus suggesting three realizations of switching between the channels. As
in the case of the Kerr (solely cubic) nonlinearity, the first two regimes are
the linear one, and one dominated by the self-focusing nonlinearity, with the
beam which, respectively, periodically couples between the channels, or stays
in the input channel. Further increase of the power reveals two novel
transmission regimes, one characterized by balance between the competing
nonlinearities, which again allows full coupling between the channels, and a
final regime dominated by the self-defocusing quintic nonlinearity. In the

Bose-Einstein condensate trapped in a double-well potential, which is
characterized by strong symmetry breaking; accordingly, the beam again abides
in the input channel, contrary to an intuitive expectation that the

generalized energy functional method which includes the neutron and proton
pairing correlations is used. Predictions of two versions of the boundary
conditions are compared with each other. The uncertainties in the equilibrium
configuration (Z,R_c) of the crust, where Z is the proton charge and R_c, the
radius of the WS cell, correspond to variation of Z by 2 - 6 units and of R_c,
by 1 - 2 fm. The effect of the boundary conditions is enhanced at increasing
density. These uncertainties are smaller than the variation of Z and R_c coming
from the pairing effects.
  In the case of high densities, k_F greater than 1 1/fm, the most important
uncertainty occurs in the value of the neutron gap. In the WS approximation, it
originates from the shell effect in the neutron single-particle spectrum which
is rather pronounced in the case of larger k_F and, correspondingly, small R_c
values, but it becomes negligible at lower density near the drip point. An
approximate recipe to avoid this uncertainty is suggested.

consecutively sent e-mails (interevent time), and the time interval between
when a user sends an e-mail and when a recipient sends an e-mail back to the
original sender (waiting time). We perform a standard Bayesian model selection
analysis that demonstrates that the interevent times are well-described by a
single log-normal while the waiting times are better described by the
superposition of two log-normals. Our analysis rejects the possibility that
either measure could be described by truncated power-law distributions with

has been demonstrated in a variety of systems at low temperature1, 2. Of all
quantum systems, spins are potentially the most important, because they offer
very long phase memories, sometimes even at room temperature. Although precise
control of spins is well established in conventional magnetic resonance3, 4,
existing techniques usually do not allow the readout of single spins because of
limited sensitivity. In this paper, we explore dipolar magnetic coupling
between two single defects in diamond (nitrogen-vacancy and nitrogen) using
optical readout of the single nitrogen-vacancy spin states. Long phase memory
combined with a defect separation of a few lattice spacings allow us to explore
the strong magnetic coupling regime. As the two-defect system was well-isolated
from other defects, the long phase memory times of the single spins was not
diminished, despite the fact that dipolar interactions are usually seen as
undesirable sources of decoherence. A coherent superposition of spin pair
quantum states was achieved. The dipolar coupling was used to transfer spin
polarisation from a nitrogen-vacancy centre spin to a nitrogen spin, with
optical pumping of a nitrogen-vacancy centre leading to efficient
initialisation. At the level anticrossing efficient nuclear spin polarisation
was achieved. Our results demonstrate an important step towards controlled spin
coupling and multi-particle entanglement in the solid state.

"quant-ph/0605039","W. M. Stuckey","Michael Silberstein, Michael Cifone and W.M. Stuckey","An Argument for 4D Blockworld from a Geometric Interpretation of
  Non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics","39 pp text, 20 figures. Submitted to Relativity and the
  Dimensionality of the World (Springer-Verlag)",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We use a new distinctly ""geometrical"" interpretation of non-relativistic
quantum mechanics (NRQM) to argue for the fundamentality of the 4D blockworld
ontology. Our interpretation rests on two formal results: Kaiser, Bohr &
Ulfbeck and Anandan showed independently that the Heisenberg commutation
relations of NRQM follow from the relativity of simultaneity (RoS) per the
Poincare Lie algebra, and Bohr, Ulfbeck & Mottelson showed that the density
matrix for a particular NRQM experimental outcome may be obtained from the
spacetime symmetry group of the experimental configuration. Together these
formal results imply that contrary to accepted wisdom, NRQM, the measurement
problem and so-called quantum non-locality do not provide reasons to abandon
the 4D blockworld implication of RoS. After discussing the full philosophical
implications of these formal results, we motivate and derive the Born rule in
the context of our ontology of spacetime relations via Anandan. Finally, we
apply our explanatory and descriptive methodology to a particular experimental
set-up (the so-called ""quantum liar experiment"") and thereby show how the
blockworld view is not only consistent with NRQM, not only an implication of
our geometrical interpretation of NRQM, but it is necessary in a non-trivial
way for explaining quantum interference and ""non-locality"" from the spacetime
perspective.
