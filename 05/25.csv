is undergoing a late-time acceleration. Among many proposals to describe this
phenomenon, the cosmological constant seems to be the simplest and the most
natural explanation. However, despite its observational successes, such a
possibility exacerbates the well known cosmological constant problem, requiring
a natural explanation for its small, but nonzero, value. In this paper we
consider a cosmological scenario driven by a varying cosmological term, in
which the vacuum energy density decays linearly with the Hubble parameter. We
show that this model is indistinguishable from the standard one in that the
early radiation phase is followed by a long dust-dominated era, and only
recently the varying cosmological term becomes dominant, accelerating the
cosmic expansion. In order to test the viability of this scenario we have used
the most recent type Ia supernova data, i.e., the High-Z SN Search (HZS) Team
and the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) Collaboration data. In particular, for
the SNLS sample we have found the present matter density and Hubble parameters
in the intervals [0.27, 0.37] and [0.68, 0.72], respectively (at 95% c.l.),
which is in good agreement with the currently accepted estimates for these
parameters.

to the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker equations. However, when the universe is very

In particular, the average expansion rate can accelerate even though the local
expansion rate decelerates everywhere. We clarify the physical meaning of this
paradoxical feature with a simple toy model, and demonstrate how acceleration
is intimately connected with gravitational collapse. This provides a link to
structure formation, which in turn has a preferred time around the era when

bands of H_2O at 6.27 microns, CH_4 at 7.65 microns, and NH_3 at 10.5 microns

supergiants and 6 late-B and early-A (B8-A2) stars of luminosity class between
Ia and II, as well as an O7~V star and an O9.7 Ia star. The spectra of several
of these stars is of sufficiently high quality for a determination of the
stellar parameters and abundances. We have acquired also a second set of lower
S/N spectra for mostly BA stars, however their quality does not allow a further
analysis. We have carried out a quantitative analysis for three early-B
supergiants. The mean oxygen abundance we derive is 12+log(O/H)=7.83 +/- 0.12.
This value agrees very well with the measurement that is obtained from HII
regions. We therefore find no additional evidence for the discrepancy between
stellar and nebular oxygen abundances measured for a single A-type supergiant
by Venn et al. The analysis of B- and A-type supergiants yields compatible
results for nitrogen, silicon and magnesium. We show that the photometric
variability of the blue supergiants included in our spectroscopic sample is
negligible for the use of these stars as distance indicators.

  Accepted for publication in Ap.J","Astrophys.J.653:454-461,2006","10.1086/508681",,"astro-ph",,"  Synchrotron emission is believed to be a major radiation mechanism during
gamma-ray bursts' (GRBs) prompt emission phase. A significant drawback of this
assumption is that the theoretical predicted spectrum, calculated within the
framework of the ``internal shocks'' scenario using the standard assumption
that the magnetic field maintains a steady value throughout the shocked region,
leads to a slope F_\nu \propto \nu^{-1/2} below 100 keV, which is in
contradiction to the much harder spectra observed. This is due to the electrons
cooling time being much shorter than the dynamical time. In order to overcome
this problem, we propose here that the magnetic field created by the internal
shocks decays on a length scale much shorter than the comoving width of the
plasma. We show that under this assumption synchrotron radiation can reproduce
the observed prompt emission spectra of the majority of the bursts. We
calculate the required decay length of the magnetic field, and find it to be
\~10^4 - 10^5 cm (equivalent to 10^5 - 10^6 skin depths), much shorter than the
characteristic comoving width of the plasma, ~3*10^{9} cm. We implement our
model to the case of GRB050820A, where a break at <~ 4 keV was observed, and
show that this break can be explained by synchrotron self absorption. We
discuss the consequences of the small scale magnetic field scenario on current
models of magnetic field generation in shock waves.

of icy comets surrounding the star or catalysis on iron grain surfaces have
been invoked to explain the presence of such unexpected species. This detailed
study aims at evaluating the chances of producing O-bearing species in the
C-rich circumstellar envelope only by gas phase chemical reactions. For the
inner hot envelope, it is shown that although most of the oxygen is locked in
CO near the photosphere (as expected for a C/O ratio greater than 1), some
stellar radii far away species such as H2O and CO2 have large abundances under
the assumption of thermochemical equilibrium. It is also shown how non-LTE
chemistry makes very difficult the CO-->H2O,CO2 transformation predicted in
LTE. Concerning the chemistry in the outer and colder envelope, we show that
formaldehyde can be formed through gas phase reactions. However, in order to
form water vapor it is necessary to include a radiative association between
atomic oxygen and molecular hydrogen with a quite high rate constant. The
chemical models explain the presence of HCO+ and predict the existence of SO

to a non-rotating inertial frame. In addition, phase shifts in electron waves
due to magnetic vector potentials (the Aharonov-Bohm effect) show that physical
states can be modified in the absence of classical forces. We report here the
observation of interference induced by the Earth's rotation in superfluid 4He
at 2 K, a temperature 2000 times higher than previously achieved with 3He. This
interferometer, an analog of a dc-SQUID, employs a recently reported phenomenon
wherein superfluid 4He exhibits quantum oscillations in an array of sub-micron
apertures. We find that the interference pattern persists not only when the
aperture array current-phase relation is a sinusoidal function characteristic
of the Josephson effect, but also at lower temperatures where it is linear and
oscillations occur by phase slips. The modest requirements for the
interferometer (2 K cryogenics and fabrication of apertures at the level of
100nm) and its potential resolution suggest that, when engineering challenges
such as vibration isolation are met, superfluid 4He interferometers could
become important scientific probes.

Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) method with high intensity synchrotron

solutions induced the appearance of the $\rm Im\bar{3}m$ structure coexisting

parameters of these two structures it was shown that they were related by the
Bonnet transformation of underlying triply periodic minimal surfaces. We found
that the transition also occurred at lower lysozyme concentration when NaCl
induced attraction between lysozyme molecules. The origin of the transition was
considered as a frustration in the cubic phase where lysozyme molecules were
highly confined. A simple estimation of the frustration was given, which took
into account of the translational entropy of lysozyme molecules. At the highest
concentration of lysozyme and NaCl the $\rm Im\bar{3}m$ structure was found to
disappear and left only the $\rm Pn\bar{3}m$ structure. This was probably
either due to the crystallization or phase separation of lysozyme solutions
ongoing microscopically, which absorbed lysozyme molecules from channels of the

pronounced when this function has a pair of nodes lying on either side of the
Fermi surface. We demonstrate that such a situation arises if the P-wave
pairing interaction $V(p_1,p_2)$, evaluated at the Fermi surface, has a sign
opposite to that anticipated in BCS theory. Taking account of the momentum
structure of the gap function, we derive a closed relation between the two

we develop a test which examines the grammar as it changes, stopping the parse

prove that it is correct. That being done, we turn to earlier, related work;
the idea of programming languages which can be extended to include new

were hampered by an immature theory of formal languages. More recent efforts to
construct transformative languages relied either on an inefficient chain of

does not have these undesirable properties, and as such, it should prove a

correlations P_ABE, shared between two honest parties and an eavesdropper. The
most studied distillation scenario consists of joint operations on a large
number of copies of the distribution (P_ABE)^N, assisted with public
communication. Here we consider distillation with only one copy of the
distribution, and instead of rates, the 'quality' of the distilled secret bits
is optimized, where the 'quality' is quantified by the secret-bit fraction of
the result. The secret-bit fraction of a binary distribution is the proportion
which constitutes a secret bit between Alice and Bob. With local operations and
public communication the maximal extractable secret-bit fraction from a
distribution P_ABE is found, and is denoted by Lambda[P_ABE]. This quantity is
shown to be nonincreasing under local operations and public communication, and
nondecreasing under eavesdropper's local operations: it is a secrecy monotone.
It is shown that if Lambda[P_ABE]>1/2 then P_ABE is distillable, thus providing
a sufficient condition for distillability. A simple expression for
Lambda[P_ABE] is found when the eavesdropper is decoupled, and when the honest
parties' information is binary and the local operations are reversible.
Intriguingly, for general distributions the (optimal) operation requires local
degradation of the data.

activities are surveyed, and popular computer-aided design methodologies are
examined. It is argued that semiotics has the potential to merge and unite
various design approaches into one fundamental theory that is naturally
interpretable and so comprehensible in terms of computer use. Reviewing related
work in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science provides a general and
encompassing vision of the creativity phenomenon. Basic notions of algebraic
semiotics are given and explained in terms of design. This is to define a model
of the design creative process, which is seen as a process of semiosis, where
concepts and their attributes represented as signs organized into systems are
evolved, blended, and analyzed, resulting in the development of new concepts.
The model allows us to formally describe and investigate essential properties
of the design process, namely its dynamics and non-determinism inherent in
creative thinking. A stable pattern of creative thought - analogical and
metaphorical reasoning - is specified to demonstrate the expressive power of
the modeling approach; illustrative examples are given. The developed theory is
applied to clarify the nature of emergence in design: it is shown that while
emergent properties of a product may influence its creative value, emergence
can simply be seen as a by-product of the creative process. Concluding remarks
summarize the research, point to some unresolved issues, and outline directions

fact has been used to conjecture that the resulting models correspond to the
spatially homogeneous (SH) models of Bianchi type I, at least for the case
where the cosmological constant vanish. By exploiting the full set of the
constraint equations as expressed in the 1+3 covariant formalism and using
elements from the theory of the spacelike congruences, we provide a direct and
simple proof of this conjecture for vacuum and dust fluid models, which shows
that the Szekeres family of solutions represents the most general class of SIIS
models. The suggested procedure also shows that, the uniqueness of the SIIS of
the Petrov type D is not, in general, affected by the presence of a non-zero
pressure fluid. Therefore, in order to allow a broader class of Petrov type I
solutions apart from the SH models of Bianchi type I, one should consider more
general ``silent'' configurations by relaxing the vanishing of the vorticity
and the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor but maintaining their ``silence''
properties i.e. the vanishing of the curls of $E_{ab},H_{ab}$ and the pressure
$p$.

the gauge sector, we explore the geometry with such torsions. After reviewing
the supersymmetry constraints and finding a relation between the scalar

compactification with $H\neq 0$ and $\d H=0$ is necessarily singular, and the
formal positivity is invalid. With $\d H\neq 0$, smooth compactification
becomes possible. We show that, at least near smooth supersymmetric solution,
the size of $H^2$ should be comparable to that of $\d H$ and the consistent
truncation of action has to keep $\alpha'R^2$ term. A warp factor equation of
motion is rewritten with $\alpha' R^2$ contribution included precisely, and
some limits are considered.

a simple approximation which turns out to be quite accurate, the solution of

obtained in the derivative expansion. Thus, with a numerical effort comparable
to that involved in the derivative expansion, we can get the full momentum

dynamics: iterations of rational functions on the Riemann sphere and Kleinian
groups. The latters are discrete subgroups of the group of conformal
automorphisms of the Riemann sphere. This dictionary motivated many remarkable
results in both domains, starting from the famous Sullivan's no wandering
domain theorem in the theory of iterations of rational functions.
  One of the principal objects used in the study of Kleinian groups is the
hyperbolic 3- manifold associated to a Kleinian group, which is the quotient of
its lifted action to the hyperbolic 3- space. M.Lyubich and Y.Minsky have
suggested to extend Sullivan's dictionary by providing an analogous
construction for iterations of rational functions. Namely, they have
constructed a lamination by three-dimensional manifolds equipped with a
continuous family with hyperbolic metrics on them (may be with singularities).
The action of the rational mapping on the sphere lifts naturally up to
homeomorphic action on the hyperbolic lamination that is isometric along the
leaves. The action on the hyperbolic lamination admits a well-defined quotient
called {\it the quotient hyperbolic lamination}.
  We study the arrangement of the horospheres in the quotient hyperbolic
lamination. The main result says that if a rational function does not belong to
a small list of exceptions (powers, Chebyshev and Latt\`es), then there are
many dense horospheres, i.e., the horospheric lamination is
topologically-transitive. We show that for ""many"" rational functions
(hyperbolic or critically-nonrecurrent nonparabolic) the quotient horospheric
lamination is minimal: each horosphere is dense.

a compact connected oriented surface with boundary, into a group of Hermitian
type. For any such representation we define the Toledo invariant, for which we
establish properties such as uniform boundedness on the representation variety,
additivity under connected sum of surfaces and congruence relations. We thus
obtain geometric properties of the maximalrepresentations, that is
representations whose Toledo invariant achieves the maximum value: we show that
maximal representations have discrete image, are faithful and completely
reducible and they always preserve a maximal tube type subdomain. This extends
to the case of a general Hermitian group some of the properties of the
representations in Teichmuller space, as well as results due to Goldman,
Toledo, Hernandez, Bradlow--Garcia-Prada--Gothen. An announcement of these
results in the case of surfaces without boundary -- where the role of tube type
domains had already been emphasized -- appeared in 2003 by the same authors.
  The congruence relations for the Toledo invariant involve a rotation number
function related to a continuous homogeneous quasimorphism which gives an
explicit way to compute the Toledo invariant. This rotation number generalizes
constructions due to Ghys, Barge--Ghys, and Clerc--Koufany.
  We establish moreover properties of boundary maps associated to maximal
representations which generalize naturally, for the causal structure of the
Shilov boundary, monotonicity properties of quasiconjugations of the circle.
This, together with the congruence relations leads to the result that the
subset of maximal representations is always real semialgebraic.

$\partial u/\partial t = \kappa\Delta u + \xi u$, where $u\colon \Z^d\times
[0,\infty)\to\R$, $\kappa$ is the diffusion constant, $\Delta$ is the discrete
Laplacian, and $\xi\colon \Z^d\times [0,\infty)\to\R$ is a space-time random
medium. The solution of the equation describes the evolution of a ``reactant''
$u$ under the influence of a ``catalyst'' $\xi$.
  In this paper we focus on the case where $\xi$ is exclusion with a symmetric
random walk transition kernel, starting from equilibrium with density $\rho\in
(0,1)$. We consider the annealed Lyapunov exponents, i.e., the exponential
growth rates of the successive moments of $u$. We show that these exponents are
trivial when the random walk is recurrent, but display an interesting
dependence on the diffusion constant $\kappa$ when the random walk is
transient, with qualitatively different behavior in different dimensions.
Special attention is given to the asymptotics of the exponents for
$\kappa\to\infty$, which is controlled by moderate deviations of $\xi$
requiring a delicate expansion argument.
  In G\""artner and den Hollander \cite{garhol04} the case where $\xi$ is a
Poisson field of independent (simple) random walks was studied. The two cases
show interesting differences and similarities. Throughout the paper, a

frequency that increases linearly with the number of oscillators, but with an
amplitude that stays fairly constant. The analysis of the theory is illustrated

aspects of his fundamental scientific production in atomic and molecular
physics, including a not well known short communication. There, Majorana
critically discusses Fermi's solution of the celebrated Thomas-Fermi equation
for electron screening in atoms and positive ions. We argue that some of
Majorana's seminal contributions in molecular physics already prelude to the
idea of exchange interactions (or Heisenberg-Majorana forces) in his later
workson theoretical nuclear physics. In all his papers, he tended to emphasize
the symmetries at the basis of a physical problem, as well as the limitations,
rather than the advantages, of the approximations of the method employed.

the population structure underlying the disease spread. When analyzing global
epidemics this force us to consider metapopulation models taking into account
intra- and inter-community interactions. Recently Watts et al introduced a
metapopulation model which accounts for several features observed in real
outbreaks [Watts et al, PNAS 102, 11157 (2005)]. In this work I provide an
analytical solution to this model, enhancing our understanding of the model and
the epidemic outbreaks it represents. First, I demonstrate that depending on
the intra-community expected outbreak size and the fraction of social bridges
the epidemic outbreaks die out or there is a finite probability to observe a
global epidemics. Second, I show that the global scenario is characterized by
resurgent epidemics, their number increasing with increasing the
intra-community average distance between individuals. Finally, I present
empirical data for the AIDS epidemics supporting the model predictions.

to fold to thermodynamically stable native structures. This process of neutral
protein evolution is an important mode of genetic change, and forms the basis
for the molecular clock. Here we present a mathematical theory that predicts
the number of accumulated mutations, the index of dispersion, and the
distribution of stabilities in an evolving protein population from knowledge of
the stability effects (ddG values) for single mutations. Our theory
quantitatively describes how neutral evolution leads to marginally stable
proteins, and provides formulae for calculating how fluctuations in stability
cause an overdispersion of the molecular clock. It also shows that the
structural influences on the rate of sequence evolution that have been observed
in earlier simulations can be calculated using only the single-mutation ddG
values. We consider both the case when the product of the population size and
mutation rate is small and the case when this product is large, and show that
in the latter case proteins evolve excess mutational robustness that is
manifested by extra stability and increases the rate of sequence evolution. Our
basic method is to treat protein evolution as a Markov process constrained by a
minimal requirement for stable folding, enabling an evolutionary description of
the proteins solely in terms of the experimentally measureable ddG values. All
of our theoretical predictions are confirmed by simulations with model lattice
proteins. Our work provides a mathematical foundation for understanding how
protein biophysics helps shape the process of evolution.

numerical simulations, we address this issue by studying the properties of a
paradigmatic non-spatial three-species stochastic system, namely the
`rock-paper-scissors' or cyclic Lotka-Volterra model. While the deterministic
approach (rate equations) predicts the coexistence of the species resulting in
regular (yet neutrally stable) oscillations of the population densities, we
demonstrate that fluctuations arising in the system with a \emph{finite number
of agents} drastically alter this picture and are responsible for extinction:
After long enough time, two of the three species die out. As main findings we
provide analytic estimates and numerical computation of the extinction
probability at a given time. We also discuss the implications of our results
for a broad class of competing population systems.

a dishonest server from eavesdropping, some decoy photons prepared by measuring
one photon in the Bell states are used to replace some original photons. One of
the users on the network can communicate any other one. This scheme has the
advantage of high capacity, and it is more convenient than others as only a

is still not exploited fully in quantum computation. The exploitation of such
power definitely requires a deep understanding of the mechanism of quantum loop
programs. In this paper, we introduce a general scheme of quantum loops and
describe its computational process. The notions of termination and almost
termination are proposed for quantum loops, and the function computed by a
quantum loop is defined. To show their expressive power, quantum loops are
applied in describing quantum walks. Necessary and sufficient conditions for
termination and almost termination of a general quantum loop on any mixed input
state are presented. A quantum loop is said to be (almost) terminating if it
(almost) terminates on any input state. We show that a quantum loop is almost
terminating if and only if it is uniformly almost terminating. It is observed
that a small disturbance either on the unitary transformation in the loop body
or on the measurement in the loop guard can make any quantum loop (almost)
terminating. Moreover, a representation of the function computed by a quantum
loop is given in terms of finite summations of matrices. To illustrate the
notions and results obtained in this paper, two simplest classes of quantum
loop programs, one qubit quantum loops, and two qubit quantum loops defined by
controlled gates, are carefully examined.
