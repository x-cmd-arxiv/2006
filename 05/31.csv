moderate resolution IR spectra of two QSOs taken with GNIRS on Gemini South.
These data were systematically searched for high redshift CIV absorption lines,
using objective selection criteria. Comprehensive tests were performed to
quantify sample incompleteness, as well as the rate of false positive CIV
identifications. The trend of constant $\Omega_{CIV}(z)$ observed at z~2-5
appears to continue to z~6, the highest observed redshift. The CIV sample is
also consistent with the redshift-invariant form of the CIV column density
distribution reported by Songaila (2001) at lower redshift, although with
fairly large uncertainties due to a smaller sample size and noisier infrared
data. The constant value of $\Omega_{CIV}$ does not necessarily imply that the
IGM was infused with an early metallicity ``floor,'' but the presence of early
CIV does indicate that heavy-element enrichment began < 1 Gyr after the Big
Bang. The lack of a decline in $\Omega_{CIV}$ at high redshift may indicate
that integrated CIV measurements are sensitive to the instantaneous rate of
feedback from galaxy formation at each epoch. Alternatively, it could result
from a balance in the evolution of the intergalactic gas density, ionization
conditions, and heavy-element abundance over time.

observational/theoretical studies of supernovae (SNe) and extremely metal-poor
(EMP) stars in the halo, which have provided excellent opportunities to test
the explosion models and their nucleosynthesis. We use the light curve and
spectra fitting of individual SN to estimate the mass of the progenitor,
explosion energy, and produced 56Ni mass. Comparison with the abundance
patterns of EMP stars has made it possible to determine the model parameters of
core-collapse SNe, such as mixing-fallback parameters.
  More specifically, we take into account the two distinct new classes of
massive SNe: 1) very energetic Hypernovae, whose kinetic energy (KE) is more
than 10 times the KE of normal core-collapse SNe, and 2) very faint and low
energy SNe (Faint SNe). These two new classes of SNe are likely to be
``black-hole-forming'' SNe with rotating or non-rotating black holes.
Nucleosynthesis in Hypernovae is characterized by larger abundance ratios
(Zn,Co,V,Ti)/Fe and smaller (Mn,Cr)/Fe than normal SNe, which can explain the
observed trends of these ratios in EMP stars. Nucleosynthesis in Faint SNe is
characterized by a large amount of fall-back, which explains the abundance
pattern of the most Fe-poor stars. These comparisons suggest that
black-hole-forming SNe made important contributions to the early Galactic (and
cosmic) chemical evolution.

  Journal","Astrophys.J.651:906-913,2006","10.1086/507762",,"astro-ph",,"  It was recently discovered that the temperature in the surface layer of
externally heated optically thick gray dust clouds increases with the optical
depth for some distance from the surface, as opposed to the normal decrease in
temperature with distance in the rest of the cloud. This temperature inversion
is a result of efficient absorption of diffuse flux from the cloud interior by
the surface dust exposed to the external radiation. A micron or bigger size
grains experience this effect when the external flux is of stellar spectrum. We
explore what happens to the effect when dust is a mixture of grain sizes
(multigrain). Two possible boundary conditions are considered: i) a constant
external flux without constrains on the dust temperature, and ii) the maximum
dust temperature set to the sublimation temperature. We find that the first
condition allows small grains to completely suppress the temperature inversion
of big grains if the overall opacity is dominated by small grains. The second
condition enables big grains to maintain the inversion even when they are a
minor contributor to the opacity. In reality, the choice of boundary condition
depends on the dust dynamics. When applied to the physics of protoplanetary
disks, the temperature inversion leads to a previously unrecognized disk
structure where optically thin dust can exist inside the dust destruction
radius of an optically thick disk. We conclude that the transition between the
dusty disk and the gaseous inner clearing is not a sharp edge, but rather a
large optically thin region.

gluon fusion dominates the creation of large angle $D\bar{D}$ pairs, charm on
light parton scattering determines the yield of single inclusive $D$ mesons.
The distinctly different non-perturbative fragmentation of $c$ quarks into $D$
mesons versus the fragmentation of quarks and gluons into light hadrons results
in a strong transverse momentum dependence of anticharm content of the
away-side charm-triggered jet. In p+A reactions, we calculate and resum the
coherent nuclear-enhanced power corrections from the final-state partonic
scattering in the medium. We find that single and double inclusive open charm
production can be suppressed as much as the yield of neutral pions from

also investigated in the incoherent Bertsch-Gunion limit and may lead to
significantly weaker transverse momentum dependence of the nuclear attenuation.

on single trace Wilson operators built from holomorphic scalar fields and an
arbitrary number of covariant derivatives in N=2 and N=4 supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theories. We demonstrate that its eigenspectrum exhibits double
degeneracy of opposite parity eigenstates which suggests that the two-loop
dilatation operator is integrable. Moreover, the two-loop anomalous dimensions
in the two theories differ from each other by an overall normalization factor
indicating that the phenomenon is not sensitive to the presence of the
conformal symmetry. Relying on these findings, we try to uncover integrable
structures behind the two-loop dilatation operator using the method of the
Baxter Q-operator. We propose a deformed Baxter equation which exactly encodes
the spectrum of two-loop anomalous dimensions and argue that it correctly
incorporates a peculiar feature of conformal scalar operators -- the conformal
SL(2) spin of such operators is modified in higher loops by an amount
proportional to their anomalous dimension. From the point of view of spin
chains this property implies that the underlying integrable model is
``self-tuned'' -- the all-loop Hamiltonian of the spin chain depends on the
total SL(2) spin which in its turn is proportional to the Hamiltonian.

bounded above by a constant independent of the step number. We show that the CG
method with variable preconditioning under this assumption may not give
improvement, compared to the steepest descent (SD) method. We describe the
basic theory of CG methods with variable preconditioning with the emphasis on
``worst case' scenarios, and provide complete proofs of all facts not available
in the literature. We give a new elegant geometric proof of the SD convergence
rate bound. Our numerical experiments, comparing the preconditioned SD and CG
methods, not only support and illustrate our theoretical findings, but also
reveal two surprising and potentially practically important effects. First, we
analyze variable preconditioning in the form of inner-outer iterations. In
previous such tests, the unpreconditioned CG inner iterations are applied to an
artificial system with some fixed preconditioner as a matrix of coefficients.
We test a different scenario, where the unpreconditioned CG inner iterations
solve linear systems with the original system matrix $A$. We demonstrate that
the CG-SD inner-outer iterations perform as well as the CG-CG inner-outer
iterations in these tests. Second, we show that variable preconditioning may
surprisingly accelerate the SD and thus the CG convergence. Specifically, we
compare the CG methods using a two-grid preconditioning with fixed and randomly
chosen coarse grids, and observe that the fixed preconditioner method is twice
as slow as the method with random preconditioning.

many-body system which lead to a fragmentation of the single-particle strength
over a wide range of energies and momenta. We address the question of how this
fragmentation affects the thermodynamical properties of nuclear matter. In
particular, we show that the entropy can be computed with the help of a
spectral function which can be evaluated in terms of the self-energy obtained
in the Self-Consistent Green's Function approach. Results for the density and
temperature dependences of the entropy per particle for symmetric nuclear
matter are presented and compared to the results of lowest order finite
temperature Brueckner--Hartree--Fock calculations. The effects of correlations
on the calculated entropy are small, if the appropriate quasi-particle
approximation is used. The results demonstrate the thermodynamical consistency
of the self-consistent T-matrix approximation for the evaluation of the Green's
functions.

function is analyzed. Breakup calculations of loosely bound nuclei (8B and
11Be) are performed with two different descriptions of the projectile. The
descriptions differ strongly in the interior of the wave function, but exhibit
identical asymptotic properties, namely the same asymptotic normalization
coefficient, and phase shifts. Breakup calculations are performed at
intermediate energies (40-70 MeV/nucleon) on lead and carbon targets as well as
at low energy (26 MeV) on a nickel target. No dependence on the projectile
description is observed. This result confirms that breakup reactions are
peripheral in the sense that they probe only the external part of the wave
function. These measurements are thus not directly sensitive to the total
normalization of the wave function, i.e. spectroscopic factor.

questions is how the quality of a song is judged and how voting groups emerge.
We investigate structures that may identify the winner based purely on the
topology of the network. This provides a basic framework to identify what the
characteristics associated with becoming a winner are, and may help to
establish a homogenous criterion for subjective measures such as quality.
Further, we measure the importance of voting cliques, and present a dynamic
model based on a changing multidimensional measure of connectivity in order to
reveal the formation of emerging community structure within the contest.
Finally, we study the dynamic behaviour exhibited by the network in order to
understand the clustering of voting preferences and the relationship between
local and global properties.

Periods immediately before storms and periods well before them were studied by
applying a method recently introduced in the literature. Statistical properties
of both types of periods have been compared. One of the compared quantities was
the slope of the power laws that have been found for some relevant
distributions. A systematic deviation between slope distributions was found.
This might be the fingerprint of a non self-organized component in records.
There has also been found a correlation between slope values and the
corresponding storm intensities, which could serve as a probabilistic approach
to magnetic storms forecasting. Data is from the low latitude Vassouras

as a result of comparing the circulation actually observed downstream with a
well-known theoretical estimate of the total circulation generated by a

an alternative estimate of the circulation generated by a cylinder is derived
by integrating the velocity on a closed loop containing the attached boundary
layer. Predictions of the dimensionless circulation for a cylinder in cross
flow are less than the previous theoretical estimate and agree with observed
values. This suggests that the total circulation generated by bluff bodies may
have been overestimated in the past, and that comparison of observed values
with this overestimate is the origin of the perceived ""loss"" in circulation.
