telescope to search for low mass companions of the nearby debris disk star
epsilon Eridani. The star was observed in two epochs 39 days apart, with
different focal plane rotation to allow the subtraction of the instrumental
Point Spread Function, achieving a maximum sensitivity of 0.01 MJy/sr at 3.6
and 4.5 um, and 0.05 MJy/sr at 5.8 and 8.0 um. This sensitivity is not
sufficient to directly detect scattered or thermal radiation from the epsilon
Eridani debris disk. It is however sufficient to allow the detection of Jovian
planets with mass as low as 1 MJ in the IRAC 4.5 um band. In this band, we
detected over 460 sources within the 5.70 arcmin field of view of our images.
To test if any of these sources could be a low mass companion to epsilon
Eridani, we have compared their colors and magnitudes with models and
photometry of low mass objects. Of the sources detected in at least two IRAC
bands, none fall into the range of mid-IR color and luminosity expected for
cool, 1 Gyr substellar and planetary mass companions of epsilon Eridani, as
determined by both models and observations of field M, L and T dwarf. We
identify three new sources which have detections at 4.5 um only, the lower
limit placed on their [3.6]-[4.5] color consistent with models of planetary
mass objects. Their nature cannot be established with the currently available
data and a new observation at a later epoch will be needed to measure their
proper motion, in order to determine if they are physically associated to
epsilon Eridani.

two-dimensional phenomena derived from their square planar CuO2 building
blocks. This is especially true of the magnetism from the copper ions. As
mobile charge carriers enter the CuO2 layers, the antiferromagnetism of the
parent insulators, where each copper spin is antiparallel to its nearest
neighbours1, evolves into a fluctuating state where the spins show tendencies
towards magnetic order of a longer periodicity. For certain charge carrier
densities, quantum fluctuations are sufficiently suppressed to yield static
long-period order2,3,4,5,6, and external magnetic fields also induce such
order7,8,9,10,11,12. Here we show that in contrast to the chemically-controlled
order in superconducting samples, the field-induced order in these same samples
is actually three-dimensional, implying significant magnetic linkage between
the CuO2 planes. The results are important because they show that there are
three-dimensional magnetic couplings which survive into the superconducting
state, and coexist with the crucial inter-layer couplings responsible for
three-dimensional superconductivity. Both types of coupling will straighten the
vortex lines, implying that we have finally established a direct link between
technical superconductivity, which requires zero electrical resistance in an
applied magnetic field and depends on vortex dynamics, and the underlying
antiferromagnetism of the cuprates.

in the Planck's constant, many-body potential scattering problem simplifies to
a statistical-mechanical problem of computing an ensemble of quantum

equations pertains rigorously at any fixed order in $\hbar$. We present
semiclassical expansion of quantum characteristics for many-body scattering

admits the consistent incorporation of specific quantum effects, such as
non-locality and coherence in propagation of particles, into the semiclassical
transport models. We formulate the principle of stationary action for quantum
Hamilton's equations and give quantum-mechanical extensions of the Liouville

how important instances of this problem can be related to the study of shortest
paths on the surface of a sphere under a special metric. Specifically, we
provide an efficient synthesis of a controlled NOT (CNOT) gate between qubits
coupled indirectly via Ising-type couplings to a third spin. Our implementation
of the CNOT gate is more than twice as fast as conventional approaches. The
pulse sequences for efficient manipulation of our coupled spin system are
obtained by explicit computation of geodesics on a sphere under the special
metric. These methods are also used for the efficient synthesis of indirect
couplings and of the Toffoli gate. We provide experimental realizations of the
presented methods on a linear three-spin chain with Ising couplings.

  NOTE IN ABSTRACT","J.Phys.A40:2935-2958,2007; Erratum-ibid.A40:13501,2007","10.1088/1751-8113/40/12/S03 10.1088/1751-8121/40/44/C01",,"quant-ph hep-ph hep-th",,"  We study lower and upper bounds on the parameters for stochastic state vector
reduction, focusing on the mass-proportional continuous spontaneous
localization (CSL) model. We show that the assumption that the state vector is
reduced whan a latent image is formed, in photography or etched track
detection, requires a CSL rate parameter $\lambda$ that is larger than
conventionally assumed by a factor of roughly $2 \times 10^{9\pm 2}$, for a
correlation length $r_C$ of $10^{-5}{\rm cm}$. We reanalyze existing upper
bounds on the reduction rate and conclude that all are compatible with such an
increase in $\lambda$. The best bounds that we have obtained come from a
consideration of heating of the intergalactic medium (IGM), which shows that
$\lambda$ can be at most $\sim 10^{8\pm 1}$ times as large as the standard CSL
value, again for $r_C=10^{-5} {\rm cm}$. (For both the lower and upper bounds,
quoted errors are not purely statistical errors, but rather are estimates
reflecting modeling uncertainties.) We discuss modifications in our analysis
corresponding to a larger value of $r_C$. With a substantially enlarged rate
parameter, CSL effects may be within range of experimental detection (or
refutation) with current technologies. ADDED NOTE: A careful calculation of
radiation from atomic systems in the CSL model (Adler and Ramazanoglu,
arXiv:0707.3134) has reinstated the bound obtained by Fu as the best upper
bound on lambda, with significant implications for CSL model phenomenology.
