primary type of cosmic rays at low energies. We suggest that the
Compton-Getting effect can play a similar role at ultra-high energies: If at
these energies the cosmic ray flux is dominated by sources at cosmological
distances, then the movement of the Sun relative to the cosmic microwave
background frame induces a dipole anisotropy at the 0.6% level. The energy
dependence and the orientation of this anisotropy provide important information
about the transition between galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays, the charge
of the cosmic ray primaries, the galactic magnetic field and, at the highest
energies, the energy-loss horizon of cosmic rays. A 3-sigma detection of this
effect requires around 10^6 events in the considered energy range and is thus
challenging but not impossible with present detectors. As a corollary we note
that the Compton-Getting effect allows one also to constrain the fraction of
the diffuse gamma-ray background emitted by sources at cosmological distance,
with promising detection possibilities for the GLAST satellite.

most extensive NIR spectral atlas of AGN to date. This atlas offers a suitable
database for studying the continuum and line emission properties of these
objects in a region full of interesting features. The shape of the continuum of
QSOs and Seyfert 1's are similar, being essentially flat in H and K band, in
the J band, a strong variation is found. In Seyfert 2 galaxies, the continuum
in the F_lambda X lambda space smoothly decreases from 1.2 microns redwards in
almost all sources. In J, it smoothly rises bluewards in some sources while in
others a small decreased in flux is observed. The spectra are dominated by
strong emission features of H I, He I, He II, [S III] and conspicuous forbidden
lines of low and high ionization species. Molecular lines of H2 are common
features to most objects. The absence of O I and Fe II lines in Seyfert 2
galaxies give observational support to the fact that these lines are formated
in the outermost portion of the broad line region. [P II] and coronal lines are
detected in all degrees of activity. The [Fe II] 12570A/16436A line ratio
becomes a reliable reddening indicator for the narrow-line region of Seyfert

Tau/4, no excess above the photosphere appears at wavelengths shortward of the

background galaxies. The multiple images are based on those of Broadhurst et
al. 2005 with some modifications. The cluster profile is explored further out
to ~2.5 Mpc/h_70 with weak lensing shear measurements from Broadhurst et al.
2005b. The masses of ~200 cluster galaxies are measured with Fundamental Plane
in order to accurately model the small scale mass structure in the cluster. The
galaxies are modelled as elliptical truncated isothermal spheres. The dark
matter component of the cluster is described by either non-singular isothermal
ellipsoids (NSIE) or elliptical versions of the universal dark matter profile
(ENFW). We use two dark matter haloes to model the smooth DM in the cluster.
The total mass profile is well described by either an NSIS profile with
sigma=1514+-18 km/s and core radius of r_c=71+-5kpc/h_70, or an NFW profile
with C=6.0+-0.5 and r_200=2.82+-0.11 Mpc/h_70. The errors are assumed to be due
to the error in assigning masses to the individual galaxies in the galaxy
component. The derived total mass is in good agreement with the mass profile of
Broadhurst et al. 05. Using also weak lensing we can constrain the profile
further out to r~2.5 Mpc/h_70. The best fit parameters are then sigma=1499+-15
km/s and r_c=66+-5 kpc/h_70 for the NSIS profile and C=7.6+-0.5 and
r_200=2.55+-0.07 Mpc/h_70 for the NFW profile. Using the same image
configuration as Broadhurst et al. 2005 we obtain a strong lensing model that
is superior to that of Broadhurst et al. 2005 (rms of 2.7'' compared to 3.2'').

equivalent width of the 5780 band is lower than would be expected based on the

the correlation with E(B-V). The relative strengths of the 5780 and 6284 A DIBs

prompt optical emission correlated with prompt gamma-ray emission, and early

standard theoretical interpretation attributes prompt emission to internal
shocks in the ultra-relativistic outflow generated by the internal engine;
early afterglow emission is attributed to shocks generated by interaction with
the surrounding medium. Here we report on observations of a bright GRB that,
for the first time, clearly show the temporal relationship and relative
strength of the two optical components. The observations indicate that early
afterglow emission can be understood as reverberation of the energy input
measured by prompt emission. Measurements of the early afterglow reverberations
therefore probe the structure of the environment around the burst, whereas the
subsequent response to late-time impulsive energy releases reveals how earlier
flaring episodes have altered the jet and environment parameters. Many GRBs are
generated by the death of massive stars that were born and died before the
Universe was ten per cent of its current age, so GRB afterglow reverberations
provide clues about the environments around some of the first stars.

remove them, including a detected intrinsic alignment for galaxies within 100
kpc/h of LRGs which we remove using photometric redshift information. The
resulting lensing signal is consistent with NFW profile dark matter halos; the
SIS profile is ruled out at the 96 (conservatively) and 99.96 per cent
confidence level (CL) for the fainter and brighter lens samples (respectively)
when we fit using lensing data between 40 kpc/h and 2 Mpc/h with total
signal-to-noise of 19 and 25 for the two lens samples. The lensing signal
amplitude suggests that the faint and bright sample galaxies typically reside
in haloes of mass (2.9+/-0.4)x10^{13} M_{sun}/h and (6.7+/-0.8)x10^{13}
M_{sun}/h respectively, in good agreement with predictions based on halo
spatial density with normalization lower than the 'concordance' sigma_8=0.9.
When fitting for the concentration parameter in the NFW profile, we find c =
5.0+/-0.6 (stat) +/-1 (sys), and c = 5.6+/-0.6 (stat) +/-1 (sys) for the faint
and bright samples, consistent with Lambda-CDM simulations. We also split the
bright sample further to determine masses and concentrations for cluster-mass
halos, finding mass (1.3+/-0.2)x10^{14} M_{sun}/h for the sample of LRGs
brighter than -22.6 in r. (Abridged)

Complemented by multi-transition single-dish observations, including infrared
observations of ro-vibrational transitions, detailed radiative transfer
modelling suggests that the fractional abundance of SiO in the inner part of
the envelope, between approximately 3-8 stellar radii, is as high as 1.5E-6.
This is more than an order of magnitude higher than predicted by equilibrium
stellar atmosphere chemistry in a carbon-rich environment and indicative of the
importance of non-LTE chemical processes. In addition to the compact component,
a spatially more extended (2.4E16 cm) low-fractional-abundance (1.7E-7) region
is required to fit the observations. This suggests that the majority of the SiO
molecules are effectively accreted onto dust grains in the inner wind while the
remaining gas-phase molecules are eventually photodissociated at larger
distances. Evidence of departure from a smooth wind is found in the observed
visibilities, indicative of density variations of a factor 2 to 5 on an angular

atmosphere models to the observations. The results of our analysis strengthen
the preliminary findings of Wijnands et al. that in both sources the neutron

Importantly, we now detect the flattening of the cooling in both sources as the

equilbrium flux and temperature in both sources by fitting a curve that decays
exponentially to a constant level. The cooling curves cannot be fit with just a
simple exponential decay without the constant offset. We find the constant

theoretical studies supported this association, which could be extended to

an energy resolution of a few keV at 500 keV and a sensitivity to linear

spectra are dominated by Paschen absorption lines at nearly all orbital phases
except near phase zero (coinciding with the X-ray dip) when the absorption
lines are filled-in by broad Paschen emission lines. The radial velocity curve
of the absorption lines corresponds to an eccentric orbit (e=0.45) whose period
and time of periastron passage are consistent with the period and phase
predicted by the most recent X-ray dip ephemeris. We found that the I-band
magnitude decreases from 17.6 to ~16.8 near phase 0.9-1.0, this brightening
coincides in phase with the X-ray dip. Even though it is likely that the
absorption line spectrum is associated with the companion star of CirX-1, we
cannot exclude the possibility that the spectrum originates in the accretion
disc. However, if the spectrum belongs to the companion star, it must be a
supergiant of spectral type B5-A0. If we assume that the compact object does
not move through the companion star at periastron, the companion star mass is
constrained to ~<10 Msun for a 1.4 Msun neutron star, whereas the inclination
has to be ~> 13.7 degrees. Alternatively, the measured absorption lines and
their radial velocity curve can be associated with the accretion disc
surrounding a 1.4 Msun neutron star and its motion around the centre of mass.
An absorption line spectrum from an accretion disc is typically found when our
line-of-sight passes through the accretion disc rim implying a high
inclination. However, from radio observations it was found that the angle
between the line-of-sight and the jet axis is smaller than 5 degrees implying
that the jet ploughs through the accretion disc in this scenario.

affected by modified gravity physics if the proper cutoff length of the

the subsequent evolution, boosting large-scale power in a way that resembles
the effect of a lower matter density. This phenomenon is almost perfectly

opposed to the faint rotational transitions of HCN (the standard high-density

therefore one of the most suitable targets to search for H_2O(3_13-2_20) at

temperature of T_b(H_2O) ~= 500 K for the maser emission and CO properties from

factor of less than 1%. However, this limit is not valid if the H_2O(3_13-2_20)
maser emission is quenched, i.e. if the line is only thermally excited. We
conclude that, if our results were to hold for other high-z sources, H_2O does

transfer, where detecting schemes have been proposed for measurement of
frequency dependent spectra of higher moments. Some of these schemes are
different from the well-known fictitious spin-detector and therefore generally
involve calculation of non-Keldysh-contour-ordered correlation functions. As an
illustration of our method we consider various third order correlation
functions of current, including the usual third cumulant of current statistics.
We investigate the frequency dependence of these correlation functions
explicitly in the case of energy-independent scattering. The results can easily
be generalized to the calculation of arbitrary n-th order correlation
functions, or to include the effect of interactions.

The electrostatic friction is due to energy losses in the sample created by the

similar effect arises when the tip is oscillating in the electrostatic field
created by charged defects in a dielectric substrate. The electrostatic
friction is compared with the van der Waals friction originating from the
fluctuating electromagnetic field due to quantum and thermal fluctuation of the
current density inside the bodies. We show that the electrostatic and van der
Waals friction can be greatly enhanced if on the surfaces of the sample and the
tip there are two-dimension (2D) systems, e.g. a 2D-electron system or
incommensurate layers of adsorbed ions exhibiting acoustic vibrations. We show

this case the heat transfer and van der Waals friction are determined by
resonant photon tunneling between adsorbate vibrational modes, or surface
plasmon modes. The enhancement of the van der Waals friction is especially
large when in the adsorbed layer there is an acoustic branch for the vibrations
parallel to the surface like in the case of Cs adsorption on Cu(100) surface.
In this case we show that even for separation $d=10$nm, the van der Waals
friction induced by adsorbates can be so large that it can be measured with the
present state-of-art equipment. The van an der Waals friction is characterized
by a strong distance dependence ($\sim 1/d^6$), and at the small distances it

the resulting delays are intrinsic to the CDW with the strain effectively
flowing from the contact. For a fixed position, the average relaxation time has
a voltage dependence given by tau_0~V^-p, with 1<p<2. The temperature
dependence of the fitting parameters shows that the dynamics are governed by
both the force on the CDW and the CDW current: for a given force and position,

the orbit determination of the major natural satellites of Saturn obtained with
the analysis of the first data sets from the Cassini mission allow to detect
the general relativistic gravitoelectric orbital precessions of such moons? The
answer is still negative. The present-day down-track accuracy would be adequate
for Mimas, Enceladus, Thetys, Dione, Rhea and Titan and inadequate for
Hyperion, Iapetus and Phoebe. Instead, the size of the systematic errors
induced by the mismodelling in the key parameters of the Saturnian
gravitational field like the even zonal harmonics Jl are larger than the
relativistic down-track shifts by about one order of magnitude, mainly for the
inner satellites like Mimas, Enceladus, Thetys, Dione, Rhea, Titan and
Hyperion. Iapetus and Phoebe are not sensibly affected by such kind of
perturbations. Moreover, the bias due to the uncertainty in Saturn's GM is
larger than the relativistic down-track effects for all such moons. Proposed
linear combinations of the satellites' orbital elements would allow to cancel
out the impact of the mismodelling in the low-degree even zonal harmonics and
GM, but the combined down-track errors would be larger than the combined
relativistic signature.

supersymmetric, space-filling Q-balls with R-charge, which we call R-balls. The
usual collective coordinate method for non-topological scalar solitons is
applied to quantize the half and quarter BPS R-balls. In each case, a different
quantization method is also applied to confirm the results from the collective
coordinate quantization. For finite N, the half BPS R-balls with a U(1)
R-charge have a moduli space which, upon quantization, results in the states of
a quantum Hall droplet with filling factor one. These states are known to
correspond to the ``sources'' in the Lin-Lunin-Maldacena geometries in IIB
supergravity. For large N, we find a new class of quarter BPS R-balls with a
non-commutativity parameter. Quantization on the moduli space of such R-balls
gives rise to a non-commutative Chern-Simons matrix mechanics, which is known
to describe a fractional quantum Hall system. In view of AdS/CFT holography,
this demonstrates a profound connection of emergent quantum gravity with
non-commutative geometry, of which the quantum Hall effect is a special case.

throat where the warp factor becomes nearly constant near the tip. We find that

large non-gaussianities are typically produced due to the small sound speed of
fluctuations. For a particular well-studied throat, the Klebanov-Strassler

difficult to satisfy current bounds on non-gaussianity, but other throat

E', S' and T' are the energy, entropy and temperature of a corresponding dual
quantum system. We show that, for a Schwarzschild black hole, the dual
variables formally satisfy all three laws of thermodynamics, including the
Planck-Nernst form of the third law requiring that the entropy tend to zero at
low temperature. This is in contrast with traditional black hole
thermodynamics, where the entropy is singular. Once the third law is satisfied,
it is straightforward to construct simple (dual) quantum systems representing
black hole mechanics. As an example, we construct toy models from one
dimensional (Fermi or Bose) quantum gases with N ~ M in a Planck scale box. In
addition to recovering black hole mechanics, we obtain quantum corrections to
the entropy, including the logarithmic correction obtained by previous papers.
The energy-entropy duality transforms a strongly interacting gravitational
system (black hole) into a weakly interacting quantum system (quantum gas) and
thus provides a natural framework for the quantum statistics underlying the
holographic conjecture.

structure deformations of an orthogonal two-torus comprising of a parallel and
a transverse direction in the near-horizon geometry of NS5-branes. The
resulting theories have the following intriguing features: Spacetime
supersymmetry is broken in a continuous fashion and the masses of the lightest
modes are lifted. In particular, no bulk or localized tachyons are generated in
the non-supersymmetric vacua. We discuss the effects of these deformations in
the context of the holographic duality between non-critical superstrings and
Little String Theories and find solutions of rotating fivebranes in
supergravity. We also comment on the generation of a one-loop cosmological
constant and determine the effects of the one-loop backreaction to leading

the Hamiltonian on the orbits, whose Hamiltonian system is equivalent to that

following. If p = n^alpha, with alpha < -1/k or alpha > - 1/(2k+1), then the
kth homology group of X(G(n,p)) is almost always vanishing, and if -1/k < alpha
< -1/(k+1), then it is almost always nonvanishing.
  We also give estimates for the expected rank of homology, and exhibit
explicit nontrivial classes in the nonvanishing regime. These estimates suggest
that almost all d-dimensional clique complexes have only one nonvanishing
dimension of homology, and we cannot rule out the possibility that they are
homotopy equivalent to wedges of spheres.

for a detailed understanding of the possibilities associated with these

present an alternative analytical approach based on the effective discrete

nature of the photonic crystal waveguides allows a novel, geometry-driven
enhancement of nonlinear effects by shifting the resonator location relative to
the waveguide, thus providing an additional control of resonant waveguide
transmission and Fano resonances. We further demonstrate that this enhancement
may result in the lowering of the bistability threshold and switching power of
nonlinear devices by several orders of magnitude. Finally, we show that
employing such enhancements is of paramount importance for the design of

1-f_{\rm em}^0$, was shown to scale very nearly as a power law in $E$: $f_h^0 =
(E/E_0)^{m-1}$, where $E_0\approx1$ GeV for pions, and $m\approx0.83$. It
follows that $\pi/e=1-(1-h/e)(E/E_0)^{m-1}$, where electromagnetic and hadronic
energy deposits are detected with efficiencies $e$ and $h$, respectively.
Fluctuations in these quantities, along with sampling fluctuations, are
incorporated to give an overall understanding of resolution, which is different
from the usual treatments in interesting ways. The conceptual framework is also
extended to the response to jets and the difference between $\pi$ and $p$
response.

mechanisms of both Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (K-H instability) and resonance
of waves. It requires both concentrated vortex and resonant waves for the
instability. The waves, which have same phase speed with the concentrated
vortex, have interactions with the vortex to trigger the instability. We call
this mechanism as ""concentrated vortex instability"". The physical explanation
of shear instability is also sketched. Finally, some useful criteria are
derived from the theorem. These results would intrigue future works to
investigate the other hydrodynamic instabilities.

first summarize the properties of aging networks suggesting a ""weak link theory
of aging"". This theory suggests that age-related random damage primarily
affects the overwhelming majority of the low affinity, transient interactions
(weak links) in cellular networks leading to increased noise, destabilization
and diversity. These processes may be further amplified by age-specific network
remodelling and by the sequestration of weakly linked cellular proteins to
protein aggregates of aging cells. Chaperones are weakly linked hubs [i.e.,
network elements with a large number of connections] and inter-modular bridge
elements of protein-protein interaction, signalling and mitochondrial networks.
As aging proceeds, the increased overload of damaged proteins is an especially
important element contributing to cellular disintegration and destabilization.
Additionally, chaperone overload may contribute to the increase of ""noise"" in
aging cells, which leads to an increased stochastic resonance resulting in a
deficient discrimination between signals and noise. Chaperone- and other
multi-target therapies, which restore the missing weak links in aging cellular
networks, may emerge as important anti-aging interventions.

lattice sites. This is used to experimentally demonstrate a massively parallel
quantum gate array, which allows the creation of a highly entangled many-body
cluster state through coherent collisions between atoms on neighbouring lattice
sites.

of atomic qubit states and measure coherence lifetimes exceeding one second at
micron-distance from the chip surface. We show that microwave near-fields on
the chip can be used to create state-dependent potentials for the
implementation of a quantum controlled phase gate with these robust qubit
states. For single atom detection and preparation, we have developed high

Furthermore, part of the absorbed squeezing of the probe field is transfered to
the pump field. For some conditions this transfer of squeezing can be complete.
