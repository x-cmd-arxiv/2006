large overdense regions in the universe. Since we know from the cosmic
microwave background that the regions that contained the most baryons when the
universe was ~400,000 years old were overdense by only one part in ten
thousand, perturbations had to have grown since then by a factor greater than
$(1+z_*)\simeq 1180$ where $z_*$ is the epoch of recombination. This enhanced
growth does not happen in general relativity, so dark matter is needed in the
standard theory. We show here that enhanced growth can occur in alternatives to
general relativity, in particular in Bekenstein's relativistic version of
MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). The vector field introduced in that theory
for a completely different reason plays a key role in generating the
instability that produces large cosmic structures today.

to sharpen constraints on cosmological parameters from the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). We employ a matrix-based power spectrum estimation
method using Pseudo-Karhunen-Loeve eigenmodes, producing uncorrelated
minimum-variance measurements in 20 k-bands of both the clustering power and
its anisotropy due to redshift-space distortions, with narrow and well-behaved
window functions in the range 0.01h/Mpc < k < 0.2h/Mpc. Results from the LRG
and main galaxy samples are consistent, with the former providing higher
signal-to-noise. Our results are robust to omitting angular and radial density
fluctuations and are consistent between different parts of the sky. They
provide a striking confirmation of the predicted large-scale LCDM power
spectrum.
  Combining only SDSS LRG and WMAP data places robust constraints on many
cosmological parameters that complement prior analyses of multiple data sets.
The LRGs provide independent cross-checks on Om and the baryon fraction in good
agreement with WMAP. Within the context of flat LCDM models, our LRG
measurements complement WMAP by sharpening the constraints on the matter
density, the neutrino density and the tensor amplitude by about a factor of
two, giving Omega_m=0.24+-0.02 (1 sigma), sum m_nu < 0.9 eV (95%) and r<0.3
(95%). Baryon oscillations are clearly detected and provide a robust
measurement of the comoving distance to the median survey redshift z=0.35
independent of curvature and dark energy properties. Within the LCDM framework,
our power spectrum measurement improves the evidence for spatial flatness,
sharpening the curvature constraint Omega_tot=1.05+-0.05 from WMAP alone to
Omega_tot=1.003+-0.010. Assuming Omega_tot=1, the equation of state parameter
is constrained to w=-0.94+-0.09, indicating the potential for more ambitious
future LRG measurements to provide precision tests of the nature of dark

matter halos are compared to corresponding N-body/hydrodynamical simulations
containing dark matter, stars and gas. The simulations without baryons share
features with others described in the literature in that the dark matter
density slope continuously decreases towards the center, with a density
\rho~r^{-1.3+/-0.2}, at about 1% of the virial radius for our Milky Way sized
galaxies. The central cusps in the simulations which also contain baryons
steepen significantly, to \rho~r^{-1.9+/-0.2}, with an indication of the inner
logarithmic slope converging. Models of adiabatic contraction of dark matter
halos due to the central build-up of stellar/gaseous galaxies are examined. The
simplest and most commonly used model, by Blumenthal et al., is shown to
overestimate the central dark matter density considerably. A modified model
proposed by Gnedin et al. is shown to be a considerable improvement, but not
perfect. Moreover it is found that the contraction parameters not only depend
on the orbital structure of the dark-matter-only halos but also on the stellar
feedback prescription which is most relevant for the baryonic distribution.
Implications for dark matter annihilation at the galactic center are discussed
and it is found that although our simulations show a considerable reduced halo
contraction as compared to the Blumenthal et al. model, the fluxes from dark
matter annihilation is still expected to be enhanced by at least a factor of a
hundred as compared to dark-matter-only halos. Finally, it is shown that while
dark-matter-only halos are typically prolate, the dark matter halos containing
baryons are mildly oblate with minor-to-major axis ratios of c/a=0.73+/-0.11,
with their flattening aligned with the central baryonic disks.

Main galaxy and Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data
Release 5 (DR5) sample. The aim of our analysis is to consider how well we can
measure the cosmological matter density using the signature of the horizon at
matter-radiation equality embedded in the large-scale power spectrum. The new
data constrains the power spectrum on scales 100--600h^-1Mpc with significantly
higher precision than previous analyses of just the SDSS Main galaxies, due to
our larger sample and the inclusion of the LRGs. This improvement means that we
can now reveal a discrepancy between the shape of the measured power and linear
CDM models on scales 0.01<k<0.15hMpc^-1, with linear model fits favouring a
lower matter density (Omega_m=0.22+/-0.04) on scales 0.01<k<0.06hMpc^-1 and a
higher matter density (Omega_m=0.32+/-0.01) when smaller scales are included,
assuming a flat LCDM model with h=0.73 and n_s=0.96. This discrepancy could be
explained by scale-dependent bias and, by analysing subsamples of galaxies, we
find that the ratio of small-scale to large-scale power increases with galaxy
luminosity, so all of the SDSS galaxies cannot trace the same power spectrum
shape over 0.01<k<0.2hMpc^-1. However, the data are insufficient to clearly
show a luminosity-dependent change in the largest scale at which a significant
increase in clustering is observed, although they do not rule out such an
effect. Significant scale-dependent galaxy bias on large-scales, which changes
with the r-band luminosity of the galaxies, could potentially explain
differences in our Omega_m estimates and differences previously observed
between 2dFGRS and SDSS power spectra and the resulting parameter constraints.

have not been K-corrected or adjusted to account for reddening. In this

accretion during the radiation-dominated era does not lead to a significant

orders of magnitude in mass through the acquisition of large dark matter halos.
We discuss the possibility of PBHs being an important component in dark matter
halos of galaxies as well as their potential to explain the ultra-luminous
x-ray sources (ULXs) observed in nearby galactic disks. We point out that
although PBHs are ruled out as the dominant component of dark matter, there is
still a great deal of parameter space open to them playing a role in the
modern-day universe. For example, a primordial halo population of PBHs each at
$10^{2.5} M_\odot$ making up 0.1% of the dark matter grow to $10^{4.5} M_\odot$
via the accumulation of dark matter halos to account for $\sim 10%$ of the dark

holes may then ``light up'' when passing through molecular clouds, becoming

running them (blindly) on simulated images that contain a known shear signal.
We determine the common features of algorithms that most successfully recover
the input parameters. We achieve previously unattained discriminatory precision
in our analysis, via a combination of more extensive simulations, and pairs of
galaxy images that have been rotated with respect to each other, thus removing
noise from their intrinsic ellipticities. The robustness of our simulation
approach is also confirmed by testing the relative calibration of methods on
real data.
  Weak lensing measurement has improved since the first STEP paper. Several
methods now consistently achieve better than 2% precision, and are still being
developed. However, the simulations can now distinguish all methods from
perfect performance. Our main concern continues to be the potential for a
multiplicative shear calibration bias: not least because this can not be
internally calibrated with real data. We determine which galaxy populations are
responsible and, by adjusting the simulated observing conditions, we also
investigate the effects of instrumental and atmospheric parameters. We have
isolated several previously unrecognised aspects of galaxy shape measurement,
in which focussed development could provide further progress towards the
sub-percent level of precision desired for future surveys.

wide range of AGN types and of X-ray extinction toward the central nuclei. We
find that the strength of the silicate feature correlates with the HI column
density estimated from fitting the X-ray data, such that low HI columns
correspond to silicate emission while high columns correspond to silicate
absorption. The behavior is generally consistent with unification models where
the large diversity in AGN properties is caused by viewing-angle-dependent
obscuration of the nucleus. Radio-loud AGNs and radio-quiet quasars follow
roughly the correlation between HI columns and the strength of the silicate
feature defined by Seyfert galaxies. The agreement among AGN types suggests a
high-level unification with similar characteristics for the structure of the
obscuring material. We demonstrate the implications for unification models
qualitatively with a conceptual disk model. The model includes an inner
accretion disk (< 0.1 pc in radius), a middle disk (0.1-10 pc in radius) with a
dense diffuse component and with embedded denser clouds, and an outer clumpy

hard than at soft energies. The variability statistics of cTTS and wTTS are
undistinguishable, suggesting a common (coronal) origin for their X-ray

mixed, resolved population through the use of color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs).
The method provides insight into the local star formation rate, analyzing the
observations of the Hipparcos satellite through a comparison with synthetic
CMDs computed for different histories with an updated stellar evolution
library. Parallax and photometric uncertainties are included explicitly and
corrected using the Bayesian Richardson-Lucy algorithm. We first describe our
verification studies using artificial data sets. From this sensitivity study,
the critical factors determining the success of a recovery for a known star
formation rate are a partial knowledge of the IMF and the age-metallicity
relation, and sample contamination by clusters and moving groups (special
populations whose histories are different than that of the whole sample).
Unresolved binaries are less important impediments. We highlight how these
limit the method. For the real field sample, complete to Mv < 3.5, we find that
the solar neighborhood star formation rate has a characteristic timescale for
variation of about 6 Gyr, with a maximum activity close to 3 Gyr ago. The
similarity of this finding with column integrated star formation rates may
indicate a global origin, possibly a collision with a satellite galaxy. We also
discuss applications of this technique to general photometric surveys of other
complex systems (e.g. Local Group dwarf galaxies) where the distances are well

show that, even with their moderate column density, the cold temperature, high

method for estimating power spectra in CMB surveys with large numbers of
pixels. Recently, Challinor & Chon showed that the E-B mixing in these
estimators can become a dominant contaminant at low noise levels, ultimately
limiting the gravity wave signal which can be detected on a finite patch of
sky. We define a modified version of the estimators which eliminates E-B mixing
and is near-optimal at all noise levels.

Branch (AGB) stars predict a large overabundance of primary nitrogen. The very
metal-poor, carbon-enhanced, s-process-rich stars, which are thought to be the
polluted companions of now-extinct AGB stars, provide direct tests of the
predictions of these models. Recent studies of the carbon and nitrogen
abundances in metal-poor stars have focused on the most carbon-rich stars,
leading to a potential selection bias against stars that have been polluted by
AGB stars that produced large amounts of nitrogen, and hence have small [C/N]
ratios. We call these stars Nitrogen-Enhanced Metal-Poor (NEMP) stars, and
define them as having [N/Fe] > +0.5 and [C/N] < -0.5. In this paper, we report
on the [C/N] abundances of a sample of 21 carbon-enhanced stars, all but three
of which have [C/Fe] < +2.0. If NEMP stars were made as easily as
Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars, then we expected to find between two
and seven NEMP stars. Instead, we found no NEMP stars in our sample. Therefore,
this observational bias is not an important contributor to the apparent dearth
of N-rich stars. Our [C/N] values are in the same range as values reported
previously in the literature (-0.5 to +2.0), and all stars are in disagreement
with the predicted [C/N] ratios for both low-mass and high-mass AGB stars. We
suggest that the decrease in [C/N] from the low-mass AGB models is due to
enhanced extra-mixing, while the lack of NEMP stars may be caused by
unfavorable mass ratios in binaries or the difficulty of mass transfer in
binary systems with large mass ratios.

diameter with a MgB2 core of 600 microm diameter was prepared with various

2.5 wt.% SiC powders exhibited a Jc value of 1x104 A/cm2 at 11.3 T and 4.2 K.
Although only 2.5 wt.% SiC were added, these values are considerably above
those of ternary wires with B4C additions, where the same Jc value is obtained
at 10T. The slope Jc vs. B for the B4C + SiC wires is steeper than for SiC
additives, the Jc values at 4.2 K being superior at fields below 9 T. The
lattice parameters a of the B4C + SiC added wires exhibit lower values than
ternary wires with the same nominal C content, suggesting a higher C content in
the MgB2 phase. The disorder in the MgB2 structure has been characterized as a
partial substitution of B by Carbon. A reduction of the domain sizes in the c
direction as well as in-plane to 250 Angstrom and 124 Angstrom has been
determined from the FWHM and the breath values of the (110) and (002) peaks.

Birr has been obtained with respect to B4C additions. A further enhancement of
Jc is expected when using different combinations of additives with and without

result of the combination of different mechanisms.

lowest order, the torsion field around a uniformly rotating spherical mass is
determined by seven dimensionless parameters. These parameters effectively
generalize the PPN formalism and provide a concrete framework for further
testing GR. We construct a parametrized Lagrangian that includes both standard
torsion-free GR and Hayashi- Shirafuji maximal torsion gravity as special

interferometer is degenerate. In such a degenerate cavity, the phase fronts of
optical fields become badly distorted when the mirror shapes are slightly
deformed due to mirror figure error and/or thermal aberration, and this causes
significant loss of the signal power and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a
gravitational wave event. Through a numerical modal simulation of the optical
fields in a simplified model of an Advanced-LIGO interferometer, We investigate
the loss of the SNR and the behavior of both the carrier and signal optical

the SNR is severe with a degenerate SRC, and a nondegenerate SRC can be used to
solve this problem. We identify the optimal level of degeneracy for the SRC,
which is achieved when the cavity Gouy phase is between 0.2 and 1.3 radians. We

energy $E$. It is also shown that the non-linear equation of motion can be
linearized by constructing a hypergeometric differential equation for the
inverse problem $t(q)$. A variable transformation reducing the general problem
to that one of a particle subjected to a linear force is also established. For
any value of $n$, it leads to a simple harmonic oscillator if $E>0$, an

deduced for the simple harmonic oscillator ($n=2$), and does not depend on the

warped internal space $\Sigma $. These vacuum densities correspond to a
gravitational source of the cosmological constant type for both subspaces of
the branes. Using the generalized zeta function technique in combination with
contour integral representations, the surface energies on the branes are
presented in the form of the sum of single brane and second brane induced
parts. For the geometry of a single brane both regions, on the left and on the
right of the brane, are considered. At the physical point the corresponding
zeta functions contain pole and finite contributions. For an infinitely thin
brane taking these regions together, in odd spatial dimensions the pole parts
cancel and the total zeta function is finite. The renormalization procedure for
the surface energies and the structure of the corresponding counterterms are
discussed. The parts in the surface densities generated by the presence of the
second brane are finite for all nonzero values of the interbrane separation and
are investigated in various asymptotic regions of the parameters. In
particular, it is shown that for large distances between the branes the induced
surface densities give rise to an exponentially suppressed cosmological
constant on the brane. The total energy of the vacuum including the bulk and
boundary contributions is evaluated by the zeta function technique and the
energy balance between separate parts is discussed.

separations giving rise to a repulsive force of short range between opposite

is in agreement with a previous calculation based on M$\ddot{o}$ller
scattering, but differently from such calculation we show here that the

annuli or cusps, and confirm the strong subadditivity via direct calculations.

conclude that the obtained amplitudes should follow the iterative structure of

realization of elements of Wall groups by normal maps of closed manifolds. The
main step of construction of the spectral sequence is an infinite filtration of
spectra in which only the first two, as is well-known, have clear geometric
sense. The first one is a spectrum $\Bbb L(\pi_1(X))$ for surgery obstruction
groups of a manifold $X$ and the second $\Bbb LP_*(F)$ is a spectrum for
surgery on a Browder-Livesay manifold pair $Y\subset X$. The geometric sense of

in two different contexts -- purely algebraic and operator space theoretic. A
quantum stochastic convolution cocycle is a quantum stochastic process on a
coalgebra satisfying the convolution cocycle relation and the initial condition
given by the counit. The notion generalises that of quantum Levy process, which
in turn is a noncommutative probability counterpart of classical Levy process
on a group.
  Convolution cocycles arise as solutions of quantum stochastic differential
equations. In turn every sufficiently regular cocycle satisfies an equation of
that type. This is proved along with the corresponding existence and uniqueness
of solutions for coalgebraic quantum stochastic differential equations. The
stochastic generators of unital *-homomorphic cocycles are characterised in
terms of structure maps on a *-bialgebra. This yields a simple proof of the
Schurmann Reconstruction Theorem for a quantum Levy process; it also yields a
topological version for a quantum Levy process on a C*-bialgebra. Precise
characterisation of the stochastic generators of completely positive and
contractive quantum stochastic convolution cocycles in the C*-algebraic context
is given, leading to some dilation results. A few examples are presented and
some interpretations offered for quantum stochastic convolution cocycles and
their stochastic generators on different types of *-bialgebra.

"nlin/0608065","Peter Ashwin","Peter Ashwin and Ian Melbourne","Dynamics on unbounded domains; co-solutions and inheritance of stability",,,,,"nlin.PS nlin.AO",,"  We consider the dynamics of semiflows of patterns on unbounded domains that
are equivariant under a noncompact group action. We exploit the unbounded
nature of the domain in a setting where there is a strong `global' norm and a
weak `local' norm. Relative equilibria whose group orbits are closed manifolds
for a compact group action need not be closed in a noncompact setting; the
closure of a group orbit of a solution can contain `co-solutions'.
  The main result of the paper is to show that co-solutions inherit stability
in the sense that co-solutions of a Lyapunov stable pattern are also stable
(but in a weaker sense). This means that the existence of a single group orbit
of stable relative equilibria may force the existence of quite distinct group
orbits of relative equilibria, and these are also stable. This is in contrast
to the case for finite dimensional dynamical systems where group orbits of
relative equilibria are typically isolated.

  measurements without introducing ancillary dimensions","4 pages, 2 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We propose a scheme that can realize a class of positive-operator-valued
measures (POVMs) by performing a sequence of projective measurements on the
original system, in the sense that for an arbitrary input state the probability
distribution of the measurement outcomes is faithfully reproduced. A necessary
and sufficient condition for a POVM to be realizable in this way is also
derived. In contrast to the canonical approach provided by Neumark's theorem,
our method has the advantage of requiring no auxiliary system. Moreover, an
arbitrary POVM can be realized by utilizing our protocol on an extended space
which is formed by adding only a single extra dimension.

decoherence, acting independently and equally on each subsystems. To be
specific, we consider an N-qubit GHZ state under depolarization, dephasing, or
dissipation channel, and tested the nonlocality by violation of Mermin-Klyshko
inequality, which is one of Bell's inequalities for multi-qubit systems. The
results show that the robustness of nonlocality increases with the number of
qubits, and that the nonlocality of an N-qubit GHZ state with even N is
extremely persistent against dephasing.

trajectories. The geometric phase or holonomy of such a trajectory is
delineated. For nonpure initial states, it is shown that well-defined
holonomies can be assigned by using Uhlmann's concept of parallel transport
along the individual trajectories. We put forward an experimental realization
of the geometric phase for a quantum trajectory in interferometry. We argue
that the average over the phase factors for all quantum trajectories that build
up a given open system evolution, fails to reflect the geometry of the open
system evolution itself.

the software by simulating quantum computers containing up to 36 qubits, using
up to 4096 processors and up to 1 TB of memory. Our results demonstrate that
the simulator exhibits nearly ideal scaling as a function of the number of
processors and suggest that the simulation software described in this paper may
also serve as benchmark for testing high-end parallel computers.

partially releasing these condensates and detecting an interference pattern
where they overlap, it is possible to create a macroscopic superposition of
different relative phases for the remaining portions of the condensates. We
discuss methods for confirming these superpositions.
