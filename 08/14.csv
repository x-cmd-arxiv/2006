of a baseline vector and a direction to a star. Two derived vectors are the
delay vector, and the projected baseline vector in the plane of the wavefronts
of the stellar light. The manuscript deals with the trigonometry of projecting
the baseline further outwards onto the celestial sphere. The position angle of
the projected baseline is defined, measured in a plane tangential to the
celestial sphere, tangent point at the position of the star. This angle
represents two orthogonal directions on the sky, differential star positions
which are aligned with or orthogonal to the gradient of the delay recorded in
the u-v plane. The North Celestial Pole is chosen as the reference direction of
the projected baseline angle, adapted to the common definition of the
""parallactic"" angle.

of spin and orbital angular momentum during the last, highly nonlinear, stages
of the coalescence process. To calculate the transfer of angular momentum from
orbital to spin, we start with two quasi-circular configurations, one with
initially non-spinning black holes, the other with corotating black holes. In
both cases the binaries complete almost two orbits before merging. We find
that, during these last orbits, the specific spin (a/m) of each horizon
increases by only 0.012 for the initially non-spinning configuration, and by
only 0.006 for the initially corotating configuration. By contrast, the
corotation value for the specific spin should increase from 0.1 at the initial
proper separation of 10M to 0.33 when the proper separation is 5M. Thus the
spin-orbit coupling is far too weak to tidally lock the binary to a corotating
state during the late-inspiral phase. We also study the converse transfer from
spin into orbital motion. In this case, we start the simulations with parallel,
highly-spinning non-boosted black holes. As the collision proceeds, the system
acquires a non-head-on orbital motion, due to spin-orbit coupling, that leads
to the radiation of angular momentum. We are able to accurately measure the
energy and angular momentum losses and model their dependence on the initial
spins.

Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique combined with an analytic description of the
inflationary spectra in terms of the horizon flow functions (HFF). By imposing
a consistency condition for the tensor-to-scalar ratio, we study the
constraints both on single field standard inflation and on inflation with the
violation of the null energy condition, which leads to a blue spectrum for
gravitational waves. For standard inflation, the constraint on the
tensor-to-scalar ratio we obtain from CMB data and 2dF05 is: $r_{0.01} < 0.26$

tensor-to-scalar ratio and the tensor slope, the constraints on the tensor
amplitude is not significantly changed, but the constraints on the HFFs are
significantly relaxed. We then show that when the third HFF $\epsilon_3$ is
allowed to be non-zero and to be of order unity, a large negative (at $2

explored, the high-excitation C I lines are stronger in non-LTE due to the
combined effect of line source function drop and increased lower level

implications on studies of nucleosynthetic processes and on Galactic chemical

the 150 and 220-GHz telescopes have 256 horns each. The horns are arranged in a
hexagonal array and feed a polarimeter which uses finline-coupled TES
bolometers as detectors. To detect the two polarizations the 97-GHz telescope
has 320 detectors while the 150 and 220-GHz telescopes have 512 detectors each.
To achieve the target NEPs (1.5, 2.5, and 4.5x10^-17 W/rtHz) the detectors are
cooled to 100 mK for the 97 and 150-GHz polarimeters and 230 mK for the 220-GHz
polarimeter. Each detector is fabricated as a single chip to ensure a 100%
operational focal plane. The detectors are contained in linear modules made of
copper which form split-block waveguides. The detector modules contain 16 or 20
detectors each for compatibility with the hexagonal arrays of horns in the
telescopes' focal planes. Each detector module contains a time-division SQUID
multiplexer to read out the detectors. Further amplification of the multiplexed
signals is provided by SQUID series arrays. The first prototype detectors for
CLOVER operate with a bath temperature of 230 mK and are used to validate the

the Helmholtz ensemble, multiple minima in free energy near $t=4$ persists for
all kinds of orientational boundary conditions. The qualitative features of
projected probability distribution of end to end vector depend crucially on the
embedding dimensions. A mapping of the WLC model, to a quantum particle moving

anisotropy barriers and thermal fluctuation over the barriers accompanied by

Indeed, M around 1-10 eV can accommodate an elegant oscillation solution to the
LSND anomaly, while other M values lead to several observable consequences. We
consider the phenomenology of low energy seesaw scenarios with M less than and
equal to approximately 1 keV. By exploring such a framework with three
right-handed neutrinos, we can consistently fit all oscillation data --
including those from LSND -- while partially addressing several astrophysical
puzzles, including anomalous pulsar kicks, heavy element nucleosynthesis in
supernovae, and the existence of warm dark matter. Furthermore, low-energy
seesaws -- regardless of their relation to the LSND anomaly -- can also be
tested by future tritium beta-decay experiments, neutrinoless double-beta decay
searches, and other observables. We estimate the sensitivity of such probes to
M.

related with the discretisation of symplectic area on P. This is an equivalent,

this is by a quantum gravity theory on a union of n anti-de Sitter spaces,
connected at their boundary (by correlations between their boundary

obtain a mass, and we compute this mass both from the field theory and from the

computations. This is the first example in which a graviton mass in the bulk of

these deformed product theories leads us to suggest that field theories may be
generally classified by a ""connectivity index"", corresponding to the number of
components (connected at the boundary) in the space-time of the dual
gravitational background. In the field theory this index roughly counts the
number of independent gauge groups, but we do not have a precise general

multiplication. This structure is given as the Browder operation induced by the
action of little disks operad, which was found by McClure and Smith. We show
that the Browder operation coincides with the Gerstenhaber bracket on the
Hochschild homology, which appears as the E2-term of the homology spectral
sequence constructed by Bousfield. In particular we consider a variant of the
space of long knots in higher dimensional Euclidean space, and show that
Sinha's homology spectral sequence computes the Poisson algebra structure of
the homology of the space. The Browder operation produces a homology class
which does not directly correspond to chord diagrams.

"math/0608327","Allen Knutson","Allen Knutson, Mark Shimozono","Kempf collapsing and quiver loci","21 pages",,,,"math.AG math.CO math.RA",,"  Kempf [1976] studied proper, G-equivariant maps from equivariant vector
bundles over flag manifolds to G-representations V, which he called
_collapsings_. We give a simple formula for the G-equivariant cohomology class
on V, or_multidegree_, associated to the image of a collapsing: apply a certain
sequence of divided difference operators to a certain product of linear
polynomials, then divide by the number of components in a general fiber. When
that number of components is 1, we construct a desingularization of the image
of the collapsing. If in addition the image has rational singularities, we can
use the desingularization to give also a formula for the G-equivariant K-class
of the image, whose leading term is the multidegree.
  Our application is to quiver loci and quiver polynomials. Let Q be a quiver
of finite type (A, D, or E, in arbitrary orientation), and assign a vector
space to each vertex. Let \Hom denote the (linear) space of representations of
Q with these vector spaces. This carries an action of GL, the product of the
general linear groups of the individual vector spaces. A_quiver locus_ \Omega
is the closure in \Hom of a GL-orbit, and its multidegree is the corresponding
_quiver polynomial_. Reineke [2004] proved that every ADE quiver locus is the
image of a birational Kempf collapsing (giving a desingularization directly).
  Using Reineke's collapsings, we give formulae for ADE quiver polynomials,
previously only computed in type A (though in this case, our formulae are new).
In the A and D cases quiver loci are known to have rational singularities
[Bobi\'nski-Zwara 2002], so we also get formulae for their K-classes, which had
previously only been computed in equioriented type A (and again our formulae
are new).

$$F_p(n,r)=(-p)^{-[(n-1)/(p-1)]}\sum_{k=r(mod p)}\binom{n}{k}(-1)^k\in\Z.$$
Nowadays this result plays important roles in many aspects. Recently Sun and
Wan investigated $F_p(n,r)$ mod p in [SW2]. In this paper, using p-adic methods
we determine $(F_p(m,r)-F_p(n,r))/(m-n)$ modulo p in terms of Bernoulli
numbers, where m>0 is an integer with $m\not=n$ and $m=n (mod p(p-1))$.
Consequently, $F_p(n,r)$ mod $p^{ord_p(n)+1}$ is determined; for example, if
$n=n_*(mod p-1)$ with $0<n_*<p-2$ then
$$\frac{F_p(pn,0)}{pn}=\frac{n_*!}{n_*+1}B_{p-1-n_*} (mod p).$$ This yields an
application to Stirling numbers of the second kind. We also study extended
Fleck quotients; in particular we prove that if $a>0$ and $l\ge 0$ are integers

We consider a family of commuting Hermitian operators $a(\Delta)$ indexed by
all measurable, relatively compact sets $\Delta$ in $X$ (a quantum stochastic
process over $X$). For such a family, we introduce the notion of a correlation
measure. We prove that, if the family of operators possesses a correlation
measure which satisfies some condition of growth, then there exists a point
process over $X$ having the same correlation measure. Furthermore, the
operators $a(\Delta)$ can be realized as multiplication operators in the
$L^2$-space with respect to this point process. In the proof, we utilize the
notion of $\star$-positive definiteness, proposed in [Y. G. Kondratiev and T.\
Kuna, {\it Infin. Dimens. Anal. Quantum Probab. Relat. Top.} {\bf 5} (2002),
201--233]. In particular, our result extends the criterion of existence of a
point process from that paper to the case of the topological space $X$, which
is a standard underlying space in the theory of point processes. As
applications, we discuss particle densities of the quasi-free representations
of the CAR and CCR, which lead to fermion, boson, fermion-like, and boson-like
(e.g. para-fermions and para-bosons of order 2) point processes.

calculated to next-to-next-to-leading order. At this order the chiral expansion
for the NN isoscalar charge operator (including consistently calculated 1/M
corrections) is a parameter-free prediction of the effective theory. Use of
this operator in conjunction with NLO and NNLO chiral effective theory wave
functions produces results that are consistent with extant experimental data
for Q^2 < 0.35 GeV^2. These wave functions predict a deuteron quadrupole moment
G_Q(Q^2=0)=0.278-0.282 fm^2-with the variation arising from short-distance
contributions to this quantity. The variation is of the same size as the
discrepancy between the theoretical result and the experimental value. This
motivates the renormalization of G_Q via a two-nucleon operator that couples to
quadrupole photons. After that renormalization we obtain a robust prediction
for the shape of G_C/G_Q at Q^2 < 0.3 GeV^2. This allows us to make precise,
model-independent predictions for the values of this ratio that will be

beams is successful in characterizing radiation fields associated with any SR

magnetic device and laser beam are solutions of the wave equation based on
paraxial approximation. It follows that they are similar in all aspects. In the
space-frequency domain SR beams appear as laser beams whose transverse extents
are large compared with the wavelength. In practical situations (e.g.
undulator, bending magnet sources), radiation beams exhibit a virtual ""waist""
where the wavefront is often plane. Remarkably, the field distribution of a SR
beam across the waist turns out to be strictly related with the inverse Fourier
transform of the far-field angle distribution. Then, we take advantage of
standard Fourier Optics techniques and apply the Fresnel propagation formula to
characterize the SR beam. Altogether, we show that it is possible to
reconstruct the near-field distribution of the SR beam outside the magnetic
setup from the knowledge of the far-field pattern. The general theory of SR in
the near-zone developed in this paper is illustrated for the special cases of
undulator radiation, edge radiation and transition undulator radiation. Using

also for a pair of complementary observables in N-level systems. All these
uncertainty relations become more attractive when expressed in terms of the
symmetrized Renyi entropies.
