0313-192, which hosts a 350-kpc double source and jets, even though previous
data have suggested that it is a spiral galaxy. We measure the bulge scale and
luminosity, radial and vertical profiles of disk starlight, and consider the
distributions of H II regions and absorbing dust. In each case, the HST data
confirm its classification as an edge-on spiral galaxy, the only such system
known to produce such an extended radio source of this kind. The Gemini near-IR
images and Chandra spectral fit reveal a strongly obscured central AGN, seen
through the entire ISM path length of the disk and showing X-ray evidence of
additional absorption from warm or dense material close to the central object.
We consider several possible mechanisms for producing such a rare combination
of AGN and host properties, some combination of which may be at work. These
include an unusually luminous bulge (suggesting a black hole of mass 0.5-0.9
billion solar masses), orientation of the jets near the pole of the gas-rich
disk, and some evidence of a weak gravitational interaction which has warped
the disk and could have enhanced fuelling of the central engine. An X-ray
counterpart of the kiloparsec-scale radio jet emerges to the south;
jet/counterjet limits in both radio and X-ray allow them to be symmetric if
seen more than 15 degrees from the plane of the sky, still consistent with the
jet axes being within ~30 degrees of the poles of the gas-rich galaxy disk. A
linear or disklike emission-line structure is seen around thenucleus, inclined
by ~20 degrees to the stellar disk but nearly perpendicular to the jets; this
may represent the aftermath of a galaxy encounter, where gas is photoionized by
the nuclear continuum.

intrinsically symmetrical, decelerating relativistic jet model to the new

deg to the line of sight. On-axis, they decelerate from a (poorly-constrained)
initial velocity of 0.8c to approximately 0.4c around 5 kpc from the nucleus,
the velocity thereafter remaining constant. The speed at the edge of the jet is
low everywhere. The longitudinal profile of proper emissivity has three
principal power-law sections and the emission is centre-brightened. Our
observations rule out a globally-ordered, helical magnetic-field configuration.
Instead, we model the field as random on small scales but anisotropic, with
toroidal and longitudinal components only. The ratio of longitudinal to
toroidal field falls with distance along the jet, qualitatively but not
quantitatively as expected from flux freezing, so that the field is
predominantly toroidal far from the nucleus. The toroidal component is
relatively stronger at the edges of the jet. A simple adiabatic model fits the
emissivity evolution only in the outer region after the jets have decelerated

emissivity decline with distance. We also interpret the morphological
differences between brightness enhancements (""arcs"") in the main and

indicate that these double peaks are the kHz QPOs known from low magnetic field
neutron stars, and not black-hole high-frequency QPOs, confirming that Cir X-1
is a neutron star. The kHz QPO peak separation varies over a wide range,
\~175-340 Hz, and increases with QPO frequency. This is contrary to what is
seen in other sources but agrees with predictions of the relativistic
precession model and Alfven wave models; beat-frequency models require
modification to accommodate this. In other observations single kHz QPOs can be
seen down to frequencies as low as ~12 Hz, as well as a strong low-frequency

the BH/host ratio is excessive at redshift z, then it would imply that the
total mass density in BHs above some M_BH(min) is larger at that redshift than
at z=0, which is impossible. This argument requires no knowledge of host or BH
properties, only a lower limit to the observed luminosity density in the
brightest galaxies at some z. We calculate this upper limit from a variety of
luminosity and mass functions in different bands from redshifts z=0-2. We show
that it is consistent with passive evolution of spheroid populations (with a
fixed M_BH/M_host relation) in all cases, and provides tighter constraints than
have generally been obtained previously, ruling out at >6 sigma observational

at high redshifts than locally, although relatively weak (factor ~2 by z=2)

D74 (2006) 083007","10.1103/PhysRevD.74.083007",,"astro-ph",,"  Satellite galaxies currently undergoing tidal disruption offer a unique
opportunity to constrain an effective violation of the equivalence principle in
the dark sector. Theories in which cold dark matter (CDM) couples to a light
scalar field naturally lead to a long-range force between dark matter
particles. An inverse-square-law force of this kind would manifest itself as a
violation of the equivalence principle in the dynamics of CDM compared to
baryons in the form of gas or stars. In a previous paper, we showed that an
attractive force would displace stars outwards from the bottom of the
satellite's gravitational potential well, leading to a higher fraction of stars
being disrupted from the tidal bulge further from the Galactic center. Since
stars disrupted from the far (near) side of the satellite go on to form the
trailing (leading) tidal stream, an attractive dark-matter force will produce a
relative enhancement of the trailing stream compared to the leading stream.
This distinctive signature of a dark-matter force might be detected through
detailed observations of the tidal tails of a disrupting satellite, such as
those recently performed by the Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) and Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) on the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy. Here we show
that this signature is robust to changes in our models for both the satellite
and Milky Way, suggesting that we might hope to search for a dark-matter force
in the tidal features of other recently discovered satellite galaxies in
addition to the Sgr dwarf.

the process of merging. The brighter of these two putative ultra compact dwarfs
has an ocular appearance, similar to that seen in galaxies that have suffered a
penetrating encounter with a smaller companion. From our HI imaging we find
that the gas distribution and kinematics in this object are similar to that of
other low mass galaxies, albeit with some evidence for tidal disturbance. On
the other hand, the HI emission has an angular size ~25 times larger than that
of the putative ultra-compact dwarfs. The optical emission is also offset from
the centre of the HI emission. HS0822+3542 is located in the Lynx-Cancer void,
but has a nearby companion LSB dwarf galaxy SAO0822+3545. In light of all this
we also consider a scenario where the optical emission from HS0822+3542 comes
not from two merging ultra-compact dwarfs but from multiple star forming
regions in a tidally disturbed galaxy. In this model, the ocular appearance of

formation.

analysis procedure allows us to differentiate between broadband temporal
intensity fluctuations introduced by instrumental gain variations plus
interstellar diffractive scintillation, and intrinsic narrowband variations.
Based on this 12.5 hours observation, we are sensitive to variations with time
scales of minutes to hours. We find statistically significant intrinsic
variations with time scales of $\sim$15--20 minutes or slower, based on the
{\it velocity-resolved fluctuation spectra}. These variations are seen
predominantly towards the line shoulders. The peak of the line profile shows
little variation, suggesting that they perhaps exhibit saturated emission. The
associated modulation index of the observed fluctuation varies from
statistically insignificant values at the line center to about unity away from
the line center. Based on light-travel-time considerations, the 20-minute time
scale of intrinsic fluctuations translates to a spatial dimension of $\sim$2--3
AU along the sight-lines. On the other hand, the transverse dimension of the
sources, estimated from their observed angular sizes of about $\sim$3 mas, is
about 6 AU. We argue that these source sizes are intrinsic, and are not
affected by interstellar scatter broadening. The implied peak brightness
temperature of the 1612/1720 maser sources is about $\sim2\times 10^{13}$ K,

these lines have shown that the submillimeter emissions in the low-mass
protostellar envelope are resolved, exhibit a western extension from the

3700 AU (P.A. = 78$^{\circ}$) in the HCN emission. The extent of the
submillimeter emissions in L483 implies the presence of higher-temperature
($\gtrsim$ 40 K) gas at 4000 AU away from the central protostar, which suggests
that we need to take 2-dimensional radiative transfer models with a flattened
disklike envelope and bipolar cavity into account to explain the temperature
structure inside the low-mass protostellar envelope. The position-velocity
diagrams of these submillimeter lines in L483 and B335 exhibit different

particular, along the axis of the associated molecular outflow the sense of the
velocity gradient traced by the submillimeter lines is opposite to that of the

the beginning till the late time of cosmological evolution. A cosmological
model has been constructed where the Universe starts with exponential expansion

parameters. During evolution it passes through the stiff fluid era, q=2, w=1,
the radiation dominated era, q=1, w=1/3 and the matter dominated era, q=1/2,
w=0. Finally, deceleration halts, q=0, w=-1/3, and it then encounters a
transition to the accelerating phase. Asymptotically the Universe reaches yet
another inflationary phase as q and w go over to -1. Such evolution is
independent of the form of the potential and the sign of the kinetic energy

morphology: there is an inner ring surrounding the central star, bright inner
lobes with an enhanced waist, and very faint lobular extensions reaching up to

the region near the solar surface. It is one of the determinant ingredients
that govern the turbulence in the photosphere, and the magnetic heating of
upper layers. The acoustic eigenmodes are directly sensitive to this mean
magnetic energy, via the magnetic pressure, and thanks to their trajectories
sweeping entirely this region. We use the local-wave formalism to calculate the
p-mode frequencies of the Saclay seismic solar model. Then, by comparing them
to the LOWL observed frequencies, the l-independent differences (up to 40
microHz) can be attributed to the existence of a magnetic pressure that
modifies the pressure, the density and the sound speed, taking also into
account the additional Alfven speed. A profile of unsigned mean magnetic field
is deduced, increasing from zero at the surface to 2.5e4 G, 5600 km deeper.
Next, by applying the same method, the l-independent variations in frequency
due the solar cycle (up to 0.4 microHz) is used to deduce the change of the
magnetic profile. This change presents two distinctive parts: a plateau of only
2-3 G from the surface down to 2100 km, and a very narrow peak of 55 G, 220 km
thick, right at the surface. Due to the non-linear effect of the magnetic
field, comparing only the frequencies between minimum and maximum activity is
not sufficient to deduce the magnetic variation. The additional knowledge of
the magnetic field at minimum activity is necessary. If the latter is ignored,
an extra variation of up to 130 G would be found. Finally, our results are

dramatic decrease with logarithmic scale, falling from $1.68\pm0.14$ to
$0.10\pm0.05$ over less than a factor of ten in $r$. This decrease is
consistent with the edge effect produced by a projected Poisson distribution

photoluminescence emission. In particular, the presence of a collective sound
mode both above and below the chemical potential can be observed, as well as
features directly related to the density of states of particle-hole like
excitations. Both resonant Rayleigh response and the absorption and
photoluminescence, are affected by the presence of quantum well disorder, which
introduces a distribution of oscillator strengths between quantum well excitons
at a given energy and cavity photons at a given momentum. As we show, this
distribution makes it important that in the condensed regime, scattering by
disorder is taken into account to all orders. We show that, in the low density
linear limit, this approach correctly describes inhomogeneous broadening of
polaritons. In addition, in this limit, we extract a linear blue-shift of the
lower polariton versus density, with a coefficient determined by temperature
and by a characteristic disorder length.

nanotube, which originates from the peculiar two-dimensional band structure of
graphene, plays the role of a pseudo-spin. Screening of this pseudo-spin,
together with the real spin, can result in an SU(4) Kondo effect at low
temperatures. For such an exotic Kondo effect to arise, it is crucial that this
orbital quantum number is conserved during tunneling. Experimentally, this
conservation is not obvious and some mixing in the orbital channel may occur.
Here we investigate in detail the role of mixing and asymmetry in the tunneling
coupling and analyze how different Kondo effects, from the SU(4) symmetry to a
two-level SU(2) symmetry, emerge depending on the mixing and/or asymmetry. We
use four different theoretical approaches to address both the linear and
non-linear conductance for different values of the external magnetic field. Our
results point out clearly the experimental conditions to observe exclusively
SU(4) Kondo physics. Although we focus on nanotube quantum dots, our results
also apply to vertical quantum dots. We also mention that a finite amount of
orbital mixing corresponds, in the pseudospin language, to having non-collinear
leads with respect to the orbital ''magnetization'' axis which defines the two
pseudospin orientations in the nanotube quantum dot. In this sense, some of our
results are also relevant to the problem of a Kondo quantum dot coupled to
non-collinear ferromagnetic leads.

chain in a quenched random potential. The dynamics studied is a simple Langevin
dynamics commonly referred to as the Rouse model. The equations for the
two-time correlation and response function are derived within the gaussian
variational approximation. In order to implement this approximation faithfully,
we employ the supersymmetric representation of the Martin-Siggia-Rose dynamical
action. For a short ranged correlated random potential the equations are solved
analytically in the limit of large times using certain assumptions concerning
the asymptotic behavior. Two possible dynamical behaviors are identified
depending upon the time separation- a stationary regime and an aging regime. In
the stationary regime time translation invariance holds and so is the
fluctuation dissipation theorem. The aging regime which occurs for large time
separations of the two-time correlation functions is characterized by history
dependence and the breakdown of certain equilibrium relations. The large time
limit of the equations yields equations among the order parameters that are
similar to the equations obtained in the statics using replicas. In particular
the aging solution corresponds to the broken replica solution. But there is a

best-known attempt to construct a framework for expressing various security

SIFs cannot capture nondeducibility on strategies (NOS). We also prove that the
set of security properties expressed with SIFs is not closed under conjunction,
from which it follows that separability is strictly stronger than double
generalized noninterference. However, we show that if we generalize the notion

seeming problems of maximizing a weighted sum of rates for a given power budget
$\bar{P}$ and minimizing sum power for given rate requirements
$\mathbf{\bar{R}}$ can be interpreted jointly in this framework. To this end we
embed the problems in a higher dimensional space. Based on these results, we
subsequently consider the combined problem of maximizing a weighted sum of
rates under given rate requirements $\mathbf{\bar{R}}$ and a fixed power budget
$\bar{P}$. This new problem is challenging, since the additional constraints do
not allow to use the hitherto existing approaches. Interestingly, the optimal

is formulated as an SMDP (Semi Markov Decision Process) connection routing
decision problem where rewards comprise a financial gain component and an
aggregate network throughput component. The corresponding Dynamic Programming
equations are solved using Value Iteration method and a stationary optimal
policy with neither convex nor concave type switching curve structure is
obtained. Threshold type and symmetric switching curves are observed for the
analogous homogenous network cases. The Individual optimality is studied under
a non-cooperative dynamic game framework with expected service time of a mobile

switching policies for UMTS that we name as QS (Queue Size), FS (Flow Size) and
QSFS (QS & FS combined) policy. These policies significantly improve over a
modified threshold policy in [1] by about 17% in response time metrics. We
further propose and evaluate a new improved switching policy that we call
FS-DCH (at-least flow-size threshold on DCH) policy. This policy is biased
towards short TCP flows of few packets and is thus a cross-layer policy that
improves the performance of TCP by giving priority to the initial few packets
of a flow on the fast DCH channel. Extensive simulation results confirm this
improvement for the case when number of TCP connections is low.

scalar field $\phi$ with a noncanonical kinetic term ($k$-inflation). We
develop a general criterion for the existence of attractors and establish
conditions selecting a class of $k$-inflation models that admit a unique
attractor solution. We then consider quantum fluctuations on the attractor
background. We show that the correlation length of the fluctuations is of order
$c_{s}H^{-1}$, where $c_{s}$ is the speed of sound. By computing the magnitude
of field fluctuations, we determine the coefficients of Fokker-Planck equations
describing the probability distribution of the spatially averaged field $\phi$.
The field fluctuations are generally large in the inflationary attractor
regime; hence, eternal self-reproduction is a generic feature of $k$-inflation.
This is established more formally by demonstrating the existence of stationary
solutions of the relevant FP equations. We also show that there exists a
(model-dependent) range $\phi_{R}<\phi<\phi_{\max}$ within which large
fluctuations are likely to drive the field towards the upper boundary
$\phi=\phi_{\max}$, where the semiclassical consideration breaks down. An exit
from inflation into reheating without reaching $\phi_{\max}$ will occur almost
surely (with probability 1) only if the initial value of $\phi$ is below
$\phi_{R}$. In this way, strong self-reproduction effects constrain models of
$k$-inflation.

result is different from the known result at present. Our method is valid not

model-dependent nuclear form factors, which may not exactly mirror the actual
form factor for the particular nucleus in question. As is well known, elastic
electron scattering can allow for very precise determinations of nuclear form
factors and hence nuclear charge densities for spherical or near-spherical
nuclei. We use charge densities derived from elastic electron scattering data
to calculate model independent, analytic form factors for various target nuclei
important in dark matter searches, such as Si, Ge, S, Ca and others. We have
found that for nuclear recoils in the range of 1-100 keV significant
differences in cross sections and rates exist when the model independent form
factors are used: at 30 keV nuclear recoil the form factors squared differ by a
factor of 1.06 for $^{28}$Si, 1.11 for $^{40}$Ca, 1.27 for $^{70}$Ge, and 1.92
for $^{129}$Xe. We show the effect of different form factors on the upper limit
on the WIMP-proton cross section obtained with a hypothetical $^{70}$Ge
detector during a 100 kg-day effective exposure. Helm form factors with various
parameter choices differ at most by 10--20% from the best (Fourier Bessel) form
factor, and can approach it to better than 1% if the parameters are chosen to
mimic the actual nuclear density.

revisit the phenomenological constraints applicable to three observables
sensitive to absolute neutrino masses: The effective neutrino mass in single
beta decay (m_beta); the effective Majorana neutrino mass in neutrinoless
double beta decay (m_2beta); and the sum of neutrino masses in cosmology
(Sigma). In particular, we include the constraints coming from the first Main
Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search (MINOS) data and from the Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) three-year (3y) data, as well as other
relevant cosmological data and priors. We find that the largest neutrino
squared mass difference is determined with a 15% accuracy (at 2-sigma) after
adding MINOS to world data. We also find upper bounds on the sum of neutrino
masses Sigma ranging from ~2 eV (WMAP-3y data only) to ~0.2 eV (all
cosmological data) at 2-sigma, in agreement with previous studies. In addition,
we discuss the connection of such bounds with those placed on the matter power
spectrum normalization parameter sigma_8. We show how the partial degeneracy
between Sigma and sigma_8 in WMAP-3y data is broken by adding further
cosmological data, and how the overall preference of such data for relatively
high values of sigma_8 pushes the upper bound of Sigma in the sub-eV range.
Finally, for various combination of data sets, we revisit the (in)compatibility
between current Sigma and m_2beta constraints (and claims), and derive
quantitative predictions for future single and double beta decay experiments.

the algorithm is the sum of each error Hamiltonian's perturbation on the exact

error terms cause the orbit to precess. In this work, by developing a general
method of computing the perihelion advance via the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector
even for non-separable Hamiltonians, I show that the precession error in
symplectic integrators can be computed analytically. It is found that at each
order, each paired error Hamiltonians cause the orbit to precess oppositely by
exactly the same amount after each period. Hence, symplectic corrector, or
process integrators, which have equal coefficients for these paired error
terms, will have their precession errors exactly cancel after each period. Thus
the physics of symplectic integrators determines the optimal algorithm for
integrating long time periodic motions.

remove less-trustworthy data from any time series before analyzing it with the

geochemical covariance of the U, Th and K abundances in various Earth
reservoirs induces positive correlations among the associated geo-neutrino
fluxes, and between these and the radiogenic heat. Mass-balance constraints in
the Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) tend instead to anti-correlate the radiogenic
element abundances in complementary reservoirs. Experimental geo-neutrino
observables may be further (anti)correlated by instrumental effects. In this
context, we propose a systematic approach to covariance matrices, based on the
fact that all the relevant geo-neutrino observables and constraints can be
expressed as linear functions of the U, Th and K abundances in the Earth's

the construction of a tentative ""geo-neutrino source model"" (GNSM) for the U,
Th, and K abundances in the main Earth reservoirs, based on selected
geophysical and geochemical data and models (when available), on plausible
hypotheses (when possible), and admittedly on arbitrary assumptions (when
unavoidable). We use then the GNSM to make predictions about several
experiments (""forward approach""), and to show how future data can constrain - a
posteriori - the error matrix of the model itself (""backward approach""). The
method may provide a useful statistical framework for evaluating the impact and
the global consistency of prospective geo-neutrino measurements and Earth

electromagnetics. Although, no conclusive experimental evidence have so far
been found but the subject is still of much interest to physicist. The theory
of magnetic monopoles was first proposed by Dirac in 1931 and soon after it was
studied by physicist of many deciplines specially particle physics, quantum
field theory and non-linear Soliton equations. One important consequence of the
magnetic monopole theory is the quantization of the electric charge which was
first derived by Dirac. In the definition of the classicaql magnetic monopole,
the concept of Dirac string is used. dirac string is the locus of the points
where the vector potential is nopt well-behave. On the other hand by
introducing the idea of magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations became
symmetrical with respect to the magnetic and electric fields, but they still
remain unsymmetrical as far as the scalar and the vector potentials are
concerned. In this work the electric and magnetic fields are redifined in
termes of some new scalar and vector potentials, respectively, as a result of
which the Maxwell's equations become symmetrical with respect to the
potentials, too. One advantage of using this formulation is that one can
discard the Dirac string all together. Finally, definition of the new
potentials guarantees the lorentz invariance of equations.
