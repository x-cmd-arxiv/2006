ZEUS-2D code to investigate the dynamics of a collapsar that generates a GRB
jet, taking account of realistic equation of state, neutrino cooling and
heating processes, magnetic fields, and gravitational force from the central
black hole and self gravity. It is found that neutrino heating processes are
not so efficient to launch a jet in this study. It is also found that a jet is
launched mainly by B_\phi fields that are amplified by the winding-up effect.
However, since the ratio of total energy relative to the rest mass energy in
the jet is not so high as several hundred, we conclude that the jets seen in
this study are not be a GRB jet. This result suggests that general relativistic
effects, which are not included in this study, will be important to generate a
GRB jet. Also, the accretion disk with magnetic fields may still play an
important role to launch a GRB jet, although a simulation for much longer
physical time (\sim 10-100 s) is required to confirm this effect. It is shown
that considerable amount of 56Ni is synthesized in the accretion disk. Thus
there will be a possibility for the accretion disk to supply sufficient amount
of 56Ni required to explain the luminosity of a hypernova. Also, it is shown
that neutron-rich matter due to electron captures with high entropy per baryon
is ejected along the polar axis. Moreover, it is found that the electron
fraction becomes larger than 0.5 around the polar axis near the black hole by
\nu_e capture at the region. Thus there will be a possibility that r-process
and r/p-process nucleosynthesis occur at these regions. Finally, much neutrons
will be ejected from the jet, which suggests that signals from the neutron
decays may be observed as the delayed bump of afterglow or gamma-rays.

dwarf galaxy NGC 6822. On spatial scales of ~130 pc, we study the nature of IR,
H alpha, HI, and radio continuum emission. Nebular emission strength correlates
with IR surface brightness; however, roughly half of the IR emission is
associated with diffuse regions not luminous at H alpha (as found in previous
studies). The global ratio of dust to HI gas in the ISM, while uncertain at the
factor of ~2 level, is ~25 times lower than the global values derived for
spiral galaxies using similar modeling techniques; localized ratios of dust to
HI gas are about a factor of five higher than the global value in NGC 6822.
There are strong variations (factors of ~10) in the relative ratios of H alpha
and IR flux throughout the central disk; the low dust content of NGC 6822 is
likely responsible for the different H alpha/IR ratios compared to those found
in more metal-rich environments. The H alpha and IR emission is associated with
high-column density (> ~1E21 cm^-2) neutral gas. Increases in IR surface
brightness appear to be affected by both increased radiation field strength and
increased local gas density. Individual regions and the galaxy as a whole fall
within the observed scatter of recent high-resolution studies of the radio-far
IR correlation in nearby spiral galaxies; this is likely the result of depleted
radio and far-IR emission strengths in the ISM of this dwarf galaxy.

$\sim$5-100 keV. Early in 2006 the INTEGRAL observatory performed a series of
four 30ksec observations with the Earth disk crossing the field of view of the
instruments. The modulation of the aperture flux due to occultation of
extragalactic objects by the Earth disk was used to obtain the spectrum of the
Cosmic X-ray Background(CXB). Various sources of contamination were evaluated,
including compact sources, Galactic Ridge emission, CXB reflection by the Earth
atmosphere, cosmic ray induced emission by the Earth atmosphere and the Earth
auroral emission. The spectrum of the cosmic X-ray background in the energy
band 5-100 keV is obtained. The shape of the spectrum is consistent with that
obtained previously by the HEAO-1 observatory, while the normalization is
$\sim$10% higher. This difference in normalization can (at least partly) be
traced to the different assumptions on the absolute flux from the Crab Nebulae.
  The increase relative to the earlier adopted value of the absolute flux of
the CXB near the energy of maximum luminosity (20-50 keV) has direct
implications for the energy release of supermassive black holes in the Universe
and their growth at the epoch of the CXB origin.

incident cosmic-ray spectrum. We provide a fitting formula for the hard X-ray

rigidity and zenith angle. A recent measurement by the INTEGRAL observatory of
the atmospheric hard X-ray flux during the occultation of the cosmic X-ray

that Earth observations could be used for in-orbit calibration of future hard

Taking advantage of the time-tagged events recorded with the GALEX photon
counting detectors, we present high temporal resolution (<0.01 sec) analysis of
these UV flare data. A statistical analysis of 700 seconds of pre-flare
quiescence data for both CR Dra and SDSS J084425.9+513830.5 failed to reveal
the presence of significant micro-flare activity in time bins of 0.2, 1 and 10
second intervals. Using an appropriate differential emission measure for both
the quiescent and flaring state, it is possible to reproduce the observed
FUV:NUV flux ratios. A major determinant in reproducing this flux ratio is
found to be the value of plasma electron density during the flare. We also
searched the count rate data recorded during each of the four flare events for
periodicity associated with magneto-hydrodynamic oscillations in the active
region coronal loops. Significant oscillations were detected during the flare
events observed on all 4 stars, with periodicities found in the 30 to 40 second
range. Flare oscillations with this periodicity can be explained as acoustic
waves in a coronal loop of length of $\approx 10^{9}$ cm for an assumed plasma
temperature of $5-20 \times 10^{6}$K. This suggests a loop length for these
M-dwarf flares of less than $1/10^{th}$ of the stellar radii. We believe that

The identification of Pleiades members fainter and cooler than those currently
known allows us to constrain evolutionary models for L dwarfs and to extend the
study of the cluster mass function to lower masses. We conducted a 1.8 deg^2
near-infrared J-band survey at the 3.5m Calar Alto Telescope, with completeness
J~19.0. The detected sources were correlated with those of previously available
optical I-band images (completeness I~22). Using a J versus I-J
colour-magnitude diagram, we identified 18 faint red L-type candidates, with
magnitudes 17.4<J<19.7 and colours I-J>3.2. If Pleiades members, their masses
would span ~0.040-0.020 M_Sol. We performed follow-up HKs-band imaging to
further confirm their cluster membership by photometry and proper motion. Out
of 11 IJ candidates with proper motion measurements, we find six cluster
members, two non-members and three whose membership is uncertain and depends on
the intrinsic velocity dispersion of Pleiades brown dwarfs. This dispersion (>4
mas yr^-1) is at least four times that of cluster stars with masses >1 M_Sol.
Five of the seven other IJ candidates are discarded because their J-Ks colours
are bluer than those of confirmed members. The J versus I-J sequence of the
L-type candidates at J>18 is not as red as theoretical models predict; it
rather follows the field L-dwarf sequence translated to the cluster distance.
This sequence overlapping, also observed in the J versus J-H and J-K diagrams,
suggests that Pleiades and field L dwarfs may have similar spectral energy
distributions and luminosities, and thus possibly similar radii. Also, we find

the explosive deaths of massive stars (``collapsars''), which produce
accompanying supernovae, while the short-duration (T > 2 s) GRBs arise from a

GRB060614, a 100-s long burst discovered by the Swift satellite, which require
the invocation of a new explosive process: either a massive ``collapsar'' that
powers a GRB without any associated supernova, or a new type of engine, as

groups at >0.06 Mdot_Edd (>~2E37 erg/s) is associated with a transition in the
persistent spectral state and (as has been suggested previously) may be related
to the increasing role of steady He-burning. We found examples of bursts
separated by <30 min, including burst triplets and even quadruplets.
  We describe the oscillation amplitudes for 13 of the 16 burst oscillation
sources, as well as the stages and properties of the bursts in which the
oscillations are detected. The burst properties are correlated with the burst
oscillation frequency; sources at <400 Hz generally have consistently short
bursts, while the more rapidly-spinning systems have both long and short
bursts. This correlation suggests either that shear-mediated mixing dominates
the burst properties, or that the nature of the mass donor (and hence the
evolutionary history) has an influence on the long-term spin evolution.

means of a parallel line-of-sight calculation. The subjacent model, taken from
two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations by Ohsuga et al. (2005),
consists of a disc accretion region and an extended atmosphere with high
velocity outflows. The non-gray radiative transfer equation is solved,
including relativistic effects, by applying the FLD approximation.
  The calculated spectrum is composed of a thermal, blackbody-like emission
from the disc which depends sensitively on the inclination angle, and of high
energy X-ray and gamma-ray emission from the atmosphere. We find mild beaming
effects in the thermal radiation for small inclination angles. If we compare
the face-on case with the edge-on case, the average photon energy is larger by
a factor of ~1.7 due mainly to Doppler boosting, while the photon number
density is larger by a factor of ~3.7 due mainly to anisotropic matter
distribution around the central black hole. This gives an explanation for the
observed X-ray temperatures of ULXs which are too high to be explained in the
framework of intermediate-mass black holes.
  While the main features of the thermal spectral component are consistent with
more detailed calculations of slim accretion discs, the atmosphere induces
major changes in the high-energy part, which cannot be reproduced by existing
models. In order to interpret observational data properly, simple approaches

three-dimensional models. The models provide detailed information about the
morphology of M-type granulation and statistical properties of the convective
surface flows. In particular, we determined the efficiency of the convective
energy transport, and the efficiency of mixing by convective overshoot. The
convective transport efficiency was expressed in terms of an equivalent
mixing-length parameter alpha in the formulation of mixing-length theory (MLT)
given by Mihalas (1978). Alpha amounts to values around 2 for matching the
entropy of the deep, adiabatically stratified regions of the convective
envelope, and lies between 2.5 and 3.0 for matching the thermal structure of
the deep photosphere. For current spectral analysis of PMS objects this implies
that MLT models based on alpha=2.0 overestimate the effective temperature by
100 K and surface gravities by 0.25 dex. The average thermal structure of the
formally convectively stable layers is little affected by convective overshoot
and wave heating, i.e., stays close to radiative equilibrium conditions. Our
models suggest that the rate of mixing by convective overshoot declines
exponentially with geometrical distance to the Schwarzschild stability
boundary. It increases at given effective temperature with decreasing

ordered ferroelectric phase and the composition is close to that at which the
ferroelectric structure changes from rhombohedral to tetragonal. It was found
that above the Burns temperature of about 600K, the transverse optic mode and
the transverse acoustic mode are strongly coupled and a model was used to
describe this coupling that gave similar parameters to those obtained for the
coupling in PMN. Below the Burns temperature additional quasi-elastic
scattering was found which increased in intensity as the sample was cooled down
to the ferroelectric transition temperature but then decreased in intensity.
This behaviour is similar to that found in PMN. This scattering is associated
with the dynamic polar nano-regions that occur below the Burns temperature. In
addition to this scattering a strictly elastic resolution limited peak was
observed that was much weaker than the corresponding peak in pure PMN and which
decreased in intensity on cooling below the ferroelectric phase whereas for
PMN, which does not have a long-range ordered ferroelectric phase, the

allowing to support or discard spin fluctuations (interaction between the

showing that the photoelectron spectrum of YBCO generally includes two
components: One from the topmost anomalously overdoped metallic CuO2 bilayer
and the other from the next superconducting bilayer that retains the bulk
properties. Our findings clearly show the opening of a large superconducting

different cuprate families. With our study we re-open this cuprate family for

these contexts is the gravity's rainbow formalism. We analyze the consequences
of such a modification for black hole thermodynamics from the perspective of
two distinct rainbow realizations built from doubly special relativity. One is
the proposal of Magueijo and Smolin and the other is based on a canonical
implementation of doubly special relativity put forward recently by the

temperature of black holes. We show that, for a family of doubly special
relativity theories satisfying certain properties, the temperature can vanish
in the limit of zero black hole mass. For the Magueijo and Smolin proposal,
this is only possible for some restricted class of models with bounded energy
and unbounded momentum. With the proposal of a canonical implementation, on the
other hand, the temperature may vanish for more general theories; in
particular, the momentum may also be bounded, with bounded or unbounded energy.
This opens new possibilities for the outcome of black hole evaporation in the
framework of a gravity's rainbow.

that will be measurable by space-based detectors such as LISA to large
redshifts. The spins of a binary's black holes have an important impact on its
waveform. Specifically, geodetic and gravitomagnetic effects cause the spins to
precess; this precession then modulates the waveform, adding periodic structure
which encodes useful information about the binary's members. Following
pioneering work by Vecchio, we examine the impact upon GW measurements of
including these precession-induced modulations in the waveform model. We find
that the additional periodicity due to spin precession breaks degeneracies
among certain parameters, greatly improving the accuracy with which they may be
measured. In particular, mass measurements are improved tremendously, by one to
several orders of magnitude. Localization of the source on the sky is also
improved, though not as much -- low redshift systems can be localized to an
ellipse which is roughly ${a few} \times 10$ arcminutes in the long direction
and a factor of 2-4 smaller in the short direction. Though not a drastic
improvement relative to analyses which neglect spin precession, even modest
gains in source localization will greatly facilitate searches for
electromagnetic counterparts to GW events. Determination of distance to the
source is likewise improved: We find that relative error in measured luminosity
distance is commonly $\sim 0.2%-0.7%$ at $z \sim 1$. Finally, with the
inclusion of precession, we find that the magnitude of the spins themselves can
typically be determined for low redshift systems with an accuracy of about
$0.1%-10 %$, depending on the spin value, allowing accurate surveys of mass and
spin evolution over cosmic time.

cosmological constant and Higgs mass parameters scan on a landscape of vacua,
it is well known that the observed orders of magnitude of these quantities can

If in addition the Higgs quartic coupling scans, with a probability
distribution peaked at low values, environmental selection for a phase having a
scale of electroweak symmetry breaking much less than the Planck scale leads to
a most probable Higgs mass of 106 GeV. While fluctuations below this are
negligible, the upward fluctuation is 25/p GeV, where p measures the strength
of the peaking of the a priori distribution of the quartic coupling. If the top
Yukawa coupling also scans, the most probable top quark mass is predicted to
lie in the range (174--178) GeV, providing the standard model is valid to at
least 10^{17} GeV. The downward fluctuation is 35 GeV/ \sqrt{p}, suggesting
that p is sufficiently large to give a very precise Higgs mass prediction.
While a high reheat temperature after inflation could raise the most probable

suggests that reheating is limited to about 10^8 GeV, and that the most
probable value of the Higgs mass remains at 106 GeV. If all Yukawa couplings

values induced by the pressures of strong environmental selection, while the s,

automatically its asymptoticity) to an actual solution $\mb u$.In special cases

interesting properties. On one hand, it can lead to tremendous dynamic growth
of the solution within a short time. On the other hand, it has a surprising
dynamic depletion mechanism that prevents the solution from blowing up in
finite time. By exploiting this special nonlinear structure, we prove the
global regularity of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations for a family of initial
data, whose solutions can lead to large dynamic growth, but yet have global

micromirror to scan a scene. For each different orientation we extract a single
grayscale value from the mirror and combine them to form a single composite
image. This allows one to choose the distribution of the samples, and so in
principle a variable resolution image could be created. We demonstrate this
ability to control resolution by constructing a voltage table that compensates
for the non-linear response of the mirrors to the applied voltage.

  rotating superluminal source",,,"10.1364/JOSAA.24.002443",,"physics.optics",,"  We consider the nonspherically decaying radiation field that is generated by
a polarization current with a superluminally rotating distribution pattern in
vacuum, a field that decays with the distance $\subP{R}$ from its source as
$\subP{R}^{-1/2}$, instead of $\subP{R}^{-1}$. It is shown (i) that the
nonspherical decay of this emission remains in force at all distances from its
source independently of the frequency of the radiation, (ii) that the part of
the source that makes the main contribution toward the value of the
nonspherically decaying field has a filamentary structure whose radial and
azimuthal widths become narrower (as $\subP{R}^{-2}$ and $\subP{R}^{-3}$,
respectively), the farther the observer is from the source, (iii) that the loci
on which the waves emanating from this filament interfere constructively
delineate a radiation `subbeam' that is nondiffracting in the polar direction,
(iv) that the cross-sectional area of each nondiffracting subbeam increases as
$\subP{R}$, instead of $\subP{R}^2$, so that the requirements of conservation
of energy are met by the nonspherically decaying radiation automatically, and
(v) that the overall radiation beam within which the field decays
nonspherically consists, in general, of the incoherent superposition of such
coherent nondiffracting subbeams. These findings are related to the recent
construction and use of superluminal sources in the laboratory and numerical
models of the emission from them. We also briefly discuss the relevance of
these results to the giant pulses received from pulsars.

  figures, 3 tables",,,"SINP-MSU-2006-15/814","physics.acc-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci hep-ph physics.ins-det",,"  The design of the LHC and future colliders aims their operation with high
intensity beams, with bunch population, $N_p$, of the order of $10^{11}$. This
is dictated by a desire to study very rare processes with maximum data sample.
HEP colliders are engineering structures of many kilometers in length, whose
transverse compactness is achieved by the application of the superconducting
technologies and limitations of cost.
  However the compactness of the structural elements conceals and potential
danger for the stable work of the accelerator. This is because a high intensity
beam of positively charged particles (protons, positrons, ions) creates around
itself an electric self-field of very high intensity, $10^5 - 10^6$ V/cm. Being
located near the conducting surfaces, at the distances of 1-20 mm away from
them, the field of such bunches activates the field emission of electrons from
the surface. These electrons, in addition to electrons from the ionization of
residual gases, secondary electrons and electrons knocked out by synchrotron
radiation, contribute to the development of a dense electron cloud in the
transport line. The particles of the bunch, being scattered on the dense
electron cloud with $N_e\sim N_p$, leaves the beam and may cause noticeable
damage. The paper presents an analysis of the conditions, under which the field
emission in the LHC collimator system may become a serious problem. The
analogous analysis of a prototype of the International Linear Collider (ILC)
project, USLC, reveals that a noticeable field emission will accompany positron
bunches on their entire path during acceleration.
