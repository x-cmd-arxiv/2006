justified. For anisotropic diffusion, s is shown to be sensitive to D,
particularly downstream and at certain angles, and a wide range of s values is
attainable. The analysis, confirmed numerically, can be used to test
collisionless shock models and to observationally constrain D. For example,
strongly forward- or backward-enhanced diffusion downstream is ruled out by GRB

We determine the conditions that may lead either to cloud collapse and star

applied the results above to the $\beta-$Pictoris stellar association which is
composed of low mass Post-T Tauri stars with an age of 11 Myr. It has been
recently suggested that its formation could have been triggered by the shock
wave produced by a SN explosion localized at a distance of about 62 pc that may
have occurred either in the Lower Centaurus Crux (LCC) or in the Upper
Centaurus Lupus (UCL) which are both nearby older subgroups of that association
(Ortega and co-workers). Using the results of the analysis above we have shown
that the suggested origin for the young association at the proposed distance is
plausible only for a very restricted range of initial conditions for the parent
molecular cloud, i.e., a cloud with a radius of the order of 10 pc and density
of the order of 20 cm$^{-3}$ and a temperature of the order of 50$-$100 K.

ring of radius 6.2kpc, with suggestions of another partial ring at an even
larger radius. Blue FUV-NUV and UV-optical colours are observed in the centre
of the galaxy and from the outer ring outward, suggesting young stellar
populations (< 1Gyr) and recent star formation in both locations. This is
supported by a simple stellar population model which assumes two bursts of star
formation, allowing us to constrain the age, mass fraction and surface mass
density of the young component pixel by pixel. Overall, the mass fraction of
the young component appears to be just under 1per cent (lower limit,
uncorrected for dust extinction). The additional presence of a nuclear and an
inner ring (radii 1.4 and 2.9kpc, respectively), as traced by [OIII] emission,
suggests ring formation through resonances. All three rings are consistent with
a single pattern speed of $78\pm6$ km/s/kpc, typical of S0 galaxies and only
marginally slower than expected for a fast bar if traced by a small observed
surface brightness plateau. This thus suggests that star formation and
morphological evolution in NGC2974 at the present epoch are primarily driven by
a rotating asymmetry (probably a large-scale bar), despite the standard

masses which are evolved assuming different collapse time scales and different
star formation efficiencies, thus producing different star formation histories.
The stellar yield set we use for all of them (Gavil\'{a}n et al. 2005) have an
important contribution of primary nitrogen proceeding from low and intermediate
mass stars. It allows to obtain a dispersion of results in the N/O-O/H plane,
when star formation efficiencies vary, in general agreement with observations.
The model results for the N/O abundance ratio are in good agreement with most
observational data trends: the extragalactic H{\sc ii} regions is well
reproduced with present time resulting abundances and the low N/O values
estimated for high-redshift objects, as well as the higher and constant values
of N/O observed for irregular and dwarf galaxies or halo stars, can be
simultaneously obtained with our models at the same low oxygen abundances. We
conclude that differences in the star formation history of galaxies and regions

Background Light (EBL) intensity at 1.25 - 4 um that exceeds the integrated
light of galaxies by factors of >3. When combined with a claimed optical
detection of the EBL at 0.80 um the EBL excess emission spectrum has a
discontinuity at ~1 um. This discontinuity has given rise to an interpretation
in terms of ultraviolet radiation emanating from the first generation of
massive stars at redshifts of 7 - 20 (so called Population III stars). The
interpretation of the NIR excess emission as being of extragalactic origin
depends crucially on the model used in the subtraction of the Zodiacal Light,
the dominant foreground contaminant. We estimate the Zodiacal Light at 0.80 um
using on the one hand the measurement by Bernstein et al.,2002, ApJ, 571,85),
with corrections for some omitted effects of atmospheric scattering and
calibration, and on the other hand the model of Kelsall et al.,1998, ApJ,
508,44). There is in neither case any evidence for a step in the EBL at ~1 um.
We emphasize that in order to avoid systematic effects it is essential to use
the same Zodiacal Light model (Kelsall et al. 1998) for both the NIR (1.25 - 4
um) and optical (0.80 um) data. We emphasize, however, that our analysis does
not allow a statement on the overall level of the NIR EBL. The contribution of
the Diffuse Galactic Light to the ``EBL excess'' emission is estimated. It is
found to be significant at 3 - 4 um and should be carefully evaluated in future
measurements which aim at detecting an EBL signal at the level of ~10 nW m^-2
sr^-1, i.e. at the level of the integrated light of (known) galaxies.

originates from the inner parts of the disk. It presents to first order a

protons caused by electron-positron pair production on the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) radiation. For a power-law generation spectrum $E^{-2.7}$, the
calculated position and shape of the dip is confirmed with high accuracy by the
spectra observed by the Akeno-AGASA, HiRes, Yakutsk and Fly's Eye detectors.
When the particle energies, measured in these detectors, are calibrated by the
dip, their fluxes agree with a remarkable accuracy. The predicted shape of the
dip is quite robust. The dip is only modified strongly when the fraction of
nuclei heavier than protons is high at injection, which imposes some
restrictions on the mechanisms of acceleration operating in UHECR sources. The
existence of the dip, confirmed by observations, implies that the transition
from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays occurs at $E \lsim 1\times 10^{18}$
eV. We show that at energies lower than a characteristic value $E_{\rm
cr}\approx 1\times 10^{18}$ eV, the spectrum of extragalactic cosmic rays
flattens in all cases of interest, and it provides a natural transition to a
steeper galactic cosmic ray spectrum. This transition occurs at some energy
below $E_{\rm cr}$, corresponding to the position of the so-called second knee.
We discuss extensively the constraints on this model imposed by current
knowledge of acceleration processes and sources of UHECR and compare it with
the traditional model of transition at the ankle.

interpretation of observations, in order to improve our understanding of these
dynamic structures. We develop our non-local thermodynamic equilibrium
radiative transfer code formerly used for the study of quiescent prominences.
The new numerical code is now able to solve the statistical equilibrium and
radiative transfer equations in the non-static case by using velocity-dependent
boundary conditions for the solution of the radiative transfer problem. This
first study investigates the effects of different physical conditions
(temperature, pressure, geometrical thickness) on the emergent helium
radiation. The motion of the prominence plasma induces a Doppler dimming effect
on the resonance lines of He I and He II. The velocity effects are particularly
important for the He II 304 A line as it is mostly formed by resonant diffusion
of incident radiation under prominence conditions. The He I resonance lines at
584 and 537 A also show some sensitivity to the motion of the plasma, all the
more when thermal emission is not too important in these lines. We also show
that it is necessary to consider partial redistribution in frequency for the
scattering of the incident radiation. This set of helium lines offers strong
diagnostic possibilities that can be exploited with the SOHO spectrometers and
with the EIS spectrometer on board the Hinode satellite. The addition of other
helium lines and of lines from other elements (in particular hydrogen) in the
diagnostics will further enhance the strength of the method.

Camera for Surveys into the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). This fortunate
sequence of events has allowed us to obtain spectacular HST images of the
echoes, yielding not only pictures of extraordinary beauty, but also providing
unique scientific information. Our team has used the HST images to provide a
direct geometrical distance to V838 Mon, based on polarimetric imaging, and
limits on the distance based on the apparent angular expansion rates. Several
morphological features seen in the HST images strongly suggest that the
illuminated dust was ejected from the star in a previous outburst, similar to
the current one. In particular, a ""double-helix"" feature points exactly back to
the star. Moreover, three-dimensional mapping of the outer edges of the dust
suggests an overall ellipsoidal shape, centered on V838 Mon itself. And the
appearance of the light echo in the most recent Hubble images is remarkably
similar to that of a well-known planetary nebula, M27. Future work on the HST
images will include an analysis of interstellar-dust physics, in a situation
where the scattering angle and illumination are unambiguously known, and
visualization of a fully three-dimensional map of the dust distribution.

weaker energy scale is much smaller than that of the magnetic exchange, yet it
is responsible for the energy barriers that are necessary to stabilise a glassy
magnetic phase at finite temperature. The resultant glassy phase is quite
unlike those found in conventional disordered spin glasses as it is based on
complex collective rearrangements of spins called ""spin folds"". This simplifies
hugely theoretical treatment of both the complex dynamics characteristic of a

Specifically, we introduce a temperature dependent function to parameterize the

interpolate between the well-defined low and high temperature limits of the
carrier distribution function and describe the observed anomalies in the
photoluminescence spectra with just two fitting parameters. We show that the

Quantum theory is a probabilistic theory with fixed causal structure. In this
paper we build a framework for probabilistic theories with non-fixed causal
structure. This combines the radical elements of general relativity and quantum
theory. The key idea in the construction is physical compression. A physical
theory relates quantities. Thus, if we specify a sufficiently large set of
quantities (this is the compressed set), we can calculate all the others. We
apply three levels of physical compression. First, we apply it locally to
quantities (actually probabilities) that might be measured in a particular
region of spacetime. Then we consider composite regions. We find that there is
a second level of physical compression for the composite region over and above
the first level physical compression for the component regions. Each
application of first and second level physical compression is quantified by a
matrix. We find that these matrices themselves are related by the physical
theory and can therefore be subject to compression. This is the third level of
physical compression. This third level of physical compression gives rise to a
new mathematical object which we call the causaloid. From the causaloid for a
particular physical theory we can calculate verything the physical theory can
calculate. This approach allows us to set up a framework for calculating
probabilistic correlations in data without imposing a fixed causal structure
(such as a background time). We show how to put quantum theory in this
framework (thus providing a new formulation of this theory). We indicate how
general relativity might be put into this framework and how the framework might
be used to construct a theory of quantum gravity.

ball of radius R, and analyze different kinds of boundary conditions on
\partial B_R. Our main results are: i) We give an explicit analytic example
showing that boundary conditions obtained from freezing the incoming
characteristic fields to their initial values are not compatible with the
constraints. ii) With the help of the exact solutions constructed, we determine
the amount of artificial reflection of gravitational radiation from
constraint-preserving boundary conditions which freeze the Weyl scalar Psi_0 to
its initial value. For monochromatic radiation with wave number k and arbitrary
angular momentum number l >= 2, the amount of reflection decays as 1/(kR)^4 for
large kR. iii) For each L >= 2, we construct new local constraint-preserving
boundary conditions which perfectly absorb linearized radiation with l <= L.
(iv) We generalize our analysis to a weakly curved background of mass M, and
compute first order corrections in M/R to the reflection coefficients for
quadrupolar odd-parity radiation. For our new boundary condition with L=2, the
reflection coefficient is smaller than the one for the freezing Psi_0 boundary

equivalent, in the regime of long wavelengths, to perfect magnetohydrodynamics

thermodynamic relations for a prefect fluid. The equation of state of the
latter is related to the scalar field's self potential. We introduce 1+3
notation to elucidate the relation between MHD and field variables. In our
approach the requirement that the scalar field be single valued leads to the
quantization of a certain circulation in steps of $\hbar$; this feature leads,
in the classical limit, to the conservation of that circulation. The
circulation is identical to that in Oron's generalization of Kelvin's
circulation theorem to perfect MHD; we here characterize the new conserved
helicity associated with it. We also demonstrate the existence for MHD of two
Bernoulli-like theorems for each spacetime symmetry of the flow and geometry;
one of these is pertinent to suitably defined potential flow. We exhibit the
conserved quantities explicitly in the case that two symmetries are
simultaneously present, and give examples. Also in this case we exhibit a new
conserved MHD circulation distinct from Oron's, and provide an example.

Universe after inflation. One or more flat directions can develop large vevs
during inflation, which can potentially affect reheating by slowing down
scattering processes among inflaton decay products or by coming to dominate the
energy density of the Universe. Both effects occur only if flat directions are
sufficiently long-lived. The computation of their perturbative decay rate, and
a simple estimate of their nonperturbative decay have led to the conclusion
that this is indeed the case. In contrast, we show that flat directions can
decay quickly through nonperturbative channels in realistic models. The mass
matrix for MSSM excitations around flat directions has nondiagonal entries,
which vary with the phase of the (complex) flat directions. The quasi-periodic
motion of the flat directions results in a strong parametric resonance, leading
to the rapid depletion of the flat direction within its first few rotations.
This may preclude any significant role for the flat directions in reheating the
Universe after inflation in models in which the inflaton decays perturbatively.

considered to be one of the flagship facilities in hadron physics from 2008.
The facility provides an intensity frontier with 50 GeV proton beam for nuclear
and particle physics. It could cover a wide range of hadron physics from
strongly interacting many-body systems with an extended hadronic degree of
freedom, strangeness, to new forms of hadrons and hadronic matters. These
studies lead not only to create innovative fields of hadron physics but also,
possibly, to understand fundamental interactions because of recent progress on
AdS/CFT correspondence. At the first stage of the J-PARC operation, hadron
topics are mainly on strangeness nuclear physics such as hypernuclei, kaonic
nuclei, and possible pentaquark hadrons. Then, the studies could be extended to
exotic hadron searches, chiral dynamics in nuclear medium, structure functions,
hard exclusive processes, hadron physics in neutrino scattering, and spin
structure of the nucleon. With major upgrades of the facility, extensive
studies could be done for the nucleon spin, heavy-ion physics, and hadron
physics at a high-energy neutrino factory.

If g is a Riemannian metric of class C2, then the Levi-Civita connection and
the Riemannian curvature tensor of g_t converges to the Levi-Civita connection
and to the Riemannian curvature tensor of g respectively as t converges to
zero. Therefore this mollifier smoothing is a good starting point in order to
generalize objects of the classical Riemannian geometry to non-regular

presented. The natural generalizations of several properties of Grothendieck

Postnikov are proved for our quantum Grothendieck polynomials. For instance, we
use a quantization map satisfying a factorization property similar to the
cohomology quantization map, and we derive a Monk-type multiplication formula.
We also define quantum double Grothendieck polynomials and derive a Cauchy

usually related to dynamical systems. Although comparing dynamical systems
seems difficult in general, Lochs was able in 1964 to relate the relative speed
of approximation of decimal and regular continued fraction expansions (almost
everywhere) to the quotient of the entropies of their dynamical systems. He
used detailed knowledge of the continued fraction operator. In 2001, a
generalization of Lochs' result was given by Dajani and Fieldsteel in
\citeDajF, describing the rate at which the digits of one number-theoretic
expansion determine those of another. Their proofs are based on covering
arguments and not on the dynamics of specific maps. In this paper we give a
dynamical proof for certain classes of transformations, and we describe
explicitly the distribution of the number of digits determined when comparing
two expansions in integer bases. Finally, using this generalization of Lochs'
result, we estimate the unknown entropy of certain number theoretic expansions
by comparing the speed of convergence with that of an expansion with known
entropy.

classical deterministic ratchet is associated with bifurcations from chaotic to
periodic regimes. This is based on the comparison of the current and the
bifurcation diagram as a function of a given parameter for a periodic
asymmetric potential. Barbi and Salerno, in \pre 62, 1988 (2000), have further
investigated this claim and argue that, contrary to Mateos' claim, current
reversals can occur also in the absence of bifurcations. Barbi and Salerno's
studies are based on the dynamics of one particle rather than the statistical
mechanics of an ensemble of particles moving in the chaotic system. The
behavior of ensembles can be quite different, depending upon their
characteristics, which leaves their results open to question. In this paper we
present results from studies showing how the current depends on the details of
the ensemble used to generate it, as well as conditions for convergent behavior
(that is, independent of the details of the ensemble). We are then able to
present the converged current as a function of parameters, in the same system
as Mateos as well as Barbi and Salerno. We show evidence for current reversal
without bifurcation, as well as bifurcation without current reversal. We
conjecture that it is appropriate to correlate abrupt changes in the current
with bifurcation, rather than current reversals, and show numerical evidence
for our claims.

response to fluctuating inputs. Reliability means that (following a transient)
an input elicits identical responses upon repeated presentations, regardless of
the system's initial condition. Here, we analyze this property for two coupled
oscillators, demonstrating that oscillator networks exhibit both reliable and
unreliable dynamics for broad ranges of coupling strengths. We further argue
that unreliable dynamics are characterized by strange attractors with random
SRB measures, implying that though unreliable, the responses lie on
low-dimensional sets. Finally, we show that 1:1 phase locking in the zero-input

Videopulse durations tended to decrease with increasing carrier wavelength and
to increase, for given carrier wavelength and polarization state, when the
chiral STF was nonlinear with intensity-dependent permittivity. The rate of
decrease in durations with wavelength was less than that for longer-duration
pulses. The effect of the circular Bragg phenomenon was swamped by the wide
bandwidth possessed by videopulses. Two measures of videopulse average speed
did not change much with carrier wavelength, and decreased slightly, for a
given carrier wavelength and polarization state, in the nonlinear case. The
other measure of average speed tended to increase with increasing carrier
wavelength, and decrease, for a given carrier wavelength and polarization
state, in the nonlinear case.

Rayleigh-Benard convection in water-filled cylindrical samples of heights equal
to their diameters. The orientation of the LSC had an irregular time
dependence, but revealed a net azimuthal rotation with an average period of
about 3 days for Rayleigh numbers R > 10^10. On average there was also a
tendency for the LSC to be aligned with upflow to the west and downflow to the
east, even after physically rotating the apparatus in the laboratory through
various angles. Both of these phenomena could be explained as a result of the
coupling of the Earth's Coriolis force to the LSC. The rate of azimuthal
rotation could be calculated from a model of diffusive LSC orientation
meandering with a potential barrier due to the Coriolis force. The model and
the data revealed an additional contribution to the potential barrier that
could be attributed to the cooling system of the sample top which dominated the
preferred orientation of the LSC at high R. The tendency for the LSC to be in a
preferred orientation due to the Coriolis force could be cancelled by a slight
tilt of the apparatus relative to gravity, although this tilt affected other
aspects of the LSC that the Coriolis force did not.

low temperature glass phase, this quantity grows quadratically with the
logarithm of the chain length, but it switches to a linear behavior of entropic
origin in the high temperature molten phase. Transition between the two phases
is continuous, with characteristics that resemble those of a disordered elastic
manifold in two dimensions. For designed sequences, however, a power-law

appropriate. Extreme value statistics arguments then predict a power-law growth

exhibit a rich spectrum of substrate consumption patterns including diauxic
growth, simultaneous consumption, and bistable growth. In previous work, we
showed that a minimal model accounting only for enzyme induction and dilution
captures all the substrate consumption patterns. Here, we construct the
bifurcation diagram of the minimal model. The bifurcation diagram explains
several general properties of mixed-substrate growth. (1) In almost all cases
of diauxic growth, the ""preferred"" substrate is the one that, by itself,
supports a higher specific growth rate. In the literature, this property is
often attributed to optimality of regulatory mechanisms. Here, we show that the
minimal model, which contains only induction, displays the property under
fairly general conditions. This suggests that the higher growth rate of the
preferred substrate is an intrinsic property of the induction and dilution
kinetics.(2) The model explains the phenotypes of various mutants containing
lesions in the regions encoding for the operator, repressor, and peripheral
enzymes. A particularly striking phenotype is the ""reversal of the diauxie"" in
which the wild-type and mutant strains consume the very same two substrates in
opposite order. This phenotype is difficult to explain in terms of molecular
mechanisms, but it turns out to be a natural consequence of the model. We show
furthermore that the model is robust. The key property of the model, namely,
the competitive dynamics of the enzymes, is preserved even if the model is
modified to account for various regulatory mechanisms. Finally, the model has
important implications for size regulation in development, since it suggests
that protein dilution is one mechanism for coupling patterning and growth.

can strongly vary. While associative learning can explain simple learning
behaviour [1,2] much more sophisticated strategies seem to be involved in
complex learning tasks. This is particularly evident in machine learning theory
[3] (reinforcement learning [4], statistical learning [5]), but it equally
shows up in trying to model natural learning behaviour [2]. A general setting
for modelling learning processes in which statistical aspects are relevant is
provided by the neural network (NN) paradigm. This is in particular of interest
for natural, learning by experience situations. NN learning models can
incorporate elementary learning mechanisms based on neuro-physiological
analogies, such as the Hebb rule, and lead to quantitative results concerning

tasks, while still being elementary and based only on procedures which one may
think of as natural, without any appeal to higher strategies [7]. We can show

closely related to quantum fault tolerance. Lower bounds on the noise tolerable
on the ancilla help give lower bounds on the tolerable noise rate threshold for
fault-tolerant computation. Upper bounds show the limits of threshold
upper-bound arguments based on the Gottesman-Knill theorem.
  We extend the range of single-qubit mixed states that are known to give
universality, by using a simple parity-checking operation. For applications to
proving threshold lower bounds, certain practical stability characteristics are
often required, and we also show a stable distillation procedure.
  No distillation upper bounds are known beyond those given by the
Gottesman-Knill theorem. One might ask whether distillation upper bounds reduce
to upper bounds for single-qubit ancilla states. For multi-qubit pure states
and previously considered two-qubit ancilla states, the answer is yes. However,
we exhibit two-qubit mixed states that are not mixtures of stabilizer states,
but for which every postselected stabilizer reduction from two qubits to one
outputs a mixture of stabilizer states. Distilling such states would require
true multi-qubit state distillation methods.

its validity has never been seriously challenged. However, given its
fundamental standing, it is very important to check it as thoroughly as
possible. Here we describe the VIP (VIolation of the Pauli exclusion principle)

the installation at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory, and aims to test the

infinite dimensional channels and their applications to the additivity problem
are considered.
  The main result of this paper is the statement that the superadditivity of
the convex closure of the output entropy for all finite dimensional channels
implies the superadditivity of the convex closure of the output entropy for all
infinite dimensional channels, which provides the analogous statements for the
strong superadditivity of the EoF and for the additivity of the minimal output
entropy.
  The above result also provides infinite dimensional generalization of Shor's
theorem stated equivalence of different additivity properties.
  The superadditivity of the convex closure of the output entropy (and hence
the additivity of the minimal output entropy) for two infinite dimensional
channels with one of them a direct sum of noiseless and entanglement-breaking
channels are derived from the corresponding finite dimensional results.
  In the context of the additivity problem some observations concerning
complementary infinite dimensional channels are considered.
