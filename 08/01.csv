These observations enable us to determine the spectra of the inner and outer
lobes over a large frequency range and demonstrate that while the spectrum of
the outer lobes exhibits significant curvature, that of the inner lobes appears
practically straight. The break frequency, and hence the inferred synchrotron
age of the outer structure, determined from 16$-$arcsec strips transverse to
the source axis, increases with distance from the heads of the lobes. The
maximum spectral ages for the northern and southern lobes are $\sim$47 and 58
Myr respectively. Because of the difference in the lengths of the lobes these
ages imply a mean separation velocity of the heads of the lobes from the
emitting plasma of 0.036c for both the northern and southern lobes. The
synchrotron age of the inner double is about 2 Myr which implies an advance
velocity of $\sim$0.1c, but these values have large uncertainties because the

the evolution of the SN rates per unit luminosity and per unit mass as
functions of cosmic time and as functions of the Hubble type. Our results
indicate that: (i) the observed increase of the SN rate per unit luminosity and
unit mass from early to late galaxy types is accounted for by our models. Our
explanation of this effect is related to the fact that the latest Hubble types
have the highest star formation rate per unit mass; (ii) By adopting a Scalo
(1986) initial mass function in spiral disks, we find that massive single stars
ending their lives as Wolf-Rayet objects are not sufficient to account for the
observed type Ib/c SN rate per unit mass. Less massive stars in close binary
systems can give instead a significant contribution to the local Ib/c SN rates.
On the other hand, with the assumption of a Salpeter (1955) IMF for all galaxy
types, single massive WR stars are sufficient to account for the observed type
Ib/c SN rate. (iii) Our models allow us to reproduce the observed type Ia SN

pointed out. On large angular scales ($l \lesssim 30$), a sub-optimal
likelihood approximation resulted in a small power excess. On small angular
scales ($l \gtrsim 300$), over-subtraction of unresolved point sources produced
a small power deficit. For a minimal six-parameter cosmological model, these
two effects conspired to decrease the value of $n_s$ by $\sim 0.7 \sigma$. In
this paper, we study the change in preferred parameter ranges for more
extensive cosmological models, including running of $n_s$, massive neutrinos,
curvature, and the equation of state for dark energy. We also include
large-scale structure and supernova data in our analysis. We find that the
parameter ranges for $\alpha_s$, $\Omega_k$ and $w$ are not much altered by the
modified analysis. For massive neutrinos the upper limit on the sum of the
neutrino masses decreases from $M_\nu < 1.90$eV to $M_\nu < 1.57$eV when using
the modified WMAP code and WMAP data only. We also find that the shift of $n_s$
to higher values is quite robust to these extensions of the minimal

We take advantage of the fact that T Tau S belongs to a triple system composed
of two hierarchical orbits to simultaneously analyze the motion of T Tau Sb in
the rest frames of T Tau Sa and T Tau N. With this method, it is possible to
pinpoint the location of the center of mass of T Tau S and, thereby, to
determine individual masses for T Tau Sa and T Tau Sb with no prior assumption
about the mass/flux ratio of the system. This improvement over previous studies
of the system results in much better constraints on orbital parameters. We find
individual masses of 2.73+/-0.31 Msun for T Tau Sa and of 0.61+/-0.17 Msun for
T Tau Sb (in agreement with its early-M spectral type), including the
uncertainty on the distance to the system. These are among the most precise
estimates of the mass of any Pre-Main Sequence star, a remarkable result since
this is the first system in which individual masses of T Tauri stars can be
determined from astrometry only. This model-independent analysis confirms that
T Tau Sa is an intermediate-mass star, presumably a very young Herbig Ae star,
that may possess an almost edge-on disk.

An eccentric gap is created with eccentricity that can exceed the planet's
eccentricity and precesses with respect to the planet's orbit. We find that a
more massive planet is required to open a gap when the planet is on an
eccentric orbit. We attribute this behavior to spiral density waves excited at
corotation resonances that increase the disk's eccentricity and exert a torque
opposite in sign to that exerted by the Lindblad resonances. The reduced torque
makes it more difficult for waves driven by the planet to overcome viscous
inflow in the disk. Spectral energy distributions of transitional disks may
reveal the presence of an eccentric planet if they are matched by an inner edge
comprising a range of temperatures set by the semi-major axis and eccentricity

pressure from an antiferromagnetic (AF) metal, through a highly unconventional
non-Fermi liquid, and finally into a Fermi-liquid state. The amplitude of the
Hall coefficient increases dramatically with decreasing T, reaching at low
temperatures a value significantly larger than 1/ne. Furthermore, the
magnetoresistance is characterized by T- and H-dependence which clearly violate
Kohler's rule. We found that the Hall angle cot\Theta varies as T^2, and the
magnetoresistance is well scaled by the Hall angle as \Delta
\rho_{xx}/\rho_{xx}\propto \tan^2\Theta. These non-Fermi liquid properties in
the electron transport are remarkably pronounced when the AF fluctuations are
enhanced in the vicinity of the QCP. We lay particular emphasis on the striking

adsorption and a sharp transition to surface overcharging at unexpectedly low

with anomalous x-ray reflectivity and find that La$^{3+}$ compensates the lipid
surface charge by forming a Stern layer with $\approx 1$ La$^{3+}$ ion per 3
lipids below a critical bulk concentration, $c_t \approx 500 \mathrm{nM}$.
Above $c_t$, the surface concentration of La$^{3+}$ increases to a saturation
level with $\approx 1$ La$^{3+}$ per lipid, thus implying that the total
electric charge of the La$^{3+}$ exceeds the surface charge. This overcharge is
observed at $\approx$ 4 orders of magnitude lower concentration than predicted
in ion-ion correlation theories. We suggest that transverse electrostatic
correlations between mobile ions and surface charges (interfacial Bjerrum
pairing) may account for the charge inversion observed in this dilute regime.

for the electron-doped Na$_x$CoO$_2$ (NCO). To understand several aspects of
this system, we study the $T$-dependent chemical potential, specific heat,
magnetic susceptibility, and the dynamic Hall-coefficient across the entire
doping range. We show systematically, how this simplest model for strongly
correlated electrons describes a crossover as function of doping ($x$) from a
Pauli-like weakly spin-correlated metal close to the band-limit (density $n=2$)
to the Curie-Weiss metallic phase ($1.5<n<1.75$) with pronounced
anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) correlations at low temperatures and Curie-Weiss type
behavior in the high-temperature regime. Upon further reduction of the doping,
a new energy scale, dominated by spin-interactions ($J$) emerges (apparent both
in specific heat and susceptibility) and we identify an effective interaction
$J_{eff}(x)$, valid across the entire doping range. This is distinct from
Anderson's formula, as we choose here $t<0$, hence the opposite sign of the
usual Nagaoka-ferromagnetic situation. This expression includes the subtle
effect of weak kinetic AFM - as encountered in the infinitely correlated
situation ($U=\infty$). By explicit computation of the Kubo-formulae, we
address the question of practical relevance of the high-frequency expression
for the Hall coefficient $R_H^*$. We hope to clarify some open questions
concerning the applicability of the t-J model to real experimental situations
through this study.

parallel the typical experimental conditions. Those distributions are measured
with square windows of sizes $8\leq r\leq 128$ gliding through a much larger
surface. Results for models with weak finite-size corrections indicate that the
absolute value of the skewness and the value of the kurtosis of height
distributions converge to $0.2\leq |S|\leq 0.3$ and $0\leq Q\leq 0.5$,
respectively. Despite the low accuracy of these results, they give additional
support to a recent claim of KPZ scaling in oligomer films. However, there are
significant finite-size effects in the scaled height distributions of models
with large local slopes, such as ballistic deposition, which suggests that
comparison of height distributions must not be used to rule out KPZ scaling. On
the other hand, roughness distributions of the same models show good data
collapse, with negligible dependence on time and window size. The estimates of
skewness and kurtosis for roughness distributions are $1.7\leq S\leq 2$ and
$3\leq Q\leq 7$. A stretched exponential tail was found, which seems to be a
particular feature of KPZ systems in 2+1 dimensions. Moreover, the KPZ
roughness distributions cannot be fitted by those of $1/f^{\alpha}$ noise. This
study suggests that the roughness distribution is the best option to test KPZ
scaling in the growth regime, and provides quantitative data for future
comparison with other models or experiments.

process in position space is the Wiener process. As well-known, the Gaussian
transition probability density function (PDF) of this process is in conflict
with special relativity, as it permits particles to propagate faster than the
speed of light. A frequently considered alternative is provided by the
telegraph equation, whose solutions avoid superluminal propagation speeds but
suffer from singular (non-continuous) diffusion fronts on the light cone, which
are unlikely to exist for massive particles. It is therefore advisable to
explore other alternatives as well. In this paper, a generalized Wiener process
is proposed that is continuous, avoids superluminal propagation, and reduces to
the standard Wiener process in the non-relativistic limit. The corresponding
relativistic diffusion propagator is obtained directly from the nonrelativistic
Wiener propagator, by rewriting the latter in terms of an integral over
actions. The resulting relativistic process is non-Markovian, in accordance
with the known fact that nontrivial continuous, relativistic Markov processes
in position space cannot exist. Hence, the proposed process defines a
consistent relativistic diffusion model for massive particles and provides a
viable alternative to the solutions of the telegraph equation.

adversary model that specifies the capabilities of adversaries. A common model
is the Dolev-Yao model, which considers only adversaries that can compose and
replay messages, and decipher them with known keys. The Dolev-Yao model is a
useful abstraction, but it suffers from some drawbacks: it cannot handle the
adversary knowing protocol-specific information, and it cannot handle
probabilistic notions, such as the adversary attempting to guess the keys. We
show how we can analyze security protocols under different adversary models by
using a logic with a notion of algorithmic knowledge. Roughly speaking,
adversaries are assumed to use algorithms to compute their knowledge; adversary
capabilities are captured by suitable restrictions on the algorithms used. We
show how we can model the standard Dolev-Yao adversary in this setting, and how
we can capture more general capabilities including protocol-specific knowledge
and guesses.

order perturbations of a perfect fluid non-rotating compact star: those arising
from the coupling between first order radial and non-radial perturbations. This
problem has been treated by developing a gauge invariant formalism based on the
2-parameter perturbation theory (Sopuerta, Bruni and Gualtieri, 2004) where the
radial and non-radial perturbations have been separately parameterized. The
non-linear perturbations obey inhomogeneous partial differential equations,
where the structure of the differential operator is given by the previous
perturbative orders and the source terms are quadratic in the first order
perturbations. In the exterior spacetime the sources vanish, thus the
gravitational wave properties are completely described by the second order
Zerilli and Regge-Wheeler functions.
  As main initial configuration we have considered a first order differentially
rotating and radially pulsating star. Although at first perturbative order this
configuration does not exhibit any gravitational radiation, we have found a new
interesting gravitational signal at non-linear order, in which the radial
normal modes are precisely mirrored. In addition, a resonance effect is present
when the frequencies of the radial pulsations are close to the first axial
w-mode. Finally, we have roughly estimated the damping times of the radial
pulsations due to the non-linear gravitational emission. The coupling near the
resonance results to be a very effective mechanism for extracting energy from
the radial oscillations.

imposes a contracting wormhole solution and the obedience of the weak energy
condition. Nevertheless, in the presence of an electric field, the latter
presents a singularity at the throat, however, for a pure magnetic field the
solution is regular. For the (2+1)-dimensional case, it is also found that the
physical fields are singular at the throat. Thus, taking into account the
principle of finiteness, which states that a satisfactory theory should avoid
physical quantities becoming infinite, one may rule out evolving

specific gauge fixing which leads to the simplest one among all possible

help of coordinate independent de Sitter waves (the modes) which are simple to
manipulate and most adapted to group theoretical matters. The physical states

pseudodifferential operator of the brane-to-brane propagation of quantum
gravitational perturbations. The gauge dependence of these contributions is
analyzed by the method of Ward identities. By the recently suggested method of
the Neumann-Dirichlet reduction the bulk propagator in the semiclassical
expansion is converted to the Dirichlet boundary conditions preferable from the
calculational viewpoint.

transition from decceleration to acceleration, accelerating epoch consistent
with recent WMAP data b. $\Lambda$CDM cosmology without cosmological constant.
As a rule, such modified gravities are expressed implicitly (in terms of
special functions) with late-time asymptotics of known type (for instance, the
model with negative and positive powers of curvature). In the alternative
approach, it is demonstrated that even simple versions of modified gravity may
lead to the unification of matter dominated and accelerated phases at the price
of the introduction of compensating dark energy.

stochastic many-body microscopic models and quantify their effectiveness in
terms of a priori and a posteriori error analysis. In this paper we focus on
stochastic lattice systems of interacting particles at equilibrium. %such as
Ising-type models. The proposed algorithms are derived from an initial
coarse-grained approximation that is directly computable by Monte Carlo
simulations, and the corresponding numerical error is calculated using the
specific relative entropy between the exact and approximate coarse-grained
equilibrium measures. Subsequently we carry out a cluster expansion around this
first-and often inadequate-approximation and obtain more accurate
coarse-graining schemes. The cluster expansions yield also sharp a posteriori
error estimates for the coarse-grained approximations that can be used for the
construction of adaptive coarse-graining methods. We present a number of
numerical examples that demonstrate that the coarse-graining schemes developed
here allow for accurate predictions of critical behavior and hysteresis in
systems with intermediate and long-range interactions. We also present examples
where they substantially improve predictions of earlier coarse-graining schemes

to construct a convex polytope $P_k$ whose support function (or brightness
function) best approximates the given measurements in the directions
$u_1,...,u_k$ (in the least squares sense). The measurement errors are assumed
to be stochastically independent and Gaussian. It is shown that this procedure
is (strongly) consistent, meaning that, almost surely, $P_k$ tends to $K$ in
the Hausdorff metric as $k\to\infty$. Here some mild assumptions on the
sequence $(u_i)$ of directions are needed. Using results from the theory of
empirical processes, estimates of rates of convergence are derived, which are
first obtained in the $L_2$ metric and then transferred to the Hausdorff
metric. Along the way, a new estimate is obtained for the metric entropy of the
class of origin-symmetric zonoids contained in the unit ball. Similar results
are obtained for the convergence of an algorithm that reconstructs an
approximating measure to the directional measure of a stationary fiber process
from noisy measurements of its rose of intersections in $k$ directions
$u_1,...,u_k$. Here the Dudley and Prohorov metrics are used. The methods are
linked to those employed for the support and brightness function algorithms via
the fact that the rose of intersections is the support function of a projection

conditional independence restrictions separately for each node in the graph and
is hence equivalent to variable selection for Gaussian linear models. We show
that the proposed neighborhood selection scheme is consistent for sparse
high-dimensional graphs. Consistency hinges on the choice of the penalty
parameter. The oracle value for optimal prediction does not lead to a
consistent neighborhood estimate. Controlling instead the probability of
falsely joining some distinct connectivity components of the graph, consistent
estimation for sparse graphs is achieved (with exponential rates), even when
the number of variables grows as the number of observations raised to an
arbitrary power.

appropriate in a wide range of different settings. In studies of ``functional
data analysis,'' it has often been assumed that a sample of random functions is
observed precisely, in the continuum and without noise. While this has been the
traditional setting for functional data analysis, in the context of
longitudinal data analysis a random function typically represents a patient, or
subject, who is observed at only a small number of randomly distributed points,
with nonnegligible measurement error. Nevertheless, essentially the same
methods can be used in both these cases, as well as in the vast number of
settings that lie between them. How is performance affected by the sampling
plan? In this paper we answer that question. We show that if there is a sample
of $n$ functions, or subjects, then estimation of eigenvalues is a
semiparametric problem, with root-$n$ consistent estimators, even if only a few
observations are made of each function, and if each observation is encumbered
by noise. However, estimation of eigenfunctions becomes a nonparametric problem
when observations are sparse. The optimal convergence rates in this case are
those which pertain to more familiar function-estimation settings. We also
describe the effects of sampling at regularly spaced points, as opposed to
random points. In particular, it is shown that there are often advantages in
sampling randomly. However, even in the case of noisy data there is a threshold
sampling rate (depending on the number of functions treated) above which the
rate of sampling (either randomly or regularly) has negligible impact on
estimator performance, no matter whether eigenfunctions or eigenvectors are
being estimated.

functional data mean that principal component methods play a substantially
greater role in functional data analysis than in more conventional

functions are of direct importance; they indicate places in the domain of a
random function where influence on the function value tends to be relatively
strong but of opposite sign. We explore statistical properties of the
relationship between extrema of empirical principal component functions, and
their counterparts for the true principal component functions. It is shown that
empirical principal component funcions have relatively little trouble capturing
conventional extrema, but can experience difficulty distinguishing a
``shoulder'' in a curve from a small bump. For example, when the true principal
component function has a shoulder, the probability that the empirical principal
component function has instead a bump is approximately equal to 1/2. We suggest
and describe the performance of bootstrap methods for assessing the strength of
extrema. It is shown that the subsample bootstrap is more effective than the
standard bootstrap in this regard. A ``bootstrap likelihood'' is proposed for
measuring extremum strength. Exploratory numerical methods are suggested.

for approximating their asymptotic distributions conditional on the observed

conducted to investigate the empirical performance of the test statistics. A
real data set is analyzed to illustrate the application of our theoretical
results.

neutrons induce fission in a surrounding assembly of uranium carbide. R&D
projects on several aspects of the target assembly are ongoing. Key criteria

a Hamiltonian that generates linear SU(2) transformations. The Hamiltonian is
generic in that it represents a host of entanglement mechanisms, which can thus
be treated in a unified way. We start by solving the quantum dynamics
analytically when the system is initially in a Fock state. We show how the two
modes get entangled by evolution to produce a coherent superposition of vortex
states in general, and a single vortex state under certain conditions. The
degree of entanglement between the modes is measured by finding the explicit
analytical dependence of the Von Neumann entropy on the system parameters. The
reduced state of each mode is analyzed by means of its correlation function and
spatial coherence function. Remarkably, our analysis is shown to be equally as
valid for a variety of initial states that can be prepared from a two-mode Fock
state via a unitary transformation and for which the results can be obtained by
mere inspection of the corresponding results for an initial Fock state. As an
example, we consider a quantum vortex as the initial state and also find
conditions for its revival and charge conjugation. While studying the evolution
of the initial vortex state, we have encountered and explained an interesting
situation in which the entropy of the system does not evolve whereas its wave
function does. Although the modal concept has been used throughout the paper,
it is important to note that the theory is equally applicable for a
two-particle system in which each particle is represented by its bosonic
creation and annihilation operators.

Lett. 97, 250503 (2006)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.250503",,"quant-ph",,"  Any physical transformation that equally distributes quantum information over
a large number M of users can be approximated by a classical broadcasting of
measurement outcomes. The accuracy of the approximation is at least of the
order 1/M. In particular, quantum cloning of pure and mixed states can be
approximated via quantum state estimation. As an example, for optimal qubit
cloning with 10 output copies, a single user has error probability p > 0.45 in
distinguishing classical from quantum output--a value close to the error
probability of the random guess.

Bell states with a high fidelity via type-II spontaneous parametric
down-conversion (SPDC) of narrow-band pump light. However, the use of
femtosecond pump pulses to generate multi-photon states with precise timing
often requires spectral filtering to maintain a high quality of polarization
entanglement. This typically reduces the efficiency of photon pair collection.
We experimentally map the polarization correlations of photon pairs from such a
source over a range of down-converted wavelengths with a high spectral
resolution and find strong polarization correlations everywhere. A spectrally
dependent imbalance between contributions from the two possible decay paths of
SPDC is identified as the reason for a reduction in entanglement quality
observed with femtosecond pump pulses. Our spectral measurements allow to
predict the polarization correlations for arbitrary filter profiles when the
frequency degree of freedom of the photon pairs is ignored.

answers (always estimated by the same observers). Finally, we infer that every

  figures",,,,"quant-ph cond-mat.str-el hep-th",,"  The work that we present in this thesis tries to be at the crossover of
quantum information science, quantum many-body physics, and quantum field
theory. We use tools from these three fields to analyze problems that arise in
the interdisciplinary intersection. More concretely, in Chapter 1 we consider
the irreversibility of renormalization group flows from a quantum information
perspective by using majorization theory and conformal field theory. In Chapter
2 we compute the entanglement of a single copy of a bipartite quantum system
for a variety of models by using techniques from conformal field theory and
Toeplitz matrices. The entanglement entropy of the so-called
Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model is computed in Chapter 3, showing analogies with
that of (1+1)-dimensional quantum systems. In Chapter 4 we apply the ideas of
scaling of quantum correlations in quantum phase transitions to the study of
quantum algorithms, focusing on Shor's factorization algorithm and quantum
algorithms by adiabatic evolution solving an NP-complete and the searching
problems. Also, in Chapter 5 we use techniques originally inspired by
condensed-matter physics to develop classical simulations, using the so-called
matrix product states, of an adiabatic quantum algorithm. Finally, in Chapter 6
we consider the behavior of some families of quantum algorithms from the
perspective of majorization theory. The structure within each Chapter is such
that the last section always summarizes the basic results. Some general
conclusions and possible future directions are briefly discussed in Chapter 7.
Appendix A, Appendix B and Appendix C respectively deal with some basic notions
on majorization theory, conformal field theory, and classical complexity
theory.
