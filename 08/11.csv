4258 using the Advanced Camera for Surveys onboard the Hubble Space Telescope.
This galaxy was selected because of its accurate maser-based distance, which is
anticipated to have a total uncertainty of ~3%. The goal of the HST
observations is to provide an absolute calibration of the Cepheid Distance
Scale and to measure its dependence on chemical abundance (the so-called
""metallicity effect"").
  We carried out observations of two fields at different galactocentric
distances with a mean abundance difference of 0.5 dex. We discovered a total of
281 Cepheids with periods ranging from 4 to 45 days (the duration of our
observing window). We determine a Cepheid distance modulus for NGC 4258
(relative to the LMC) of 10.88 +- 0.04 (random) +- 0.05 (systematic) mag. Given
the published maser distance to the galaxy, this implies \mu (LMC)=18.41 +-
0.10 (r) +- 0.13 (s) mag or D(LMC)= 48.1 +- 2.3 (r) +- 2.9 (s) kpc. We measure
a metallicity effect of \gamma=-0.29 +- 0.09 (r) +- 0.05 (s) mag/dex. We see no
evidence for a variation in the slope of the Period-Luminosity relation as a
function of abundance.
  We estimate a Hubble Constant of H_0= 74 +- 3 (r) +- 6 (s) km/s Mpc using a
recent sample of 4 well-observed type Ia SNe and our new calibration of the
Cepheid Distance Scale. It may soon be possible to measure the value of H_0
with a total uncertainty of 5%, with consequent improvement in the
determination of the equation of state of dark energy.

air. The experiment is easy to reproduce and it is based on simple optical

fixed laser beam in the laboratory frame that scans due to Earth's rotation.
Second, an active rotation of the laser beam on a turntable system. The results
obtained with both methods show that the course of the light rays are affected
by the motion of the Earth, and a predominant quantity of first order with a

from the 3rd EGRET catalog which are at intermediate Galactic latitudes (5 deg.
< |b| < 73 deg.). For each source, four interleaved 35-minute pointings were
made with the 13-beam, 1400-MHz multibeam receiver on the Parkes 64-m radio
telescope. This covered the 95% error box of each source at a limiting
sensitivity of about 0.2 mJy to pulsed radio emission for periods P > 10 ms and
dispersion measures < 50 pc cm-3. Roughly half of the unidentified gamma-ray
sources at |b| > 5 deg. with no proposed active galactic nucleus counterpart
were covered in this survey. We detected nine isolated pulsars and four
recycled binary pulsars, with three from each class being new. Timing
observations suggest that only one of the pulsars has a spin-down luminosity
which is even marginally consistent with the inferred luminosity of its
coincident EGRET source. Our results suggest that population models, which
include the Gould belt as a component, overestimate the number of isolated
pulsars among the mid-latitude Galactic gamma-ray sources and that it is
unlikely that Gould belt pulsars make up the majority of these sources.
However, the possibility of steep pulsar radio spectra and the confusion of
terrestrial radio interference with long-period pulsars (P > 200 ms) having
very low dispersion measures (< 10 pc cm-3, expected for sources at a distance
of less than about 1 kpc) prevent us from strongly ruling out this hypothesis.
Our results also do not support the hypothesis that millisecond pulsars make up
the majority of these sources. Non-pulsar source classes should therefore be
further investigated as possible counterparts to the unidentified EGRET sources
at intermediate Galactic latitudes.

three reported periodicities: the orbital period, P{orb}~11.6 d, X-ray flaring
with P{flare}~2.7 hr, and a ""superorbital"" X-ray periodicity P{super}~30.7 d.
The objective of this paper is to show that the puzzling periodicities in the
system may be explained in the context of scenarios in which tidal interactions
drive oscillations in the B-supergiant star. We calculate the solution of the
equations of motion for one layer of small surface elements distributed along
the equator of the star, as they respond to the forces due to gas pressure,
centrifugal, coriolis, viscous forces, and the gravitational forces of both
stars. This calculation provides variability timescales that can be compared
with the observations. In addition, we use observational data obtained at the
Observatorio Astron\'omico Nacional en San Pedro M\'artir (OAN/SPM) between
1993-2004 to determine which of the periodicities may be present in the optical
region. We suggest that the tidal oscillations lead to a structured stellar
wind which, when fed to the neutron star, produces the X-ray modulations. The
connection between the stellar oscillations and the modulation of the mass
ejection may lie in the shear energy dissipation generated by the tangential
motions that are produced by the tidal interaction, particularly in the tidal
bulge region. The tidal oscillation scenario weakens the case for 2S0114+650
containing a magnetar descendent.

parameter space to identify conditions under which plane-parallel clouds
contain sufficient column densities of molecular dark matter that they could be
reservoirs for future star formation. Such clouds would be undetected or at
least appear by current observational criteria to be uninteresting from the
perspective of star formation. We use a time-dependent PDR code to produce
theoretical models of the chemistry and emission arising in clouds for our
chosen region of parameter space. We then select a subset of model clouds with
levels of emission that are low enough to be undetectable or at least
overlooked by current surveys. The existence of significant column densities of
cold molecular dark matter requires that the background radiation field be
several or more orders of magnitude weaker than that in the solar
neighbourhood. Lower turbulent velocities and cosmic ray induced ionization
rates than typically associated with molecular material within a kpc of the Sun
are also required for the molecular matter to be dark. We find that there is a
large region within the parameter space that results in clouds that might
contain a significant mass of molecular gas whilst remaining effectively
undetectable or at least not particularly noticeable in surveys. We note
briefly conditions under which molecular dark matter may contain a dynamically
interesting mass.

We find that the star formation in the gas-stripped outer disk ceased very

currently being stripped. At the time of this stripping, data and models
suggest that the galaxy experienced a modest starburst. The stripping is
occurring in a region of the cluster well outside the cluster core, likely
because this galaxy is experiencing extreme conditions from a dynamic ICM due
to an ongoing sub-cluster merger. The outer disk has a spectrum of a K+A
galaxy, traditionally observed in high-redshift cluster galaxies. In the case
of NGC 4522, a K+A spectrum is formed by simple stripping of the interstellar
gas by the hot intracluster medium. These data show K+A spectra can be created
by cluster processes and that these processes likely extend beyond the cluster
core.

recent detection of a correlation between the spectral index and flux during a
near infrared (NIR) flare provides a means to conduct detailed investigations
of the plasma heating and radiation processes. We study the evolution of the
electron distribution function under the influence of a turbulent magnetic
field in a hot collisionless plasma. The magnetic field, presumably generated
through instabilities in the accretion flow, can both heat the plasma via
resonant wave-particle coupling and cool the electrons via radiation. The
electron distribution can generally be approximated as relativistic Maxwellian.
To account for the observed correlation, we find that the magnetic field needs
to be anti-correlated with the electron ''temperature''. NIR and X-ray light
curves are produced for a cooling and a heating phase. The model predicts
simultaneous flare activity in the NIR and X-ray bands, which can be compared
with observations. These results can be applied to MHD simulations to study the
radiative characteristics of collisionless plasmas, especially accretion flows

day-side atmospheric pressure-temperature profiles that are much more

radiative-convective models have found. The resulting day-side thermal spectra
are very similar to a blackbody, and only weak water absorption features are
seen at short wavelengths. The dayside emission is consequently in
significantly better agreement with ground-based and space-based secondary
eclipse data than any previous models, which predict strong flux peaks and deep
absorption features. At other orbital phases, absorption due to carbon monoxide
and methane is also predicted. We compute the spectra under two treatments of
atmospheric chemistry: one uses the predictions of equilibrium chemistry, and
the other uses non-equilibrium chemistry, which ties the timescales of methane
and carbon monoxide chemistry to dynamical timescales. As a function of orbital
phase, we predict planet-to-star flux ratios for standard infrared bands and
all Spitzer Space Telescope bands. In Spitzer bands, we predict 2-fold to
15-fold variation in planetary flux as a function of orbital phase with
equilibrium chemistry, and 2-fold to 4-fold variation with non-equilibrium
chemistry. Variation is generally more pronounced in bands from 3-10 $\mu$m
than at longer wavelengths. The orbital phase of maximum thermal emission in

GCs (ICGCs) based on the results of 14 models. Our principle results are
summarized as follows. (1) The projected radial density profiles (Sigma_GC) of
ICGCs in clusters with different M_CL can be diverse, though ICGCs have
inhomogeneous, asymmetric, and somewhat elongated distributions in most models.
If Sigma_GC (R) ~ R^alpha, alpha ranges from -1.5 to -2.5 for GCs in clusters.
(2) Although total number of GCs within the central 0.05 Mpc (N_GC,0.05) and
0.2 Mpc (N_GC,0.2) are diverse in different clusters, they can depend weakly on
M_CL in such a way that both N_GC,0.05 and N_GC,0.2 are likely to be larger for
clusters with larger M_CL. (3) Total number of GCs per cluster masses (specific
frequency of GCs for clusters of galaxies) are more likely to be larger in more
massive clusters, mainly because a larger number of earlier virialized objects
can be located in more massive clusters. (4) Spatial distributions of old GCs
in clusters can depend on the truncation epoch of GC formation (z_trun) such
that they can be steeper and more compact in the models with higher z_trun. (5)
The mean metallicity of ICGCs in a cluster can be smaller than that of GCs
within the cluster member galaxy-scale halos by ~ 0.3 in [Fe/H]. Metallicity
distribution functions (MDFs) of ICGCs show peak values around [Fe/H] ~ -1.6
and do not have remarkable bimodality.

the first stage of the calculation, whereby the low-energy ab-initio problem is
transformed into an effective tight-binding form. The second stage only
involves Fourier transforms and unitary transformations of the small matrices
set up in the first stage. With these inexpensive operations, the quantities of
interest are interpolated onto a dense k-point mesh and used to evaluate the
anomalous Hall conductivity as a Brillouin zone integral. The present scheme,
which also avoids the cumbersome summation over all unoccupied states in the
Kubo formula, is applied to bcc Fe, giving excellent agreement with
conventional, less efficient first-principles calculations. Remarkably, we find
that more than 99% of the effect can be recovered by keeping a set of terms
depending only on the Hamiltonian matrix elements, not on matrix elements of
the position operator.

on well known O(m)-vector models in three dimension. Evidences of changes of
criticality in both systems, when confined in aerogel pores, are briefly
referenced. The 3DXY model (m=2) represents the universality class to which the
\lambda-transition of bulk superfluid $^4$He belongs. Experiments report
changes of critical exponents for this transition, when superfluid $^4$He is
confined in aerogels. Numerical results of the 3DXY model, confined in
aerogel-like structures, are in agreement with experiments. Both results seem
to contradict Harris criterion: being the specific heat exponent negative for
the pure system, changes must be explained in terms of the extended criterion
due to Weinrib and Halperin, which requires disorder to be long-range
correlated (LRC) at all scales. Aerogels are fractal through some decades only,
and present crossovers to homogeneous regimes at finite scales, so the
violation to Harris criterion persists. The apparent violation has been
explained in terms of hidden LRC subsets within aerogels $[$Phys. Rev. Lett.,
2003, {\bf 90}, 170602$]$. On the other hand, experiments on the liquid-vapor
(LV) transition of $^4$He and N$_2$ confined in aerogels, also showed changes
in critical-point exponents. Being the LV critical-point in the O(1)
universality class, criticality may be affected by both, short-range correlated
(SRC) and LRC subsets ofdisorder. Simulations of the 3DIS in DLCA aerogels can
corroborate experimental results. Experiments and simulations both suggest a
shift in critical exponents to values closer to the SRC instead of those of the
LRC fixed point.

tau-production threshold, but above the pion production one, is presented. It
is based on the different behavior of the neutral current pion production off
the nucleon, depending on whether it is induced by neutrinos or antineutrinos.
This procedure for distinguishing tau-neutrinos from antineutrinos neither
relies on any nuclear model, nor it is affected by any nuclear effect
(distortion of the outgoing nucleon waves, etc...). We show that
neutrino-antineutrino asymmetries occur both in the totally integrated cross
sections and in the pion azimuthal differential distributions. To define the
asymmetries for the latter distributions we just rely on Lorentz-invariance.
All these asymmetries are independent of the lepton family and can be
experimentally measured by using electron or muon neutrinos, due to the lepton
family universality of the neutral current neutrino interaction. Nevertheless
and to estimate their size, we have also used the chiral model of
hep-ph/0701149 at intermediate energies. Results are really significant since
the differences between neutrino and antineutrino induced reactions are always
large in all physical channels.

such an inductance term and find that it vanishes, due to the contribution of a
global low-energy mode (a ``global axion''). This is in accord with the general
argument on the absence of theta-dependence in such topologies. Because the
mode is a single oscillator, there is no corresponding particle, and the
solution to the U(1) problem is unaffected.

scale is smaller than their symmetry breaking scale. In particular, depending
on the concrete form of the kinetic term, the typical size of such a defect can
be either much larger or much smaller than the size of a standard defect with

trivial (classically stable) vacuum of gauge theories becomes unstable at the
quantum level, unless one introduces sufficiently many fermionic degrees of
freedom. This is due to a negative IR-singular term in the one-loop effective
potential, which appears as a result of the UV/IR mixing. We study such a
system non-perturbatively in the case of pure U(1) gauge theory in four
dimensions, where two directions are non-commutative. Monte Carlo simulations
are performed after mapping the regularized theory onto a U(N) lattice gauge
theory in d=2. At intermediate coupling strength, we find a phase in which open
Wilson lines acquire non-zero vacuum expectation values, which implies the
spontaneous breakdown of translational invariance. In this phase, various
physical quantities obey clear scaling behaviors in the continuum limit with a
fixed non-commutativity parameter $\theta$, which provides evidence for a
possible continuum theory. The extent of the dynamically generated space in the
non-commutative directions becomes finite in the above limit, and its
dependence on $\theta$ is evaluated explicitly. We also study the dispersion
relation. In the weak coupling symmetric phase, it involves a negative
IR-singular term, which is responsible for the observed phase transition. In
the broken phase, it reveals the existence of the Nambu-Goldstone mode
associated with the spontaneous symmetry breaking.

structure is co-calibrated if, and only if, M is an Einstein manifold. The
fibres are always associative. In fact, the associated 3-form results from a
linear combination of three other volume 3-forms, one of which is the volume of
the fibres. We also give new examples of co-calibrated structures on well known
spaces. We hope this contributes both to the knowledge of special geometries
and to the study of 4-manifolds.

(FPU)-like lattices were recently generalized to the case of dispersive
long-range interactions (LRI) of the Kac-Baker form. The position variance of
the soliton shows a stronger than linear time-dependence (superdiffusion) as
found earlier for lattice solitons on FPU chains with nearest neighbour
interactions (NNI). In contrast to the NNI case where the position variance at
moderate soliton velocities has a considerable linear time-dependence (normal
diffusion), the solitons with LRI are dominated by a superdiffusive mechanism
where the position variance mainly depends quadratic and cubic on time. Since
the superdiffusion seems to be generic for nontopological solitons, we want to
illuminate the role of the soliton shape on the superdiffusive mechanism.
Therefore, we concentrate on a FPU-like lattice with a certain class of
power-law long-range interactions where the solitons have algebraic tails
instead of exponential tails in the case of FPU-type interactions (with or
without Kac-Baker LRI). A collective variable (CV) approach in the continuum
approximation of the system leads to stochastic integro-differential equations
which can be reduced to Langevin-type equations for the CV position and width.
We are able to derive an analytical result for the soliton diffusion which
agrees well with the simulations of the discrete system. Despite of
structurally similar Langevin systems for the two soliton types, the algebraic
solitons reach the superdiffusive long-time limit with a characteristic
$t^{1.5}$ time-dependence much faster than exponential solitons. The soliton
shape determines the diffusion constant in the long-time limit that is
approximately a factor of $\pi$ smaller for algebraic solitons.

assumption of exponential forms of growth for the primary tumor and metastatic
colonies predicts a linear relation on a log-log plot of a metastatic colony
size distribution, which was consistent with the experimental results.
Furthermore, the slope of the curve signifies the ratio of growth rates of the
primary and the metastases. Non-exponential (Gompertzian and logistic) tumor
growth patterns were also incorporated into the theory to explain possible
deviation from the log-log linear relation. The observed metastasis-free
probability also supported the assumption of a time-dependent Poisson process.
With this approach, we determined the mechanistic parameters governing the
process of metastatogenesis in the lungs for two murine tumor cell lines (KHT
and MCaK). Since biological parameters specified in the model could be obtained
in the laboratory, a workable metastatic ""assay"" may be established for various
malignancies and in turn contribute in formulating rational treatment regimens
for subclinical metastases.

  polarity","PDF only",,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030108",,"q-bio.CB",,"  Various molecules exclusively accumulate at the front or back of migrating
eukaryotic cells in response to a shallow gradient of extracellular signals.
Directional sensing and signal amplification highlight the essential properties
in the migrating cells, known as cell polarity. In addition to these, such
properties of cell polarity involve unique determination of migrating direction
(uniqueness of axis) and localized gradient sensing at the front edge
(localization of sensitivity), both of which may be required for smooth
migration. Here we provide the mass conservation system based on the
reaction-diffusion system with two components, where the mass of the two
components is always conserved. Using two models belonging to this mass
conservation system, we demonstrate through both numerical simulation and
analytical approximations that the spatial pattern with a single peak
(uniqueness of axis) can be generally observed and that the existent peak
senses a gradient of parameters at the peak position, which guides the movement
of the peak. We extended this system with multiple components, and we developed
a multiple-component model in which cross-talk between members of the Rho
family of small GTPases is involved. This model also exhibits the essential
properties of the two models with two components. Thus, the mass conservation
system shows properties similar to those of cell polarity, such as uniqueness
of axis and localization of sensitivity, in addition to directional sensing and
signal amplification.

the uncertainty in the sum of two or more observables is always less than or
equal to the sum of the uncertainties in corresponding observables. This shows
that the quantum mechanical uncertainty in any observable is a convex function.
We prove that if we have a finite number $N$ of identically prepared quantum
systems, then a joint measurement of any observable gives an error $\sqrt N$
less than that of the individual measurements. This has application in quantum
metrology that aims to give better precision in the parameter estimation.
Furthermore, this proves that a quantum system evolves slowly under the action
of a sum Hamiltonian than the sum of individuals, even if they are
non-commuting.

time-continuous quantum measurement. For the first time, we can prove that the

low-efficiency measurements. We show that our single-state theory can be
adapted to weak continuous ensemble measurements as well.

of the best-known differential equations with a cubic nonlinearity. A
