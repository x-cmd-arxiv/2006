demonstrate an extended inertial range. As intermittency violates
self-similarity of motions, it gets impossible to naively extrapolate the
properties of fluid obtained computationally with relatively low resolution to
the actual astrophysical situations. In terms of Astrophysics, intermittency
affects turbulent heating, momentum transfer, interaction with cosmic rays,
radio waves and many more essential processes. Because of its significance,
studies of intermittency call for coordinated efforts from both theorists and
observers. In terms of theoretical understanding we are still just scratching a
surface of a very rich subject. We have some theoretically well justified
models that are poorly supported by experiments, we also have She-Leveque
model, which could be vulnerable on theoretical grounds, but, nevertheless, is
well supported by experimental and laboratory data. I briefly discuss a rather
mysterious property of turbulence called ``extended self-similarity'' and the
possibilities that it opens for the intermittency research. Then I analyze
simulations of MHD intermittency performed by different groups and show that
their results do not contradict to each other. Finally, I discuss the
intermittency of density, intermittency of turbulence in the
viscosity-dominated regime as well as the intermittency of polarization of
Alfvenic modes. The latter provides an attractive solution to account for a
slower cascading rate that is observed in some of the numerical experiments. I
conclude by claiming that a substantial progress in the field may be achieved
by studies of the turbulence intermittency via observations.

central star formation is triggered by the galaxy-galaxy interaction before a

dominant collisions are typically those between hydrogen atoms. However,
collisions with electrons couple much more efficiently to the spin state of
hydrogen than do collisions with other hydrogen atoms and thus become important
once the ionized fraction exceeds ~1%. Here we compute the rate at which
electron-hydrogen collisions change the hydrogen spin. Previous calculations
included only S-wave scattering and ignored resonances near the n=2 threshold.
We provide accurate results, including all partial wave terms through the

electron-hydrogen collision rates at higher temperatures are not necessary,
because collisional excitation in this regime inevitably produces Lyman-alpha
photons, which in turn dominate spin exchange when T_K > 6200 K even in the
absence of radiative sources. Our rates differ from previous calculations by
several percent over the temperature range of interest. We also consider some

galaxies at redshifts z>3. Numerical simulations demonstrate that giant gas
clouds, which are cold and dense enough to produce massive star clusters,
assemble naturally in hierarchical models of galaxy formation at high redshift.
Do model clusters evolve into observed globular clusters or are they disrupted
before present as a result of the dynamical evolution? To address this
question, we calculate the orbits of model clusters in the time-variable
gravitational potential of a Milky Way-sized galaxy, using the outputs of a
cosmological N-body simulation. We find that at present the orbits are
isotropic in the inner 50 kpc of the Galaxy and preferentially radial at larger
distances. All clusters located outside 10 kpc from the center formed in
satellite galaxies, some of which are now tidally disrupted and some of which
survive as dwarf galaxies. The spatial distribution of model clusters is
spheroidal and the fit to the density profile has a power-law slope of 2.7. The
combination of two-body relaxation, tidal shocks, and stellar evolution drives
the evolution of the cluster mass function from an initial power law to a
peaked distribution, in agreement with observations. However, not all initial
conditions and not all evolution scenarios are consistent with the observed
mass function of the Galactic globular clusters. The successful models require
the average cluster density to be constant initially for clusters of all mass
and to remain constant with time. Synchronous formation of all clusters at a
single epoch (z=4) and continuous formation over a span of 1.6 Gyr (between z=9
and z=3) are both consistent with the data. For both formation scenarios, we
provide online catalogs of the main physical properties of model clusters.

content, and asymmetric red-(blue-) shifted emission lines with a blue (red)
counterpart ranging from absorption to emission (with increasing line/continuum
strength) in expanding (infalling) media.

can be obtained in expanding (infalling) media from objects without any
intrinsic lya emission, as a natural consequence of radiation transfer effects.
3/ The formation and the detailed shape of lya profiles resulting from
expanding shells has been thoroughly revised: for sufficiently large column
densities, the position of the main lya emission peak is redshifted by twice
the expansion velocity.This is in excellent agreement with the observations of
z~3 LBGs. This finding indicates also that large scale, fairly symmetric shell

(WC8-9) stars are observed in the Solar neighbourhood, whilst late subtypes

relevance to (a) the upper mass limit in metal-rich galaxies such as NGC 3049,

they finally explode. Details of their evolution have not yet been safely
established, and their physics are not well understood. Their spectral analysis
requires adequate model atmospheres, which have been developed step by step
during the past decades and account in their recent version for line blanketing
by the millions of lines from iron and iron-group elements. However, only very
few WN stars have been re-analyzed by means of line-blanketed models yet.
  AIMS: The quantitative spectral analysis of a large sample of Galactic WN
stars with the most advanced generation of model atmospheres should provide an
empirical basis for various studies about the origin, evolution, and physics of
the Wolf-Rayet stars and their powerful winds.
  METHODS: We analyze a large sample of Galactic WN stars by means of the
Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmospheres, which account for iron line
blanketing and clumping. The results are compared with a synthetic population,
generated from the Geneva tracks for massive star evolution. RESULTS: We obtain
a homogeneous set of stellar and atmospheric parameters for the Galactic WN
stars, partly revising earlier results.
  CONCLUSIONS: Comparing the results of our spectral analyses of the Galactic
WN stars with the predictions of the Geneva evolutionary calculations, we
conclude that there is rough qualitative agreement. However, the quantitative
discrepancies are still severe, and there is no preference for the tracks that
account for the effects of rotation. It seems that the evolution of massive
stars is still not satisfactorily understood.

be applied to most of the observed SNRs. It is shown that the model
successfully explains the many averaged observational properties of evolved
shell-type SNRs. In particular, the radio surface brightness ($\Sigma$) evolves
with diameter as $\sim D^{-(0.3 \div 0.5)}$, while the bounding shock is strong
(Mach number is ${\mathcal M} \geq10$), followed by steep decrease (steeper
than $\sim D^{-4.5}$) for ${\cal M} <10$. Such evolution of the surface
brightness with diameter and its strong dependence on the environmental
parameters strongly reduce the usefulness of $\Sigma - D$ relations as a tool
for determining the distances to SNRs. The model predicts no radio emission
from SNRs in the late radiative stage of evolution and the existence of
radio-quiet but relatively active SNRs is possible. Our model easily explains
very large-diameter radio sources such as the Galactic Loops and the candidates
for Hypernova radio remnants. The model predicts that most of the observed SNRs
are located in a tenuous phase of the ISM. From the comparison of the model
results with the statistics of evolved shell-type SNRs, we were able to
estimate the fraction of electrons accelerated from the thermal pool in the
range $(3\div 11) \times 10^{- 4}$.

far infrared colours similar to those of well-known planetary nebulae. The
large majority of them were unidentified sources or poorly known in the
literature at the time when this spectroscopic survey started, some 15 years
ago.
  Methods: We present low-resolution optical spectroscopy, finding charts and
improved astrometric coordinates of a sample of 253 IRAS sources.
  Results: We have identified 103 sources as post-AGB stars, 21 as ``transition
sources'', and 36 as planetary nebulae, some of them strongly reddened. Among
the rest of sources in the sample, we were also able to identify 38 young
stellar objects, 5 peculiar stars, and 2 Seyfert galaxies. Up to 49 sources in
our spectroscopic sample do not show any optical counterpart, and most of them
are suggested to be heavily obscured post-AGB stars, rapidly evolving on their
way to becoming planetary nebulae.
  Conclusions: An analysis of the galactic distribution of the sources
identified as evolved stars in the sample is presented together with a study of
the distribution of these stars in the IRAS two-colour diagram. Finally, the
spectral type distribution and other properties of the sources identified as
post-AGB in this spectroscopic survey are discussed in the framework of stellar
evolution.

Amplitude Dwarf nova (TOAD) Var Her 04 during decline from super-outburst. The
four MIPS observations span 271 days and the two IRAC observations span 211
days. Along the line-of-sight to Var Her 04, there is a foreground M-star
within 1\arcsec of the variable; as a result, all of the Spitzer photometry
presented in this paper is a blend of the foreground M-star and Var Her 04. We
estimate the quiescent level of the TOAD to be $\Delta V=4-5$ magnitudes below
that of the M-star. Based upon the spectral energy distribution and the 2MASS
colors, we find the M-star to be an M3.5V dwarf at a distance of 80-130 pc.
Based upon its outburst amplitude and quiescent apparent magnitude, we estimate
the distance to Var Her 04 to be 200-400 pc, suggesting that the line-of-sight
foreground star is physically unrelated to the cataclysmic variable. All of the
Spitzer photometry is consistent with the photospheric emission of the
line-of-sight M3.5V star, except for one 24 \micron observation obtained after
the variable re-brightened. This 24 \micron flux density is 75 $\mu$Jy
($4\sigma$) above the preceding and following MIPS observations. We tentatively
suggest that the mid-infrared brightening of 75 $\mu$Jy may be associated with
a dust formation event in the super-outburst ejecta. Assuming a dust
temperature of 100-400 K, we have estimated the amount of dust required. We
find $10^{-13}-10^{-11}$ M$_\odot$ of dust is needed, consistent with amounts
of mass ejection in TOADs expected during super-outburst, and possibly making
TOADs important contributors to the recycling of the interstellar medium.

to lithium ratios, namely, 6:1, 15:1, 30:1 and infinity. For all compositions,
we find nonexponential correlation functions, which can be described by a

increase of the salt concentration results in a strong slowing down of the
segmental motion. Consistently, for the high 6:1 salt concentration, a high
apparent activation energy E_a=4.1eV characterizes the temperature dependence
of the mean correlation times at Tg < T< 1.1T_g, while smaller values E_a=2.5eV
are observed for moderate salt contents. The correlation functions are most
nonexponential for 15:1 PPO-LiClO4, whereas the stretching is reduced for

functions on the evolution time in the presence and in the absence of ions

  Spacetime","15 pages, no figures; contribution to 7th International Conference on
  the History of General Relativity",,,,"gr-qc hep-th",,"  Quantum field theory in curved spacetime is a theory wherein matter is
treated fully in accord with the principles of quantum field theory, but
gravity is treated classically in accord with general relativity. It is not
expected to be an exact theory of nature, but it should provide a good
approximate description when the quantum effects of gravity itself do not play
a dominant role. A major impetus to the theory was provided by Hawking's
calculation of particle creation by black holes, showing that black holes
radiate as perfect black bodies. During the past 30 years, considerable
progress has been made in giving a mathematically rigorous formulation of
quantum field theory in curved spacetime. Major issues of principle with regard
to the formulation of the theory arise from the lack of Poincare symmetry and
the absence of a preferred vacuum state or preferred notion of ``particles''.
By the mid-1980's, it was understood how all of these difficulties could be
overcome for free (i.e., non-self-interacting) quantum fields by formulating
the theory via the algebraic approach and focusing attention on the local field
observables rather than a notion of ``particles''. However, these ideas, by
themselves, were not adequate for the formulation of interacting quantum field
theory, even at a perturbative level, since standard renormalization
prescriptions in Minkowski spacetime rely heavily on Poincare invariance and
the existence of a Poincare invariant vacuum state. However, during the past
decade, great progress has been made, mainly due to the importation into the
theory of the methods of ``microlocal analysis''. This article will describe
the historical development of the subject and describe some of the recent
progress.

suitable notion of degree for the vertex points, we focus on those patches with
points of degrees less tah or equal to 6. Such patches are called el liptic. We
show that the elliptic patches with precisely three points of degree four,
denoted by (0, 3, 0), can be classified. The number of vertex points of these
patches are calculated, and we also describe their triangulation structures.
  From the classification of patches of the type (0, 3, 0), we describe and
find the number of vertex points for three other elliptic patches of types (0,
2, 2), (0, 1, 4), (0, 0, 6). We also describe an enlargement method for
constructing patches (which we call the generic construction method) and apply
this method to derive formulas for certain patches. In the third chapter we
describe some configurations for constructing elliptic spherical
triangulations. These are the mutant configu- ration, the productive
configuration and the self-reproductive configuration. We also describe the
face-fullering and edge-fullering methods as well as the glueing of patches
method for constructing triangulations and patches. We show that there are only
19 possible types of elliptic triangulations for spheres and determine the
existence (as well as nonexistence) of all these types except for a small
number of cases.

correspond to the linking of settlements or the spreading of an epidemic. The
authors investigate $\tgor(K)$, the critical time for the appearance of a giant
component as a function of $K$, and prove that
$\tgor=(1+o(1))\frac{4}{\sqrt{3K}}$, using a proper timescale.
  In this work, we show that a natural variation of the model $\Gor$ has
interesting properties. Define the process $\Gand$, where a weight of size $K$
is assigned to edges between pairs of non-isolated vertices, and a weight of
size 1 otherwise. We prove that the asymptotical behavior of the giant
component threshold is essentially the same for $\Gand$, and namely $\tgand /
\tgor$ tends to $\frac{64\sqrt{6}}{\pi(24+\pi^2)}\approx 1.47$ as $K\to\infty$.
However, the corresponding thresholds for connectivity satisfy $\tcand /
\tcor=\max\{{1/2},K\}$ for every $K>0$. Following the methods of [Amir et al.],
$\tgand$ is characterized as the singularity point to a system of differential
equations, and computer simulations of both models agree with the analytical
results as well as with the asymptotic analysis. In the process, we answer the
following question: when does a giant component emerge in a graph process where
edges are chosen uniformly out of all edges incident to isolated vertices,
while such exist, and otherwise uniformly? This corresponds to the value of
$\tgand(0)$, which we show to be ${3/2}+\frac{4}{3\mathrm{e}^2-1}$.

appreciably improves the isoscalar optical potential depth over the previous
folding model calculations.
  The rearrangement gives stronger effects as the density grows.
  We also present rearrangement terms in the $A$-$A$ double-folding potential.
  Since the rearrangement terms are relevant to the nuclear structure but
should be handled within the reaction model,

made from crushed silica-free carbonado-diamond and thin sections were also
prepared. The 100 to 1000 times brighter synchrotron infrared radiation permits
a greater spatial resolution. Inclusions and pore spaces were avoided and/or
sources of chemical contamination were removed. The FTIR spectra of
carbonado-diamond mostly depict the presence of single nitrogen impurities, and
hydrogen. The lack of identifiable nitrogen aggregates in the infrared spectra,
the presence of features related to hydrocarbon stretch bonds, and the
resemblance of the spectra to CVD and presolar diamonds indicate that
carbonado-diamonds formed in a hydrogen-rich interstellar environment. This is
consistent with carbonado-diamond being sintered and porous, with extremely
reduced metals, metal alloys, carbides and nitrides, light carbon isotopes,
surfaces with glassy melt-like patinas, deformation lamellae, and a complete
absence of primary, terrestrial mineral inclusions. The 2.6-3.8 billion year

  Expanded",,,,"physics.geo-ph astro-ph physics.gen-ph",,"  I demonstrate two fundamental contributions. First, the Earth tectonics is
generally a consequence of the springtide-induced magnification of mechanical
resonance in the Earth mantle. The same mechanism that causes bridges to
collapse under the soldiers step-marching makes also the Earth lithosphere fail
under the springtide-induced magnification of the mantle resonance resulting in
strong earthquakes. Secondly, by generalizing the above finding onto any body
anywhere in all the Universes and at all times, I find that there is no
distinction between physics at intergalactic, Newtonian, quantum, and smaller
scales. Thus, the so-called constant of proportionality of physics, G, is not a
constant but a parameter of a most general form: G = s e^2, nonlinearly varying
amongst different scales s. Any scale-related variations of physics,
erroneously recognized as such by Einstein and Planck, are only apparent and
arise as a consequence of the Earth mantle springtide-induced extreme
resonance, which is also critically impeding any terrestrial experiments aimed
at estimating the final proportionality G. Gravitation is explained if simply
regarded mechanical and repulsive.

resistance to bending. The constraint for a fixed total area leads to a
non-linear shape evolution equation at leading order. As a result two regimes
of vesicle behavior, tank-treading and tumbling, are predicted depending on the
viscosity contrast between interior and exterior fluid. Below a critical
viscosity contrast, which depends on the excess area, the vesicle deforms into
a tank--treading ellipsoid, whose orientation angle with respect to the flow

regime, the vesicle exhibits periodic shape deformations with a frequency that
increases with the viscosity contrast. Non-Newtonian rheology such as normal

(EAQEC) codes, a generalization of the stabilizer formalism to the setting in
which the sender and receiver have access to pre-shared entanglement.
Conventional stabilizer codes are equivalent to dual-containing symplectic
codes. In contrast, EAQEC codes do not require the dual-containing condition,
which greatly simplifies their construction. We show how any quaternary
classical code can be made into a EAQEC code. In particular, efficient modern
codes, like LDPC codes, which attain the Shannon capacity, can be made into
EAQEC codes attaining the hashing bound. In a quantum computation setting,
EAQEC codes give rise to catalytic quantum codes which maintain a region of
inherited noiseless qubits.
  We also give an alternative construction of EAQEC codes by making classical
entanglement assisted codes coherent.

  Communications",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.75.010303",,"quant-ph",,"  The Shor-Preskill proof of the security of the BB84 quantum key distribution
protocol relies on the theoretical existence of good classical error-correcting
codes with the ``dual-containing'' property. A practical implementation of BB84
thus requires explicit and efficiently decodable constructions of such codes,
which are not known. On the other hand, modern coding theory abounds with
non-dual-containing codes with excellent performance and efficient decoding
algorithms. We show that the dual-containing constraint can be lifted at a
small price: instead of a key distribution protocol, an efficiently
implementable key expansion protocol is obtained, capable of increasing the
size of a pre-shared key by a constant factor.

two-way classical communication that is assisted by one-time pad encryption. We
propose a two-way preprocessing that uses one-time pad encryption by previously
shared secret key, and the net key rate of the QKD with proposed preprocessing
exceeds the key rate of the QKD without it. The preprocessing is reduced to the
entanglement distillation protocol with two-way classical communication and
previously shared EPR pairs (two-way breeding protocol), and the security of
QKD with the preprocessing is guaranteed in the same way as Shor and Preskill's
arguments.
