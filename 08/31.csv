study the overall clustering of HI-rich galaxies and its dependence on
luminosity, HI gas mass and rotational velocity. These samples cover the entire
southern sky Dec < 0 deg, containing up to 4,174 galaxies over the radial
velocity range 300-12,700 km/s. A scale length of r_0 = 3.45 +/- 0.25 Mpc/h and
slope of gamma = 1.47 +/- 0.08 is obtained for the HI-rich galaxy real-space
correlation function, making gas-rich galaxies among the most weakly clustered
objects known. HI-selected galaxies also exhibit weaker clustering than
optically selected galaxies of comparable luminosities. Good agreement is found
between our results and those of synthetic HI-rich galaxy catalogues generated
from the Millennium Run CDM simulation. Bisecting HICAT using different
parameter cuts, clustering is found to depend most strongly on rotational
velocity and luminosity, while the dependency on HI mass is marginal. Splitting
the sample around v_rot = 108 km/s, a scale length of r_0 = 2.86 +/- 0.46 Mpc/h
is found for galaxies with low rotational velocities compared to r_0 = 3.96 +/-

  abstract!",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20066162",,"astro-ph",,"  The recent detection by direct imaging of three giant planets at wide
separation (50-250 AU) from their primaries has raised the question about the
``true isolation'' of planetary-mass objects in clusters. Our goal was to test
the possibility that some free-floating planetary-mass object could in fact be
part of wide planetary systems. We searched in the literature for stellar and
brown-dwarf member candidates of the sigma Orionis cluster at small angular
separations from published candidate planetary-mass objects. We found one
candidate planetary system, SE 70, composed of an X-ray source and a
planetary-mass object, namely S Ori 68, separated by only 4.6 arcsec. In order
to assess the cluster membership of the X-ray source, we obtained
mid-resolution optical spectroscopy using ISIS on the William Herschel
Telescope. We also compiled additional data on the target from available
astronomical catalogues. We have found that SE 70 follows the
spectrophotometric sequence of the cluster and displays spectroscopic features
of youth, such as lithium in absorption and chromospheric Halpha emission. The
radial velocity is consistent with cluster membership. Hence, SE 70 is very
probably a sigma Orionis cluster member. The projected physical separation
between SE 70 and S Ori 68 is 1700+/-300 AU at the distance of the cluster. If
the common proper motion is confirmed in the near future, the system would be
composed of an M5-6 brown dwarf with an estimated mass of ~45 M_Jup and an
L5+/-2 giant planet with an estimated mass of ~5 M_Jup. It would be the widest
and one of the lowest-mass planetary systems known so far.

redshift range 3.5<z<5.2 for the absolute magnitude interval -21<M_{145}<-28.
The determination of the faint end of the luminosity function at these
redshifts provides important constraints on models of joint evolution of
galaxies and AGNs. Methods: We have defined suitable criteria to select faint
QSOs in the GOODS fields, checking in detail their effectiveness and
completeness. Spectroscopic follow-up of the resulting QSO candidates has been
carried out. The confirmed sample of faint QSOs is compared with a brighter one
derived from the SDSS. We have used a Monte-Carlo technique to estimate the
properties of the luminosity function, checking various parameterizations for
its shape and evolution. Results: Models based on Pure Density Evolution show
better agreement with observation than models based on Pure Luminosity
Evolution. However a different break magnitude with respect to z~2.1 is
required at 3.5<z<5.2. Models with a steeper faint end score a higher
probability. We do not find any evidence for a flattening of the bright end at
redshift z>3.5. Conclusions: The estimated space density evolution of QSOs
indicates a suppression of the formation and/or feeding of Supermassive Black
Holes at these redshifts. The QSO contribution to the UV background is
insufficient to ionize the IGM at 3.5<z<5.2.

a white dwarf-white dwarf binary merger scenario to account for its existence.
This result may represent the first direct observational evidence that single
star evolution can produce white dwarfs with M>1.1Msun, as predicted by some
stellar evolutionary theories. On the basis of its tangential velocity we also
provisionally identify the ultramassive (M~1.2Msun) white dwarf PG0136+251 as

excellent 59 keV, 122 keV and 662 keV energy resolutions of 1.4 keV, 1.9 keV,

improve on the performance of the pixelated detectors. Previously, the benefit
of steering grids had been limited by additional electronic noise associated
with currents between the negatively biased steering grids and the anode
pixels. We are currently exploring the possibility to isolate the steering grid
from the CZT substrates by a thin layer of Al$_2$O$_3$. We performed a series
of measurements to determine by how much the isolation layer reduces the
grid-pixel currents. Comparing the currents between two Au contacts before and
after isolating one of the two contacts from the CZT with a 700 nm thick layer

pairs in our restricted sample and comparing the multiplicity fractions to

al. (2006) to map our monopole results onto a more physical dipole geometry and
to estimate the spindown of PNSs when their winds are relativistic. We then
quantify the effects of rotation and magnetic fields on the mass loss, energy
loss, and r-process nucleosynthesis in PNS winds. We describe the evolution of
PNS winds through the Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling epoch, emphasizing the
transition between (1) thermal neutrino-driven, (2) non-relativistic
magnetically-dominated, and (3) relativistic magnetically-dominated outflows.
We find that proto-magnetars with P ~ 1 ms and B > 10^15 G drive relativistic
winds with luminosities, energies, and Lorentz factors (magnetization sigma ~
0.1-1000) consistent with those required to produce long duration gamma-ray
bursts and hyper-energetic supernovae (SNe). A significant fraction of the
rotational energy may be extracted in only a few seconds, sufficiently rapidly
to alter the asymptotic energy of the SN remnant, its morphology, and,
potentially, its nucleosynthetic yield. Winds from PNSs with more modest
rotation periods (2 - 10 ms) and with magnetar-strength fields produce
conditions significantly more favorable for the r-process than winds from
slowly rotating PNSs. Lastly, we show that energy and momentum deposition by

the early Universe provides one of the most promising ways of probing the
fundamental physical properties of a galaxy, such as its size, dynamical mass,
gas density, and temperature. While such observations are currently limited to
the most luminous galaxies, the advent of ALMA will change the situation
dramatically, resulting in the detection of numerous normal galaxies at high
redshifts. Maps and spectra of rotational CO line emission were calculated from
a cosmological N-body/hydrodynamical TreeSPH simulation of a z ~ 3 ""Lyman break
galaxy'' of UV luminosity about one order of magnitude below L*. To simulate a
typical observation of our system with ALMA, we imposed characteristic noise,
angular, and spectral resolution constraints. The CO line properties predicted
by our simulation are in good agreement with the two Lyman break systems
detected in CO to date. We find that while supernovae explosions from the
ongoing star formation carve out large cavities in the molecular ISM, they do
not generate large enough gas outflows to make a substantial imprint on the CO
line profile. This implies that for most proto-galaxies - except possibly the
most extreme cases - stellar feedback effects do not affect CO as a dynamical
mass tracer. Detecting CO in sub-L* galaxies at z ~3 will push ALMA to the
limits of its cababilities, and whether a source is detected or not may depend
critically on its inclination angle. Both these effects (sensitivity and
inclination) will severely impair the ability of ALMA to infer the gas
kinematics and dynamical masses using line observations.

  section and expanded discussion",,"10.1111/j.1745-3933.2007.00353.x",,"astro-ph",,"  The dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites of the Local Group have long been
thought to be simple spheroids of stars embedded within extended dark matter
halos. Recently, however, evidence for the presence of spatially and
kinematically distinct stellar populations has been accumulating. Here, we
examine the influence of such components on dynamical models of dwarf galaxies
embedded in cold dark matter halos. We begin by constructing a model of
Andromeda II, a dSph satellite of M31 which shows evidence for spatially
distinct stellar components. We find that the two-component model predicts an
overall velocity dispersion profile that remains approximately constant at
$\sim 10 - 11$ km s$^{-1}$ out to $\sim 1$ kpc from the center; this is despite
wide kinematic and spatial differences between the two individual components.
The presence of two components may also help to explain oddities in the
velocity dispersion profiles of other dSphs; we show that velocity dispersion
profiles which appear to rise from the center outwards before leveling
off--such as those of Leo I, Draco, and Fornax--can result from the gradual
transition from a dynamically cold, concentrated component to a second, hotter,
and more spatially extended one, both in equilibrium within the same dark halo.
Dwarf galaxies with two stellar components generally have a leptokurtic
line-of-sight velocity distribution which is well described by a double
Maxwellian. Interestingly, we find that multiple equilibrium components could
also provide a potential alternative origin for ``extra-tidal'' stars (normally
ascribed to tidal effects) in situations where corroborating evidence for tides
may be lacking.

agreement with observations. Among the alpha-elements, O, Mg, Si, S, and Ca
show a plateau at [Fe/H] < -1, while Ti is underabundant overall. The observed
abundance of Zn ([Zn/Fe] ~ 0) can be explained only by the high energy
explosion models, which requires a large contribution of hypernovae. The
observed decrease in the odd-Z elements (Na, Al, and Cu) toward low [Fe/H] is
reproduced by the metallicity effect on nucleosynthesis. The iron-peak elements
(Cr, Mn, Co, and Ni) are consistent with the observed mean values at -2.5 <

electric current loss in the energy output of radio pulsars. We remind that
even the losses attributed to the magneto-dipole radiation of a pulsar in
vacuum can be written as a result of an Ampere force action of the electric
currens flowing over the neutron star surface (Michel, 1991, Beskin et al.,
1993). It is this force that is responsible for the transfer of angular
momentum of a neutron star to an outgoing magneto-dipole wave. If a pulsar is
surrounded by plasma, and there is no longitudinal current in its
magnetosphere, there is no energy loss (Beskin et al., 1993, Mestel et al.,
1999). It is the longitudinal current closing within the pulsar polar cap that
exerts the retardation torque acting on the neutron star. This torque can be
determined if the structure of longitudinal current is known. Here we remind of
the solution by Beskin, Gurevitch & Istomin (1993) and discuss the validity of
such an assumption. The behavior of the recently observed ""part-time job""
pulsar B1931+24 can be naturally explained within the model of current loss
while the magneto-dipole model faces difficulties.

$z=0$, an `initial' mass $M_{\rm i}$ defined to be the mass enclosed by the
largest sphere which contains the initial barycenter of the halo particles and
within which the mean linear density is equal to the critical value for
spherical collapse at $z=0$. For halos of a given final mass, $M_{\rm h}$, the
ratio $M_{\rm i}/M_{\rm h}$ has large scatter, and the scatter is larger for
halos of lower final masses. Halos that form earlier on average have larger
$M_{\rm i}/M_{\rm h}$, and so correspond to higher peaks in the initial density
field than their final masses imply. Old halos are more strongly clustered than
younger ones of the same mass because their initial masses are larger. The
age-dependence of clustering for low-mass halos is entirely due to the
difference in the initial/final mass ratio. Low-mass old halos are almost
always located in the vicinity of big structures, and their old ages are
largely due to the fact that their mass accretions are suppressed by the hot
environments produced by the tidal fields of the larger structure. The
age-dependence of clustering is weaker for more massive halos because the
heating by large-scale tidal fields is less important.

variations of the double peaked Balmer emission-lines, not only in cool Be star

explain the long-term V/R variations in the discs around massive Be stars. When
there exists a narrow gap between the star and its circumstellar disc, with the
result that the radial velocity perturbation is non-zero at the inner disc

effects in supernovae and in the early universe. We demonstrate that the case
of ""bipolar"" oscillations, where a dense gas of neutrinos and antineutrinos in
equal numbers completely converts from one flavour to another even if the
mixing angle is small, is equivalent to a pendulum in flavour space. Bipolar
flavour conversion corresponds to the swinging of the pendulum, which begins in
an unstable upright position (the initial flavour), and passes through
momentarily the vertically downward position (the other flavour) in the course
of its motion. The time scale to complete one cycle of oscillation depends
logarithmically on the vacuum mixing angle. Likewise, the presence of an
ordinary medium can be shown analytically to contribute to a logarithmic
increase in the bipolar conversion period. We further find that a more complex
(and realistic) system of unequal numbers of neutrinos and antineutrinos is
analogous to a spinning top subject to a torque. This analogy easily explains
how such a system can oscillate in both the bipolar and the synchronised mode,
depending on the neutrino density and the size of the neutrino-antineutrino
asymmetry. Our simple model applies strictly only to isotropic neutrino gasses.
In more general cases, and especially for neutrinos streaming from a supernova
core, different modes couple to each other with unequal strength, an effect
that can lead to kinematical decoherence in flavour space rather than
collective oscillations. The exact circumstances under which collective
oscillations occur in non-isotropic media remain to be understood.

previous findings on BD X-ray activity: a log-log relation between X-ray and
bolometric luminosity for stars (with L*<10 Lsun) and BDs detected in X-rays; a
shallow log-log relation between X-ray fractional luminosity and mass; a
log-log relation between X-ray fractional luminosity and effective temperature;
a log-log relation between X-ray surface flux and effective temperature. We
find no significant log-log correlation between the X-ray fractional luminosity
and EW(Halpha). Accreting and nonaccreting BDs have a similar X-ray fractional
luminosity. The median X-ray fractional luminosity of nonaccreting BDs is about
4 times lower than the mean saturation value for rapidly rotating low-mass
field stars. Our TMC BDs have higher X-ray fractional luminosity than BDs in
the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project. The X-ray fractional luminosity declines
from low-mass stars to M-type BDs, and as a sample, the BDs are less efficient
X-ray emitters than low-mass stars. We thus conclude that while the BD
atmospheres observed here are mostly warm enough to sustain coronal activity, a
trend is seen that may indicate its gradual decline due to the drop in
photospheric ionization degree (abridged).

closest observational counterparts to theoretical models for single stellar
populations. Progress in our understanding of the atmospheres and evolution of
massive stars has led to generally reliable synthesis models. The future
release of new evolution models with rotation, however, will require
non-trivial updates to previously published synthesis models, in particular for
all Wolf-Rayet and red supergiant related quantities. Cluster synthesis work is
currently progressing from a purely stellar approach to a more comprehensive
stellar+cluster perspective. The photometric evolution of stars and the
dynamical evolution of clusters are delicately interwoven. Recent work attempts
to combine these seemingly related fields.

about substructure in the gas distribution, in contrast to analytic modelling
of the profiles. In addition to describing our procedure, we present here a
detailed investigation of the accuracy of the method and its error calculations
over a wide range of input profile characteristics and data quality using Monte
Carlo simulations. We also make comparisons with gas density profiles obtained
from Chandra observations, where the PSF correction is small, and with profiles
obtained using analytic modelling, which demonstrate that our procedure is a
useful improvement over standard techniques. This type of method will be
especially valuable in the ongoing analysis of unbiased and complete samples of
X-ray clusters, both local and distant, helping to improve the quality of their

optically thin accretion flows around active gravitating objects. The source of
the magnetic field is the azimuthal electric current associated with the
Poynting-Robertson drag on the electrons of the accreting plasma. This current
generates magnetic field loops which open up because of the differential
rotation of the flow. We show through simple numerical simulations that what
regulates the generation and accumulation of magnetic flux near the center is
the value of the plasma conductivity. Although the conductivity is usually
considered to be effectively infinite for the fully ionized plasmas expected
near the inner edge of accretion disks, the turbulence of those plasmas may
actually render them much less conducting due to the presence of anomalous
resistivity. We have discovered that if the resistivity is sufficiently high
throughout the turbulent disk while it is suppressed interior to its inner
edge, an interesting steady-state process is established: accretion carries and
accumulates magnetic flux of one polarity inside the inner edge of the disk,
whereas magnetic diffusion releases magnetic flux of the opposite polarity to
large distances. In this scenario, magnetic flux of one polarity grows and
accumulates at a steady rate in the region inside the inner edge and up to the
point of equipartition when it becomes dynamically important. We argue that
this inward growth and outward expulsion of oppositely-directed magnetic fields
that we propose may account for the ~30 min cyclic variability observed in the
galactic microquasar GRS1915+105.

observations were carried out with the IRAM-30m telescope and the JCMT. We have
detected N2D+ emission in 7 of the 10 sources of our sample, and found an
average value N(N2D+)/N(N2H+)~0.015. This value is 3 orders of magnitude larger
than the interstellar D/H ratio, indicating the presence of cold and dense gas,
in which the physical-chemical conditions are similar to those observed in
low-mass pre-stellar cores. Also, the integrated CO depletion factors show that
in the majority of the sources the expected CO abundances are larger than the
observed values, with a median ratio of 3.2. In principle, the cold gas that
gives origin to the N2D+ emission can be the remnant of the massive molecular
core in which the high-mass (proto-)star was born, not yet heated up by the
central object. If so, our results indicate that the chemical properties of the
clouds in which high-mass stars are born are similar to their low-mass

standard zero temperature mean field theories in the literature, but
necessarily includes pairing fluctuation effects at non-zero temperature within
a consistent framework. Physically, these effects are associated with the
presence of pre-formed pairs (or a fermionic pseudogap) in the normal phase,
and pair excitations of the condensate, in the superfluid phase. We show how
this finite $T$ theory of fermionic pair condensates bears many similarities to
the condensation of point bosons. In the process we examine three different
types of condensate: the usual breached pair or Sarma phase and both the one

of these has been discussed in the literature albeit only within a
Landau-Ginzburg formalism, generally valid near $T_c$. Here we show how to
arrive at the two plane wave LOFF state in the ground state as well as at
general temperature $T$.

domain those signals are carried as voltages and currents on wires, and the
discreteness of the photon's energy is usually not evident. However, by
coupling a superconducting qubit to signals on a microwave transmission line,
it is possible to construct an integrated circuit where the presence or absence
of even a single photon can have a dramatic effect. This system is called
circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) because it is the circuit equivalent of
the atom-photon interaction in cavity QED. Previously, circuit QED devices were
shown to reach the resonant strong coupling regime, where a single qubit can
absorb and re-emit a single photon many times. Here, we report a circuit QED
experiment which achieves the strong dispersive limit, a new regime of cavity
QED in which a single photon has a large effect on the qubit or atom without
ever being absorbed. The hallmark of this strong dispersive regime is that the
qubit transition can be resolved into a separate spectral line for each photon
number state of the microwave field. The strength of each line is a measure of
the probability to find the corresponding photon number in the cavity. This
effect has been used to distinguish between coherent and thermal fields and
could be used to create a photon statistics analyzer. Since no photons are
absorbed by this process, one should be able to generate non-classical states
of light by measurement and perform qubit-photon conditional logic, the basis
of a logic bus for a quantum computer.

the relation implicitly contains the conservation of energy density at every
point of the system. The separate contributions to the total energy density are
described in detail, and it is shown that the key difference to standard
density functional methods is the existence of a general exchange-correlation
potential, which does not explicitly depend on electron charge. We derive
solutions for the hydrogen-like atoms and analyse local properties. It is found
that these systems are stable due to the existence of a vector potential ${\bf
A}$, related to electron motion, which leads to two general effects: (i) The
root of the charge density acquires an additional complex phase; and (ii) for
single electrons, the vector potential cancels the effect of electrostatic
repulsions. We determine the density of states of a free electron gas based on
this model and find that the vectorpotential also accounts for the Pauli
exclusion principle. Implications of these results for direct methods in
density functional theory are discussed. It seems that the omission of vector
potentials in formulating the kinetic energy density functionals may be the
main reason that direct methods so far are not generally applicable. Finally,
we provide an orbital free self-consistent formulation for determining the

strategies based on two channels of signals. The model is applicable to
financial markets, ecosystems and computer networks. We find that the dynamics

particular, occasional mismatches of the signals induce a series of transitions
among numerous attractors. Surprisingly, in contrast to the effects of noises
on dynamical systems normally resulting in a large number of attractors, the
number of attractors due to the mismatched signals remains finite. Both
simulations and analyses show that this can be explained by the antipersistent
nature of the dynamics. Antipersistence refers to the response of the system to
a given signal being opposite to that of the signal's previous occurrence, and
is a consequence of the competition of the agents to make minority decisions.
Thus, it is essential for stabilizing the dynamical systems.

the pairwise potentials accounting for particle-particle collisions is
equivalent to considering a shot noise acting on a single particle. We call
this approach the interacting single adsorbate approximation, which gathers
three important advantages: (i) the dynamics underlying surface diffusion and
low vibrational motion can be easily understood in terms of relatively simple
stochastic processes; (ii) from our model, appropriate (and well justified)

more complicated (but commonly used) molecular dynamics simulations within the

the application of this model, numerical results are presented. Specially, our

studied using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique. In the
first place, we analyzed how the reduction of electron density from
half-filling to quarter-filling affects the Kondo resonance in the limit of
Hubbard repulsion U=0. In general, a weak dependence with the electron density
was found for the local density of states (LDOS) at the impurity except when
the impurity, at half-filling, is close to a mixed valence regime. Next, in the
central part of this paper, we studied the effects of finite Hubbard
interaction on the chain at quarter-filling. Our main result is that this
interaction drives the impurity into a more defined Kondo regime although
accompanied in most cases by a reduction of the spectral weight of the impurity
LDOS. Again, for the impurity in the mixed valence regime, we observed an
interesting nonmonotonic behavior. We also concluded that the conductance,
computed for a small finite bias applied to the leads, follows the behavior of
the impurity LDOS, as in the case of non-interacting chains. Finally, we
analyzed how the Hubbard interaction and the finite chain length affect the
spin compensation cloud both at zero and at finite temperature, in this case
using quantum Monte Carlo techniques.

lambda-calculus and first-order rewriting (LICS'88), many authors have
contributed to this subject by extending it to richer typed lambda-calculi and
rewriting paradigms, culminating in calculi like the Calculus of Algebraic
Constructions. These works provide theoretical foundations for type-theoretic
proof assistants where functions and predicates are defined by oriented
higher-order equations. This kind of definitions subsumes induction-based
definitions, is easier to write and provides more automation. On the other
hand, checking that user-defined rewrite rules are strongly normalizing and
confluent, and preserve the decidability of type-checking when combined with
beta-reduction, is more difficult. Most termination criteria rely on the term
structure. In a previous work, we extended to dependent types and higher-order
rewriting, the notion of ``sized types'' studied by several authors in the
simpler framework of ML-like languages, and proved that it preserves strong
normalization. The main contribution of the present paper is twofold. First, we
prove that, in the Calculus of Algebraic Constructions with size annotations,
the problems of type inference and type-checking are decidable, provided that
the sets of constraints generated by size annotations are satisfiable and admit
most general solutions. Second, we prove the later properties for a size
algebra rich enough for capturing usual induction-based definitions and much
more.

functions and classes of solutions of Einstein equations which we construct

black hole or a naked singularity, depending on the nature of initial data and
evolutions chosen, and subject to validity of the weak energy condition. The
results are discussed and analyzed in the light of the cosmic censorship
hypothesis in black hole physics. The formalism here combines the earlier
results on gravitational collapse in four dimensions in a unified treatment.
Also the earlier work is generalized to higher dimensional spacetimes to allow
a study of the effect of number of dimensions on the possible final outcome of
the collapse in terms of either a black hole or naked singularity. No
restriction is adopted on the number of dimensions, and other limiting
assumptions such as self-similarity of spacetime are avoided, in order to keep
the treatment general. Our methodology allows to consider to an extent the

velocity less than the speed of light or a maximum energy for subluminal
electrons; both these quantities will generally depend on the direction of an
electron's motion. From synchrotron radiation, we may infer a lower bound on
the maximum velocity, and from inverse Compton emission, a lower bound on the
maximum subluminal energy. With observational data for both these types of
emission from multiple celestial sources, we may then place bounds on all nine

in a straightforward way. In particular, we include the 2pi, rho-pi, and KKbar
continua as independent input in our analysis and provide an error band for our
results. Moreover, we discuss two different methods to include the asymptotic
constraints from perturbative QCD. We simultaneously analyze the world data for
all four form factors in both the space-like and time-like regions and
generally find good agreement with the data. We also extract the nucleon radii
and the omega-NN coupling constants. For the radii, we generally find good
agreement with other determinations with the exception of the electric charge
radius of the proton which comes out smaller. The omega-NN vector coupling
constant is determined relatively well by the fits, but for the tensor coupling
constant even the sign can not be determined.

chaotic and classical non-chaotic. It depends whether the spontaneously
symmetry breaking takes place. In the first class of models with the
spontaneously symmetry breaking the dynamics is similar to the Yang-Mills

initial conditions. We observe similarities to the phenomenon of a multiple
scattering process around the origin. In turn the class of models without the
spontaneously symmetry breaking can be described as the classical non-chaotic
scattering process and the methods of symbolic dynamic are also used in this
case. We show that the phantom cosmology can be treated as a simple model with
scattering of trajectories which character depends crucially on a sign of a
square of mass. We demonstrate that there is a possibility of chaotic behavior
in the flat Universe with a conformally coupled phantom field in the system

homogeneous Bose gas at density $\rho$ and temperature $T$. In the dilute
regime, i.e., when $a^3\rho \ll 1$, where $a$ denotes the scattering length of
the pair-interaction potential, our bound differs to leading order from the
expression for non-interacting particles by the term $4\pi a (2\rho^2 -
[\rho-\rho_c]_+^2)$. Here, $\rho_c(T)$ denotes the critical density for
Bose-Einstein condensation (for the non-interacting gas), and $[ ]_+$ denotes
the positive part. Our bound is uniform in the temperature up to temperatures
of the order of the critical temperature, i.e., $T \sim \rho^{2/3}$ or smaller.
One of the key ingredients in the proof is the use of coherent states to extend
the method introduced in [arXiv:math-ph/0601051] for estimating correlations to
temperatures below the critical one.

algebra. Any concept of a binary axiomatic relative velocity made possible the
replacement of the Lorentz relativity group by the relativity groupoid. The
relativity groupoid is a category of massive bodies in mutual relative motions,
where a binary relative velocity is interpreted as a categorical morphism with
the associative addition. This associative addition is to be contrasted with
non-associative addition of (ternary) relative velocities in isometric special
relativity (loop structure).
  We consider an algebra of many time-plus-space splits, as an operator algebra
generated by idempotents. The kinematics of relativity groupoid is ruled by
associative Frobenius operator algebra, whereas the dynamics of categorical
relativity needs the non-associative Fr\""olicher-Richardson operator algebra.
  The Lorentz covariance is the cornerstone of physical theory.
Observer-dependence within relativity groupoid, and the Lorentz-covariance

the role of lattice coordinates in underlying Toda field equations. A
multi-component version of the so called differential Fay identity are derived
from the Hirota equations of the $\tau$-function of this ``charged''

have a well-defined dispersionless limit (the dispersionless Hirota equations).

generating functional expression of auxiliary linear equations for
scalar-valued wave functions of the multi-component KP hierarchy.

continuous geometric symmetry, such as a real tokamak when the discrete nature
of the external magnetic field coils is taken into account, or the alternative
fusion concept, the stellarator, where axisymmetry is deliberately broken to
provide a nonzero winding number (rotational transform) on each invariant torus
of the magnetic field line dynamics (assumed for present purposes to be an
integrable Hamiltonian system). Quantum (wave) chaos theory provides tools for
characterizing the spectrum statistically, from the regular spectrum of the
separable case (integrable semiclassical dynamics) to that where the
semiclassical ray dynamics is so chaotic that no simple classification of the
individual eigenvalues is possible (quantum chaos). The MHD spectrum exhibits
certain nongeneric properties, which we show, using a toy model, to be
understable from the number-theoretic properties of the asymptotic spectrum in
the limit of large toroidal and poloidal mode (quantum) numbers when only a
single radial mode number is retained. Much more realistically, using the ideal
MHD code CAS3D, we have constructed a data set of several hundred growth-rate
eigenvalues for an interchange-unstable three-dimensional stellarator
equilibrium with a rather flat, nonmonotonic rotational transform profile.
Statistical analysis of eigenvalue spacings shows evidence of generic quantum
chaos, which we attribute to the mixing effect of having a large number of
radial mode numbers.

consciousness into quantum theory of measurements. Most naturally this is
achieved in the framework of Everett's ""many-worlds interpretation"" of quantum
mechanics. According to this interpretation, various classical alternatives are
perceived by consciousness separately from each other. In the Extended Everett
Concept (EEC) proposed by the present author, the separation of the
alternatives is identified with the phenomenon of consciousness. This explains
classical character of the alternatives and unusual manifestations of
consciousness arising ""at the edge of consciousness"" (i.e. in sleep or trance)
when its access to ""other alternative classical realities"" (other Everett's
worlds) becomes feasible. Because of reversibility of quantum evolution in EEC,
all time moments in the quantum world are equivalent while the impression of
flow of time appears only in consciousness. If it is assumed that consciousness
may influence onto probabilities of alternatives (which is consistent in case
of infinitely many Everett's worlds), EEC explains free will, ""probabilistic

temperatures between 800 deg C and 955 deg C at 2 kbar total pressure. Hydrogen
fugacities (f_{H_2}) were controlled using the double capsule technique with
the iron-w\""ustite (IW) buffer assemblage generating f_{H_2} of 1290-1370 bars
corresponding to H_2 partial pressures (P_{H_2}) of 960-975 bars. We found that
silica glass hydrogenated under such conditions contains molecular hydrogen
(H_2) in addition to SiH and SiOH groups. H_2 molecules dissolved in the
quenched glasses introduce a band at 4136 cm^{-1} in the Raman spectra which in
comparison to that of gaseous H_2 is wider and is shifted to lower frequency.
IR spectra of hydrogenated samples contain a band at 4138 cm^{-1} which we
assign to the stretching vibration of H_2 molecules located in
non-centrosymmetric sites. The Raman and IR spectra indicate that the dissolved
H_2 molecules interact with the silicate network. We suggest that the H_2 band
is the envelope of at least three components due to the occupation of at least
three different interstitial sites by H_2 molecules. Both, Raman and IR spectra
of hydrogenated glasses contain bands at ~2255 cm^{-1} which may be due to the
vibration of SiH groups.

$\widetilde{y}_n(i)= {1}/{n}\sum_{k}y(i-k)$ the moving average, $n$ the moving

we analytically show that $\sigma_{DMA}^2$ is equivalent to $C_H n^{2H}$ for

a simple way to measure the magnitude of the different terms in $G_{\tau}$.
When the generator has only terms associated with few-body couplings, our
proposal is scalable. We present the explicit protocol for estimating the
magnitude of the noise generators when the noise consists of only one and
two-body terms, and describe a method for measuring the parameters of more
general noise models. The protocol focuses on obtaining the magnitude with
which these terms affect the system during a time step of length $\tau$;
measurement of this information has critical implications for assesing the
scalability of fault-tolerant quantum computation in any physical setup.

lower bound to the time interval that a given initial state $\psi_I$ may need
so as to evolve into a state orthogonal to itself. Recently [V. Giovannetti, S.
Lloyd, and L. Maccone, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 67}, 052109 (2003)] this bound has
been generalized to the case where $\psi_I$ does not necessarily evolve into an
orthogonal state, but into any other $\psi_F$. It was pointed out that, for
certain classes of states, quantum entanglement enhances the evolution ""speed""
of composite quantum systems. In this work we provide an exhaustive and
systematic QSL study for pure and mixed states belonging to the whole
15-dimensional space of two qubits, with $\psi_F$ a not necessarily orthogonal
state to $\psi_I$. We display convincing evidence for a clear correlation
between concurrence, on the one hand, and the speed of quantum evolution
determined by the action of a rather general local Hamiltonian, on the other
one.
