solve several long-standing astrophysical puzzles, from supernova asymmetries

double-lined eclipsing binary with nearly identical low-mass components. The
spectroscopic elements derived from 18 spectra obtained with the High
Resolution Spectrograph on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope during the Fall of 2005
are K_1=88.45 +/- 0.48 km/s and K_2=90.43 +/- 0.60 km/s, resulting in a mass
ratio of$q=K_1/K_2 = 0.978 +/- 0.018 and minimum masses of M_1 sin^{3}i=0.775
+/- 0.016 solar masses and M_2 sin^{3}i=0.759 +/- 0.012 solar masses,
respectively. We have extensive differential photometry of J0516 obtained over
several nights between 2004 January-March (epoch 1) and 2004 October-2005
January plus 2006 January (epoch 2) using the 1m telescope at the Mount Laguna
Observatory. The source was roughly 0.1 mag brighter in all three bandpasses
during epoch 1 when compared to epoch 2. Also, phased light curves from epoch 1
show considerable out-of-eclipse variability, presumably due to bright spots on
one or both stars. In contrast, the phased light curves from epoch 2 show
little out-of-eclipse variability. The light curves from epoch 2 and the radial
velocity curves were analyzed using our ELC code with updated model atmospheres
for low-mass stars. We find the following: M_1=0.787 +/- 0.012 solar masses,
R_1=0.788 +/- 0.015 solar radii, M_2=0.770 +/- 0.009 solar masses, and
R_2=0.817 +/- 0.010 solar radii. The stars in J0516 have radii that are
significantly larger than model predictions for their masses, similar to what
is seen in a handful of other well-studied low-mass double-lined eclipsing
binaries. We compiled all recent mass and radius determinations from low-mass
binaries and determine an empirical mass-radius relation of the form R = 0.0324

  I discuss findings in terms of posterior bounds on the isocurvature fraction

the effective Bayesian complexity are computed for several prior ranges for the
isocurvature content. I find that the CDM isocurvature fraction is now
constrained to be less than about 10%, while the fraction in either the
neutrino entropy or velocity mode is below about 20%. Model comparison strongly
disfavours mixed models that allow for isocurvature fractions larger than
unity, while current data do not allow to distinguish between a purely
adiabatic model and models with a moderate (ie, below about 10%) isocurvature

  The conclusion is that purely adiabatic conditions are strongly favoured from
a model selection perspective. This is expected to apply in even stronger terms
to more complicated superpositions of isocurvature contributions.

synthetic spectra match almost all measurable hydrogen and helium lines
observed in six test stars over a wide spectral range from the Balmer limit to
the NIR, except for only a few well-understood cases. Our approach reproduces
other published non-LTE calculations, however avoids inconsistencies with the
modelling of the He I singlets recently discussed in the literature. It
improves on the published LTE models in many aspects: non-LTE strengthening and
the use of improved line-broadening data result in overall significant
differences in the line profiles and equivalent widths of the Balmer and helium
lines. Where possible, systematic effects on the stellar parameter
determination are quantified, e.g. gravities derived from the Hgamma wings may
be overestimated by up to ~0.2 dex at our upper temperature boundary in LTE.

knowledge of the function that describes the fall-off of signal size from the
shower core (the lateral distribution function). In this paper an analysis with
a simple Monte Carlo model is used to show that an optimum ground parameter can
be identified for each individual shower. At this optimal core distance,
$r_\mathrm{opt}$, the fluctuations in the expected signal, $S(r_\mathrm{opt})$,
due to a lack of knowledge of the lateral distribution function are minimised.
Furthermore it is shown that the optimum ground parameter is determined
primarily by the array geometry, with little dependence on the energy or zenith

developed, in different contexts, for the Accretion-Ejection Instability, the

rely on the properties of the relativistic rotation curve in the vicinity of
the Marginally Stable Orbit). This instability can appear as modes of azimuthal
wavenumbers m=2, 3,... that have very similar pattern speeds \omega/m, while
the m=1 mode, which would appear as the fundamental of this discrete spectrum,
is less unstable. This would readily explain the 2:3 (and sometimes higher)
frequency ratio observed between these QPO. These instabilites form eigenmodes,
i.e. standing wave patterns at a constant frequency in the disk; they are
strongly unstable, and thus do not need an external excitation mechanism to
reach high amplitudes. Furthermore, they have the property that a fraction of
the accretion energy can be emitted toward the corona: this would explain that
these QPO are seen in a spectral state where Comptonized emission from the
corona is always present. Their existence depends critically on the existence
of a magnetic structure, formed by poloidal flux advected in the accretion
process, in the central region between the disk and the black hole.

absorbers at all redshifts studied appear to contradict the predictions for the
global mean interstellar metallicity in galaxies from cosmic chemical evolution
models. On the other hand, a number of metal-rich sub-DLA systems have been
identified recently, and the fraction of metal-rich sub-DLAs appears to be
considerably larger than that of metal-rich DLAs, especially at z < 1.5. In
view of this, here we investigate the evolution of metallicity in sub-DLAs. We
find that the mean Zn metallicity of the observed sub-DLAs may be higher than
that of the observed DLAs, especially at low redshifts, reaching a near-solar
level at z <~ 1. This trend does not appear to be an artifact of sample
selection, the use of Zn, the use of N_{HI}-weighting, or observational
sensitivity. While a bias against very low metallicity could be present in the
sub-DLA sample in some situations, this cannot explain the difference between
the DLA and sub-DLA metallicities at low z. The primary reason for the
difference between the DLAs and sub-DLAs appears to be the dearth of metal-rich
DLAs. We estimate the sub-DLA contribution to the total metal budget using
measures of their metallicity and comoving gas density. These calculations
suggest that at z <~ 1, the contribution of sub-DLAs to the total metal budget
may be several times that of DLAs. At higher redshifts also, there are
indications that the sub-DLAs may contribute significantly to the cosmic metal
budget.

small and is not responsible for missing many QSOs in magnitude limited QSO
surveys. While we can not totally rule out a bimodal dust distribution with a
population of very dusty, metal rich, absorbers which push the background QSOs
below the observational threshold of current optical spectroscopic studies,
based upon the current samples it appears that the metallicity in QSO absorbers
decreases with increase in H I column densities beyond 10^{19} cm^{-2}. Thus
the sub-DLA population is more metal rich than the DLAs, a trend which may
possibly extend to the non-damped Lyman limit systems (NDLLS). Based on the
recently discovered mass-metallicity relation for galaxies, we suggest that
most sub-DLAs and possibly NDLLS, are associated with massive spiral/elliptical
galaxies while most DLAs are associated with low mass galaxies. The sub-DLA
galaxies will then contribute a larger fraction of total mass (stellar and ISM)
and therefore metals, to the cosmic budget, specially at low redshifts, as
compared to the DLAs.

also measure the gas velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{g}$) from these multiple
transitions, and find that the relation between $\sigma_{g}$ and $\sigma_{*}^c$
becomes much weaker at higher redshifts than in smaller redshifts. The
distribution of $<\sigma_{g}/\sigma_{*}^c>$ is $1.24\pm0.76$ for the core [O
III] line and $1.20\pm0.96$ for the [O II] line, which suggests that
$\sigma_{g}$ of the core [O III] and [O II] lines can trace $\sigma_{*}^c$
within about 0.1 dex in the logarithm of $\sigma_{*}^c$. For the secondary
driver, we find that the deviation of $\sigma_{g}$ from $\sigma_{*}^c$ is
correlated with the Eddington ratio.

The vector functions follow from compatibility condition for the pure shear

linearly elastic solids with cubic material symmetry: for a given state of
stress or strain, the strain energy achieves its extreme values when the

liquid phases on the triangular and Kagom\'e lattices in the Schwinger boson
framework. A maximum of eight distinct $Z_2$ spin liquid states are found for
each lattice, which preserve all symmetries. Out of these only a few have
nonvanishing nearest neighbor amplitudes which are studied in greater detail.
On the triangular lattice, only two such states are present - the first
(zero-flux state) is the well known state introduced by Sachdev, which on
condensation of spinons leads to the 120 degree ordered state. The other
solution which we call the $\pi$-flux state has not previously been discussed.
Spinon condensation leads to an ordering wavevector at the Brillouin zone edge
centers, in contrast to the 120 degree state. While the zero-flux state is more
stable with just nearest-neighbor exchange, we find that the introduction of
either next-neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange or four spin ring-exchange (of
the sign obtained from a Hubbard model) tends to favor the $\pi$-flux state. On
the Kagom\'e lattice four solutions are obtained - two have been previously
discussed by Sachdev, which on spinon condensation give rise to the $q=0$ and
$\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ spin ordered states. In addition we find two new
states with significantly larger values of the quantum parameter at which
magnetic ordering occurs. For one of them this even exceeds unity,
$\kappa_c\approx 2.0$ in a nearest neighbor model, indicating that if
stabilized, could remain spin disordered for physical values of the spin. This
state is also stabilized by ring exchange interactions with signs as derived
from the Hubbard model.

studied theoretically the conductance of ideal atomic contact geometries of the
ferromagnetic 3d materials Fe, Co, and Ni using a realistic tight-binding
model. Our analysis shows that in the absence of magnetic domains, the d bands
of these transition metals play a key role in the electrical conduction. In the
contact regime this fact has the following important consequences for the three
materials: (i) there are partially open conduction channels and therefore
conductance quantization is not expected, (ii) the conductance of the last
plateau is typically above G_0=2e^2/h, (iii) both spin species contribute to
the transport and thus there is in general no full current polarization, and
(iv) both the value of the conductance and the current polarization are very
sensitive to the contact geometry and to disorder. In the tunneling regime we
find that a strong current polarization can be achieved.

(LP) over a relaxed codeword polytope was recently proposed by Feldman et al.
In this paper we investigate the structure of the polytope used in the LP
relaxation decoding. We begin by showing that for expander codes, every
fractional pseudocodeword always has at least a constant fraction of
non-integral bits. We then prove that for expander codes, the active set of any
fractional pseudocodeword is smaller by a constant fraction than the active set
of any codeword. We exploit this fact to devise a decoding algorithm that
provably outperforms the LP decoder for finite blocklengths. It proceeds by
guessing facets of the polytope, and resolving the linear program on these
facets. While the LP decoder succeeds only if the ML codeword has the highest
likelihood over all pseudocodewords, we prove that for expander codes the
proposed algorithm succeeds even with a constant number of pseudocodewords of
higher likelihood. Moreover, the complexity of the proposed algorithm is only a
constant factor larger than that of the LP decoder.

considered under the restrictive assumptions (i) spherical-symmetric density
profiles, (ii) time-independent quintessence equation of state parameter, w,
and (iii) nothing but gravitational interaction between dark energy scalar
field and matter. In addition, the quintessence subsystem is conceived as made
of ``particles'' whose mutual interaction has intensity equal to G(1+3w) and
scales as the inverse square of their distance. Then the virial theorem is
formulated for subsystems. In the special case of fully clustered quintessence,
energy conservation is assumed with regard to either the whole system (global
energy conservation), or to the matter subsystem within the tidal potential
induced by the quintessence subsystem (partial energy conservation). Further
investigation is devoted to a few special values, w=-1/3, -1/2, -2/3, -1. The
special case of fully clustered (i.e. collapsing together with the matter)
quintessence is studied in detail. The general case of partially clustered
quintessence is considered in terms of a degree of quintessence de-clustering,
\zeta, ranging from fully clustered (\zeta=0) to completely de-clustered
(\zeta=1) quintessence, respectively. The special case of unclustered (i.e.
remaining homogeneous) quintessence is also discussed. The trend exhibited by
the fractional (virialization to turnaround) radius, \eta, as a function of
other parameters, is found to be different from its counterparts reported in
earlier attempts. The reasons of the above mentioned discrepancy are discussed.

Euclidean action for the grand canonical ensemble is computed with the
appropriate boundary terms. The thermodynamical quantities such as the Gibbs
free energy, entropy and specific heat of the black holes are derived from it.
The global stability of black holes are studied in detail by studying the free
energy for various potentials. For small values of the potential, we find that
there is a Hawking-Page phase transition between a BIAdS black hole and the
thermal-AdS space. For large potentials, the black hole phase is dominant and
are preferred over the thermal-AdS space. Local stability is studied by
computing the specific heat for constant potentials. The non-extreme black
holes have two branches: small black holes are unstable and the large black
holes are stable. The extreme black holes are shown to be stable both globally
as well as locally. In addition to the thermodynamics, we also show that the
phase structure relating the mass $M$ and the charge $Q$ of the black holes is
similar to the liquid-gas-solid phase diagram.

components. These measures are typically constructed as weighted $\ell_1$ norms
of componentwise $\ell_q$ norms of frame coefficients. We show how to compute
solutions of linear inverse problems with such joint sparsity regularization
constraints by fast thresholded Landweber algorithms. Next we discuss the
adaptive choice of suitable weights appearing in the definition of sparsity
measures. The weights are interpreted as indicators of the sparsity pattern and
are iteratively up-dated after each new application of the thresholded
Landweber algorithm. The resulting two-step algorithm is interpreted as a
double-minimization scheme for a suitable target functional. We show its
$\ell_2$-norm convergence. An implementable version of the algorithm is also
formulated, and its norm convergence is proven. Numerical experiments in color
image restoration are presented.

the same as for the incipient infinite cluster for ordinary percolation, the
scaling functions differ. Thus, somewhat surprisingly, the two clusters behave
differently; in fact, we prove that their laws are mutually singular. In
addition, we derive scaling estimates for simple random walk on the cluster
starting from the root. We show that the invasion percolation cluster is
stochastically dominated by the incipient infinite cluster. Far above the root,
the two clusters have the same law locally, but not globally. A key ingredient
in the proofs is an analysis of the forward maximal weights along the backbone
of the invasion percolation cluster. These weights decay toward the critical
value for ordinary percolation, but only slowly, and this slow decay causes the
scaling behavior to differ from that of the incipient infinite cluster.

enters the system through physical boundaries and this leads to stochastic
dynamic boundary conditions. A dynamic, as opposed to static, boundary
condition involves the time derivative as well as spatial derivatives for the
system state variables on the boundary. Although stochastic \emph{static}
(Neumann or Dirichet type) boundary conditions have been applied for stochastic
partial differential equations, not much is known about the dynamical impact of
stochastic \emph{dynamic} boundary conditions. The purpose of this paper is to
study possible impacts of stochastic dynamic boundary conditions on the long
term dynamics of the Cahn-Hilliard equation arising in the materials science.
We show that the dimension estimation of the random attractor increases as the
coefficient for the dynamic term in the stochastic dynamic boundary condition
decreases. However, the dimension of the random attractor is not affected by
the corresponding stochastic static boundary condition.

electrodes. Trapping of charged particles in an electrode structure leads to
frequency shifts, which are due to image charge and space charge effects. These
effects are of importance for Penning trap experiments which involve high
charge densities or require high precision in the motional frequencies. Our
analysis of image charges shows that only (higher order) odd powers of the
particle displacement lead to induced charge differences, giving rise to a
signal. This implies that, besides the centre-of-mass frequency of a trapped
particle cloud, also higher order individual particle frequencies induce a
signal, which can be picked up by an electronic detection circuit attached to
the trap electrodes. We also derive analytic expressions for the image charge
and space charge induced frequency shifts and perform simulations of space
charge effects. In relation to this, we discuss the consequences of the shifted
particle frequencies for resistive cooling of the particle motion.

existence of the crossover timescales are related to a sinusoidal trend. The
first crossover is due to the seasonal trend and the value of second ones is
approximately equal to the well known cycle of sun activity. Using Fourier
detrended fluctuation analysis, the sinusoidal trend is eliminated. The value
of Hurst exponent of the runoff water of rivers without the sinusoidal trend
shows a long range correlation behavior. For the Daugava river the value of
Hurst exponent is $0.52\pm0.01$ and also we find that these fluctuations have
multifractal nature. Comparing the MF-DFA results for the remaining data set of
Daugava river to those for shuffled and surrogate series, we conclude that its
multifractal nature is almost entirely due to the broadness of probability
density function.

  \textit{Quesada gigas}","5 pages, 6 figures",,,,"q-bio.OT",,"  Cicadas (Homoptera:Cicadidae) are insects able to produce loudly songs and it
is known that the mechanism to produce sound of tymballing cicadas works as a
Helmholtz resonator. In this work we offer evidence on the participation of the
wings in a high quality resonating process which defines the details of the
acoustic properties of the calling song. The study is carry on \textit{Quesada
gigas} species and it is dividied in three stages: (i) the acoustical
characterization of the abdominal cavity, (ii) the record and calculation of
frequency spectrum of the calling song, and (iii) the measurement of the
vibration modes of the wings. The comparison between all the results
unequivocally show the dramatic influence of the wings in the moment in which
the insect emits its calling song.

Geometry Problem (MDGP) is that of finding a function $x:G\to \mathbb{R}^{3}$,
where $||x(u)-x(v)||=d(u,v)$ for each $\{u,v\}\in E$. We show that under a few
assumptions usually satisfied in proteins, the MDGP can be formulated as a
search in a discrete space. We call this MDGP subclass the Discretizable MDGP
(DMDGP). We show that the DMDGP is \textbf{NP}-complete and we propose an
algorithm, called Branch-and-Prune (BP), which solves the DMDGP exactly. The BP
algorithm performs exceptionally well in terms of solution accuracy and can
find all solutions to any DMDGP instance. We successfully test the BP algorithm
on several randomly generated instances.

  28th, 2006",,"10.1139/P06-072",,"quant-ph",,"  The one dimensional Schroedinger hydrogen atom is an interesting mathematical
and physical problem to study bound states, eigenfunctions and quantum
degeneracy issues. This 1D physical system gave rise to some intriguing
controversy over more than four decades. Presently, still no definite consensus
seems to have been reached. We reanalyzed this apparently controversial
problem, approaching it from a Fourier transform representation method combined
with some fundamental (basic) ideas found in self-adjoint extensions of
symmetric operators. In disagreement with some previous claims, we found that
the complete Balmer energy spectrum is obtained together with an odd parity set
of eigenfunctions. Closed form solutions in both coordinate and momentum spaces
were obtained. No twofold degeneracy was observed as predicted by the
degeneracy theorem in one dimension, though it does not necessarily have to
hold for potentials with singularities. No ground state with infinite energy
exists since the corresponding eigenfunction does not satisfy the Schroedinger
equation at the origin.

photoionization of atoms in a cadmium vapor with ultrafast laser pulses. The
photoionization is driven through an intermediate atomic resonance with a
frequency-quadrupled mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser that produces pulses of
either 100 fsec or 1 psec duration at a central wavelength of 229 nm. The large
bandwidth of the pulses photoionizes all velocity classes of the Cd vapor,
resulting in high loading efficiencies compared to previous ion trap loading
techniques. Measured loading rates are compared with a simple theoretical
model, and we conclude that this technique can potentially ionize every atom
traversing the laser beam within the trapping volume. This may allow the
operation of ion traps with lower levels of background pressures and less trap
electrode surface contamination. The technique and laser system reported here
should be applicable to loading most laser-cooled ion species.

Wrobel","Universal Mixing of Quantum Walk on Graphs","14 pages, 4 figures","Quantum Information and Computation 7(8):738-751, 2007",,,"quant-ph",,"  We study the set of probability distributions visited by a continuous-time
quantum walk on graphs. An edge-weighted graph G is universal mixing if the
instantaneous or average probability distribution of the quantum walk on G
ranges over all probability distributions on the vertices as the weights are
varied over non-negative reals. The graph is uniform mixing if it visits the
uniform distribution. Our results include the following:
  (a) All weighted complete multipartite graphs are instantaneous universal
mixing. This is in contrast to the fact that no unweighted complete
multipartite graphs are uniform mixing (except for the four-cycle).
  (b) The weighted claw or star graph is a minimally connected instantaneous
universal mixing graph. In fact, as a corollary, the unweighted claw is
instantaneous uniform mixing. This adds a new family of uniform mixing graphs
to a list that so far contains only the hypercubes.
  (c) Any weighted graph is average almost-uniform mixing unless its spectral
type is sublinear in the size of the graph. This provides a nearly tight
characterization for average uniform mixing on circulant graphs.
  (d) No weighted graphs are average universal mixing. This shows that weights
do not help to achieve average universal mixing, unlike the instantaneous case.
  Our proofs exploit the spectra of the underlying weighted graphs and path
collapsing arguments.

be recovered by a unitary operation, where the notion of recovery is more
relaxed than the notion of correction insofar as it does not protect the
subsystem from subsequent iterations of the noise. We also demonstrate that in
the case of unital noise operations one can identify a subset of all
correctable subsystems -- those that can be corrected by a single unitary
operation -- as the noiseless subsystems for the composition of the noise
operation with its dual. Using the recently developed structure theory for
noiseless subsystems, the identification of such unitarily correctable
subsystems is reduced to an algebraic exercise.

mechanics. It finds applications in various disciplines of physics including
condense matter, quantum optics, to name but a few. Wigner distribution
function is introduced by E. Wigner in 1932. However, there is no analytical
derivation of Wigner distribution function in the literatures, to date. In this
paper, a simple analytical derivation of Wigner distribution function is
presented. Our derivation is based on two assumptions, these are A) by taking
the integral of Wigner distribution function, with respect to configuration
space, the momentum space distribution function is obtained B) WDF is real.
Similarly, and in addition to Wigner distribution function, the distribution
function of Sobouti-Nasiri, which is imaginary, is also derived.
