the standard internal-external shock model. The decay index of early afterglow
is very sensitive to the reference time one chooses. In order to understand the
nature of early afterglow, it is essential to take a correct reference time.
Our simple analytic model provides a framework to understand special
relativistic effects involved in early afterglow phase. We evaluate light
curves of reverse shock emission as well as those of forward shock emission,
based on full hydrodynamic calculations. We show that the reference time does
not shift significantly even in the thick shell case. For external shock
emission components, measuring times from the beginning of the prompt emission
is a good approximation and it does not cause an early steep decay. In the thin
shell case, the energy transfer time from fireball ejecta to ambient medium
typically extends to thousands of seconds. This might be related to the shallow
decay phases observed in early X-ray afterglow at least for some bursts.

J=5$\to$4; $v=0$ line observations of the OMC1S region in the Orion Nebula made
using the Submillimeter Array (SMA). We detect for the first time a cluster of
four compact bipolar and monopolar outflows that show high, moderate and low
velocity gas and appear to be energized by millimeter and infrared sources
associated with this region. The SiO molecular outflows are compact ($<$ 3500
AU), and in most of the cases, they are located very close to their exciting
sources. We thus propose that the SiO thermal emission is tracing the youngest
and most highly excited parts of the outflows which cannot be detected by other
molecules. Moreover, since the ambient cloud is weak in the SiO line emission,
these observations can reveal flows that in other molecular transitions will be
confused with the ambient velocity cloud emission. Analysis of their
positional-velocity diagrams show that some components of these outflows may be
driven by wide-angle winds very close to the exciting object. Finally, we find
that some of these SiO outflows seem to be the base of powerful Herbig-Haro
jets and large-scale molecular flows that emanate from a few arcseconds around
this zone. In particular, we find a strongly excited SiO bipolar outflow with a
P.A. of $\sim$ 100$^{\circ}$, that is likely energized by the luminous ($\sim$
3 $\times$ 10$^3$ L$_{\odot}$) infrared protostar ""B"" and could be the base of

star 36 Lyncis from line syntheses of phase-resolved, high resolution spectra
obtained from the IUE archives and from newly obtained ground-based H$\alpha$
spectra. This disk is highly inclined to the rotational axis and betrays its
existence every half rotation cycle as one of two opposing sectors pass in
front of the star. Although the disk absorption spectrum is at least ten times
too weak to be visible in optical iron lines during these occultations, its
properties can be readily examined in a large number of UV ""iron curtain"" lines
because of their higher opacities. The analysis of the variations of the UV
resonance lines brings out some interesting details about the radiative
properties of the disks: (1) they are optically thick in the C IV and Si IV
doublets, (2) the range of excitation of the UV resonance lines is larger at
the primary occultation ($\phi$ = 0.00) than at the secondary one, and (3) the
{\bf relative strengths of the absorption peaks} for the two occultations
varies substantially from line to line. We have modeled the absorptions of the
UV C IV resonance and H$\alpha$ absorptions by means of a simulated disk with
opaque and translucent components. Our simulations suggest that a gap separates
the star and the inner edge of the disk. The disk extends radially out to
$\geq$10 R$_{*}$. The disk scale height perpendicular to the plane is
$\approx$1R$_{*}$. However, the sector causing the primary occultation is about
four times thicker than the opposite sector. The C IV scattering region extends
to a larger height than the H$\alpha$ region does, probably because it results
from shock heating far from the cooler disk plane.

were calculated from ab initio studies within the LDA and LDA+U approximations.
It is shown that LDA underestimates the band gap, energy levels of the Cd-4d
states, s-d coupling and band dispersion. However, it calculates the spin-orbit
coupling correctly. LDA+U did not increase much the band gap value, but it
corrected the s-d coupling by shifting the Cd-4d levels towards the
experimentally determined location and by splitting the LDA-derived single s
peak into two peaks, which originates from admixture of s and d states. It is
shown that the sd coupling plays an important role in absorption and
reflectivity constants. The calculated optical spectra fairly agree with
experimental data. Independent of wave-vector scissors operator is found to be
a good first approximation to shift rigidly the band gap of CdTe underestimated

one (the bounded value property) giving a necessary and sufficient condition

  Anatolian Fault Zone","11 pages, 3 figures",,,,"physics.geo-ph",,"  Earthquakes and aftershock sequences follow several empirical scaling laws:
One of these laws is Bath's law for the magnitude of the largest aftershock. In
this work, Modified Form of Bath's Law and its application to KOERI data have
been studied. Bath's law states that the differences in magnitudes between
mainshocks and their largest detected aftershocks are approximately constant,
independent of the magnitudes of mainshocks and it is about 1.2. In the
modified form of Bath's law for a given mainshock we get the inferred largest
aftershock of this mainshock by using an extrapolation of the Gutenberg-Richter
frequency-magnitude statistics of the aftershock sequence. To test the
applicability of this modified law, 6 large earthquakes that occurred in Turkey
between 1950 and 2004 with magnitudes equal to or greater than 6.9 have been
considered. These earthquakes take place on the North Anatolian Fault Zone.
Additionally, in this study the partitioning of energy during a
mainshock-aftershock sequence was also calculated in two different ways. It is
shown that most of the energy is released in the mainshock. The constancy of
the differences in magnitudes between mainshocks and their largest aftershocks
is an indication of scale-invariant behavior of aftershock sequences.

beam dumps per interaction region, each rated to 18MW of beam power, together
with additional beam dumps for tuning purposes and machine protection. The
baseline design uses high pressure moving water dumps, first developed for the
SLC and used in the TESLA design, although a gas based dump is also being
considered. In this paper we discuss the progress made by the international
community on both physics and engineering studies for the beam dumps.

induce transitions between discrete energy levels of the atom, no matter what
is its frequency. It means in the quantum transition of an atom interacting
with an intense laser of circular frequency $\omega$, the energy difference
between the initial and the final states of the atom is not necessarily being
an integer multiple of the quantum energy $\hbar\omega$. The absorption spectra
become continuous. The Bohr condition is violated. The energy of photoelectrons
becomes light intensity dependent in the intense laser photoelectric effect.
The transition probabilities and cross sections of photo-excitations and
photo-ionizations are laser intensity dependent, showing that these processes
cannot be reduced to the results of interactions between the atom and separate
individual photons, they are rather the processes of the atom interacting with
the laser as a whole. The interaction of photons on atoms are not simply
additive. The effects are non-perturbative and non-linear. Some numerical
results for processes between hydrogen atom and intense circularly polarized
laser, illustrating the non-perturbative and non-linear character of the
atom-laser interaction, are given.

as a basic assumption. Most people in the field consider the inconsistency
between local realistic theories and quantum mechanics to be a result of
non-local nature of quantum mechanics. In this Paper, we derive the
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger type theorem for particles with instantaneous
(non-local) interactions at the hidden-variable level. Then, we show that the
previous contradiction still exists between quantum mechanics and non-local
hidden variable models.

systems such as quantum spin or harmonic chains as quantum channels for short
distance communication. Many properties of such chains are determined by the
spectral gap between their ground and excited states. In particular this gap
vanishes at critical points of quantum phase transitions. In this article we
study the relation between the transfer speed and quality of such a system and
the size of its spectral gap. We find that the transfer is almost perfect but
slow for large spectral gaps and fast but rather inefficient for small gaps.
