perturbations in an expanding cosmological background of cold pressure-less
gas. We focus on solutions having shock discontinuities propagating in the
surrounding cold gas. The pressure, $p$, and energy-density, $\mu$, in the
shock-heated matter are assumed to obey $p=w\mu$, where $w$ is a positive
constant. Consistent solutions are found for shocks propagating from the
symmetry center of a region of a positive density excess over the background.
In these solutions, shocks exist outside the radius marking the event horizon
of the black hole which would be present in a shock-less collapse. For large
jumps in the energy-density at the shock, a black hole is avoided altogether
and the solutions are regular at the center. The shock-heated gas does not
contain any sonic points, provided the motion of the cold gas ahead of the
shock deviates significantly from the Hubble flow. For shocks propagating in
the uniform background, sonic points always appear for small jumps in the
energy-density. We also discuss self-similar solutions without shocks in fluids
with $w<-1/3$.

127 AGN, of which 91 are confidently detected (>5 sigma) on the time-averaged

for calculating the AGN luminosity function and X-ray absorption distribution.
In broad agreement with previous studies, we find that the fraction of obscured
(log NH>22) objects is much higher (~70%) among the low-luminosity AGN
(Lx<10^43.6 erg/s) than among the high-luminosity ones (Lx>10^43.6 erg/s),

a significant population of AGN that are so strongly obscured that their
observed hard
  X-ray luminosities fall below 10^40-10^41 erg/s, the effective limit of our

smoothly broken power-law shape in the range 40<log Lx<45.5 with a

very strong variability over the last 5 years. We observed a second large X-ray
outburst in November 2004 with the high resolution transmission grating
spectrometer on-board Chandra. In the low state X-ray emissivities indicate
temperatures well above 25 MK. In the high state we find an extended emissivity
distribution with high emissivities in the range from 3 MK to over 100 MK. The
outburst event in stellar terms is one of the most powerful ever observed and
the most energetic one in the ONC with a lower total energy limit of 1.5x10^37
ergs. The line diagnostics show that under the assumption that the line
emitting regions in the low states are as close as within 1 -- 2 stellar radii
from the O-star's photosphere, whereas the hard states suggest a distance of 3

of the stars. We argue that the high X-ray states are possibly the result of
reconnection events from magnetic interactions of the primary and secondary
stars of the spectroscopic binary. Effects from wind collisions seem unlikely
for this system. The low state emissivity and R-ratios strengthen the
predicament that the X-ray emission is enhanced by magnetic confinement of the
primary wind. We also detect Fe fluorescence indicative of the existence of
substantial amounts of neutral Fe in the vicinity of the X-ray emission.

large angular size compared to the Chandra field-of-view. We describe a
quantitative measure of the impact of central cooling, and find that the sample
comprises 9 clusters possessing cool cores and 11 without. The properties of
these two types differ markedly, but there is a high degree of uniformity
amongst the cool core clusters, which obey a nearly universal radial scaling in
temperature of the form T \propto r^~0.4, within the core. This uniformity
persists in the gas cooling time, which varies more strongly with radius in
cool core clusters (t_cool \propto r^~1.3), reaching t_cool <1Gyr in all cases,
although surprisingly low central cooling times (<5Gyr) are found in many of
the non-cool core systems. The scatter between the cooling time profiles of all
the clusters is found to be remarkably small, implying a universal form for the
cooling time of gas at a given physical radius in virialized systems, in
agreement with recent previous work. Our results favour cluster merging as the
primary factor in preventing the formation of cool cores.

conditions on the connection forms. We will use the so-called conductor (a.k.a

we will first show that the space of connections is a C^\infty Hilbert
principal bundle with respect to the associated conductor gauge group. We will
consider the holonomy of the Coulomb connection for this bundle. If the base

  complexity","12 Pages, 2 Figures",,,,"nlin.CD",,"  Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZ) [1] and its variants have been used widely to
identify non-random patterns in biomedical signals obtained across distinct
physiological states. Non-random signatures of the complexity measure can occur
under nonlinear deterministic as well as non-deterministic settings. Surrogate
data testing have also been encouraged in the past in conjunction with
complexity estimates to make a finer distinction between various classes of
processes. In this brief letter, we make two important observations (1)
Non-Gaussian noise at the dynamical level can elude existing surrogate
algorithms namely: Phase-randomized surrogates (FT) amplitude-adjusted Fourier
transform (AAFT) and iterated amplitude adjusted Fourier transform (IAAFT).
Thus any inference nonlinear determinism as an explanation for the
non-randomness is incomplete (2) Decrease in complexity can be observed even
across two linear processes with identical auto-correlation functions. The
results are illustrated with a second-order auto-regressive process with
Gaussian and non-Gaussian innovations. AR (2) processes have been used widely
to model several physiological phenomena, hence their choice. The results
presented encourage cautious interpretation of non-random signatures in
experimental signals using complexity measures.

optimal broadcasting and state estimation are asymptotically equivalent. We
