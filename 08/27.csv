next-to-lightest sparticle (NSP) is the stau, the charged partner of the tau
lepton, it may be metastable and form bound states with several nuclei. These
bound states may affect the cosmological abundances of Li6 and Li7 by enhancing
nuclear rates that would otherwise be strongly suppressed. We consider the
effects of these enhanced rates on the final abundances produced in Big-Bang
nucleosynthesis (BBN), including injections of both electromagnetic and
hadronic energy during and after BBN. We calculate the dominant two- and
three-body decays of both neutralino and stau NSPs, and model the
electromagnetic and hadronic decay products using the PYTHIA event generator
and a cascade equation. Generically, the introduction of bound states drives
light element abundances further from their observed values; however, for small
regions of parameter space bound state effects can bring lithium abundances in
particular in better accord with observations. We show that in regions where
the stau is the NSP with a lifetime longer than 10^3-10^4 s, the abundances of
Li6 and Li7 are far in excess of those allowed by observations. For shorter
lifetimes of order 1000 s, we comment on the possibility in minimal
supersymmetric and supergravity models that stau decays could reduce the Li7
abundance from standard BBN values while at the same time enhancing the Li6
abundance.

relations between the observed pulses and their corresponding timescales, such

find that the angular spreading timescale caused by curvature effect of
fireball surface only contributes to the falling part of the observed pulses,
while the dynamic one in the co-moving frame of the shell merely contributes to
the rising portion of pulses provided the radiative time is negligible. In
addition, the pulses resulted from the pure radiative cooling time of
relativistic electrons exhibit properties of fast rise and slow decay (a
quasi-FRED) profile together with smooth peaks. Besides, we interpret the
phenomena of wider pules tending to be more asymmetric to be a consequence of
the difference in emission regions. Meanwhile, we find the intrinsic emission
time is decided by the ratios of lorentz factors and radii of the shells
between short and long bursts. Based on the analysis of asymmetry, our results
suggest that the long GRB pulses may occur in the regions with larger radius,
while the short bursts could locate at the smaller distance from central

independently here during which we obtained the first spatially resolved R~2000

wide systems. However, only 0.3+/-0.1% of old field VLM objects are found in
such wide systems. Thus, young, wide, VLM binary populations may be
evaporating, due to stellar encounters in their natal clusters, leading to a
field population depleted in wide VLM systems.

follow the orbits of a set of microhalos in a realistic flattened Milky Way
potential. We concentrate on (detectable) microhalos passing near the Sun with
a range of pericenter and apocenter. Stellar perturbers near the orbital path
of a microhalo would exert stochachstic impulses, which we apply in a Monte

different masses and ages in our Galaxy. Also incorporated are the usual
pericenter tidal heating and disk-shocking heating. We give a detailed
diagnosis of typical microhalos and find microhalos with internal tangential
anisotropy are slightly more robust than the ones with radial anisotropy. In
addition, the dark particles generally go through of a random walk in velocity
space and diffuse out of the microhalos.

which the optical conductivity was determined. Using
Thermal-Difference-Reflectance (TDR) Spectroscopy the reflectance of the sample
in the normal state just above the superconducting transition, and in the
superconducting state were then obtained. From these data we determined the
ratio of the superconducting- to normal-state optical conductivities. Mattis
and Bardeen had calculated this function within the BCS theory, where the gap
is a fixed energy-independent quantity. Taking into account the retarded nature
of the electron-phonon coupling results in a complex, energy dependent gap
causing deviations from the Mattis-Bardeen plot at energies where the phonon
coupling function is large. We find a typical deviation near the phonon
energies in Tl2212, and in addition, at 1.2 and 1.7eV. The phonon, and these
electronic terms can each be described by a coupling constant. None of which by
itself gives rise to a high transition temperature, but the combination does.
Using Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Scattering (RIXS) we find that the d-to-d
excitations of the cuprate ion in Tl2212 fall at the same energies as the dips
in the Mattis-Bardeen plot. We conclude that the high superconducting
transition temperature of the cuprates is due to the sum of the phonon

The black strings/cigars penetrating the Friedmann brane generate a
Swiss-cheese type structure. This universe forever expands and decelerates, as
its general relativistic analogue. The evolution of the cosmological fluid
however can proceed along four branches, two allowed to have positive energy
density, one of them having the symmetric embedding limit. On this branch a
future pressure singularity can arise for either (a) a difference in the
cosmological constants of the cosmological and black hole brane regions (b) a
difference in the left and right bulk cosmological constants. While the
behaviour (a) can be avoided by a redefinition of the fluid variables, (b)
establishes a critical value of the asymmetry over which the pressure
singularity occurs. We introduce the pressure singularity censorship which
bounds the degree of asymmetry in the bulk cosmological constant. We also show
as a model independent generic feature that the asymmetry source term due to
the bulk cosmological constant increases in the early universe. In order to
obey the nucleosynthesis constraints, the brane tension should be constrained
therefore both from below and from above. With the maximal degree of asymmetry
obeying the pressure singularity censorship, the higher limit is 10 times the
lower limit. The degree of asymmetry allowed by present cosmological
observations is however much less, pushing the upper limit to infinity.

epsilon-delta-surgery sequence recently proved by Pedersen, Quinn and Ranicki.
Since one has to apply it not only in cases when the target is a manifold, but
a controlled Poincar\'e complex, we explain this issue very roughly.
Specifically, it is applied in the inductive step to construct the desired
controlled homotopy equivalence p_{i+1}: X_{i+1} --> X_i. Our main theorem
requires a sufficiently controlled Poincar\'e structure on X_i (over X_{i-1}).
Our construction shows that this can be achieved. In fact, the Poincar\'e
structure of X_i depends upon a homotopy equivalence used to glue two manifold
pieces together (the rest is surgery theory leaving unaltered the Poincar\'e
structure). It follows from the epsilon-delta-surgery sequence (more precisely
from the Wall realization part) that this homotopy equivalence is sufficiently
well controlled. In the final section we give additional explanation why the
limit space of the X_i's has no resolution.

by a piecewise constant function on a finite partition of the underlying
measurable space. Given a (possibly large) family of candidate partitions, we
build a piecewise constant estimator (histogram) on each of them and then use
the data to select one estimator in the family. Choosing the square of a
Hellinger-type distance as our loss function, we show that each estimator built
on a given partition satisfies an analogue of the classical squared bias plus
variance risk bound. Moreover, the selection procedure leads to a final
estimator satisfying some oracle-type inequality, with, as usual, a possible
loss corresponding to the complexity of the family of partitions we consider.
When this complexity is not too high, the selected estimator has a risk
bounded, up to a universal constant, by the smallest risk bound obtained for
the estimators in the family. For suitable choices of the family of partitions,
we deduce uniform risk bounds over various classes of intensities. Our approach
applies to the estimation of the intensity of an inhomogenous Poisson process,
among other counting processes, or the estimation of the mean of a random
vector with nonnegative components.

structure of the dense QCD matter created in these collisions, and investigate
the origin of the trends observed in the excitation functions of certain soft
hadronic observables. We show that presence of chemical nonequilibrium in light
quark abundance imparts a characteristic signature on the energy dependence of
resonance yields, that differs considerably from what is expected in the
equilibrium picture.

matter. In the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model the nuclear correction to the
sigma term is small and negative, i.e., it decelerates the decrease of the
quark condensate in nuclear matter. However, the quark condensate in nuclear
matter is controlled primarily by the scalar-isoscalar $\sigma$ field. Compared
to the leading term, it moderates the decrease more than that of the nuclear
sigma term alone at densities around and larger than the normal nuclear matter
density.

generating oscillatory massless charge a material particle, will be Doppler
shifted when the charge hence particle is in motion, with a velocity $v$, as a
mere mechanical consequence of the source motion. We illustrate here that two
such component waves generated in opposite directions and propagating at speed
$c$ between walls in a one-dimensional box, superpose into a traveling beat
wave of wavelength ${\mit\Lambda}_d$$=(\frac{v}{c}){\mit\Lambda}$ and phase
velocity $c^2/v+v$ which resembles directly L. de Broglie's hypothetic phase
wave. This phase wave in terms of transporting the particle mass at the speed
$v$ and angular frequency ${\mit\Omega}_d=2\pi v /{\mit\Lambda}_d$, with
${\mit\Lambda}_d$ and ${\mit\Omega}_d$ obeying the de Broglie relations,
represents a de Broglie wave. The standing-wave function of the de Broglie
(phase) wave and its variables for particle dynamics in small geometries are
equivalent to the eigen-state solutions to Schr\""odinger equation of an
identical system.

often fail to appreciate exactly how they use it. Math may be the language of
science, but math-in-physics is a distinct dialect of that language. Physicists
tend to blend conceptual physics with mathematical symbolism in a way that
profoundly affects the way equations are used and interpreted. Research with
university physics students in classes from algebra-based introductory physics
indicates that the gap between what students think they are supposed to be
doing and what their instructors expect them to do can cause severe problems.

ingredients that enable the emergence of relaxation-free and decoherence-free

interacts with a common reservoir and ii) when each resonator, strongly coupled
to each other, interacts with its own reservoir. Our main result is that both
subspaces are generated when all the resonators couple with the same group of
reservoir modes, thus building up a correlation (among these modes), which has
the potential to shield particular network states against relaxation and/or
decoherence.
