on the event 6 of 6.3 MeV and also on the other events that at 1 sigma fall
below the energy threshold: events 3,4,10,12. The volume distribution is not a
uniform distribution at 3 sigma, that suggests the presence of background
events close or at the border of the volume used for the analysis, including
the events 3,4,10. We checked the expected energy distribution assuming that
the signal is due to nubar(e)p-->e+n and that the average antineutrino energy
is 14 MeV. The agreement with the observations is not perfect but it is
acceptable at the 11 % confidence level if we include the peak of low energy
background events; otherwise, we face a 2.9 sigma problem. The expected energy
distribution implies that the evidence for supernova neutrinos is at 10 sigma
and that 1-3 background events are plausible. This conclusion does not change
strongly when we model the time distribution of the signal taking into account
the presence of an initial luminous phase of neutrino emission. This suggests
however that some of the early events are due to supernova neutrinos and not to
background. In summary, we formulate the hypothesis that some of the observed
low energy events are due to background and that some among them belong to a
peculiar phase of emission, that could be further characterized by low energy
neutrinos. Such an interpretation diminishes to a minimum the postulated number
of background events and thus improves the agreement between the a priori and
the a posteriori expectations on the number of background events. We argue on
these grounds that there is no significant disagreement between the average
energy of the supernova neutrinos seen in Kamiokande-II and the conventional
expectations.

presented and analyzed with a parameter-fitting eclipse model. The mass ratio
of TT Tri is poorly constrained, but must lie roughly in the range
0.3<q(=M_2/M_1)<0.9. Models characterized by mass ratios of q=0.3 (i=76.1 deg),
q=0.6 (i=72.6 deg), and q=0.9 (i=70.4 deg) were all capable of providing
acceptable fits to the data, although the best fits were achieved for mass
ratios near the upper end of the permitted range. The values of the remaining
fitting parameters were found to be insensitive to the adopted mass ratio and
rim thickness. The accretion disk was found to extend to ~50-60% of the
distance to the inner Lagrangian point in all models, but came closer to
reaching the tidal limit in the higher mass ratio models. The same behavior was
found for the radial temperature profile of the disk, which increased with mass
ratio, becoming more consistent with that expected for steady state accretion
in the q=0.6 and q=0.9 models. Models with a truncated inner disk (R_in>>R_1)
generally resulted in a higher white dwarf temperature, and a steepening of the
disk temperature profile, but were not required to achieve a viable
steady-state disk solution. No evidence was found for a luminous bright spot in
the system, which is not surprising given the lack of a pre-eclipse ""hump"" in
the light curve. A total of 22 eclipse timings were measured for the system,
which yielded an ephemeris for the times of mid-eclipse given by HJD =
2,453,618.953(3) + 0.1396369(4) E. A comparison of the observed brightness and
color at mid-eclipse with the photometric properties of the best-fitting model
suggests that TT Tri lies at a distance of ~400-500 pc. (abstract abridged)

Despite considerable theoretical work the precise details are still unknown, in
part because of the difficulty in directly observing nucleons that are
accelerated to TeV energies in, and affect the structure of, the SNR shocks.
However, for the last ten years, X-ray observatories ASCA, and more recently
Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Suzaku have made it possible to image the synchrotron
emission at keV energies produced by cosmic-ray electrons accelerated in the
SNR shocks. In this article, we describe a spatially-resolved spectroscopic
analysis of Chandra observations of the Galactic SNR Cassiopeia A to map the
cutoff frequencies of electrons accelerated in the forward shock. We set upper
limits on the electron diffusion coefficient and find locations where particles
appear to be accelerated nearly as fast as theoretically possible (the Bohm

enhanced angular momentum transport, in accretion disks is still an unsolved
problem. This is especially important for cold disk systems which are
practically neutral in charge and therefore turbulence can not be of
magnetohydrodynamic origin. While the flow must exhibit some instability and
then turbulence in support of the transfer of mass inward and angular momentum
outward, according to the linear perturbation theory, in absence of
magnetohydrodynamic effects, it should always be stable. We demonstrate that
the three-dimensional secondary disturbance to the primarily perturbed disk,
consisting of elliptical vortices, gives significantly large hydrodynamic
growth in such a system and hence may suggest a transition to an ultimately
turbulent state. This result is essentially applicable to accretion disks
around quiescent cataclysmic variables, in proto-planetary and star-forming
disks, the outer region of disks in active galactic nuclei, where the gas is
significantly cold and thus the magnetic Reynolds number is smaller than 10^4.

during inflation. Depending on the amount of inflation, this can lead to broken
statistical isotropy on the largest observable scales.

larger than 66 times the size of the protosolar nebula, at a 90% confidence
level, assuming 1 solar mass of protosolar material. The relevant size of the
nebula depends on its state of evolution at the time of radioactivity
injection. In one scenario, a collection of low-mass stars, including our sun,
formed in a group or cluster with an intermediate- to high-mass star that ended
its life as a supernova while our sun was still a protostar, a starless core,
or perhaps a diffuse cloud. Using recent observations of protostars to estimate
the size of the protosolar nebula constrains the distance of the supernova at
0.02 to 1.6 pc. The supernova distance limit is consistent with the scales of
low-mass stars formation around one or more massive stars, but it is closer
than expected were the sun formed in an isolated, solitary state. Consequently,
if any presolar radioactivities originated via supernova injection, we must
conclude that our sun was a member of such a group or cluster that has since
dispersed, and thus that solar system formation should be understood in this
context. In addition, we show that the timescale from explosion to the creation
of small bodies was on the order of 1.8 Myr (formal 90% confidence range of 0
to 2.2 Myr), and thus the temporal choreography from supernova ejecta to

strain is applied. The possible buckled configurations of a piece of film with
stripe geometry are investigated as a function of the compressive strain. It is
found that the stable configuration depends strongly on the applied strain and
the Poisson ratio of the film. Next, the film is considered to be attached to a

  For growth patterns at moderate to high undercooling and relatively large
anisotropy, the values of the tip radius and selection parameter plotted as a
function of the Peclet number fall approximately on single curves. Hence, it
may be argued that a parallel flow changes the selected tip radius and growth
velocity solely by modifying (increasing) the Peclet number. This has
interesting implications for the availability of current selection theories as
predictors of growth characteristics under flow.
  At smaller anisotropy, a modification of the morphology diagram in the plane
undercooling versus anisotropy is observed. The transition line from dendrites
to doublons is shifted in favour of dendritic patterns, which become faster
than doublons as the flow speed is increased, thus rendering the basin of
attraction of dendritic structures larger.
  For small anisotropy and Prandtl number, we find oscillations of the tip

decreasing the flow velocity, we observe a reduction in the amplitude of these

the induced structural changes. In addition, we have also investigated the
diffusion barriers for hydrogen to enter into nanotube interiors, both in the
presence and absence of topological defects. Even if nanotube interiors are
made accessible, the hydrogen uptake remains modest, i.e., less than 3.5 wt%.

ringing phase, presenting a systematic method for extraction of the quasinormal
mode frequencies and amplitudes and comparing our results against perturbation
theory.
  The amplitude of each mode depends exponentially on the starting time of the
quasinormal regime, which is not defined unambiguously. We show that this
time-shift problem can be circumvented by looking at appropriately chosen
relative mode amplitudes. From our simulations we extract the quasinormal
frequencies and the relative and absolute amplitudes of corotating and
counterrotating modes (including overtones in the corotating case). We study
the dependence of these amplitudes on the shape of the initial perturbation,
the angular dependence of the mode and the black hole spin, comparing against
results from perturbation theory in the so-called asymptotic approximation. We
also compare the quasinormal frequencies from our numerical simulations with
predictions from perturbation theory, finding excellent agreement. Finally we
study under what conditions the relative amplitude between given pairs of modes
gets maximally excited and present a quantitative analysis of rotational
mode-mode coupling. The main conclusions and techniques of our analysis are
quite general and, as such, should be of interest in the study of ringdown

(without unit) is developed. There are the notions of fibrations, homotopy (in
the sense of Karoubi), path spaces, Puppe sequences, etc. One introduces the
notion of a quasi-isomorphism (or weak equivalence) for rings and shows that -
similar to spaces - the derived category obtained by inverting the
quasi-isomorphisms is naturally left triangulated. Also, homology theories on
rings are studied. These must be homotopy invariant in the algebraic sense,
meet the Mayer-Vietoris property and plus some minor natural axioms. To any
functor X from rings to pointed simplicial sets a homology theory is associated
in a natural way. If X=GL and fibrations are the GL-fibrations, one recovers
Karoubi-Villamayor's functors KV_i, i>0. If X is Quillen's K-theory functor and
fibrations are the surjective homomorphisms, one recovers the (non-negative)
homotopy K-theory in the sense of Weibel. Technical tools we use are the
homotopy information for the category of simplicial functors on rings and the
Bousfield localization theory for model categories. The machinery developed in
the paper also allows to give another definition for the triangulated category

incorporating relativity and quantum theory, 2) Understanding the origin and
evolution of the Universe as well as explaining the smallness of the
cosmological constant.
  Several efforts have been made in the last few decades towards achieving
these goals with some successes and failures. The current best theory we have
for unification of all forces is Superstring/M Theory. However current evidence
suggests our Universe is flat and accelerating. A Universe with a positive
cosmological constant will have serious implications for string theory since
the S-Matrix cannot be well defined and Superstring/M Theory is only formulated
in flat Minkowski background. Holographic principle provides a way out as shown
by the AdS/CFT and dS/CFT correspondence, but it remains to be proved if it is
valid for our non-conformal, non-supersymmetric Universe. Aside from the issue
of defining M-Theory in a de Sitter background, why the cosmological constant
is so small remains puzzling and needs to be understood. The ``cosmological
constant problem'' has brought physics to a standstill towards any major

  Conventional big bang cosmology has not yet produced a satisfactory
explanation of the small value of the cosmological constant. An attempt by
SuperString/M Theory in this direction is given by the Ekpyrotic/Cyclic model.
  The aim of this review is not to introduce any new concepts not already
known, but give an overview of current state of affairs in high energy physics,
highlighting some successes and failures and making some few suggestions on
areas to focus to resolve some of these outstanding issues.

between covalent and ion-pair states. The surfaces are transformed to a
quasidiabatic representation. The collision problem is expanded in a set of
channels suitable for handling the system in the presence of electric and/or

Because of the large number of scattering channels involved, we propose and
make use of suitable approximations. To account for the hyperfine structure of
both collision partners in the short-range region we develop a
frame-transformation procedure which includes most of the hyperfine
Hamiltonian. Scattering cross sections on the order of $10^{-13}$ cm$^2$ are

spin orientation of the partners is completely disrupted during the collision.

to their excellent spectral purity are essential for interrogating atomic
frequency standards at the limit of quantum projection noise; otherwise
aliasing effects will dominate the frequency stability due to the periodic
sampling between successive interrogations of the atomic transition. For this
reason, UWA oscillators are now operational at NMI (Sydney), LNE-SYRTE (Paris),
the French Space Agency (CNES, Toulouse) and at UWA (Perth). Other
applications, which have attracted attention in recent years, include tests on
fundamental principles of physics, such as tests of Lorentz invariance. This
paper reports on the long-term operation and performance of such oscillators.
We compare the long-term drift of some different CSOs. The drift rates turn out
to be linear over many years and in the same direction. However, the magnitude
seems to vary by more than one order of magnitude between the oscillators,
