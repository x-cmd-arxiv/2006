absorption systems at z=1.04329, 1.95260, 1.96337, and 1.98691. The two highest
redshift systems, separated by about 2400 km/s, have been previously suspected
as kinematic features arising in the circumstellar wind around the progenitor
star. However, the high column densities of low-ionization species (including
possibly neutral hydrogen) in the blue-shifted system, are inconsistent with
the expected highly ionized state of the circumstellar wind from the massive
progenitor star, even prior to the GRB explosion. This conclusion is also
supported by the lack of detectable absorption from fine-structure transitions
of SiII and FeII. Instead we conclude that the two redshift systems are similar
to multiple DLAs found in QSO sight lines with a similar velocity separation
and chemical abundance of [Cr/Fe] and [Zn/Fe]. The absorption system at
z=1.96337 is likely an intervening low-mass galaxy, possibly related to the GRB
host as part of a forming large-scale structure.

decreases with decreasing z with gamma=0.74+-0.31 in the interval z=0.7-1.9. A

explored redshift range and turns into a flat evolution for z -> 0. The
stronger absorbers thin out faster (gamma=1.50+-0.45). The break in their
evolution predicted for z=1.5-1.7 cannot be seen down to z=0.7. On the other
hand, a comparison with values from the literature for the local number density
gives a hint that this break occurs at lower redshift. 2. The distribution of
the column densities of the absorbers is complete down to N_HI=10^12.90 cm^-2.
It can be approximated by a single power law with the exponent beta=1.60+-0.03

neutron stars is a key question that has drawn considerable attention over the
past few decades. Quark matter can comprise an arbitrary fraction of the star,
from 0 for a pure neutron star to 1 for a pure quark star, depending on the
equation of state of matter at high density. From an astrophysical viewpoint,
these two extreme cases are generally expected to manifest different
observational signatures. An intermediate fraction implies a hybrid star, where
the interior consists of mixed or homogeneous phases of quark and nuclear
matter, depending on surface and Coulomb energy costs, as well as other finite
size and screening effects. In this brief review article, we discuss what we
can deduce about quark matter in neutron stars in light of recent exciting
developments in neutron star observations. We state the theoretical ideas
underlying the equation of state of dense quark matter, including color
superconducting quark matter. We also highlight recent advances stemming from
re-examination of an old paradigm for the surface structure of quark stars and
discuss possible evolutionary scenarios from neutron stars to quark stars, with
emphasis on astrophysical observations.

the CTE loss is parametrized in terms of the location of the source on the CCD,
the source signal level within the measurement aperture, the background level,
and the time of observation. For spectroscopic data, it is found that one
additional parameter is needed to provide an adequate calibration of the CTE
loss, namely the signal in the point spread function located between the signal
extraction box and the read-out amplifier. The effect of the latter parameter
is significant for spectra taken using the G750L or G750M gratings of STIS. The
algorithms presented here correct flux calibration inaccuracies due to CTE
losses as large as 30% to within ~ 1.5% RMS throughout the wavelength range
covered by the STIS CCD modes. This uncertainty is similar to the Poisson noise
associated with a source detected at a signal level of about 2500 electrons per

loss and the centroid shift (both for imaging and spectroscopic modes), thus
enabling one to correct for both effects of imperfect charge transfer to STIS

the young (6-8 Myr), nearby (97 pc) compact cluster around eta Chamaeleontis to
search for stellar and sub-stellar companions. Given its youth and proximity,
any sub-stellar companions are expected to be luminous, especially in the near
infrared, and thus easier to detect next to their parent stars. Here, we
present VLT/NACO adaptive optics imaging with companion detection limits for 17
eta Cha cluster members, and follow-up VLT/ISAAC near-infrared spectroscopy for
companion candidates. The widest binary detected is ~0.2"", corresponding to the
projected separation 20 AU, despite our survey being sensitive down to
sub-stellar companions outside 0.3"", and planetary mass objects outside 0.5"".
This implies that the stellar companion probability outside 0.3"" and the brown
dwarf companion probability outside 0.5"" are less than 0.16 with 95%
confidence. We compare the wide binary frequency of eta Cha to that of the
similarly aged TW Hydrae association, and estimate the statistical likelihood
that the wide binary probability is equal in both groups to be < 2e-4. Even
though the eta Cha cluster is relatively dense, stellar encounters in its
present configuration cannot account for the relative deficit of wide binaries.
We thus conclude that the difference in wide binary probability in these two
groups provides strong evidence for multiplicity properties being dependent on
environment. In two appendices we derive the projected separation probability
distribution for binaries, used to constrain physical separations from observed
projected separations, and summarize statistical tools useful for multiplicity
studies.

Mpc/h. We use the relationship between color and group environment to test the
null hypothesis that only the group environment matters, searching for a
residual dependence of properties on the surrounding density. Generally, red
galaxies are slightly more clustered on small scales (about 100--300 kpc/h)
than the null hypothesis predicts, possibly indicating that substructure within
groups has some importance. At large scales (> 1 Mpc/h), the actual projected
correlation functions of galaxies are biased at less than the 5% level with
respect to the null hypothesis predictions. We exclude strongly the converse
null hypothesis, that only the surrounding density (on any scale) matters.
These results generally encourage the use of the halo model description of
galaxy bias, which models the galaxy distribution as a function of host halo
mass alone. We compare these results to proposed galaxy formation scenarios

that a planet can cause eccentricity growth in a disk region adjacent to the
planet's orbit, even if the planet's orbit is circular. Disk-planet
interactions lead to growth in a planet's orbital eccentricity. The orbital
eccentricities of a 2 Mjup and a 3 Mjup planet increase from 0 to 0.11 within
about 3000 orbits. Over a similar time period, the orbital eccentricity of a 1
Mjup planet grows from 0 to 0.02. For a case of a 1 Mjup planet with an initial
eccentricity of 0.01, the orbital eccentricity grows to 0.09 over 4000 orbits.
Radial migration is directed inwards, but slows considerably as a planet's
orbit becomes eccentric. If a planet's orbital eccentricity becomes
sufficiently large, e > ~0.2, migration can reverse and so be directed
outwards. The accretion rate towards a planet depends on both the disk and the
planet orbital eccentricity and is pulsed over the orbital period. Planet mass
growth rates increase with planet orbital eccentricity. For e~0.2 the mass
growth rate of a planet increases by approximately 30% above the value for e=0.
For e > ~0.1, most of the accretion within the planet's Roche lobe occurs when
the planet is near the apocenter. Similar accretion modulation occurs for flow
at the inner disk boundary which represents accretion toward the star.

of a molecular core. The mass of the envelope is ~0.6 Msun from the 350 um flux
density, while LTE mass of the core is ~3 Msun from moleuclar line
observations. Combining visibility data from the OVRO mm-array and the 45m
telescope, we found that the core has a radial density profile of
$\rho(r)\propto r^{-2}$ for 0.003 < r/pc < 0.08 region. Molecular line data
analysis revealed that the velocity width of the core gas increases
inward,while the outermost region maintains a velocity dispersion of a few
times of the ambient sound speed. The broadened velocity width can be
interpreted as infall. Thus, the collapse in GF9-2 is likely to be described by
an extension of the Larson-Penston solution for the period after formation of a
central star. We derived the current mass accretion rate of ~3E-05 Msun/year
from infall velocity of ~ 0.3 km/s at r~ 7000 AU. All results suggest that
GF9-2 core has been undergoing gravitational collapse for ~ 5000 years since
the formation of central protostar(s), and that the unstable state initiated
the collapse ~2E+05 years (the free-fall time) ago.

  Aims: We use the relation between mid IR and hard X-ray luminosities to
constrain AGN unification scenarios.
  Methods: With VISIR at the VLT, we have obtained the currently highest
angular resolution (0"".35 FWHM) narrow-band mid infrared images of the nuclei
of 8 nearby Seyfert galaxies. Combining these observations with X-ray data from
the literature we study the correlation between their mid IR and hard X-ray

  Results: We find that the rest frame 12.3 mircon (L_MIR) and 2-10 keV (L_X)
luminosities are correlated at a highly significant level. The best fit
power-law to our data is log L_MIR \propto (1.60 \pm 0.22) log L_X, showing a
much smaller dispersion than earlier studies.
  Conclusions: The similarity in the og L_MIR / log L_X ratio between Sy1s and
Sy2s even using high angular resolution MIR data implies that the similarity is
intrinsic to AGN and not caused by contamination from extra-nuclear emission.
This supports clumpy torus models. The exponent of the correlation constrains
the inner geometry of the torus.

variety of spectral shapes, shape evolutions, and spectral correlations between
flux and spectral peak, within bursts described by Borgonovo & Ryde, and among
bursts described by Amati/Ghirlanda. In our proposed model the spectral peak is
given by the photospheric emission from a relativistic outflow for which the
horizon length is much smaller than the radial width. The observed duration of
the thermal flash will be given by the radial light-crossing time. This then
gives that the typical emission site is at ~10e11 cm from the center, with a
Lorentz factor of ~300. This emission is accompanied by non-thermal emission
from dissipation locations outside the photosphere. The relative strength of
these two components depend on injection effects at the central engine leading
to varying relative location of the saturation and photospheric radii. The
total emission can then reproduce the observed variety. The spectral
correlations are found by assuming that the amount of energy dissipated depends
non-linearly on the averaged particle density. Beside the spectral correlations
this also gives a description of how the relative strength of the thermal
component varies with temperature within a burst.

(Ly$\alpha$) forest. Different from the first-year WMAP (WMAP1), WMAP3's
preference on the running of the scalar spectral index on the large scales is
now fairly independent of the low CMB multipoles $\ell$. A combination with the
galaxy power spectrum from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) prefers a
negative running to larger than 2$\sigma$, regardless the presence of low
$\ell$ CMB ($2\le \ell \le 23$) or not. On the other hand if we focus on the
Power Law $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with only six parameters (matter density
$\Omega_m h^2$, baryon density $\Omega_b h^2$, Hubble Constant $H_0$, optical
depth $\tau$, the spectral index, $n_s$, and the amplitude, $A_s$, of the
scalar perturbation spectrum) when we drop the low $\ell$ CMB contributions
WMAP3 is consistent with the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles scale-invariant
spectrum ($n_s=1$ and no tensor contributions) at $\sim 1\sigma$. When assuming
a simple power law primordial spectral index or a constant running, in case one
drops the low $\ell$ contributions ($2\le \ell \le 23$) WMAP3 is consistent
with the other observations better, such as the inferred value of $\sigma_8$.

analize how the (u - r) color index and the morphological type of galaxies (the
latter evaluated through the SDSS Eclass and FracDev parameters) are related to
the environment and to the luminosity of galaxies, in order to find hints that
can be related to the presence of a ''void'' galaxy population. Void galaxies
are identified through a highly selective criterion, which takes also into
account redshift and allows us to exclude from the sample all the galaxies that
are not really close to the center of underdense regions. We study the (u - r)
color distribution for galaxies in different luminosity bins, and we look for
correlations of color with the environment, the luminosity, and the
morphological type of the galaxies. We find that galaxies in underdense regions

The transition from overdense to underdense environments is smooth, the
fraction of late-type galaxies decreases while the fraction of early-type
galaxies increases smoothly from underdense to dense environments. We do not
find any sudden transition in the galaxy properties with density, which,
according to a suggestion by Peebles (2001), should mark the transition to a

the Fornax stars of different ages as selected from Colour-Magnitude Diagram
analysis. We have obtained accurate velocities and metallicities from spectra
in the CaII triplet wavelength region for 562 Red Giant Branch stars which have
velocities consistent with membership in Fornax dwarf spheroidal. We have found
evidence for the presence of at least three distinct stellar components: a
young population (few 100 Myr old) concentrated in the centre of the galaxy,
visible as a Main Sequence in the Colour-Magnitude Diagram; an intermediate age
population (2-8 Gyr old); and an ancient population (> 10Gyr),which are
distinguishable from each other kinematically, from the metallicity
distribution and in the spatial distribution of stars found in the

``metal rich'' stars ([Fe/H]> -1.3) show a less extended and more concentrated
spatial distribution, and display a colder kinematics than the ``metal poor''

fractions of the maximally random jammed (MRJ) states for space dimensions
$d=4$, 5 and 6 to be $\phi_{MRJ} \simeq 0.46$, 0.31 and 0.20, respectively. To
a good approximation, the MRJ density obeys the scaling form $\phi_{MRJ}=
c_1/2^d+(c_2 d)/2^d$, where $c_1=-2.72$ and $c_2=2.56$, which appears to be
consistent with high-dimensional asymptotic limit, albeit with different
coefficients. Calculations of the pair correlation function $g_{2}(r)$ and
structure factor $S(k)$ for these states show that short-range ordering
appreciably decreases with increasing dimension, consistent with a recently
proposed ``decorrelation principle,'' which, among othe things, states that
unconstrained correlations diminish as the dimension increases and vanish
entirely in the limit $d \to \infty$. As in three dimensions (where $\phi_{MRJ}
\simeq 0.64$), the packings show no signs of crystallization, are isostatic,
and have a power-law divergence in $g_{2}(r)$ at contact with power-law
exponent $\simeq 0.4$. Across dimensions, the cumulative number of neighbors
equals the kissing number of the conjectured densest packing close to where
$g_{2}(r)$ has its first minimum. We obtain estimates for the freezing and

networks, in which data are associated with deadlines and it is desired for
data to reach the sink(s) by their deadlines. To this end, existing real-time
data dissemination work have developed packet scheduling schemes that
prioritize packets according to their deadlines. In this paper, we first
demonstrate that not only the scheduling discipline but also the routing
protocol has a significant impact on the success of real-time sensor data
dissemination. We show that the shortest path routing using the minimum number
of hops leads to considerably better performance than Geographical Forwarding,
which has often been used in existing real-time data dissemination work. We
also observe that packet prioritization by itself is not enough for real-time
data dissemination, since many high priority packets may simultaneously contend
for network resources, deteriorating the network performance. Instead,
real-time packets could be judiciously delayed to avoid severe contention as
long as their deadlines can be met. Based on this observation, we propose a
Just-in-Time Scheduling (JiTS) algorithm for scheduling data transmissions to
alleviate the shortcomings of the existing solutions. We explore several
policies for non-uniformly delaying data at different intermediate nodes to
account for the higher expected contention as the packet gets closer to the
sink(s). By an extensive simulation study, we demonstrate that JiTS can
significantly improve the deadline miss ratio and packet drop ratio compared to
existing approaches in various situations. Notably, JiTS improves the
performance requiring neither lower layer support nor synchronization among the
sensor nodes.

We further show that when the channel is indecomposable, and has no intersymbol

over a network with colocated users, through an independent block Rayleigh
fading channel. The colocation nature of the users allows cooperation, which
increases the overall achievable rate, from the transmitter to the destined
user. The transmitter is ignorant of the fading coefficients, while receivers
have access to perfect channel state information (CSI). This gives rise to the
multi-layer broadcast approach used by the transmitter. The broadcast approach
allows, in our network setting, to improve the cooperation between the
colocated users. That is due to the nature of broadcasting, where the better
the channel quality, the more layers that can be decoded. The cooperation
between the users is performed over an additive white Gaussian channels (AWGN),
with a relaying power constraint, and unlimited bandwidth. Three commonly used
cooperation techniques are studied: amplify-forward (AF), compress-forward
(CF), and decode-forward (DF). These methods are extended using the broadcast
approach, for the case of relaxed decoding delay constraint. For this case a
separated processing of the layers, which includes multi-session cooperation is
shown to be beneficial. Further, closed form expressions for infinitely many AF
sessions and recursive expressions for the more complex CF are given. Numerical
results for the various cooperation strategies demonstrate the efficiency of
multi-session cooperation.

systematically understand a subset of lattice artifacts which pollute the
lattice correlation functions for a few processes of physical interest. Where
possible, we compare to existing lattice QCD calculations. In particular, we
extend the heavy baryon Lagrangian to the next order in partially quenched
chiral perturbation theory and use it to compute the masses of the lightest
spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 baryons to next-to-next-to leading order. We then
construct the twisted mass chiral Lagrangian for baryons and apply it to
compute the lattice spacing corrections to the baryon masses simulated with
twisted mass lattice QCD.
  We extend computations of the nucleon electromagnetic structure to account
for finite volume effects, as these observables are particularly sensitive to
the finite extent of the lattice. We resolve subtle peculiarities for lattice
QCD simulations of polarizabilities and we show that using background field
techniques, one can make predictions for the 4 spin-dependent nucleon
polarizabilities, quantities which are difficult to access experimentally.
  We then discuss the two-pion system in finite volume, determining the
exponentially small volume corrections necessary for lattice determinations of
the scattering parameters. We also determine the lattice spacing artifacts that
arise for a mixed-action lattice simulation of the two-pion system with
Ginsparg-Wilson valence quarks and staggered sea quarks. We show that the
isospin 2 scattering length has a near continuum like behavior, differing from
the chiral perturbation theory calculation by a computable difference.

data at three different centrality bins. Generally, a reasonable agreement

underestimate the elliptic flow. Around the same energy the slope of the

Since EH action is likely to just the first term in the derivative expansion of
an effective theory, it is interesting to ask whether these features continue
to hold for more general gravitational actions. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of lagrangians of the form L=Q_a^{bcd}R^a_{bcd}, in which Q_a^{bcd} is
a tensor with the symmetries of the curvature tensor, made from metric and
curvature tensor and satisfies the condition \nabla_cQ^{abcd}=0, and show that
they share these features. The Lanczos-Lovelock lagrangians are a subset of
these in which Q^{abcd} is a homogeneous function of the curvature tensor. They
are all holographic, in a specific sense of the term, and -- in all these cases
-- the surface term can be interpreted as the horizon entropy. The
thermodynamics route to gravity, in which the field equations are interpreted
as TdS=dE+pdV, seems to have greater degree of validity than the field
equations of Einstein gravity itself. The results suggest that the holographic
feature of EH action could also serve as a new symmetry principle in
constraining the semiclassical corrections to Einstein gravity. The

recoil when they suffer an impact by incident particles. Higher-dimensional
topological defects develop distinctive wave patterns propagating along their
worldvolume under similar circumstances. For 1-dimensional topological defects
(vortex lines), these wave patterns fail to decay in the asymptotic future: the
propagating wave eventually displaces the vortex line a finite distance away
from its original position (the distance is proportional to the transferred
momentum). The quantum version of this phenomenon, which we call ``local
recoil'', can be seen as a simple geometric manifestation of the absence of
spontaneous symmetry breaking in 1+1 dimensions. Analogously to soliton recoil,
local recoil of vortex lines is associated with infrared divergences in
perturbative expansions. In perturbative string theory, such divergences appear
in amplitudes for closed strings scattering off a static D1-brane. Through a
Dirac-Born-Infeld analysis, it is possible to resum these divergences in a way
that yields finite, momentum-conserving amplitudes.

quantum field theory known as Faddeev-Skyrme models. Mathematically one
considers minimizing an energy functional on homotopy classes of maps from
closed 3-manifolds into homogeneous spaces of compact Lie groups. The energy
minimizers known as Hopfions describe stable configurations of subatomic
particles such as protons and their strong interactions.
  In particular, we introduce novel Sobolev spaces suitable for our variational
problem and develop the notion of homotopy type for maps in such spaces that
generalizes homotopy for smooth and continuous maps. This notion is based on
defining a generalized Hopf invariant for Sobolev maps into homogeneous spaces
that was previously known only for maps into $S^2$. Since the spaces in
question are neither linear nor even convex we represent maps by gauge
potentials that form a linear space and reformulate the problem in terms of
these potentials. However, this representation of maps introduces some gauge
ambiguity into the picture and we work out 'gauge calculus' for the principal
bundles involved to apply the gauge-fixing techniques that eliminate the
ambiguity. These bundles arise as pullbacks of the structure bundles $H\hra
G\to G/H$ of homogeneous spaces and we study their topology and geometry that
are of independent interest.
  Our main results include proving existence of Hopfions as finite energy
Sobolev maps in each (generalized) homotopy class when the target space is a
symmetric space. For more general spaces we obtain a weaker result on existence
of minimizers only in each 2-homotopy class.

subject to diffusion. When this quantity is scalar it can be, for instance, the
temperature of the flow or the concentration of some pollutants. Because of the
diffusion term, one expects the equations to have a regularizing effect.
However, in their Euler form, the equations describe the evolution of the
quantity multiplied by the density of the flow. The parabolic structure is thus
degenerate near vacuum (when the density vanishes). In this paper we show that
we can nevertheless derive uniform $L^{p}$ bounds that do not depend on the
density (in particular the bounds do not degenerate near vacuum). Furthermore
the result holds even when the density is only a measure. We investigate both
the scalar and the system case. In the former case, we obtain $L^{\infty}$
bounds. In the latter case the quantity being investigated could be the
velocity field in compressible Navier-Stokes type of equations, and we derive
uniform $L^p$ bounds for some $p$ depending on the ratio between the two
viscosity coefficients (the main additional difficulty in that case being to
deal with the second viscosity term involving the divergence of the velocity).
Such estimates are, to our knowledge, new and interesting since they are
uniform with respect to the density. The proof relies mostly on a method
introduced by De Giorgi to obtain regularity results for elliptic equations
with discontinuous diffusion coefficients.

mechanical response of the protein shells of viruses have provided a
quantitative description of their strength and elasticity. To better understand

this paper adopts a course-grained modeling approach within the framework of
three-dimensional nonlinear continuum elasticity. Homogeneous, isotropic,
elastic, thick shell models are proposed for two capsids: the spherical Cowpea
Chlorotic Mottle Virus (CCMV), and the ellipsocylindrical bacteriophage $\phi

characterization of the effects of AFM tip geometry, capsid dimensions, and
capsid constitutive descriptions. The generally nonlinear force response of
capsids to indentation is shown to be insensitive to constitutive details, and
greatly influenced by geometry. Nonlinear stiffening and softening of the force
response is dependent on the AFM tip dimensions and shell thickness. Fits of
the models capture the roughly linear behavior observed in experimental
measurements and result in estimates of Young's moduli of $\approx$280--360 MPa
for CCMV and $\approx$4.5 GPa for $\phi 29$.

are examined with a three-dimensional coupled-mode model for wave propagation
over steep topography. Whereas the classical geometrical optics approximation
predicts an abrupt transition from complete transmission at small incidence
angles to no transmission at large angles, the full model predicts a more
gradual transition with partial reflection/transmission that is sensitive to
the canyon geometry and controlled by evanescent modes for small incidence
angles and relatively short waves. Model results for large incidence angles are
compared with data from directional wave buoys deployed around the rim and over
Scripps Canyon, near San Diego, California, during the Nearshore Canyon
Experiment (NCEX). Wave heights are observed to decay across the canyon by
about a factor 5 over a distance shorter than a wavelength. Yet, a spectral
refraction model predicts an even larger reduction by about a factor 10,
because low frequency components cannot cross the canyon in the geometrical
optics approximation. The coupled-mode model yields accurate results over and
behind the canyon. These results show that although most of the wave energy is
refractively trapped on the offshore rim of the canyon, a small fraction of the
wave energy 'tunnels' across the canyon. Simplifications of the model that
reduce it to the standard and modified mild slope equations also yield good
results, indicating that evanescent modes and high order bottom slope effects
are of minor importance for the energy transformation of waves propagating
across depth contours at large oblique angles.

while simultaneously discriminating their permeation over Na+ ions by more than
a factor of a thousand. Structural studies show bare K+ ions occupying the
narrowest channel regions in a state of high coordination by all 8 surrounding
oxygen ligands from the channel walls. As in most channels, the driving force
for selectivity occurs when one ion is preferentially stabilized or
destabilized by the channel compared to water. In the common view of mechanism,
made vivid by textbook graphics, the driving force for selectivity in K-
channels arises by a fit, whereby the channel induces K+ ions to leave water by
offering an environment like water for K+, in terms of both energy and local
structure. The implication that knowledge of local ion coordination in a liquid
environment translates to design parameters in a protein ion channel, producing
similar energetic stabilities, has gone unchallenged, presumably due in part to
lack of consensus regarding ion coordination structures in liquid water.
Growing evidence that smaller numbers and different arrangements of ligands
coordinate K+ ions in liquid water, however, raises new questions regarding
mechanism: how and why should ion coordination preferences change, and how does
that alter the current notions of ion selectivity? Our studies lead to a new
channelcentric paradigm for the mechanism of K+ ion channel selectivity.
Because the channel environment is not liquid-like, the channel necessarily
induces local structural changes in ion coordination preferences that enable
structural and energetic differentiation between ions.
