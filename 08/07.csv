galaxies are as luminous as the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), raising
immediate interest in their link to the formation of BCGs and galaxy clusters.
However, despite apparent similarities, the dominant fossil galaxies show
non-boxy isophotes, in contrast to the most luminous BCGs. This study suggests
that the structure of the brightest group galaxies produced in fossil groups
are systematically different to the majority of BCGs. If the fossils do indeed
form from the merger of major galaxies including late-types within a group,
then their disky nature is consistent with the results of recent numerical
simulations of semi-analytical models which suggest that gas rich mergers
result in disky isophote ellipticals.
  We show that fossils form a homogeneous population in which the velocity
dispersion of the fossil group is tightly correlated with the luminosity of the
dominant elliptical galaxy. This supports the scenario in which the giant
elliptical galaxies in fossils can grow to the size and luminosity of BCGs in a
group environment. However, the boxy structure of luminous BCGs indicate that
they are either not formed as fossils, or have undergone later gas-free mergers
within the cluster environment.

conventional superconductors, tunnelling spectroscopy has established that
pairing is mediated by bosonic modes (phonons); a peak in the second derivative
of tunnel current d2I/dV2 corresponds to each phonon mode . For
high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity, however, no boson
mediating electron pairing has been identified. One explanation could be that
electron pair formation and related electron-boson interactions are
heterogeneous at the atomic scale and therefore challenging to characterize.
However, with the latest advances in d2I/dV2 spectroscopy using scanning
tunnelling microscopy, it has become possible to study bosonic modes directly
at the atomic scale . Here we report d2I/dV2 imaging studies of the high-Tc
superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d. We find intense disorder of electron-boson
interaction energies at the nanometre scale, along with the expected
modulations in d2I/dV2 (refs 9,10). Changing the density of holes has minimal
effects on both the average mode energies and the modulations, indicating that
the bosonic modes are unrelated to electronic or magnetic structure. Instead,
the modes appear to be local lattice vibrations, as substitution of 18O for 16O
throughout the material reduces the average mode energy by approximately 6 per
cent - the expected effect of this isotope substitution on lattice vibration
frequencies. Significantly, the mode energies are always spatially
anticorrelated with the superconducting pairing-gap energies, suggesting an
interplay between these lattice vibration modes and the superconductivity.

priority indices (PI) are ""frozen in time"" (i.e. a task priority is assigned
once for all to each incoming task). Relaxing the ""frozen in time"" assumption,
this paper studies the new dynamic behavior expected when the priority of each

a QS with deadlines assigned to the incoming tasks which is operated under the

reveals a surprising, nonmonotonic dependence of the critical recovery rate on

positioning mechanism of mobile terminals which is based on the geometric
property of wireless node placement, and on the postulate of modern physics
that a propagation speed of information never exceeds the velocity of light. In
particular, they utilize the measurements of the round-trip time of radio
signal propagation and bidirectional communication for variants of the
challenge-and-response. In this paper, we propose a novel means to construct
the above mechanism by use of unidirectional communication instead of
bidirectional communication. Our proposal is based on the assumption that a
mobile terminal incorporates a high-precision inner clock in a tamper-resistant
protected area. In positioning, the mobile terminal uses its inner clock and
the time and location information broadcasted by radio from trusted stations.
Our proposal has a major advantage in protecting the location privacy of mobile
terminal users, because the mobile terminal need not provide any information to
the trusted stations through positioning procedures. Besides, our proposal is
free from the positioning error due to claimant's processing-time fluctuations
in the challenge-and-response, and is well-suited for mobile terminals in the
open air, or on the move at high speed, in terms of practical usage. We analyze
the security, the functionality, and the feasibility of our proposal in
comparison to previous proposals.

of a gauge theory in the presence of gauge bosons of vanishing momentum, in the

dimensionful parameter $\Lambda$ affecting only the on-shell prescription of
the free (abelian) gluon propagator. When summed to all orders in $g\Lambda$
the modification is equivalent to evaluating standard Green functions in a pure
gauge field with an imaginary gauge parameter $\propto \Lambda$. We show how to
calculate the corresponding dressed Green functions, which are Poincare and
gauge covariant. We evaluate the expressions for the dressed quark and $q \bar
q$ propagators, imposing as boundary condition that they approach the standard
perturbative form in the short-distance limit ($|p^2|\to\infty$). The on-shell
($p^2=m^2$) pole of the free quark propagator is removed for any $\Lambda > 0$,
and replaced by a discontinuity which vanishes exponentially with $p^2$. The
dressing introduces an effective interaction between quarks and antiquarks
which is enhanced at low relative 3-momentum. Further study should allow to
identify the (bound) eigenstates of propagation and determine whether they
define a unitary S-matrix. When the quark mass is zero there is a euclidean
propagator solution which breaks chiral symmetry spontaneously. We study some

feature non-standard Higgs sectors. These may introduce new sources of CP
violation, and there may be mixing between multiple Higgs bosons or other new

even be no Higgs at all. These non-standard Higgs scenarios have important
implications for collider physics as well as for cosmology, and understanding
their phenomenology is essential for a full comprehension of electroweak
symmetry breaking. This report discusses the most relevant theories which go
beyond the Standard Model and its minimal, CP-conserving supersymmetric
extension: two-Higgs-doublet models and minimal supersymmetric models with CP
violation, supersymmetric models with an extra singlet, models with extra gauge
groups or Higgs triplets, Little Higgs models, models in extra dimensions, and
models with technicolour or other new strong dynamics. For each of these
scenarios, this report presents an introduction to the phenomenology, followed
by contributions on more detailed theoretical aspects and studies of possible

respectively. By adjunction, they give rise to epistemic modalities, capturing

values obtained by generators of pseudo-random numbers. The basic idea is that
the H{\""o}lder exponent for a sufficiently long sequence of uncorrelated random
numbers has the fixed value $h=1/2$. The presence of long-range correlations
leads to deviation from this value. We calculate the H{\""o}lder exponent by the
method of multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA). We discuss
frequently used tests for randomness, finite sample properties of the MFDFA,
and the conditions for a correct application of the method. We observe that the
fluctuation function $F_{q}$ used in the MFDFA reacts to trends caused by low
periodicity presented in the pseudo-random number generator. In order to select
appropriate generators from the numerous programs we propose a test for the
ensemble properties of the generated pseudo-random sequences with respect to
their robustness against presence of long-range correlations, and a selection
rule which orders the generators that pass the test. Selecting generators that
successfully pass the ensemble test and have good performance with respect to
the selection rule is not enough. For the selected generator we have to choose
appropriate pseudo-random sequences for the length of the sequence required by
the solved problem. This choice is based on the closeness of the H{\""o}lder
exponent of the generated sequence to its value 1/2 characteristic for the case
of absence of correlations.

Prisoner's Dilemma game. This paper is an extension of the investigation
presented in a recent paper [Eriksson and Lindgren (2005), J. Theor. Biol.
232(3), 399]. One of the main results of the previous study is that there are
modes of dynamic behaviour, such as limit cycles and fixed points, that are
maintained due to a non-zero mutation level, resulting in a significantly
higher level of cooperation than was reported in earlier studies. In the
present study, we investigate two mechanisms in the evolutionary dynamics for
finite populations: (i) a stochastic model of the mutation process, and (ii) a
stochastic model of the selection process. The most evident effect comes from
the second extension, where we find that a previously stable limit cycle is
replaced by a trajectory that to a large extent is close to a fixed point that
is stable in the deterministic model. The effect is strong even when population
size is as large as 10,000. The effect of the first mechanism is less
pronounced, and an argument for this difference is given.

Phys. B 86, 371 (2007)","10.1007/s00340-006-2515-4",,"quant-ph",,"  Starting from the observation that reversible processes cannot increase the
purity of any input state, we study deterministic physical processes, which map
a set of states to a set of pure states. Such a process must map any state to
the same pure output, if purity is demanded for the input set of all states.
But otherwise, when the input set is restricted, it is possible to find
non-trivial purifying processes. For the most restricted case of only two input
states, we completely characterize the output of any such map. We furthermore
consider maps, which combine the property of purity and reversibility on a set
of states, and we derive necessary and sufficient conditions on sets, which
permit such processes.

demonstrate inseparability of W-type N-partite entangled states containing only
a single photon. First, we show that the pairwise entanglement of arbitrary two
modes chosen from N optical modes can be detected using the method proposed by
Nha and Kim [Phys. Rev. A 74, 012317 (2006)], thereby suggesting the full
inseparability among N parties. In particular, this scheme is found to succeed
for any nonzero quantum efficiency of photodetectors. Second, we consider a
quantum teleportation network using linear optics without auxiliary modes. The
conditional teleportation can be optimized by a suitable choice of the
transmittance of the beam splitter in the Bell measurement. Specifically, we
identify the conditions under which maximum fidelity larger than classical
bound 2/3 is achieved only in cooperation with other parties. We also
investigate the case of on-off photodetectors that cannot discriminate the
number of detected photons.

superselection rules (SSRs): that which applies when the parties (Alice and
Bob) cannot distinguish among certain quantum objects they have. This arises
naturally in the context of ensemble quantum information processing such as in
liquid NMR. We discuss how a SSR for the symmetric group can be applied, and
show how the extractable entanglement can be calculated analytically in certain
cases, with a maximum bipartite entanglement in an ensemble of N Bell-state
pairs scaling as log(N) as N goes to infinity . We discuss the apparent
disparity with the asymptotic (N >> 1) recovery of unconstrained entanglement
for other sorts of superselection rules, and show that the disparity disappears
when the correct notion of applying the symmetric group SSR to multiple copies
is used. Next we discuss reference frames in the context of this SSR, showing
the relation to the work of von Korff and Kempe [Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 260502
(2004)]. The action of a reference frame can be regarded as the analog of
activation in mixed-state entanglement. We also discuss the analog of
distillation: there exist states such that one copy can act as an imperfect
reference frame for another copy. Finally we present an example of a stronger
operational constraint, that operations must be non-collective as well as
symmetric. Even under this stronger constraint we nevertheless show that
Bell-nonlocality (and hence entanglement) can be demonstrated for an ensemble
of N Bell-state pairs no matter how large N is. This last work is a
generalization of that of Mermin [Phys. Rev. D 22, 356 (1980)].

renormalization group method in a family of generic quantum spin chains which
undergo a transition from integrable to non-integrable - quantum chaotic case

in terms of matrix-product-operators with rank D_\epsilon(t), such that
evolution of a long chain is accurate within fidelity error \epsilon up to time

\exp(const t), unless the system is integrable in which case we find polynomial

local properties of the detectors are known. We derive a general threshold for
the detector efficiencies which guarantees that a negative expectation value of

threshold depends on the local decomposition of the witness and its measured
expectation value. For two-qubit witnesses we find the local operator
decomposition that is optimal with respect to closing the loophole.

corresponding to slightly different Hamiltonian parameters. The Hamiltonians
under investigation can be considered as the variable range generalization of
the fermionic Hamiltonian obtained by the Jordan-Wigner transformation of the
XY spin-chain in a transverse magnetic field. Under periodic boundary
conditions, the matrices of the problem become circulant and the models are
exactly solvable. Their free-ends counterparts are instead analyzed
numerically. In particular, we focus on the long range model corresponding to a
fully connected directed graph, providing asymptotic results in the
thermodynamic limit, as well as the finite-size scaling analysis of the second
order quantum phase transitions of the system. A strict relation between
fidelity and single particle spectrum is demonstrated, and a peculiar gapful
transition due to the long range nature of the coupling is found. A comparison
between fidelity and another transition marker borrowed from quantum
information i.e., single site entanglement, is also considered.
