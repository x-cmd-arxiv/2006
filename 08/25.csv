We find in this paper, however, that even if steepness is fixed, time delays
can still have significant model dependence, which we attribute to shape
modeling degeneracies. This conclusion follows from numerical experiments with
models of 35 galaxy lenses. We suggest that varying and twisting ellipticities,
features that are explored by pixelated lens models but not so far by

conditions of supernova ejecta to observable spectra are required for the
quantitative interpretation of observational data of type Ia supernovae (SN Ia)
and the assessment of the physical merits of theoretical supernova explosion
models. The numerical treatment of the radiation transport - yielding the
synthetic spectra - in models of SN Ia ejecta in early phases is usually
carried out in analogy to atmospheric models of `normal' hot stars. Applying
this analogy indiscriminately leads to inconsistencies in SN Ia models because
a diffusive lower boundary, while justified for hot stars, is invalid for
hydrogen and helium-deficient supernova ejecta. In type Ia supernovae the
radiation field does not thermalize even at large depths, and large optical
depths are not reached at all wavelengths. We derive an improved description of
the lower boundary that allows a more consistent solution of the radiation
transfer in SN Ia and therefore yields more realistic synthetic spectra. We
analyze the conditions that lead to a breakdown of the conventional diffusion
approximation as the lower boundary in SN Ia. For the radiative transfer, we
use a full non-LTE code originally developed for radiatively driven winds of
hot stars, with adaptations for the physical conditions in SN Ia. In addition
to a well-tested treatment of the underlying microphysical processes, this code
allows a direct comparison of the results for SN Ia and hot stars. We develop a
semi-analytical description that allows us to overcome some of the limiting
assumptions in the conventional treatment of the lower boundary in SN Ia
radiative transfer models. We achieve good agreement in a comparison between
the synthetic spectrum of our test model and an observed spectrum.

because it displays signatures of recent circumnuclear star formation and a
high-level of X-ray activity, in addition to the classical spectral
characteristics typical of an AGN. The NIR nuclear spectrum, which covers the
interval 0.8-2.4 microns, is dominated by HI and HeI recombination lines as
well a [SII], [SIII] and [Fe II] forbidden lines. Coronal lines of [SVIII],
[SIX], [SiVI], [SiX], and [CaVIII] in addition to molecular H_2 lines are also
detected. An estimate of the contribution of the stellar population to the
continuum is made by means of the ^{12}CO(6-3) 1.618 microns overtone bandhead.
It was found that 83% of the H-band continuum is of stellar origin. It improves
previous estimates, which claimed that at least 50% of the observed continuum
was attributed to the AGN. The analysis of the emission line profiles, both
allowed and forbidden, shows a narrower line on top of a broad blue-shifted
component. The latter seems to be associated to a nuclear outflow. This result
does not required the presence of a hidden BLR claimed to be present in
previous NIR observations of this object. Internal extinction, calculated by
means of several indicators including [FeII] flux ratios not previously used
before in AGNs, reveals a dusty AGN, while the extended regions are little or
not affected by dust. Density and temperature for the NLR are calculated using
optical and NIR lines diagnostic ratios. The results show temperatures from
10000K up to 40000K and densities between 10^3-10^5 cm^{-3}. The larger
temperatures points out that shocks must contribute to the line emission.

provide evidence for the existence of particle dark matter. White dwarfs seem
to be the most promising candidates to look for. The signature of a white dwarf
burning WIMPs would be a very hot star with mass and radius characteristic for

to compare predictions for the galaxy mass-metallicity (M*-Z) relation versus
observations at z~2 from Erb et al. (2006). With no outflows, galaxies are
over-enriched, indicating that outflows are required not only to suppress star
formation and enrich the IGM but also to lower galaxy metal content. The
observed M*-Z slope is matched both in our model without winds as well as our
favored outflow model where the outflow velocity scales as the escape velocity,
but is too steep in a model with constant outflow speeds. If outflows are too
widespread at early times, the IGM out of which smaller galaxies form can
become pre-polluted, resulting in a low-mass flattening of the M*-Z relation
that is inconsistent with data. Remarkably, the same momentum-driven wind model
that provides the best agreement with IGM enrichment data also yields the best
agreement with the z~2 M*-Z relation, showing the proper outflow scaling and
strength to match the observed slope and amplitude. In this model, the M*-Z
relation evolves slowly from z=6-2; an (admittedly uncertain) extrapolation to
z=0 broadly matches local M*-Z observations. Overall, the M*-Z relation
provides critical constraints on galactic outflow processes during the heydey

most promising scenario, the neutrino-driven winds from a nascent neutron star,
encounters severe difficulties in obtaining requisite entropy and short dynamic
timescale for the r-process. In this study, the effect of anisotropy in
neutrino emission from a proto-neutron star surface is examined with
semi-analytic neutrino-driven wind models. The increase of neutrino number
density in the wind owing to the anisotropy is modeled schematically by
enhancing the effective neutrino luminosity. It is shown that the neutrino
heating rate from neutrino-antineutrino pair annihilation into
electron-positron pairs can significantly increase owing to the anisotropy and
play a dominant role for the heating of wind material. A factor of five
increase in the effective neutrino luminosity results in 50% higher entropy and
a factor of ten shorter dynamic timescale owing to this enhanced neutrino
heating. The nucleosynthesis calculations show that this change is enough for
the robust r-process, producing the third abundance peak A = 195 and beyond.
Future multi-dimensional studies with accurate neutrino transport will be
needed if such anisotropy relevant for the current scenario (more than a factor
of a few) is realized during the wind phase (~1-10 s).

2004. The neutron star in this 2.46 hr binary has the most rapid spin of the
accreting pulsars at 599 Hz. The most recently-discovered pulsar, HETE
J1900.1-2455 (377 Hz), has an intermediate orbital period of 83.3 min, and has
been active for more than 1 yr, much longer than the typical transient
outburst. Pulsations were detected only in the first few months of the
outburst; this source has since resembled a faint, persistent non-pulsing
low-mass X-ray binary, typical of the broader low-mass X-ray binary population.

Together with the multi-epoch spectroscopic and photometric data compiled for a
large sample of these stars and ages estimated for individual stars by using
pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks, we have studied the evolution of
emission line activity in them. We find that, on average, the H_alpha emission
line strength decreases with increasing stellar age in HAeBe stars, indicating
that the accretion activity gradually declines during the PMS phase. This would
hint at a relatively long-lived (a few Myr) process being responsible for the
cessation of accretion in Herbig Ae/Be stars. We also find that the accretion
activity in these stars drops substantially by ~ 3 Myr. This is comparable to
the timescale in which most intermediate mass stars are thought to lose their
inner disks, suggesting that inner disks in intermediate mass stars are
dissipated rapidly after the accretion activity has fallen below a certain
level. We, further find a relatively tight correlation between strength of the
emission line and near-infrared excess due to inner disks in HAeBe stars,
indicating that the disks around Herbig Ae/Be stars cannot be entirely passive.
We suggest that this correlation can be understood within the frame work of the
puffed-up inner rim disk models if the radiation from the accretion shock is
also responsible for the disk heating.

transformed from a hot post-AGB star to a very luminous cool supergiant.
Theoretically, this evolution has been associated with the reignition of a
helium-shell during the post-AGB stage. A series of studies of the chemical
composition of the photosphere have suggested that this evolution has been
associated with a dramatic increase of approximately 3 dex in the abundances of
s-process elements between about 1960 and 1995. The problem with this apparent
change is that it occurred at a time when the surface convection zone, which is
governed by the star's effective temperature, could not have developed
sufficiently to dredge processed material from the stellar interior to the
surface. We have reviewed the chemical evolution of FG Sge by means of
modelling the time-varying spectrum under a range of assumptions. By comparing
these models with published observational data, a self-consistent picture has
emerged. In particular we find that surface hydrogen has been depleted during
the interval in question. In contrast, the s-process abundances have generally
maintained a steady enhancement of around 1 - 2 dex, although some modest
changes may have occurred since 1950. This implies that FG Sge has not just
completed dredging up freshly-produced s-process isotopes. However, there
remains a contradiction between the observed hydrogen-depletion, the age of the
associated planetary nebula, and current evolutionary models for a pre-white
dwarf suffering a late thermal pulse.

Hyperaccreting stellar-mass BHs are widely considered as energy sources that

with the same temperature and surface area, we confirm previous results that
compared to Newtonian calculations, GR effects increase the annihilation rate
measured by an observer at infinity by a factor of 2 when the neutrinosphere is
a disk. However, in case of a torus and a sphere the influence of GR effects is
globally only ~25%, although locally it can be significantly larger.
Independent of whether GR effects are included, disks yield the highest energy
deposition rates, followed by tori and, with the lowest rates, spheres. For
disks and tori, increasing the angular momentum of the BH from 0 to 1 enhances
the energy deposition rate measured by an observer at infinity by roughly a
factor of 2 due to the shrinking inner radius of the neutrinosphere. (abridged)

calculations were made with the GALFORM code, which tracks the evolution of the
disc and bulge components of a galaxy, using a self-consistent model to compute
the scalelengths. The sizes of galactic discs are determined by the
conservation of the angular momentum of cooling gas. The sizes of merger
remnants are computed by applying the virial theorem and conserving the binding
energy of the progenitors and their orbital energy. We compare the model
predictions with observational results derived from the SDSS. The model enjoys
a number of notable successes, such as giving reasonable reproductions of the
local Faber-Jackson relation, the velocity dispersion-age relation, and the
fundamental plane relating the luminosity, velocity dispersion and effective
radius of spheroids. These achievements are all the more remarkable when one
bears in mind that none of the parameters have been adjusted to refine the
model predictions. We study how the residuals around the fundamental plane
relation depend on galaxy properties. We examine in detail the physical
ingredients of the calculation of galaxy sizes. We also study the evolution of
the scaling relations with redshift. However, there are some important
disagreements between the predictions of the model and observations: the
brightest model spheroids have effective radii smaller than observed and the
zero-point of the fundamental plane shows little or no evolution with redshift
in the model.

and time-independent physical conditions explain the many observed molecular
abundances in astrophysical sources, it is crucial to estimate the
uncertainties in the calculated abundances and compare them with the observed
abundances and their uncertainties. Non linear amplification of the error and
bifurcation may limit the applicability of chemical models. Here we study such
effects on dense cloud chemistry. Method: Using a previously studied approach
to uncertainties based on the representation of rate coefficient errors as log
normal distributions, we attempted to apply our approach using as input a
variety of different elemental abundances from those studied previously. In
this approach, all rate coefficients are varied randomly within their log
normal (Gaussian) distribution, and the time-dependent chemistry calculated
anew many times so as to obtain good statistics for the uncertainties in the
calculated abundances. Results: Starting with so-called ``high-metal''
elemental abundances, we found bimodal rather than Gaussian like distributions
for the abundances of many species and traced these strange distributions to an
extreme sensitivity of the system to changes in the ratio of the cosmic ray
ionization rate zeta\_He for He and that for molecular hydrogen zeta\_H2. The
sensitivity can be so extreme as to cause a region of bistability, which was
subsequently found to be more extensive for another choice of elemental
abundances. To the best of our knowledge, the bistable solutions found in this
way are the same as found previously by other authors, but it is best to think
of the ratio zeta\_He/zeta\_H2 as a control parameter perpendicular to the
''standard'' control parameter zeta/n\_H.

$L$ are substantially above the $L$ an advection-dominated accretion flow
(ADAF) can produce, $\sim 0.4\alpha^2 L_{\rm E}$, which is only $\sim
(3$--$4)%L_{\rm E}$ even for $\alpha$ as high as 0.3. On the other hand, we
successfully explain the hard states with $L\sim (4$--$10)%$ using the luminous
hot accretion flow (LHAF) model. As $10%L_{\rm E}$ is also roughly the highest
luminosity an LHAF can produce, such an agreement between the predicted and
observed highest luminosities provides by itself strong support for this model.
Then, we study multi-waveband spectral variability during the 2000 outburst. In
addition to the primary maxima in the optical light curves, secondary maxima
were detected after the transition from the very high state to the hard state.
We show that the secondary maxima are well modeled by synchrotron emission from
a jet formed during the state transition. We argue that the absence of the
corresponding secondary peak in the X-ray light curve indicates that the X-ray
jet emission, regardless of its radiative process, synchrotron or its
Comptonization, is not important in the hard state compared to the emission
from the accretion flow.

  Hebrew university, Aug. 2005",,,"TR-2005-84","cs.DC",,"  The ``Pulse Synchronization'' problem can be loosely described as targeting
to invoke a recurring distributed event as simultaneously as possible at the
different nodes and with a frequency that is as regular as possible. This
target becomes surprisingly subtle and difficult to achieve when facing both
transient and permanent failures. In this paper we present an algorithm for
pulse synchronization that self-stabilizes while at the same time tolerating a
permanent presence of Byzantine faults. The Byzantine nodes might incessantly
try to de-synchronize the correct nodes. Transient failures might throw the
system into an arbitrary state in which correct nodes have no common notion
what-so-ever, such as time or round numbers, and can thus not infer anything
from their own local states upon the state of other correct nodes. The
presented algorithm grants nodes the ability to infer that eventually all
correct nodes will invoke their pulses within a very short time interval of
each other and will do so regularly.
  Pulse synchronization has previously been shown to be a powerful tool for
designing general self-stabilizing Byzantine algorithms and is hitherto the
only method that provides for the general design of efficient practical
protocols in the confluence of these two fault models. The difficulty, in
general, to design any algorithm in this fault model may be indicated by the
remarkably few algorithms resilient to both fault models. The few published
self-stabilizing Byzantine algorithms are typically complicated and sometimes
converge from an arbitrary initial state only after exponential or super
exponential time.

  Our method is to assign algorithmic probabilities to the different computers
themselves, based on the idea that ""unnatural"" computers should be hard to

would give a natural and machine-independent probability measure on the
computers, and also on the binary strings.

all computers; thus, this method cannot eliminate machine-dependence. Moreover,
we show that the reason for failure has a clear and interesting physical
interpretation, suggesting that every other conceivable attempt to get rid of

get rid of some amount of machine-dependence in some situations, and the

  Systems (OPODIS'03 La Martinique, France), December, 2003",,,"cs.DC",,"  Clock synchronization is a very fundamental task in distributed system. It
thus makes sense to require an underlying clock synchronization mechanism to be
highly fault-tolerant. A self-stabilizing algorithm seeks to attain
synchronization once lost; a Byzantine algorithm assumes synchronization is
never lost and focuses on containing the influence of the permanent presence of
faulty nodes. There are efficient self-stabilizing solutions for clock
synchronization as well as efficient solutions that are resilient to Byzantine
faults. In contrast, to the best of our knowledge there is no practical
solution that is self-stabilizing while tolerating the permanent presence of
Byzantine nodes. We present the first linear-time self-stabilizing Byzantine
clock synchronization algorithm. Our deterministic clock synchronization
algorithm is based on the observation that all clock synchronization algorithms
require events for exchanging clock values and re-synchronizing the clocks to
within safe bounds. These events usually need to happen synchronously at the
different nodes. In classic Byzantine algorithms this is fulfilled or aided by
having the clocks initially close to each other and thus the actual clock
values can be used for synchronizing the events. This implies that clock values
cannot differ arbitrarily, which necessarily renders these solutions to be
non-stabilizing. Our scheme suggests using an underlying distributed pulse
synchronization module that is uncorrelated to the clock values.

logic program whose answer sets correspond to the solutions of the problem, and
by (ii) computing the answer sets of the program using an answer set solver as
a search engine. Typically, a programmer creates a series of gradually
improving logic programs for a particular problem when optimizing program
length and execution time on a particular solver. This leads the programmer to
a meta-level problem of ensuring that the programs are equivalent, i.e., they
give rise to the same answer sets. To ease answer set programming at
methodological level, we propose a translation-based method for verifying the
equivalence of logic programs. The basic idea is to translate logic programs P
and Q under consideration into a single logic program EQT(P,Q) whose answer
sets (if such exist) yield counter-examples to the equivalence of P and Q. The
method is developed here in a slightly more general setting by taking the
visibility of atoms properly into account when comparing answer sets. The
translation-based approach presented in the paper has been implemented as a
translator called lpeq that enables the verification of weak equivalence within
the smodels system using the same search engine as for the search of models.
Our experiments with lpeq and smodels suggest that establishing the equivalence
of logic programs in this way is in certain cases much faster than naive
cross-checking of answer sets.

method for measuring relational similarity. LRA has potential applications in
many areas, including information extraction, word sense disambiguation, and
information retrieval. Recently the Vector Space Model (VSM) of information
retrieval has been adapted to measuring relational similarity, achieving a
score of 47% on a collection of 374 college-level multiple-choice word analogy
questions. In the VSM approach, the relation between a pair of words is
characterized by a vector of frequencies of predefined patterns in a large
corpus. LRA extends the VSM approach in three ways: (1) the patterns are
derived automatically from the corpus, (2) the Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) is used to smooth the frequency data, and (3) automatically generated
synonyms are used to explore variations of the word pairs. LRA achieves 56% on
the 374 analogy questions, statistically equivalent to the average human score
of 57%. On the related problem of classifying semantic relations, LRA achieves
similar gains over the VSM.

never-decreasing function along outgoing null geodesic flow). We are able to
define such a ""c-function"", that we call \tilde{C}, for general theories of
gravity. It has the nontrivial property of being well defined on general
spacelike surfaces, rather than just on a spatial cross-section of a black hole
horizon. We argue that \tilde{C} is a suitable generalization of the notion of
""area"" in any extension of the holographic bound for general theories of
gravity. Such a function is provided by an algorithm which is similar (although
not identical) to that used by Iyer and Wald to define the entropy of a
dynamical black hole. In a class of higher curvature gravity theories that we
analyze in detail, we are able to prove the monotonicity of \tilde{C} if
several physical requirements are satisfied. Apart from the usual ones, these
include the cancellation of ghosts in the spectrum of the gravitational
Lagrangian. Finally, we point out that our \tilde{C}-function, when evaluated
on a black hole horizon, constitutes by itself an alternative candidate for
defining the entropy of a dynamical black hole.

can lead to an exit from a scaling matter-dominated epoch to a late-time
accelerated expansion, which is attractive to alleviate the coincident problem
of dark energy. We derive the condition for the existence of cosmological
scaling solutions in the presence of the GB coupling for a general scalar-field
Lagrangian density $p(\phi, X)$, where $X=-(1/2)(\nabla \phi)^2$ is a kinematic
term of the scalar field. The GB coupling and the Lagrangian density are
restricted to be in the form $f(\phi) \propto e^{\lambda \phi}$ and $p=Xg
(Xe^{\lambda \phi})$, respectively, where $\lambda$ is a constant and $g$ is an
arbitrary function. We also derive fixed points for such a scaling Lagrangian
with a GB coupling $f(\phi) \propto e^{\mu \phi}$ and clarify the conditions
under which the scaling matter era is followed by a de-Sitter solution which
can appear in the presence of the GB coupling. Among scaling models proposed in
the current literature, we find that the models which allow such a cosmological
evolution are an ordinary scalar field with an exponential potential and a
tachyon field with an inverse square potential, although the latter requires a
coupling between dark energy and dark matter.

Yang-Mills theory, and of QCD with a single fermion in the antisymmetric (or
symmetric) tensor representation, are equivalent in the $N\to\infty$ limit. If
true, this correspondence can provide useful insight into properties of real
QCD (with fundamental representation fermions), such as predictions [with
O(1/N) corrections] for the non-perturbative vacuum energy, the chiral
condensate, and a variety of other observables. Several papers asserting to
have proven this large N ``orientifold equivalence'' have appeared. By
considering theories compactified on $R^3 \times S^1$, we show explicitly that
this large N equivalence fails for sufficiently small radius, where our
analysis is reliable, due to spontaneous symmetry breaking of charge
conjugation symmetry in QCD with an antisymmetric (or symmetric) tensor
representation fermion. This theory is also chirally symmetric for small
radius, unlike super-Yang-Mills. The situation is completely analogous to
large-N equivalences based on orbifold projections: simple symmetry realization
conditions are both necessary and sufficient for the validity of the large N
equivalence. Whether these symmetry realization conditions are satisfied
depends on the specific non-perturbative dynamics of the theory under
consideration. Unbroken charge conjugation symmetry is necessary for validity
of the large N orientifold equivalence. Whether or not this condition is
satisfied on $R^4$ (or $ R^3 \times S^1$ for sufficiently large radius) is not
currently known.

  Testing",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH",,"  Methods based on hypothesis tests (HTs) in the Haar domain are widely used to
denoise Poisson count data. Facing large datasets or real-time applications,
Haar-based denoisers have to use the decimated transform to meet limited-memory
or computation-time constraints. Unfortunately, for regular underlying
intensities, decimation yields discontinuous estimates and strong ""staircase""
artifacts. In this paper, we propose to combine the HT framework with the
decimated biorthogonal Haar (Bi-Haar) transform instead of the classical Haar.
The Bi-Haar filter bank is normalized such that the p-values of Bi-Haar
coefficients (pBH) provide good approximation to those of Haar (pH) for
high-intensity settings or large scales; for low-intensity settings and small
scales, we show that pBH are essentially upper-bounded by pH. Thus, we may
apply the Haar-based HTs to Bi-Haar coefficients to control a prefixed false
positive rate. By doing so, we benefit from the regular Bi-Haar filter bank to
gain a smooth estimate while always maintaining a low computational complexity.
A Fisher-approximation-based threshold imple- menting the HTs is also
established. The efficiency of this method is illustrated on an example of
hyperspectral-source-flux estimation.

calculations for a single and arrays of sub-wavelength cylindrical holes in
metallic films presenting large transmission. These calculations are in
excellent agreement with experimental measurements. This effect has to be
understood in terms of the properties exhibited by the dielectric constant of
metals which cannot be treated as ideal metals for the purpose of transmission
and diffraction of light. We discuss the cases of well-differentiated metals
silver and tungsten. It is found that the effect of surface plasmons or other
surface wave excitations due to a periodical set of holes or other roughness at
the surface is marginal. The effect can enhance but also can depress the
transmission of the arrays as shown by theory and experiments. The peak
structure observed in experiments is a consequence of the interference of the
wavefronts transmitted by each hole and is determined by the surface array
period independently of the material. Without large transmission through a
single hole there is no large transmission through the array. We found that in
the case of Ag which at the discussed frequencies is a metal there are
cylindrical plasmons at the wall of the hole, as reported by Economu et al 30
years ago, that enhanced the transmission. But it turns out, as will be
explained, that for the case of W which behaves as a dielectric, there is also
a large transmission when compared with that of an ideal metal waveguide. To
deal with this problem one has to use the measured dielectric function of the
metals. We discuss thoroughly all these cases and compare with the data.

presents a complete explanation for his anomalous result by: a) showing that
his results are not statistically significant, b) describing in detail how
flaws in his analysis procedure produced a false signal with precisely the
properties he expected, and c) presenting a quantitative model of his
systematic drift that shows there is no real signal in his data. In short, this
is every experimenter's nightmare: he was unknowingly looking at statistically
insignificant patterns in his systematic drift that mimicked the appearance of
a real signal. An upper limit on ""absolute motion"" of 6 km/sec is derived from
his raw data, fully consistent with similar experimental results and the
prediction of Special Relativity. The key point of this paper is the need for a
comprehensive and quantitative error analysis. The concepts and techniques used
in this analysis were not available in Miller's day, but are now standard.
These problems also apply to the famous measurements of Michelson and Morley,

  protein folding",,,,,"physics.bio-ph physics.comp-ph",,"  A kinetic model for the nucleation mechanism of protein folding is proposed.
A protein is modeled as a heteropolymer consisting of hydrophobic and
hydrophilic beads with equal constant bond lengths and bond angles. The total
energy of the heteropolymer is determined by the repulsive/attractive
interactions of non-linked beads and the contribution from the dihedral angles
involved. Their parameters can be rigorously defined, unlike the ill defined
surface tension of a cluster of protein residues which is the basis of the
previous model. As a crucial idea of the model, the dihedral potential in which
a selected bead is involved is averaged over all possible configurations of
neighboring beads along the protein chain. The resulting average dihedral
potential of the residue is constant far enough from the cluster, but increases
monotonically with decreasing distance below a threshold value. An overall
potential around the cluster wherein a residue performs a chaotic motion is a
combination of the average dihedral and pairwise potentials. As a function of
distance from the cluster it has a double well shape. Residues in the inner
well are considered as belonging to the cluster (folded part of the protein)
while those in the outer well are treated as belonging to the unfolded
(although compact) part of the protein. A double well shape of the potential
around the cluster allows one to determine its emission and absorption rates by
using a first passage time analysis and develop a self-consistent kinetic
theory for the nucleation mechanism of protein folding. Numerical calculations
for a protein of 2500 residues with the diffusion coefficient of residues in
the native state ranging from 10^{-6} cm^2/s to 10^{-8} cm^2/s predict folding
times in the range from several seconds to several hundreds of seconds.

spatial light modulator (DMD, Texas Instruments). Employing video projector
technology high resolution patterns, designed as bitmap images on the computer,
are displayed using a micromirror array consisting of about 786000 tiny
individually addressable tilting mirrors. The DMD, which is located in the
image plane of an infinity corrected microscope, is projected onto a substrate
placed in the focal plane of the microscope objective. With a 5x(0.25 NA) Fluar
microscope objective, a fivefold reduction of the image to a total size of 9
mm2 and a minimum feature size of 3.5 microns is achieved. Our system can be
used in the visible range as well as in the near UV (with a light intensity of
up to 76 mW/cm2 around the 365 nm Hg-line). We developed an inexpensive and
simple method to enable exact focusing and controlling of the image quality of
the projected patterns. Our MPLS has originally been designed for the
light-directed in situ synthesis of DNA microarrays. One requirement is a high
UV intensity to keep the fabrication process reasonably short. Another demand
is a sufficient contrast ratio over small distances (of about 5 microns). This
is necessary to achieve a high density of features (i.e. separated sites on the
substrate at which different DNA sequences are synthesized in parallel fashion)
while at the same time the number of stray light induced DNA sequence errors is
kept reasonably small. We demonstrate the performance of the apparatus in
light-directed DNA chip synthesis and discuss its advantages and limitations.

derive an effective two-photon Hamiltonian with dependence on the number
operator of the ion's center-of-mass motion. This dependence occurs both in the
cavity induced Stark-shifs and in the ion-field coupling, and its role in the
dynamics is illustrated by showing the time evolution of the probability of
occupation of the electronic levels for simple initial preparations of the

factoring algorithm, and a state in Grover's quantum search algorithm. Although
the visualization function can take negative values, it becomes non-negative
