during the prompt phase and during what seems to be the afterglow phase. The
results are puzzling, since if the opt-UV and the X-ray emission belong to a
single backbody (BB), then its luminosity is too large, and this BB cannot be
interpreted as the signature of the shock breakout of the supernova. There are
also serious problems in associating the emission expected by the supernova
shock breakout with either the opt-UV or the X-ray emission. In the former case
we derive too small ejecta velocities; in the latter case, on the contrary, the
required velocity is too large, corresponding to the large radius of a BB
required to peak close to the UV band. We then present what we think is the
most conservative alternative explanation, namely a synchrotron spectrum,
self-absorbed in the opt-UV and extending up to the X-ray band, where we
observe the emission of the most energetic electrons, which are responsible for
the exponential roll-over of the spectrum. The obtained fit can explain the
entire spectrum except the BB observed in the X-rays, which must be a separate
component. The puzzling feature of this interpretation is that the same model
is required to explain the spectrum also at later times, up to 1e5 s, because
the opt-UV emission remains constant in shape and also (approximately) in
normalisation. In this case the observed X-ray flux is produced by self-Compton
emission. Thus the prompt emission phase should last for ~1e5 s or more.
Finally, we show that the BB observed in X-rays, up to 7000 seconds, can be
photospheric emission from the cocoon or stellar material, energized by the GRB
jet at radii comparable to the stellar radius (i.e. 1e10-1e11 cm), not very far
from where this material becomes transparent (e.g. 1e12 cm).

dwarf TVLM 513-46546 simultaneously at 4.88 GHz and 8.44 GHz. The radio
emission was determined to be persistent, variable and periodic at both
frequencies with a period of ~2 hours. This periodicity is in excellent
agreement with the estimated period of rotation of the dwarf based on its v sin
i of ~60 km/s. This rotational modulation places strong constraints on the
source size of the radio emitting region and hence the brightness temperature
of the associated emission. We find the resulting high brightness temperature,
together with the inherent directivity of the rotationally modulated component
of the emission, difficult to reconcile with incoherent gyrosynchrotron
radiation. We conclude that a more likely source is coherent, electron
cyclotron maser emission from the low density regions above the magnetic poles.
This model requires the magnetic field of TVLM 513-46546 to take the form of a
large-scale, stable, dipole or multipole with surface field strengths up to at
least 3kG. We discuss a mechanism by which broadband, persistent electron
cyclotron maser emission can be sustained in the low density regions of the
magnetospheres of ultracool dwarfs. A second nonvarying, unpolarized component
of the emission may be due to depolarization of the coherent electron cyclotron
maser emission or alternatively, incoherent gyrosynchrotron or synchrotron
radiation from a population of electrons trapped in the large-scale magnetic
field.

in this sample, due primarily to differences in N(CO). For a given N(H_2),
published models of diffuse and translucent clouds predict less CO than is
observed. The J=1-3 rotational levels of 12CO are sub-thermally populated in
these sight lines, with T_ex typically between 3 and 7 K. In general, there is
no significant difference between the excitation temperatures of 12CO and 13CO.
Fits to the higher resolution CO line profiles suggest that CO (like CN) is
concentrated in relatively cold, dense gas. We obtain C_2 column densities from
the F-X (1-0) and (0-0) bands (1314 and 1341 A), the D-X (0-0) band (2313 A),
and the A-X (3-0) and (2-0) bands (7719 and 8757 A). Comparisons among those
N(C_2) yield a set of mutually consistent f-values for the UV and optical C_2
bands, but also reveal some apparent anomalies within the F-X (0-0) band. Both
the kinetic temperature inferred from the C_2 rotational populations (up to
J=18) and the excitation temperature T_02(C_2) are generally smaller than the
corresponding T_01(H_2). Incorporating additional data for K I, HD, CH, C_2,
C_3, CN, and CO from the literature (for a total sample of 74 sight lines), we
find that (1) CO is most tightly correlated with CN; (2) the ratios 12CO/H_2
and 13CO/H_2 both are fairly tightly correlated with the density indicator
CN/CH (but C_2/H_2 is not); and (3) the ratio 12CO/13CO is somewhat
anti-correlated with both CN/CH and N(CO). Sight lines with 12CO/13CO below the
average local Galactic value of 12C/13C appear to sample colder, denser gas in

limb-darkened angular diameter, stellar mass, and the abundances of Mg, Si, and

star for which the effective temperature can be accurately constrained from the
observed spectral energy distribution (corrected for reddening). Such analysis
leads to a value that is higher than most spectroscopic results previously
reported in the literature (~5950 K). We find that the ionization balance of Fe
lines is satisfied only if a low Teff (~5950 K) is adopted. With our preferred
Teff (6141 K), the mean iron abundance we obtain from the FeII lines is lower
by about 0.15 dex than that from the FeI lines, and therefore, the discrepancy
between the mean iron abundance from FeI and FeII lines cannot be explained by
overionization by UV photons as the main non-LTE effect. We also comment on
non-LTE effects and the importance of inelastic collisions with neutral H atoms

cooling and star formation) of mergers involving idealised X-ray clusters whose
initial conditions resemble relaxed clusters with cool compact cores observed

plausible, range of impact parameters and progenitor mass ratios. We find that
all mergers evolve via a common progression. We illustrate this progression in
the projected gas density, X-ray surface brightness, SZ, temperature, and gas
entropy maps. Several different classes of transient ``cold front''-like
features can arise over the course of a merger. We find that all of these
classes are present in Chandra and XMM observations of merging systems and
propose a naming scheme for these features: ``comet-like'' tails, bridges,
plumes, streams and edges. In none of the cases considered do the initial cool
compact cores of the primary and the secondary get destroyed during the course
of the mergers. We quantify the evolving morphology of our mergers using
centroid variance, power ratios and offset between the X-ray and the projected
mass maps. We find that the centroid variance best captures the dynamical state
of the cluster. Placing the system at z=0.1, we find that all easily identified
observable traces of the secondary disappear from a simulated 50 ks Chandra
image following the second pericentric passage. The system, however, takes
approximately 2 additional Gyrs to relax and virialize. Temperature
fluctuations at the level of 20% can persist in the final systems well past the
point of virialization, suggesting that that the existence of temperature
fluctuations, in and of themselves, do not necessarily indicate a disturbed or
unrelaxed system.

takes a wide range of values that are unrelated to metallicity but
anticorrelated with 24 um brightness and F_24/F_70 ratio. This suggests that

observed in star-forming low-metallicity galaxies. We use the S3MC images to
compile a photometric catalog of ~400,000 mid- and far-infrared point sources

categories: 1) bright 5.8 um sources with very faint optical counterparts and
very red mid-infrared colors ([5.8]-[8.0]>1.2), which we identify as YSOs. 2)
Bright mid-infrared sources with mildly red colors (0.16<[5.8]-[8.0]<0.6),

synthetic Kurucz photospheric predictions. Stars showing excess infrared
emission due to strong emission lines or extended nebulosity seen at 24 um are
excluded from our sample; therefore, the remaining infrared excesses are likely
to arise from circumstellar debris disks. At the 3-sigma confidence level, the
excess rate at 24 and 70 um is 32% and >=33% (with an uncertainty of 5%),
considerably higher than has been found for old solar analogs and M dwarfs. Our
measurements place constraints on the fractional dust luminosities and
temperatures in the disks. We find that older stars tend to have lower
fractional dust luminosity than younger ones. While the fractional luminosity
from the excess infrared emission follows a general 1/t relationship, the
values at a given stellar age vary by at least two orders of magnitude. We also
find that (1) older stars possess a narrow range of temperature distribution
peaking at colder temperatures, and (2) the disk emission at 70 um persists

0.75 <= z <= 1.3 in the DEEP2 Survey, both for field galaxies and for galaxies

the evolution of galaxy colour at high z. The colour segregation observed
between local group and field samples is already in place at z ~ 1: DEEP2
groups have a significantly lower blue fraction than the field. At fixed z,
there is also a correlation between blue fraction and galaxy magnitude, such
that brighter galaxies are more likely to be red, both in groups and in the
field. In addition, there is a negative correlation between blue fraction and
group richness. In terms of evolution, the blue fraction in groups and the
field remains roughly constant from z=0.75 to z ~ 1, but beyond this redshift
the blue fraction in groups rises rapidly with z, and the group and field blue
fractions become indistinguishable at z ~ 1.3. Careful tests indicate that this
effect does not arise from known systematic or selection effects. To further
ensure the robustness of this result, we build on previous mock DEEP2
catalogues to develop mock catalogues that reproduce the colour-overdensity
relation observed in DEEP2 and use these to test our methods. The convergence
between the group and field blue fractions at z ~ 1.3 implies that DEEP2 galaxy
groups only became efficient at quenching star formation at z ~ 2; this result
is broadly consistent with other recent observations and with current models of
galaxy evolution and hierarchical structure growth. (Abridged.)

In an effective
theory in which a gas of closed strings is coupled to a dilaton gravity
background without any potential for the dilaton, the Hagedorn phase which is
quasi-static in the string frame corresponds to an expanding, non-accelerating
phase from the point of view of the Einstein frame. The Einstein frame
curvature singularity which appears in this toy model is related to the blowing
up of the dilaton in the string frame. However, for large values of the
dilaton, the toy model clearly is inapplicable. Thus, there must be a new
string phase which is likely to be static with frozen dilaton. With such a
phase, the horizon problem can be successfully addressed in string gas
cosmology. The generation of cosmological perturbations in the Hagedorn phase
seeded by a gas of long strings in thermal equilibrium is reconsidered, both
from the point of view of the string frame (in which it is easier to understand
the generation of fluctuations) and the Einstein frame (in which the evolution
equations are well known). It is shown that fixing the dilaton at some early

Minor changes and corrections, added references",,,,"math.OA math.CO",,"  On the space of (non-commutative) distributions of k-tuples of selfadjoint
elements in a $C^*$-probability space $D_c(k)$, one has an operation
$\freeplus$ of free additive convolution, and one can consider the subspace
$D_c^{inf-div}$ of distributions which are infinitely divisible with respect to
this operation. The linearizing transform for free additive convolution is the
R-transform. Thus, one has $R_{\mu\freeplus\nu}=R_{\mu}+R_{\nu}$. The
eta-series $\eta_{\mu}$ is the counterpart of $R_{\mu}$ in the theory of
Boolean convolution. We prove that the space of eta-series of distributions
belonging to $D_c(k)$ coincides with the space of R-transforms of distributions
which are infinitely divisible with respect to free additive convolution. As a
consequence of this fact, one can define a bijection $B : D_c(k) \to
D_c^{inf-div}$ via the formula $R_{B(\mu)} = \eta_{\mu}$, for all distributions
$\mu$ in $D_c(k)$. We show that $B$ is a multi-variable analogue of a bijection
studied by Bercovici and Pata for k=1, and we prove a theorem about convergence
in moments which parallels the Bercovici-Pata result. On the other hand we
prove the formula $B(\mu\freetimes\nu) = B(\mu) \freetimes B(\nu),$ with
$\mu,\nu$ considered in a space $D^{alg}(k)$ containing $D_c (k)$ where the
operation of free multiplicative convolution $\freetimes$ always makes sense.
An equivalent reformulation for this equality is that
$\eta_{\mu\freetimes\nu}=\eta_{\mu} \freestar \eta_{\nu},$ for all $\mu,\nu\in
D^{alg}(k)$. This shows that, in a certain sense, eta-series behave in the same
way as R-transforms in connection to the operation of multiplication of free
k-tuples of non-commutative random variables.

Abraham and Bonnet gave a poset hierarchy that characterised the class of

incomparability. We define a larger poset hierarchy than that of Abraham and
Bonnet, to include a broader class of ``scattered'' posets that we call
$\kappa$-scattered. These posets cannot embed any order such that for every two
subsets of size $ < \kappa$, one being strictly less than the other, there is
an element in between. If a linear order has this property and has size
$\kappa$ we call this set $\qkappa$. Such a set only exists when
$\kappa^{<\kappa}=\kappa$. Partial orders with the property that for every
$a<b$ the set $\{x: a<x<b\}$ has size $\geq \kappa$ are called weakly
$\kappa$-dense, and partial orders that do not have a weakly $\kappa$-dense
subset are called strongly $\kappa$-scattered. We prove that our hierarchy
includes all strongly $\kappa$-scattered FAC posets, and that the hierarchy is
included in the class of all FAC $\kappa$-scattered posets. In addition, we
prove that our hierarchy is in fact the closure of the class of all
$\kappa$-well-founded linear orders under inversions, lexicographic sums and
FAC weakenings. For $\kappa=\aleph_0$ our hierarchy agrees with the one from
the Abraham-Bonnet theorem.

produces electron-hole pairs in a direct-gap semiconductor material that
subsequently recombine producing infrared light to be registered by a
photo-detector. The key issue is how to make the semiconductor essentially
transparent to its own infrared light, so that photons generated deep inside
the semiconductor could reach its surface without tangible attenuation. We
discuss two ways to accomplish this, one based on doping the semiconductor with
shallow impurities of one polarity type, preferably donors, the other by
heterostructure bandgap engineering. The proposed semiconductor scintillator
combines the best properties of currently existing radiation detectors and can
be used for both simple radiation monitoring, like a Geiger counter, and for
high-resolution spectrography of the high-energy radiation. The most important
advantage of the proposed detector is its fast response time, about 1 ns,
essentially limited only by the recombination time of minority carriers.
Notably, the fast response comes without any degradation in brightness. When
the scintillator is implemented in a qualified semiconductor material (such as
InP or GaAs), the photo-detector and associated circuits can be epitaxially
integrated on the scintillator slab and the structure can be stacked-up to
achieve virtually any desired absorption capability.

Updated with reviewer's comments / suggestions",,"10.1080/14685240701376316",,"physics.flu-dyn",,"  The results of an analysis of turbulent pipe flow based on a Karhunen-Lo`eve
decomposition are presented. The turbulent flow is generated by a direct
numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations using a spectral element
algorithm at a Reynolds number Re_\tau=150. This simulation yields a set of
basis functions that captures 90% of the energy after 2,453 modes. The
eigenfunctions are categorised into two classes and six subclasses based on
their wavenumber and coherent vorticity structure. Of the total energy, 81% is
in the propagating class, characterised by constant phase speeds; the remaining
energy is found in the non propagating subclasses, the shear and roll modes.
The four subclasses of the propagating modes are the wall, lift, asymmetric,
and ring modes. The wall modes display coherent vorticity structures near the
wall, the lift modes display coherent vorticity structures that lift away from
the wall, the asymmetric modes break the symmetry about the axis, and the ring
modes display rings of coherent vorticity. Together, the propagating modes form
a wave packet, as found from a circular normal speed locus. The energy transfer
mechanism in the flow is a four step process. The process begins with energy
being transferred from mean flow to the shear modes, then to the roll modes.
Energy is then transfer ed from the roll modes to the wall modes, and then
eventually to the lift modes. The ring and asymmetric modes act as catalysts
that aid in this four step energy transfer. Physically, this mechanism shows
how the energy in the flow starts at the wall and then propagates into the
outer layer.

  of drag reduction by spanwise wall oscillation","11 pages, 21 figures. Figure added",,,,"physics.flu-dyn",,"  The results of a comparative analysis based upon a Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve
expansion of turbulent pipe flow and drag reduced turbulent pipe flow by
spanwise wall oscillation are presented. The turbulent flow is generated by a
direct numerical simulation at a Reynolds number $Re_\tau = 150$. The spanwise
wall oscillation is imposed as a velocity boundary condition with an amplitude
of $A^+ = 20$ and a period of $T^+ = 50$. The wall oscillation results in a 27%
mean velocity increase when the flow is driven by a constant pressure gradient.
The peaks of the Reynolds stress and root-mean-squared velocities shift away
from the wall and the Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve dimension of the turbulent attractor
is reduced from 2453 to 102. The coherent vorticity structures are pushed away
from the wall into higher speed flow, causing an increase of their advection
speed of 34% as determined by a normal speed locus. This increase in advection
speed gives the propagating waves less time to interact with the roll modes.
This leads to less energy transfer and a shorter lifespan of the propagating
structures, and thus less Reynolds stress production which results in drag
reduction.

Karhunen-Lo`eve decomposition, in turbulent pipe flow undergoing reverse
transition to laminar flow is investigated. The turbulent flow data is
generated by a direct numerical simulation started at a fully turbulent
Reynolds number of Re_\tau=150, which is slowly decreased until Re_\tau=95. At
this low Reynolds number the high frequency modes decay first, leaving only the
decaying streamwise vortices. The flow undergoes a chugging phenomena, where it
begins to relaminarize and the mean velocity increases. The remaining
propagating modes then destabilize the streamwise vortices, rebuild the energy
spectra, and eventually the flow regains its turbulent state. Our results
capture three chugging cycles before the flow completely relaminarizes. The
high frequency modes present in the outer layer decay first, establishing the
importance of the outer region in the self-sustaining mechanism of wall bound
turbulence.

and loss spectra touch each other at a singular frequency. In the framework of
the standard (Schawlow-Townes-Lax-Henry) theory, the finite linewidth results
from the account of fluctuations associated with the random spontaneous
emission processes. This approach is based on the assumption that in the
mean-field approximation the singular frequency generation persists for
injection levels higher than critical. We show that this assumption in the
framework of the Boltzmann kinetic equation for electrons and photons is
invalid and therefore the standard description of semiconductor laser linewidth
lacks theoretical foundation. Experimental support of the standard theory is
also questionable.

to search for the variation of the fundamental constants consists in comparison
of different atomic clocks. Huge enhancement of the variation effects happens
in transition between accidentally degenerate atomic and molecular energy
levels. A new idea is to build a ``nuclear'' clock based on the ultraviolet
transition between very low excited state and ground state in Thorium nucleus.
This may allow to improve sensitivity to the variation up to 10 orders of
magnitude!

  Notes in Computer Science vol. 4392, pp. 456-478, 2007",,,"quant-ph",,"  Assume that two distant parties, Alice and Bob, as well as an adversary, Eve,
have access to (quantum) systems prepared jointly according to a tripartite
state. In addition, Alice and Bob can use local operations and authenticated
public classical communication. Their goal is to establish a key which is
unknown to Eve. We initiate the study of this scenario as a unification of two
standard scenarios: (i) key distillation (agreement) from classical
correlations and (ii) key distillation from pure tripartite quantum states.
  Firstly, we obtain generalisations of fundamental results related to
scenarios (i) and (ii), including upper bounds on the key rate. Moreover, based
on an embedding of classical distributions into quantum states, we are able to
find new connections between protocols and quantities in the standard scenarios
(i) and (ii).
  Secondly, we study specific properties of key distillation protocols. In
particular, we show that every protocol that makes use of pre-shared key can be
transformed into an equally efficient protocol which needs no pre-shared key.
This result is of practical significance as it applies to quantum key
distribution (QKD) protocols, but it also implies that the key rate cannot be
locked with information on Eve's side. Finally, we exhibit an arbitrarily large
separation between the key rate in the standard setting where Eve is equipped
with quantum memory and the key rate in a setting where Eve is only given
classical memory. This shows that assumptions on the nature of Eve's memory are
important in order to determine the correct security threshold in QKD.

with positive Wigner function; for such states we show that the oscillations of
the discrete Wigner function typically spread over the entire discrete
phase-space (including the regions where the two interfering states are
localized). This is a generic property which is in sharp contrast with the
usual attributes of Wigner functions that make them useful candidates to
display the existence of quantum coherence through oscillations. However, it is
possible to find subsets of cat states with a natural phase-space
representation, in which the oscillatory regions remain localized. We show that
this can be done for interesting families of stabilizer states used in quantum
error-correcting codes, and illustrate this by analysing the phase-space
representation of the five-qubit error-correcting code.
