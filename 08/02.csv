pulsar also known to be a strong pulsed source of high-energy emission. Despite
the extensive studies at high-energy wavelengths, there is little or no
published work on its single-pulse behaviour in the radio band. In this report
we rectify this omission. We have found that the shape of the pulse profile of
PSR B0656+14 requires an unusually long timescale to achieve stability (over
25,000 pulses at 327 MHz). This instability is caused by very bright and narrow
pulses with widths and luminosities comparable to those observed for the RRATs.
Many pulses are bright enough to qualify as ""giant pulses"", but are broader
than those usually meant by this term. At 327 MHz the brightest pulse was about
116 times brighter than the average pulse. Although the most powerful pulses
peak near the centre of the profile, occasional sudden strong pulses are also
found on the extreme leading edge of the profile. One of them has a peak flux
of about 2000 times the average flux at that pulse longitude. No ""break"" in the
pulse-energy distributions is observed, but nevertheless there is evidence of
two separate populations of pulses: bright pulses have a narrow ""spiky""
appearance consisting of short quasi-periodic bursts of emission with
microstructure, in contrast to the underlying weaker broad pulses. Furthermore,
the spiky pulses tend to appear in clusters which arise and dissipate over
about 10 periods. We demonstrate that the spiky emission builds a narrow and
peaked profile, whereas the weak emission produces a broad hump, which is
largely responsible for the shoulders in the total emission profiles at both
high and low frequencies.

these calculations have implications beyond the fate of population III stars.
These simulations provide a first 3-dimensional look at a realistic collapsar

non-axisymmetric instabilities in the collapsing core cause spiral structures
to form, and these structures shape later outflows. These outflows are driven
by the imbalance between viscous heating and inefficient neutrino cooling and
ultimately develop into a 1e52 erg explosion. Without magnetic fields, this

Telescope (HST) imaging of the location of the SN, along with a precise
localization of this event using the Laser-Guide-Star assisted Adaptive Optics
(LGS-AO) system at Keck Observatory, are combined to identify a luminous
(M_V=-10.3) point source as the possible progenitor of SN 2005gl. If the source
is indeed a single star, it was likely a member of the class of luminous blue
variable stars (LBVs). This finding leads us to consider the possible general
association of SNe IIn with LBV progenitors. We find this is indeed supported
by observations of other SNe, and the known properties of LBV stars. For
example, we argue that should the prototypical Galactic LBV eta Carina explode
in a phase similar to its current state, it will likely produce a type IIn SN.
We discuss our findings in the context of current ideas about the evolution of
massive stars, and review the census of SNe with identified progenitors. We
introduce the concept of the progenitor-SN map as a convenient means to discuss
the present status and future prospects of direct searches for SN progenitors.

the breakout of a mildly relativistic, radiation-dominated shock from a dense
stellar wind surrounding the progenitor star. There is also evidence for the
presence of a mildly relativistic ejecta in GRB980425/SN1998bw, based on its
X-ray and radio afterglow. Here we study the process of repeated bulk Compton
scatterings of shock breakout thermal photons by the mildly relativistic
ejecta. During the shock breakout process, a fraction of the thermal photons
would be repeatedly scattered between the pre-shock material and the shocked
material as well as the mildly relativistic ejecta and, as a result, the
thermal photons get boosted to increasingly higher energies. This bulk motion
Comptonization mechanism will produce nonthermal gamma-ray and X-ray flashes,
which could account for the prompt gamma-ray burst emission in low-luminosity
supernova-connected GRBs, such as GRB060218. A Monte Carlo code has been
developed to simulate this repeated scattering process, which confirms that a
significant fraction of the thermal photons get ""accelerated"" to form a
nonthermal component, with a dominant luminosity. This interpretation for the
prompt nonthermal emission of GRB060218 may imply that either the usual
internal shock emission from highly relativistic jets in these low-luminosity

advent of HST surveys that trace bars in the rest-frame optical out to z~1, it
is critical to provide a reference baseline for bars at z~0 in the optical
band. We present results on bars at z~0 in the optical and NIR bands based on
180 spirals from OSUBSGS. (1) The deprojected bar fraction at z~0 is ~60% +/-6%
in the NIR H-band and ~44% +/-6% in the optical B-band. (2) The results before
and after deprojection are similar, which is encouraging for high-redshift
studies that forego deprojection. (3) Studies of bars at z~0.2-1.0 (lookback
time of 3-8 Gyr) have reported an optical bar fraction of ~30% +/-6%, after
applying cutoffs in absolute magnitude (M_V < -19.3), bar size (a_bar >= 1.5
kpc), and bar ellipticity (e_bar >= 0.4). Applying these exact cutoffs to the
OSUBSGS data yields a comparable optical B-band bar fraction at z~0 of ~
34%+/-6%. This rules out scenarios where the optical bar fraction in bright
disks declines strongly with redshift. (4) Most (~70%) bars have moderate to
high strentgh or ellipticity (0.50 <= e_bar <= 0.75). There is no bimodality in
the distribution of e_bar. The H-band bar fraction and e_bar show no
substantial variation across RC3 Hubble types Sa to Scd. (5) RC3 bar types
should be used with caution. Many galaxies with RC3 types ""AB"" turn out to be
unbarred and RC3 bar classes ""B"" and ""AB"" have a significant overlap in e_bar.
(6) Most bars have sizes below 5 kpc. Bar and disk sizes correlate, and most
bars have a_bar/R_25~0.1-0.5. This suggests that the growths of bars and disks
are intimately tied.

percent of the sky should be covered with extended sources brighter than

comoving SFR densities that are between factors of 30 and 100 lower than
predictions, suggesting a reduction by more than a factor of 10 in star
formation efficiency at z~3. We consider several mechanisms that could reduce
star formation efficiency at high redshift. We find that the cosmological
increase with redshift of the critical surface density for the Toomre
instability may be sufficient to suppress star formation to the levels implied
by the UDF observations. However, the uncertainties are such that Toomre
instabilities may still exist. In that case star formation at column densities
less than 10^22 cm^-2 may be suppressed by the low molecular content of the DLA
gas. The upper limits on in situ star formation reduce the predicted
metallicities at z~3 to be significantly lower than observed, and reduce the
heat input in the gas to be substantially lower than the inferred cooling
rates. In contrast, the radiative output from compact Lyman Break Galaxies

small scale filaments that are confined by the external plasma pressure. This
creates small scale density fluctuations. In addition, extended current sheets
create even stronger density gradients that accompany field reversals in the

turbulent cascade when the turbulence reaches the scales at which the
fluctuation velocity gets less than the Alfven velocity. At those scales it is
possible to consider three cascades, of fast, slow and Alfven modes with little
energy exchange between them. As Alfvenic and slow modes are anisotropic they
marginally scatter and accelerate cosmic rays, while fast modes dominate the
processes. However, in the presence of cosmic rays the turbulence is modified
as cosmic rays transfer the energy of compressible motions (i.e. slow and fast
modes) from large scales to the scale of cosmic ray Larmor radius. This results
in generation of a new small-scale Alfvenic component which is not a part of
the ordinary MHD cascade. This component does scatter and accelerate cosmic
rays. In addition, magnetic reconnection in turbulent medium accelerates cosmic
rays. The complexity of the intracluster turbulence calls for observational
studies. A new technique Velocity Coordinate Spectrum (VCS) is particularly
promising for studies of velocity fluctuations with a new generation of X-ray

previously explained by estimating the semi-major at which the first order mean
motion resonances are large enough to overlap. Orbital dynamics near an
eccentric planet could differ due to first order corotation resonances that
have strength proportional to the planet's eccentricity. However, we find the
corotation resonance width at low free eccentricity is small. Also the first
order resonance width at zero free eccentricity is the same as that for a zero

insensitivity of the chaotic zone width to planet eccentricity. Particles at

at least 3 sigma, with X-ray luminosities in the range L_(0.5-2 keV) ~
10^41-10^43 ergs/s. The optical-to-X-ray flux ratios are consistent with
expectations, given the known correlations between alpha_ox and ultraviolet
luminosity, while a couple of objects appear to be anomalously X-ray weak. The
range of 0.5--2 keV photon indices we measure, 1 < Gamma_s < 2.7, is entirely
consistent with values found in samples of more luminous sources with more
massive black holes. Black hole mass evidently is not a primary driver of soft
X-ray spectral index. On the other hand, we do find evidence for a correlation
between X-ray power-law slope and both X-ray luminosity and Eddington ratio,
which may suggest that X-ray emission mechanisms weaken at high Eddington
ratio. Such a weakening may explain the X-ray weakness of one of our most
optically luminous objects.

SNRs. To this end we have pursued an accurate ``forward'' modeling of the
interaction of the Vela SNR shock with an ISM cloud. We perform hydrodynamic
simulations and we directly compare the observables synthesized from the
simulations with the data. We explore four different model setups, choosing the
values of the physical parameters on the basis of our preliminary analysis of
the X-ray data. We synthesize X-ray emission maps and spectra filtered through
the XMM-Newton EPIC-MOS instrumental response. The impact of a shock front at 6
million Kelvin on an elliptical cloud 30 times denser than the ambient medium
describes well the shock-cloud interaction processes in the Vela FilD region in
terms of spectral properties and morphology of the X-ray and optical emission.
The bulk of the X-ray emission in the FilD knot originates in the cloud
material heated by the transmitted shock front, but significant X-ray emission
is also associated to the cloud material, which evaporates, as an effect of
thermal conduction, in the intercloud medium. The physical origin of the FilD
optical emission is associated to thermal instabilities. In the FilD knot the
X-ray emission associated to the reflected shock front is negligible.

investigate possible sources of bias in the log-likelihood function and its
subsequent analysis, focusing on estimators of the inverse covariance matrix.
Furthermore, we study under which circumstances the estimated covariance matrix
is invertible. METHODS. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the
behaviour of estimators for the inverse covariance matrix, depending on the
number of independent data sets and the number of variables of the data
vectors. RESULTS. We find that the inverse of the maximum-likelihood estimator
of the covariance is biased, the amount of bias depending on the ratio of the
number of bins (data vector variables), P, to the number of data sets, N. This
bias inevitably leads to an -- in extreme cases catastrophic -- underestimation
of the size of confidence regions. We report on a method to remove this bias
for the idealised case of Gaussian noise and statistically independent data
vectors. Moreover, we demonstrate that marginalisation over parameters
introduces a bias into the marginalised log-likelihood function. Measures of
the sizes of confidence regions suffer from the same problem. Furthermore, we
give an analytic proof for the fact that the estimated covariance matrix is

Several striking features are observed compared to the classical (large-S)
spin-wave spectra. Whereas at low energies the dispersion is only weakly
renormalized by quantum fluctuations, significant anomalies are observed at
high energies. In particular, we find roton-like minima at special wave-vectors
and strong downward renormalization in large parts of the Brillouin zone,
leading to very flat or dispersionless modes. We present detailed comparison of
our calculated excitation energies in the Brillouin zone with the spin-wave
dispersion to order 1/S calculated recently by Starykh, Chubukov, and Abanov

qualitative differences. We show that at temperatures as low as 0.1J the

non-analytic at the points of half-integer average dot population.
Specifically, the exact result of K. A. Matveev, Phys. Rev. B 51, 1743 (1995),
that the dot capacitance shows periodic logarithmic singularities is rederived
as a special case corresponding to non-interacting electrons. We demonstrate
that this conclusion also holds in the presence of SU(2) spin symmetry, and
argue that logarithmic singularities persist as long as the Coulomb blockade is
destroyed which will be the case for sufficiently large tunneling and not very
strong interparticle repulsions. We show that interparticle repulsions aid the
Coulomb blockade to survive disordering effect of zero-point motion provided
the tunneling is sufficiently weak. Upon increase of tunneling, the Coulomb
blockade disappears through a Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition
characterized by a dot population jump whose magnitude is only determined by
interparticle repulsions in the channel. Similar conclusions are applicable to
systems without SU(2) spin symmetry except that the logarithmic singularity of
the capacitance is replaced by a power-law non-analyticity whose exponent
characterizes the degree of spin fluctuations.

results in Al-doped crystals and polycrystals up to x=0.2 reported in

below 30 K, both the gaps decrease and, up to the highest doping level x=0.32

the data within the two-band Eliashberg theory shows that this gap trend can be
explained as being mainly due to the band filling and to an increase in the
interband scattering which is necessary to account for the increase in
Delta_{pi} at low Al contents (x < 0.1). We suggest to interpret the following
decrease of Delta_{pi} for T_{c}^{A} < 30 K as being governed by the onset of
inhomogeneity and disorder in the Al distribution that partly mask the
intrinsic effects of doping and is not taken into account in standard
theoretical approaches.

using Kofke's Gibbs-Duhem integration technique combined with semigrand
canonical Monte Carlo simulations. We demonstrate that it is possible to
produce a wide-range of experimentally observed binary phase diagrams (with no
intermetallic phases) by reference to the atomic sizes and cohesive energies of
the two elemental materials. In some cases, it is useful to employ a single
adjustable parameter to adjust the phase diagram (we provided a good choice for
this free parameter). Next, we perform a systematic investigation of the effect
of relative atomic sizes and cohesive energies of the elements on the binary
phase diagrams. We then show that this approach leads to good agreement with
several experimental binary phase diagrams. The main benefit of this approach
is not the accurately reproduction of experimental phase diagrams, but rather
to provide a method by which material properties can be continuously changed in
simulations studies. This is one of the keys to the use of atomistic
simulations to understand mechanisms and properties in a manner not available
to experiment.

dimensional crossover is observed by studying the diamagnetic vortex
fluctuations of the lowest-Landau-level type which occur in isochamps
magnetization curves, $MvsT$, for temperatures close to the transition
temperature $T_{c}(H)$. The study was accomplished by obtaining isochamps
magnetization curves as a function of temperature for fields in the range of
0.4 T to 5 T. Magnetization curves for each sample when plotted together show
two distinct well resolved crossing points, one formed by low field curves and
located at a higher temperature than the other formed by high field curves. A
lowest-Landau-level scaling analysis is applied to the curves forming the
crossing points and it is verified that lower field curves obey the
three-dimensional form of this scaling while the higher field curves obey the
two-dimensional form. The results allow to observe the evolution of the
dimensional crossover field $H_{cross}$, 3D-2D, with the content of oxygen in

  \cite{Pea84} to assess what can be inferred by rational players in a
non-cooperative game in the presence of common knowledge. However, this notion
can be defined in a number of ways that differ in seemingly unimportant minor
details. We shed light on these differences, explain their impact, and clarify
for which games these definitions coincide. Then we apply the same analysis to
explain the differences and similarities between various ways the iterated
elimination of strictly dominated strategies was defined in the literature.
This allows us to clarify the results of \cite{DS02} and \cite{CLL05} and
improve upon them. We also consider the extension of these results to strict
dominance by a mixed strategy. Our approach is based on a general study of the
operators on complete lattices. We allow transfinite iterations of the
considered operators and clarify the need for them. The advantage of such a
general approach is that a number of results, including order independence for
some of the notions of rationalizability and strict dominance, come for free.

wireless communication environments (such as Satellite, mobile phone
networks,...). It has been recently observed that the average service time of
broadcast systems can be considerably improved by taking into consideration
existing correlations between requests. We study a pull-based data broadcast
system where users request possibly overlapping sets of items; a request is
served when all its requested items are downloaded. We aim at minimizing the
average user perceived latency, i.e. the average flow time of the requests. We
first show that any algorithm that ignores the dependencies can yield arbitrary
bad performances with respect to the optimum even if it is given arbitrary
extra resources. We then design a $(4+\epsilon)$-speed
$O(1+1/\epsilon^2)$-competitive algorithm for this setting that consists in 1)
splitting evenly the bandwidth among each requested set and in 2) broadcasting
arbitrarily the items still missing in each set into the bandwidth the set has
received. Our algorithm presents several interesting features: it is simple to
implement, non-clairvoyant, fair to users so that no user may starve for a long
period of time, and guarantees good performances in presence of correlations
between user requests (without any change in the broadcast protocol). We also
present a $ (4+\epsilon)$-speed $O(1+1/\epsilon^3)$-competitive algorithm which
broadcasts at most one item at any given time and preempts each item broadcast
at most once on average. As a side result of our analysis, we design a
competitive algorithm for a particular setting of non-clairvoyant job
scheduling with dependencies, which might be of independent interest.

is presented for incorporating these symmetries in a manifest way. The second

IIB string theory and M-theory) are treated, as well as compactifications of

four space-time dimensions. The free (2,0) tensor multiplet field theory is
introduced and discussed, and we present a formalism in which its
superconformal covariance is made manifest. We also introduce a tensile
self-dual string and discuss how to couple this string to the tensor multiplet
fields in a way that respects superconformal invariance.

the symmetry algebra of the standard 2-D Kepler system, which was identified by
Daboul and Slodowy as an infinite-dimensional Kac-Moody loop algebra, and was
denoted by ${\mathbb H}_2 $, gets reduced by the symmetry breaking term,
defined by the Hamiltonian \[ H(\beta)= \frac 1 {2m} (p_1^2+p_2^2)- \frac
\alpha r - \beta r^{-1/2} \cos ((\phi-\gamma)/2). \] For this $H (\beta)$ I
define two symmetry loop algebras ${\mathfrak L}_{i}(\beta), i=1,2$, by
choosing the `basic generators' differently. These ${\mathfrak L}_{i}(\beta)$
can be mapped isomorphically onto subalgebras of ${\mathbb H}_2 $, of
codimension 2 or 3, revealing the reduction of symmetry. Both factor algebras
${\mathfrak L}_i(\beta)/I_i(E,\beta)$, relative to the corresponding
energy-dependent ideals $I_i(E,\beta)$, are isomorphic to ${\mathfrak so}(3)$
and ${\mathfrak so}(2,1)$ for $E<0$ and $E>0$, respectively, just as for the
pure Kepler case. However, they yield two different non-standard contractions
as $E \to 0$, namely to the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra ${\mathfrak h}_3={\mathfrak
w}_1$ or to an abelian Lie algebra, instead of the Euclidean algebra
${\mathfrak e}(2)$ for the pure Kepler case. The above example suggests a
general procedure for defining generalized contractions, and also illustrates
the {\em `deformation contraction hysteresis'}, where contraction which involve
two contraction parameters can yield different contracted algebras, if the
limits are carried out in different order.

the topological group Aut(M,p). Furthermore, we also show that the order l(p)

exists an integer k depending only on M such that for every point p in M germs
at p of CR diffeomorphisms mapping M into another real-analytic hypersurface in
a complex space of the same dimension are uniquely determined by their k-jet at

theorem.
  Our parametrization theorem also holds for the stability group of any
essentially finite minimal real-analytic CR manifold of arbitrary codimension.
One of the new main tools developed in the paper, which may be of independent

inverting certain families of parametrized maps with singularities.

An estimation procedure based on combining the so-called marginal integration

semiparametric spatial regression setting. Asymptotic distributions are
established under some mild conditions. The same convergence rates as in the
one-dimensional regression case are established. An application of the

model for the stable homotopy category with a nice associative and commutative
smash product on the point set level and a compatible Quillen closed model
structure. About the only disadvantage of this model is that the stable
equivalences cannot be defined by inverting those morphisms which induce
isomorphisms on homotopy groups, because this would leave too many homotopy
types. In this sense the naively defined homotopy groups are often `wrong`, and
then their precise relationship to the `true` homotopy groups (i.e., morphisms
in the stable homotopy category from sphere spectra) appears mysterious.
  In this paper I discuss and exploit extra algebraic structure on the naively
defined homotopy groups of symmetric spectra, namely a special kind of action
of the monoid of injective self maps of the natural numbers. This extra
structure clarifies several issues about homotopy groups and stable
equivalences and explains why the naive homotopy groups are not so wrong after
all. For example, the monoid action allows a simple characterization of
semistable symmetric spectra.

Yukawa type potentials with sub-mm range, arising from new physics related to
gravity. The proposes set-up is very similar to neutral atom optical lattice
clocks, but with the atoms trapped in lattice sites close to the reflecting
mirror. A sequence of pulses of the probe laser at different frequencies is
then used to create an interferometer with a coherent superposition between
atomic states at different distances from the mirror (in different lattice
sites). Assuming atom interferometry state of the art measurement of the phase
difference and a duration of the superposition of about 0.1 s we expect to be

different atoms and surfaces indicates no fundamentally limiting effect at the

generally, after a quantum memory bound applies. In particular, the following
special case plays an important role in quantum cryptographic protocols in the
bounded storage model: Given a string x encoded in an unknown basis chosen from
a set of mutually unbiased bases, you may perform any measurement, but then
store at most q qubits of quantum information. Later on, you learn which basis
was used. How well can you compute a function f(x) of x, given the initial
measurement outcome, the q qubits and the additional basis information? We
first show a lower bound on the success probability for any balanced function,
and any number of mutually unbiased bases, beating the naive strategy of simply
guessing the basis. We then show that for two bases, any Boolean function f(x)
can be computed perfectly if you are allowed to store just a single qubit,
independent of the number of possible input strings x. However, we show how to
construct three bases, such that you need to store all qubits in order to
compute f(x) perfectly. We then investigate how much advantage the additional
basis information can give for a Boolean function. To this end, we prove
optimal bounds for the success probability for the AND and the XOR function for
up to three mutually unbiased bases. Our result shows that the gap in success
probability can be maximal: without the basis information, you can never do
better than guessing the basis, but with this information, you can compute f(x)
perfectly. We also exhibit an example where the extra information does not give
any advantage at all.

display a remarkable similarity to sweeps through quantum phase transitions. We
find that transitions of second or higher order are advantageous in comparison
to those of first order. With this insight, we propose a novel adiabatic
quantum algorithm for the solution of 3-satisfiability (3-SAT) problems (exact
cover), which is significantly faster than previous proposals according to
numerical simulations (up to 20 qubits). These findings suggest that adiabatic
quantum algorithms can solve NP-complete problems such as 3-SAT much faster
than the Grover search routine (yielding a quadratic enhancement), possibly
even with an exponential speed-up. PACS: 03.67.-a, 03.67.Lx, 73.43.Nq,

tolerate are based on fault-tolerance schemes relying heavily on postselecting
on no detected errors. However, there has been no proof that these schemes give
even a positive tolerable noise threshold. A technique to prove a positive
threshold, for probabilistic noise models, is presented. The main idea is to
maintain strong control over the distribution of errors in the quantum state at
all times. This distribution has correlations which conceivably could grow out
of control with postselection. But in fact, the error distribution can be
written as a mixture of nearby distributions each satisfying strong
independence properties, so there are no correlations for postselection to
amplify.

possible to excite the searched mode in a number of steps proportional to

in \cite{Quantumness}, which is closely related to the fidelity loss in
transmission of the quantum states through a classical channel. In
\cite{Fuchs}, Fuchs showed that in $d$-dimensional Hilbert space, minimum
quantumness is $\frac{2}{d+1}$, and this can be achieved by all rays in the
space. He left an open problem, asking whether fewer than $d^2$ states can
achieve this bound. Recently, in a different context, A. J. Scott introduced a
concept of generalized $t$-design in \cite{GenSphet}, which is a natural
generalization of spherical $t$-design. In this paper, we show that the lower
bound on the quantumness can be achieved if and only if the states form a
generalized 2-design. As a corollary, we show that this bound can be only
achieved if the number of states are larger or equal to $d^2$, answering the
open problem. Furthermore, we also show that the minimal set of such ensemble
is Symmetric Informationally Complete POVM(SIC-POVM). This leads to an
equivalence relation between SIC-POVM and minimal set of ensemble achieving
minimal quantumness.
