cosmology such as $\Lambda$CDM and have the potential to significantly affect
galactic structure. In this paper we dissect the case-by-case outcome from a
set of numerical simulations of a single satellite elliptical galaxy accreting
onto a massive elliptical galaxy. We take care to explore cosmologically
relevant orbital parameters and to set up realistic initial galaxy models that
include all three relevant dynamical components: dark matter halos, stellar
bulges, and central massive black holes. The effects of several different
parameters are considered, including orbital energy and angular momentum,
satellite density and inner density profile, satellite-to-host mass ratio, and
presence of a black hole at the center of the host. Black holes play a crucial
role in protecting the shallow stellar cores of the hosts, as satellites
merging onto a host with a central black hole are more strongly disrupted than
those merging onto hosts without black holes. Orbital parameters play an
important role in determining the degree of disruption: satellites on less
bound or more eccentric orbits are more easily destroyed than those on more
bound or more circular orbits as a result of an increased number of pericentric
passages and greater cumulative effects of gravitational shocking and tidal
stripping. In addition, satellites with densities typical of faint elliptical
galaxies are disrupted relatively easily, while denser satellites can survive
much better in the tidal field of the host. Over the range of parameters
explored, we find that the accretion of a single satellite elliptical galaxy
can result in a broad variety of changes, in both signs, in the surface
brightness profile and color of the central part of an elliptical galaxy.

simplifying approximations as the thin-horizon (super-adiabatic) or the
instantaneous transitions between the successive phases of domain of the
different cosmic fluids. The accuracy of such assumptions, broadly employed in
the literature, is put in check. Since the physical nature of the fluid (known
as dark energy) leading to the accelerated expansion observed in the recent
Universe is still uncertain, four categories of models were analyzed:
cosmological constant, X-fluid (phantom or not), generalized Chaplygin gas and
(a parametric form of) quintessence. The results are conclusive with respect to
the insensitivity of gravitational waves to dark energy, due to the recentness
of its phase of domain ($z \sim 1 $). The empirical counterparts of the
gravitational wave forecasts are still nonexistent for the noise levels and
operational frequencies of the experiments already built are inadequate to
detect those relics. Perspectives are more promising for space detectors
(planned to be sensitive to amplitudes of $\sim 10^{-23}$ at $10^{-3}-1$Hz).
The cosmic microwave background is also discussed as an alternative of indirect
detection and the energy density scale of inflation is constrained to be
smaller than $10^{-10}$ in the analysis here presented.

3.0e9-3.0e13 Msun. These properties include the concentration parameter (c),
the spin parameter (lambda) and the mean axis ratio (q). For the
concentration-mass relation we find c~M^(-0.11) in agreement with the model
proposed by Bullock et al. even if we find a lower normalization (15%). The
results for lambda and q are in good agreement with previous studies, while c
and lambda are anti-correlated. In an attempt to remove unrelaxed haloes, we
use the offset parameter (xoff), defined as the distance between the most bound
particle and the center of mass. Removing haloes with large xoff increases the
c by ~10%, lowers the lambda by ~15%, and removes the most prolate haloes. In
addition, it largely removes the anti-correlation between c and lambda though
not entirely. We also investigate the effects of the large-scale environment.
We find that more concentrated haloes live in denser environments. Note,
however, that the trend is weak compared to the scatter. For the spin
parameters we find no environment dependence, while there is a weak indication
that the most spherical haloes reside in denser region. Finally, using a simple
model for disk galaxy formation we show that haloes that host low surface
brightness galaxies are expected to be hosted by a biased sub-set of haloes.
Not only do these haloes have spin parameters that are larger than average,
they also have c that are 15% percent lower than the average at a given halo
mass. We discuss the implications of all these findings for the claimed
disagreement between halo concentrations inferred from LSB rotation curves, and
those expected for a LCDM cosmology. (abridged)

open clusters and field dwarfs and subdwarfs. The age-metallicity relation is
characterized by close-to-solar metallicities for stars younger than ~4 Gyr,
and by a large [Fe/H] spread with a trend towards lower metallicities for
higher ages. We find that the [Fe/H] dispersion of young stars (less than 1
Gyr) is comparable to the observational errors, indicating that stars in the
solar neighbourhood are formed from interstellar matter of quite homogeneous
chemical composition. The three giants of our sample which have been proposed
to host planets are not metal rich, what is at odds with those for main
sequence stars. However, two of these stars have masses much larger than a

general curved, and never achieves a steady state. This behavior is in sharp
contrast to spiral shocks in two-dimensional (thin) disks, which are generally
stationary. The non-steady motions in our models include large-amplitude

magnitude of the optical afterglow of GRB 030115 is fainter than many upper
limits for other bursts, suggesting that without early nIR observations it
would have been classified as a ``dark'' burst. Both the color and optical
magnitude of the afterglow are likely due to dust extinction and indicate that
at least some optical afterglows are very faint due to dust along the line of
sight. Multicolor {\it Hubble Space Telescope} observations were also taken of
the host galaxy and the surrounding field. Photometric redshifts imply that the
host, and a substantial number of faint galaxies in the field are at $z \sim
2.5$. The overdensity of galaxies is sufficiently great that GRB 030115 may
have occurred in a rich high-redshift cluster. The host galaxy shows extremely

data to a number of systematic errors such as uncertainties in the mean flux,
continuum and noise estimate. The quasar continuum is described by the
superposition of a power law and emission lines. We perform a power law
continuum fitting on a spectrum-by-spectrum basis, and obtain an average
continuum slope of 0.59 +/- 0.36 in the redshift range 2.5<z<3.5. Taking into
account the variation in the continuum indices increases the mean flux by 3 and
7 per cent at z=3 and 2.4, respectively, as compared to the values inferred
with a single (mean) continuum slope. We compare our measurements to the PDF
obtained with mock lognormal spectra, whose statistical properties have been
constrained to match the observed Lya flux PDF and power spectrum of high
resolution data. Using our power law continuum fitting and the SDSS pipeline
noise estimate yields a poor agreement between the observed and mock PDFs.
Allowing for a break in the continuum slope and, more importantly, for residual
scatter in the continuum level substantially improves the agreement. A decrease
of 10-15 per cent in the mean quasar continuum with a typical rms variance at
the 20 per cent level can account for the data, provided that the noise excess
correction is no larger than 10 per cent.

regions are found at HI column densities above 1x10^21 cm^-2 (on scales of 200
pc), well within the range of threshold columns measured in normal galaxies.
The HII luminosity function resembles the ones derived for other low-mass dwarf
galaxies in the same group; we derive a total star formation rate of 2.6x10^-3
M_sun/yr in the tidal feature. We also present new high-resolution imaging of
the molecular gas distribution in the tidal arm using CO observations obtained
with the OVRO interferometer. We recover about one sixth of the CO flux (or
M_H2~2x10^6 M_sun, assuming a Galactic conversion factor) originally detected
in the IRAM 30m single dish observations, indicating the presence of a diffuse
molecular gas component in the tidal arm. The brightest CO peak in the
interferometer map (comprising half of the detected CO flux) is coincident with
one of the brightest HII regions in the feature. Assuming a constant star
formation rate since the creation of the tidal feature (presumably ~3x10^8
years ago), a total mass of ~7x10^5 M_sun has been transformed from gas into
stars. Over this period, the star formation in the tidal arm has resulted in an
additional enrichment of Delta(Z)>0.002. The reservoir of atomic and molecular
gas in the tidal arm is ~3x10^8 M_sun, allowing star formation to continue at
its present rate for a Hubble time. Such wide-spread, low-level star formation
would be difficult to image around more distant galaxies but may be detectable
through intervening absorption in quasar spectra.

initial metallicity of Z=10^{-8}, masses between 9 and 85 solar masses and fast
initial rotation velocities (V_{ini}=600-800 km/s).
  The most interesting models are the models with Z=10^{-8} ([Fe/H]~-6.6). In
the course of helium burning, carbon and oxygen are mixed into the hydrogen
burning shell. This boosts the importance of the shell and causes a reduction
of the CO core mass. Later in the evolution, the hydrogen shell deepens and
produces large amount of primary nitrogen. For the most massive models (M>~60
solar masses), significant mass loss occurs during the red supergiant stage.
This mass loss is due to the surface enrichment in CNO elements via rotational
and convective mixing. The 85 solar mass model ends up as a WO type Wolf-Rayet
star. Therefore the models predict SNe of type Ic and possibly long and soft
GRBs at very low metallicities.
  The rotating 20 solar mass models can best reproduce the observed CNO
abundances at the surface of extremely metal poor (EMP) stars and the
metallicity trends when their angular momentum content is the same as at solar
metallicity (and therefore have an increasing surface velocity with decreasing
metallicity). The wind of the massive star models can also reproduce the CNO
abundances of the most metal-poor carbon-rich star known to date, HE1327-2326.

radio-loud flat-spectrum AGN with compact relativistic outflows detected at
parsec scales. The source counts of compact AGN shows that the MOJAVE sample

flat-spectrum quasars of the sample reveals that the pc-scale jets of quasars
have intrinsic luminosities in the range between ~10^24 W/Hz and ~10^27 W/Hz
and Lorentz factors distributed between 3 and 30. We find that the apparent
speed (or Lorentz factor) of jets evolves with redshift, increasing from z~0 to
z~1 and then falling at higher redshifts (z~2.5) by a factor of 2.5. The
evolution of apparent speeds does not affect significantly the evolution of the
beamed luminosity function of quasars, which is most likely to be dependent on
the evolution of radio luminosity. Furthermore, the beamed radio luminosity
function suggests that the intrinsic luminosity function of quasars has a
double power-law form: it is flat at low luminosities and steep at high
luminosities. There is a positive evolution of quasars at low redshifts (z<0.5)
and strong negative evolution at redshifts >1.7 with space density decline up
to z~2.5. This implies that the powerful jets were more populous at redshifts
between 0.5 and 1.7. We show that the evolution of compact quasars is
luminosity dependent and it depends strongly on the speed of the jet suggesting
that there are two distinct populations of quasars with slow and fast jets

alpha=-1.4 consistent with most previous studies. While phi* is comparable to

least. Using the conservative slope -1.4, we find a LD at 1700A
rho(M<-18.5)=2.4 10 19 W Mpc-3 and rho Tot=3.1 10 19 W Mpc-3, comparable to
that estimated in other studies. The unexpectedly large number of very bright
galaxies found in the VVDS indicates that the color-selection and photo-z
techniques that are generally used to build high-z galaxy samples may be
affected by a significant fraction of color-measurement failures or by
incomplete modelling of the mix of stellar emission, AGN contribution, dust
absorption and intergalactic extinction assumed to identify high-z galaxies,
making pure magnitude selection better able to trace the full population.
Because of the difficulty to identify all low-luminosity galaxies in a
spectroscopic survey, the LD could still be significantly underestimated. We
also find that the relative contribution of the most luminous galaxies compared
to the fainter ones is at least twice as large in the VVDS compared to former
estimates. Therefore, the VVDS paints a quite different picture of the role of
the most actively star-forming galaxies in the history of star formation.

relatively accurate abundance values also for carbon and nitrogen. The
comparison of the abundance ratios of C, N, O and Fe in the ISM of M 87 with
those in the stellar population of our Galaxy shows that the relative
contribution of core-collapse supernovae to the enrichment of the ISM in M 87
is significantly less than in the Milky Way and indicates that the enrichment
of the ISM by iron through Type Ia supernovae and by carbon and nitrogen is
occurring in parallel. This suggests that the main source of carbon and
nitrogen in M 87 are the low- and intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch
stars. From the oxygen to iron abundance ratio in the hot gas we estimate that
the relative number of core collapse and type Ia supernovae contributing to the
enrichment of the ISM in the core of M 87 is ~60% and ~40% respectively. The
spatial distributions of iron and oxygen are different. While the oxygen
abundance distribution is flat the iron abundance peaks in the core and has a

small damage of its protective layer. The crossover from an initial regime of
slow corrosion rate (pit nucleation) to a regime of rapid corrosion
(propagation of the pit) takes place at the incubation time. The model is
defined in a lattice whose sites represent the possible states of the metal
(bulk, reactive and passive) and the solution (neutral, acidic or basic).
Probabilistic rules describe passivation of the metal surface, dissolution of
the passive layer, which is enhanced in acidic media, and spatially separated
electrochemical reactions, which may create pH inhomogeneities in the solution.
  From a suitable matching of characteristic times of creation and annihilation
of pH inhomogeneities in the solution, a scaling theory gives the average
radius of the dissolved region at the incubation time as a function of the
model parameters. That radius decreases with the rate of spatially separated
reactions and the rate of dissolution in acidic media, and increases with the
diffusion coefficient of H+ and OH- ions in solution. The average incubation
time is written as the sum of a series of characteristic times for the slow
dissolution in neutral media. It linearly increases with the rate of
dissolution in neutral media, under the reasonable assumption that this is the
slowest rate of the process. The results are confirmed by numerical simulation
in two-dimensional lattices, but extension to three dimensions is discussed.

and perovskite oxides (SrTiO$_{3}$, BaTiO$_{3}$). It is well suited for
materials with a strong component of ionic binding and especially for ""ionic""

importance of both of these states at the Fermi energy. Starting from an

sheaf theory. A coloured net is a sheaf-cosheaf pair over a Petri space and a
morphism between coloured nets is a morphism between such pairs. Coloured nets
and their morphisms form a category. We prove the existence of a product in the
subcategory of sort-respecting morphisms. After introducing markings our
concepts generalize to coloured Petri nets.

  Memoryless Channels","Submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory (40 pages,
  10 figures)",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  This paper derives an improved sphere-packing (ISP) bound for finite-length
codes whose transmission takes place over symmetric memoryless channels. We
first review classical results, i.e., the 1959 sphere-packing (SP59) bound of
Shannon for the Gaussian channel, and the 1967 sphere-packing (SP67) bound of
Shannon et al. for discrete memoryless channels. A recent improvement on the
SP67 bound, as suggested by Valembois and Fossorier, is also discussed. These
concepts are used for the derivation of a new lower bound on the decoding error
probability (referred to as the ISP bound) which is uniformly tighter than the
SP67 bound and its recent improved version. The ISP bound is applicable to
symmetric memoryless channels, and some of its applications are exemplified.
Its tightness is studied by comparing it with bounds on the ML decoding error
probability, and computer simulations of iteratively decoded turbo-like codes.
The paper also presents a technique which performs the entire calculation of
the SP59 bound in the logarithmic domain, thus facilitating the exact
calculation of this bound for moderate to large block lengths without the need
for the asymptotic approximations provided by Shannon.

two-dimensional genus-zero holomorphic N=2 superconformal field theory, we
define the moduli space of N=2 super-Riemann spheres with oriented and ordered
half-infinite tubes (or equivalently, oriented and ordered punctures, and local
superconformal coordinates vanishing at the punctures), modulo N=2
superconformal equivalence. We develop a formal theory of infinitesimal N=2
superconformal transformations based on a representation of the N=2
Neveu-Schwarz algebra in terms of superderivations. In particular, via these
infinitesimals we present the Lie supergroup of N=2 superprojective
transformations of the N=2 super-Riemann sphere. We give a reformulation of the
moduli space in terms of these infinitesimals. We introduce generalized N=2
super-Riemann spheres with tubes and discuss some group structures associated
to certain moduli spaces of both generalized and non-generalized N=2
super-Riemann spheres. We define an action of the symmetric groups on the
moduli space. Lastly we discuss the nonhomogeneous (versus homogeneous)
coordinate system associated to N=2 superconformal structures and the
corresponding results in this coordinate system.

filtration of a symmetric group module are well-defined precisely when the
characteristic is at least five. This result suggested the possibility of a
symmetric group theory analogous to that of good filtrations and tilting
modules for $GL_n(k)$. This paper is an initial attempt at such a theory. We
obtain two sufficient conditions that ensure a module has a Specht filtration,
and a formula for the filtration multiplicities. We then study the categories
of modules that satisfy the conditions, in the process obtaining a new result
on Specht module cohomology.
  Next we consider symmetric group modules that have both Specht and dual
Specht filtrations. Unlike tilting modules for $GL_n(k)$, these modules need
not be self-dual, and there is no nice tensor product theorem. We prove a
correspondence between indecomposable self-dual modules with Specht filtrations
and a collection of $GL_n(k)$-modules which behave like tilting modules under
the tilting functor. We give some evidence that indecomposable self-dual
symmetric group modules with Specht filtrations may be self-dual trivial source
modules.

that is not visited by drifters that are released outside of the region. This
so-called ``forbidden zone'' (FZ) suggests the existence of a persistent

letter a year-long record of surface currents produced by a Hybrid-Coordinate
Ocean Model simulation of the WFS is used to identify Lagrangian coherent
structures (LCSs), which reveal the presence of a robust and persistent
cross-shelf transport barrier in approximately the same location as the
boundary of the FZ. The location of the cross-shelf transport barrier undergoes
a seasonal oscillation, being closer to the coast in the summer than in the
winter. A month-long record of surface currents inferred from high-frequency
(HF) radar measurements in a roughly 60 km $\times$ 80 km region on the WFS off
Tampa Bay is also used to identify LCSs, which reveal the presence of robust
transient transport barriers. While the HF-radar-derived transport barriers
cannot be unambiguously linked to the boundary of the FZ, this analysis does
demonstrate the feasibility of monitoring transport barriers on the WFS using a
HF-radar-based measurement system. The implications of a persistent cross-shelf
transport barrier on the WFS for the development of harmful algal blooms on the
shoreward side of the barrier are considered.

the atoms to be trapped by a rf field RF1, the cooling procedure is facilitated
using a second rf source RF2. This second rf field produces a controlled
coupling between the spin states dressed by RF1. The evaporation is then
possible in a pulsed or continuous mode. In the pulsed case, atoms with a given
energy are transferred into untrapped dressed states by abruptly switching off
the interaction. In the continuous case, it is possible for energetic atoms to
adiabatically follow the doubly-dressed states and escape out of the trap. Our
results also show that when the frequencies of the fields RF1 and RF2 are
separated by at least the Rabi frequency associated with RF1, additional

system with no excited states, so that all possible states of the particle are
just kinematical modifications of any one of them. In this way instead of
describing the particle attributes it amounts to describe the collection of
consecutive inertial observers who describe the particle in the same
kinematical state. The kinematical state space of an elementary particle is a
homogeneous space of the kinematical group.By considering the largest
homogeneous spaces of both, Galilei and Poincare groups, it is shown how the
spin structure is related to the different degrees of freedom. Finally, the
spacetime symmetry group of a relativistic particle which satisfies Dirac's
equation when quantized, is enlarged to take into account additional symmetries
like spacetime dilations and local rotations. An interaction Lagrangian
invariant under this enlarged group is proposed and the compound system of two
Dirac particles is analyzed.

the same situation will occur from one time to another. Contrary to what is
common in models of repeated games in the literature, most real situations may
differ a lot and they are seldom completely symmetric. The purpose of this
paper is to discuss a simple model of cognitive processing in the context of a
repeated interaction with varying payoffs. The interaction between players is
modelled by a repeated game with random observable payoffs. Cooperation is not
simply associated with a certain action but needs to be understood as a
phenomenon of the behaviour in the repeated game. The players are thus faced
with a more complex situation, compared to the Prisoner's Dilemma that has been
widely used for investigating the conditions for cooperation in evolving
populations. Still, there are robust cooperating strategies that usually evolve
in a population of players. In the cooperative mode, these strategies select an
action that allows for maximizing the sum of the payoff of the two players in
each round, regardless of the own payoff. Two such players maximise the
expected total long-term payoff. If the opponent deviates from this scheme, the
strategy invokes a punishment action, which aims at lowering the opponent's
score for the rest of the (possibly infinitely) repeated game. The introduction
of mistakes to the game actually pushes evolution towards more cooperative
strategies even though the game becomes more difficult.

genuine tripartite, W-state like and bipartite entanglement, for three qubit
composite system. To illustrate the point, entanglement of three qubit GHZ

While genuine N-partite entanglement of a composite system is generated by
N-way coherences, N-partite entanglement in general can be present due to
(K<N)-way coherences as well.

without the photon absorbed under the imperfect interaction as a power series
in 1/N, and show the following result: Even if the interaction between the
object and the photon is imperfect, we can let the success probability P of the
IFM get close to unity arbitrarily by making the reflectivity of the beam
splitter larger and increasing the number of the beam splitters. Moreover, we
obtain an approximating equation of P for large N from the derived power series

the classical measurement record does not automatically imply the presence of
quantum correlations in the system under investigation. In this work we explore
the question of when correlations, or other measurement data, are sufficient to
guarantee the existence of a certain amount of quantum correlations in the
system and when additional information, such as the degree of purity of the
system, is needed to do so. Various measurement settings are discussed, both
numerically and analytically. Exact results and lower bounds on the least
