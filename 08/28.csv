walk, Einstein in 1905 derived an equation describing the diffusion of the
particle's probability distribution in configuration space. Fokker and Planck
extended this work to describe the velocity distribution of the particles.
Their equation and its solutions have been applied to many problems in nature
starting with the motion of Brownian particles in a liquid. Chandrasekhar
derived the Fokker-Planck equation for stars and showed that long-range
gravitational encounters provide a drag force, dynamical friction, which is
important in the evolution of star clusters and the formation of galaxies. In
certain circumstances, Fokker-Planck evolution also describes the evolution of
dark (invisible) matter in the universe. In the early universe, the thermal
decoupling of weakly interacting massive particles from the plasma of
relativistic leptons and photons is governed by Fokker-Planck evolution. The
resulting dissipation imprints a minimum length scale for cosmic density
fluctuations. Still later, these density fluctuations produce stochastic
gravitational forces on the dark matter as it begins to cluster under gravity.
The latter example provides an exact derivation of the Fokker-Planck equation
without the usual assumption of Markovian dynamics.

matter density perturbations: the relative gravitational time delay between a
pair of light paths converging towards an observer and originating from two
points on the last scattering surface separated by the physical scale of an
acoustic oscillation. It is found that time delay biases the size of acoustic
oscillations {\it systematically} towards smaller angles, or larger harmonic
numbers $\ell$, i.e. the mean geometry as revealed by CMB light becomes that of
an open Universe if $\Omega=1$. Since the effect is second order, its standard
deviation $\delta\ell/\ell \sim (\delta\Phi)^2$ where $(\delta\Phi)^2 \sim
10^{-9}$ is the normalization of the primordial matter spectrum $P(k)$, the
consequence is too numerically feeble to warrant a re-interpretion of WMAP
data. If, however, this normalization were increased to $\delta\Phi \gtrsim
0.01$ which is still well within the perturbation limit, the shift in the
positions of the acoustic peaks would have been substantial enough to implicate
inflationary $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Thus $\Omega$ is not the only parameter
(and by deduction inflation cannot be the only mechanism) of relevance to the
understanding of {\it observed} large scale geometry. The physics that explains
why $\delta\Phi$ is so small also plays a crucial role, but since this is a
separate issue independent of inflation, might it be less artificial to look
for an alternative solution to the flatness problem altogether?

and gas fraction, lowering the effective yield. Low effective yields in
galaxies with rotation speeds < 120 km/s have been widely interpreted as the
onset of SN-driven winds below a characteristic galaxy mass, but gas accretion
is also a viable explanation. However, calculations presented here prove: (1)
that metal-enriched outflows are the only mechanism that can significantly
reduce the effective yield, but only for gas-rich systems; (2) that it is
nearly impossible to reduce the effective yield of a gas-poor system, no matter
how much gas is lost or accreted; and (3) that any subsequent star formation
drives the effective yield back to the closed-box value. Thus, only gas-rich
systems with low star formation rates (such as dwarf irregulars) can produce
and maintain low effective yields, while massive gas-poor galaxies can never
show low effective yields, even after experiencing substantial infall and/or
outflow. The drop in effective yield seen in low mass galaxies is therefore
less likely to be due to the onset of SN-driven winds than to the galaxies'
surface densities falling entirely below the Kennicutt SF threshold. Additional
calculations confirm that the fraction of baryonic mass lost through winds
varies only weakly with galaxy mass, shows no sharp upturn at any mass scale,
and does not require that >15% of baryons have been lost by galaxies of any
mass. SN feedback is therefore unlikely to be effective for removing large
amounts of gas from low mass disk galaxies. In addition, the dependence between
metal-loss and galaxy mass is sufficiently weak that massive galaxies dominate
metal enrichment of the IGM. The calculations in this paper provide limiting
cases for any arbitrary chemical evolution history, as proven in an Appendix.

surveys have been recognized as a feasible method to detect transiting hot
Jupiters. Many transit surveys are now under way, with instruments ranging from
10-cm cameras to the Hubble Space Telescope. However, the results of these
surveys have been much below the expected capacity, estimated in the dozens of
detections per year. One of the reasons is the presence of systematics (``red
noise'') in photometric time series. In general, yield predictions assume
uncorrelated noise (``white noise''). In this paper, we show that the effect of
red noise on the detection threshold and the expected yields cannot be
neglected in typical ground-based surveys. We develop a simple method to
determine the effect of red noise on photometric planetary transit detections.
This method can be applied to determine detection thresholds for transit
surveys. We show that the detection threshold in the presence of systematics
can be much higher than with the assumption of white noise, and obeys a
different dependence on magnitude, orbital period and the parameters of the
survey. Our method can also be used to estimate the significance level of a
planetary transit candidate (to select promising candidates for spectroscopic
follow-up). We apply our method to the OGLE planetary transit search, and show
that it provides a reliable description of the actual detectionthreshold with
real correlated noise. We point out in what way the presence of red noise could
be at least partly responsible for the dearth of transiting planet detections
from existing surveys, and examine some possible adaptations in survey planning
and strategy. Finally, we estimate the photometric stability necessary to the
detection of transiting ``hot Neptunes''.

the sample enters the ``mixed valence'' regime, where different charge states

conducting polymers. We concentrate on the study of the effects of temperature
on characteristics of the transport. We treat a conducting polymers in a metal
state as a network of metallic-like grains connected by electron quantum
tunneling via intermediate state localized on a polymer chain between the
grains. To analyze the effects of temperature on this kind of electron
intergrain transport we represent the thermal environment as a phonon bath
coupled to the intermediate state. The electron transmission is computed using
the Buttiker model within the scattering matrix formalism. This approach is
further developed, and the dephasing parameter is expessed in terms of relevant
energies including the thermal energy. It is shown that temperature
dependencies of both current and conductance associated with the above
transport mechanism differ from those typical for other conduction mechanisms
in conducting polymers. This could be useful to separate out the contribution
from the intergrain electron tunneling to the net electric current in transport
experiments on various polymer nanofibers. The proposed model could be used to
analyze inelastic electron transport through molecular junctions.

further show that this sequence is reproduced and extended in simulations of

composition different relaxation scenarios are observed for the small

stretching. Only small quantitative differences are observed between dynamic
features for large and small particles. On the contrary, large disparity
induces a clear time scale separation between the large and the small
particles. Density-density correlators for the small particles become extremely
stretched, and display logarithmic relaxation by properly tuning the
temperature or the wavevector. Self-correlators decay much faster than
density-density correlators. For very large size disparity, a complete
separation between self- and collective dynamics is observed for the small

correlations are frozen. The dynamic picture obtained by varying the size
disparity resembles features associated to Mode Coupling transition lines of
the types B and A at, respectively, small and very large size disparity. Both
lines might merge, at some intermediate disparity, at a higher-order point, to

breaking of the gauge symmetry implies that the corresponding chemical
potential must be taken as zero, unless it is introduced before breaking the

having two modes, one of them being the free-particle quadratic in momentum

analysing properties of heap data has not reached the same level of maturity as
the analysis of static and stack data. The spatial and temporal structure of
stack and static data is well understood while that of heap data seems
arbitrary and is unbounded. We devise bounded representations which summarize
properties of the heap data. This summarization is based on the structure of
the program which manipulates the heap. The resulting summary representations
are certain kinds of graphs called access graphs. The boundedness of these
representations and the monotonicity of the operations to manipulate them make
it possible to compute them through data flow analysis.
  An important application which benefits from heap reference analysis is
garbage collection, where currently liveness is conservatively approximated by
reachability from program variables. As a consequence, current garbage
collectors leave a lot of garbage uncollected, a fact which has been confirmed
by several empirical studies. We propose the first ever end-to-end static
analysis to distinguish live objects from reachable objects. We use this
information to make dead objects unreachable by modifying the program. This
application is interesting because it requires discovering data flow
information representing complex semantics. In particular, we discover four
properties of heap data: liveness, aliasing, availability, and anticipability.
Together, they cover all combinations of directions of analysis (i.e. forward
and backward) and confluence of information (i.e. union and intersection). Our
analysis can also be used for plugging memory leaks in C/C++ languages.

bare masses of pions and kaons are obtained, as well as an estimate of the mass
of the \eta_8. The former are found to dominate the physical pseudoscalar
masses. We then match to the self-energies from Chiral Perturbation Theory
(CHPT) to O(p^4), and a robust relation between several O(p^4) CHPT
counterterms is obtained. We also resum higher orders from our calculated
self-energies. By taking into account values determined from previous chiral
phenomenological studies of m_s/\hat{m} and 3L_7+L^r_8, we determine a tighter
region of favoured values for the O(p^4) CHPT counterterms 2L^r_6-L^r_4 and
2L^r_8-L^r_5. This determination perfectly overlaps with the recent
determinations to O(p^6) in CHPT. We warn about a likely reduction in the value
of m_s/\hat{m} by higher loop diagrams and that this is not systematically
accounted for by present lattice extrapolations. We also provide a favoured
interval of values for m_s/\hat{m} and 3L_7+L^r_8.

non-perturbative decay of the flat direction via preheating is an unlikely
event. In order to address this issue, first we identify the physical degrees
of freedom and their masses in presence of a large flat direction VEV (Vacuum
Expectation Value). We explicitly show that the (complex) flat direction and
its fermionic partner are the only light {\it physical} fields in the spectrum.
If the flat direction VEV is much larger than the weak scale, and it has a
rotational motion, there will be no resonant particle production at all. The
case of multiple flat directions is more involved. We illustrate that in many
cases of physical interest, the situation becomes effectively the same as that
of a single flat direction, or collection of independent single directions. In
such cases preheating is not relevant. In an absence of a fast non-perturbative
decay, the flat direction survives long enough to affect thermalization in
supersymmetric models as described in hep-ph/0505050 and hep-ph/0512227. It can
also ``terminate'' an early stage of non-perturbative inflaton decay as
discussed in hep-ph/0603244.

geometrical effect modifies the standard exponential suppression of the decay
rate, substituting it with a power one, with the exponent becoming very large
in the semiclassical regime. This result is compared with the power-like
behavior of the discontinuity in the specific energy of the dynamical lattice
Ising model. The last problem is far from being semiclassical, and the
corresponding exponent was found to be 3/2. This exponent is expected to govern
any gravitational decay into a vacuum without massless excitations. We
conjecture also an exact relation between the exponent in this power-law
suppression and the central charge of the stable phase.

the following property: Any norm-preserving asymptotically Lipschitz function
$f'\colon A\to \R^{m+1}$, $A\subset X$, extends to a norm-preserving

characterized the dimension of the Higson corona $\nu(X)$ of $X$ is the
smallest integer $n\ge 0$ such that $\R^{n+1}$ is an absolute extensor of $X$

They must include such a non-exponential behaviour to be realistic.
