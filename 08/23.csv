the two imposes constraints on the particle number density, and hence the jet

only two which have sufficient resolution in the radio images to give

conduction is important for low accretion rate systems where the electron
cooling time is longer than the conduction time of the plasma, such as Sgr A*
in the Galactic Center. For accretion flows with density profiles similar to
the Bondi solution (n[r] ~ r^[-3/2]), we show that heat conduction leads to
super-virial temperatures, implying that conduction significantly modifies the
dynamics of the accretion flow. We then self-consistently solve for the
dynamics of spherical accretion in the presence of saturated conduction and
electron heating. We find that the accretion rate onto the central object can
be reduced by ~1-3 orders of magnitude relative to the canonical Bondi rate.
Electron conduction may thus be an important ingredient in explaining the low
radiative efficiencies and low accretion rates inferred from observations of
low-luminosity galactic nuclei. The solutions presented in this paper may also
describe the nonlinear saturation of the magnetothermal instability in hot
accretion flows.

The clouds, which we treat as spherical, can expand and contract homologously.
Photoionization drives mass ejection; the recoil of cloud material both stirs
turbulent motions and leads to an effective confining pressure. The balance
between these effects and the decay of turbulent motions through isothermal
shocks determines clouds' dynamical and energetic evolution. We find that for
realistic values of the rates of turbulent dissipation, photoevaporation, and
energy injection by HII regions, the massive clouds where most molecular gas in
the Galaxy resides live for a few crossing times, in good agreement with recent
observational estimates that large clouds in local group galaxies survive
roughly 20-30 Myr. During this time clouds remain close to equilibrium, with
virial parameters of 1-3 and column densities near 10^22 H atoms cm^-2, also in
agreement with observed cloud properties. Over their lives they convert 5-10%
of their mass into stars, after which point most clouds are destroyed when a

inclination corrections. Long-slit spectroscopy yields usable H-alpha rotation
curves for 162 galaxies. Observational errors, including distance errors due to
peculiar velocities, are small compared to the intrinsic scatter of the TF

mag/log(km/s) in the g-band to -6.6 +/- 0.2 mag/log(km/s) in the z-band. The
intrinsic scatter is approximately 0.4 mag in all bands. The scatter is not
dominated by rare outliers or by any particular class of galaxies, though it
drops slightly, to 0.36 mag, if we restrict the sample to nearly bulgeless
systems. Correlations of TF residuals with other galaxy properties are weak:
bluer galaxies are significantly brighter than average in the g-band but only
marginally brighter in the i-band; more concentrated galaxies are slightly
fainter than average; and the TF residual is virtually independent of
half-light radius, contrary to the trend expected for gravitationally dominant
disks. The observed residual correlations do not account for most of the
intrinsic scatter, implying that this scatter is instead driven largely by
variations in the ratio of dark to luminous matter within the disk galaxy
population.

function of luminosity, using a sample of approximately 80,000 galaxies drawn
from Data Release 4 (DR4) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We separate
brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) from our main sample and reanalyze their
photometry due to a problem with the default pipeline sky subtraction for BCGs.
The observables we consider are effective radius (R_e), velocity dispersion
(sigma), dynamical mass (M_dyn ~ R_e sigma2), effective density (sigma2/R_e2),
and effective surface brightness (mu_e). With the exception of the L-M_dyn
correlation, we find evidence of variations in the slope (i.e. the power-law
index) of the fundamental plane projections with luminosity for our normal
elliptical galaxy population. In particular, the radius-luminosity and
Faber-Jackson relations are steeper at high luminosity relative to low
luminosity, and the more luminous ellipticals become progressively less dense
and have lower surface brightnesses than lower luminosity ellipticals. These
variations can be understood as arising from differing formation histories,
with more luminous galaxies having less dissipation. Data from the literature
and our reanalysis of BCGs show that BCGs have radius-luminosity and
Faber-Jackson relations steeper than the brightest non-BCG ellipticals in our
sample, consistent with significant growth of BCGs via dissipationless mergers.
The variations in slope we find in the Faber-Jackson relation of non-BCGs are
qualitatively similar to that reported in the black hole mass-velocity
dispersion (M_BH-sigma) correlation. This similarity is consistent with a
roughly constant value of M_BH/M_star over a wide range of early type galaxies,
where M_star is the stellar mass.

the SHADES survey cover a total area of 460 sq. arcmin to a range of depths.
However combining the results from these surveys has hitherto been complicated
by the fact that different survey groups have used different methods of data
reduction and source extraction. Here we present the results of re-reducing and
analysing all of these blank field SCUBA in an almost identical manner to that
employed in the SCUBA 8-mJy Survey. Comparative source catalogues are given
which include a number of new significant source detections as well as failing
to confirm some of those objects previously published. These new source
catalogues have been combined to produce the most accurate number counts to
date from 2 to 12.5 mJy. The cumulative number counts appear to steepen beyond
S(850)=8mJy, which could indicate an intrinsic turn-over in the underlying
luminosity function placing an upper limit on the luminosity (and hence mass)
of a high redshift galaxy. We have also investigated the clustering properties
of the bright SCUBA population by means of 2-point angular correlation
functions. We find evidence for strong clustering broadly consistent with that
measured for Extremely Red Objects (EROs). Nearest-neighbour analyses further
support strong clustering on arcmin scales, rejecting the null hypothesis that
the distribution of the bright submm sources is random at the 99% confidence
level.

radio-quiet compact central objects in supernova remnants. It has been found
that 1E 1207.4-5209 is not spinning down monotonically suggesting that this
neutron star undergoes strong, frequent glitches, contains a fall-back disk, or
possess a binary companion. Here, we report on a sequence of seven XMM-Newton
observations of 1E 1207.4-5209 performed during a 40 day window in June/July
2005. Due to unanticipated variance in the phase measurements beyond the
statistical uncertainties, we could not identify a unique phase-coherent timing
solution. The three most probable timing solutions give frequency time
derivatives of +0.9, -2.6, and +1.6 X 10^(-12) Hz/s (listed in descending order
of significance). We conclude that the local frequency derivative during our
XMM-Newton observing campaign differs from the long-term spin-down rate by more
than an order of magnitude, effectively ruling out glitch models for 1E
1207.4-5209. If the long-term spin frequency variations are caused by timing
noise, the strength of the timing noise in 1E 1207.4-5209 is much stronger than
in other pulsars with similar period derivatives. Therefore, it is highly
unlikely that the spin variations are caused by the same physical process that
causes timing noise in other isolated pulsars. The most plausible scenario for
the observed spin irregularities is the presence of a binary companion to 1E
1207.4-5209. We identified a family of orbital solutions that are consistent
with our phase-connected timing solution, archival frequency measurements, and
constraints on the companions mass imposed by deep IR and optical observations.

driving force, we consider a polymer which is initially placed in the middle of
the pore and study the escape time $\tau_e$ required for the polymer to
completely exit the pore on either side. The distribution of the escape times
is wide and has a long tail. We find that $\tau_e$ scales with the chain length
$N$ as $\tau_e \sim N^{1+2\nu}$, where $\nu $ is the Flory exponent. For driven
translocation, we concentrate on the influence of the friction coefficient
$\xi$, the driving force $E$ and the length of the chain $N$ on the
translocation time $\tau$, which is defind as the time duration between the
first monomer entering the pore and the last monomer leaving the pore. For
strong driving forces, the distribution of translocation times is symmetric and
narrow without a long tail and $\tau \sim E^{-1}$. The influence of $\xi$
depends on the ratio between the driving and frictional forces. For
intermediate $\xi$, we find a crossover scaling for $\tau$ with $N$ from $\tau
\sim N^{2\nu}$ for relatively short chains to $\tau \sim N^{1 + \nu}$ for
longer chains. However, for higher $\xi$, only $\tau \sim N^{1 + \nu}$ is
observed even for short chains, and there is no crossover behavior. This result
can be explained by the fact that increasing $\xi$ increases the Rouse
relaxation time of the chain, in which case even relatively short chains have
no time to relax during translocation. Our results are in good agreement with
previous simulations based on the fluctuating bond lattice model of polymers at
intermediate friction values, but reveals additional features of dependency on
friction.

  a general theory and first principles calculations for copper","13 pages, 5 figures; Accepted in Phys. Rev. B",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.74.155416",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  First principles calculations of the Sigma 5 (310)[001] symmetric tilt grain
boundary in Cu with Bi, Na, and Ag substitutional impurities provide evidence
that in the phenomenon of Bi embrittlement of Cu grain boundaries electronic
effects do not play a major role; on the contrary, the embrittlement is mostly
a structural or ""size"" effect. Na is predicted to be nearly as good an
embrittler as Bi, whereas Ag does not embrittle the boundary in agreement with
experiment. While we reject the prevailing view that ""electronic"" effects
(i.e., charge transfer) are responsible for embrittlement, we do not exclude
the role of chemistry. However numerical results show a striking equivalence
between the alkali metal Na and the semi metal Bi, small differences being
accounted for by their contrasting ""size"" and ""softness"" (defined here). In
order to separate structural and chemical effects unambiguously if not
uniquely, we model the embrittlement process by taking the system of grain
boundary and free surfaces through a sequence of precisely defined gedanken
processes; each of these representing a putative mechanism. We thereby identify
three mechanisms of embrittlement by substitutional impurities, two of which
survive in the case of embrittlement or cohesion enhancement by interstitials.
Two of the three are purely structural and the third contains both structural
and chemical elements that by their very nature cannot be further unravelled.
We are able to take the systems we study through each of these stages by
explicit computer simulations and assess the contribution of each to the nett
reduction in intergranular cohesion. The conclusion we reach is that
embrittlement by both Bi and Na is almost exclusively structural in origin;
that is, the embrittlement is a size effect.

networks in a rich scattering environment. We develop schemes to optimize the
ratio, $\rho(n)$ of achievable network sum capacity to the sum of the
point-to-point capacities of source-destinations pairs operating in isolation.
For fixed SNR networks, i.e., where the worst case SNR over the
source-destination pairs is fixed independent of $n$, we show that
collaborative strategies yield a scaling law of $\rho(n) = {\cal
O}(\frac{1}{n^{1/3}})$ in contrast to multi-hop strategies which yield a
scaling law of $\rho(n) = {\cal O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$. While, networks where
worst case SNR goes to zero, do not preclude the possibility of collaboration,
multi-hop strategies achieve optimal throughput. The plausible reason is that
the gains due to collaboration cannot offset the effect of vanishing receive
SNR. This suggests that for fixed SNR networks, a network designer should look
for network protocols that exploit collaboration. The fact that most current
networks operate in a fixed SNR interference limited environment provides
further motivation for considering this regime.

very-extended Kac-Moody algebras in relation with theories of gravity coupled
to matter. In the first part, we focus on the occurrence of KM algebras in the
cosmological billiards. We analyse the billiards in the simplified situation of
spatially homogeneous cosmologies. The most generic cases lead to the same
algebras as those met in the general inhomogeneous case, but also sub-algebras
of the ""generic"" ones appear. Next, we consider particular gravitational
theories which, upon toroidal compactification to D=3 space-time dimensions,
reduce to a theory of gravity coupled to a symmetric space non-linear
sigma-model. We show that the billiard analysis gives direct information on
possible dimensional oxidations (or on their obstructions) and field content of
the oxidation endpoint. We also consider all hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras and
completely answer the question of whether or not a specific theory exists
admitting a billiard characterised by the given hyperbolic algebra. In the
second part, we turn to the set up of such gravity-matter theories through the
building of an action explicitly invariant under a Kac-Moody group. As a first
step to include fermions, we check the compatibility of the presence of a Dirac
fermion with the (hidden duality) symmetries appearing in the toroidal
compactification down to 3 space-time dimensions. Next, we investigate how the
fermions (with spin 1/2 or 3/2) fit in the conjecture for hidden over-extended
symmetry G++. Finally, in the context of G+++ invariant actions, we derive all
the possible signatures for all the GB++ theories that can be obtained from the
conventional one (1,D-1) by ""dualities"" generated by Weyl reflections. This

recent years, especially on various models of random graphs (including small
world and scale free networks). They model a variety of phenomena, including
the spread of information on the Internet; the outbreak of epidemics in a
spatially structured population; and communication between randomly dispersed
processors in an ad hoc wireless network. Typically, research has concentrated
on the existence and size of a large connected component (representing, say,
the size of the epidemic) in a percolation model, or uses differential
equations to study the dynamics using a mean-field approximation in an infinite
graph. Here we investigate the time taken for information to propagate from a
single source through a finite network, as a function of the number of nodes
and the network topology. We assume that time is discrete, and that nodes
attempt to transmit to their neighbors in parallel, with a given probability of
success. We solve this problem exactly for several specific topologies, and use
a large-deviation theorem to derive general asymptotic bounds, which apply to
any family of networks where the diameter grows at least logarithmically in the
number of nodes. We use these bounds, for example, to show that a scale-free
network has propagation time logarithmic in the number of nodes, and inversely
proportional to the transmission probability.

for this equation. While our main concern is a convergence result, we also have
to extend Otto's notion of entropy solutions to conservation laws with a source

the initial and boundary data are essentially bounded, we can establish
convergence to the entropy solution. Showing that the numerical solutions are
bounded we can extract a weak*-convergent subsequence. Identifying its limit as
an entropy process solution requires some effort as we cannot use Kruzkov-type

identify the numerical entropy flux for an arbitrary entropy pair. By the

the principle of penalization to Partial Least Squares (PLS). Starting with a
generalized additive model, we expand the additive component of each variable
in terms of a generous amount of B-Splines basis functions. In order to prevent
overfitting and to obtain smooth functions, we estimate the regression model by
applying a penalized version of PLS. Although our motivation for penalized PLS
stems from its use for B-Splines transformed data, the proposed approach is
very general and can be applied to other penalty terms or to other dimension
reduction techniques. It turns out that penalized PLS can be computed virtually
as fast as PLS. We prove a close connection of penalized PLS to the solutions
of preconditioned linear systems. In the case of high-dimensional data, the new
method is shown to be an attractive competitor to other techniques for
estimating generalized additive models. If the number of predictor variables is
high compared to the number of examples, traditional techniques often suffer
from overfitting. We illustrate that penalized PLS performs well in these
situations.

available potential energy (CAPE), due to its influence on updraft strength,

is examined in the framework of 3D incompressible Hall MHD turbulence. The Hall
term added to the standard MHD equations makes the Alfv\'en waves dispersive

understanding the cooperative nature of neural computation. Research over the
last few years has shown that Granger causality is a key technique to furnish
this capability. The main goal of this article is to provide an expository
introduction to the concept of Granger causality. Mathematical frameworks for
both bivariate Granger causality and conditional Granger causality are
developed in detail with particular emphasis on their spectral representations.

entropies of a given many-fermion state and the free state that has the same
1-particle statistics. It also equals the relative entropy of the two states in
question, i.e., it is the entropy of the given state relative to the
corresponding free state. The nonfreeness of a pure state is the same as its
""particle-hole symmetric correlation entropy"", a variant of an established
measure of electron correlation. But nonfreeness is also defined for mixed
states, and this allows one to compare the nonfreeness of subsystems to the
nonfreeness of the whole. Nonfreeness of a part does not exceed that in the
whole; nonfreeness is additive over independent subsystems; and nonfreeness is
superadditive over subsystems that are independent on the 1-particle level.

uniquely related. Such a connection becomes more interesting when the Hilbert
space has a dimension that is a power of a prime $N=d^n$, which describes a
composite system of $n$ qudits. Hence, entanglement naturally enters the
picture. Although our results are general, we concentrate on the simplest
nontrivial example of dimension $N=8=2^3$. It is shown that the number of
fundamentally different Wigner functions is severely limited if one
simultaneously imposes translational covariance and that the generating
operators consist of rotations around two orthogonal axes, acting on the
individual qubits only.

mutual information of the Pauli channels, when the noise on consecutive uses of
the channel has some partial correlations. In this Paper, we study
quantum-communication channels in $d$-dimensional systems and derive the mutual
information of the quantum channels for maximally entangled states and product
states coding with correlated noise. Then, we compare fidelity between these
states. Our results show that there exists a certain fidelity memory threshold
which depends on the dimension of the Hilbert space $(d)$ and the properties of
noisy channels. We calculate the classical capacity of a particular correlated
noisy channel and show that in order to achieve Holevo limit, we must use $d$
particles with $d$ degrees of freedom. Our results show that entanglement is a
useful means to enhance the mutual information. We choose a special
non-maximally entangled state and show that in the quasi-classical depolarizing
and quantum depolarizing channels, maximum classical capacity in the higher
memory channels is given by the maximally entangled state. Hence, our results
show that for high error channels in every degree of memory, maximally
entangled states have better mutual information.

of vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction that ensures the stability of

atoms to excited states possible in vacuum with a conducting boundary. The
boundary-induced contribution is effectively a nonthermal correction, which
enhances or weakens the nonthermal effect already present in the unbounded
case, thus possibly making the effect easier to observe. An interesting feature
worth being noted is that the nonthermal corrections may vanish for atoms on
some particular trajectories.
