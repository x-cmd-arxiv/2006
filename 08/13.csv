accounting of metals in the context of the missing metals problem at z~2.5,
showing that ~40% of the metals are in galaxies, and the remainder is divided
between diffuse IGM gas and shocked gas in halos and filamentary structures.
Comparisons with available observations of metallicity and metal mass fraction
evolution show broad agreement. We predict stars have a mean metallicity of
one-tenth solar already at z=6, which increases slowly to one-half solar today,
while stars just forming today have typically solar metallicity. Our HI column
density-weighted mean metallicity (comparable to Damped Ly-alpha system
metallicities) slowly increases from one-tenth to one-third solar from z=6-1,
then falls to one-quarter solar at z=0. The global mean metallicity of the
universe tracks ~50% higher than that of the diffuse phase down to z~1, and by
z=0 it has a value around one-tenth solar. Metals move towards higher densities
and temperatures with time, peaking around the mean cosmic density at z=2 and
an overdensity of 100 at z=0. We study how carbon and oxygen ions trace the

presence of Kaluza Klein (KK) excitations of the ordinary fermions and bosons
of the Standard Model that may be observed at hadron and lepton colliders. A
conserved discrete symmetry, KK-parity, ensures the stability of the lightest
KK particle (LKP), which, if neutral, becomes a good dark matter particle. It
has been recently shown that for a certain range of masses of the LKP a relic
density consistent with the experimentally observed one may be obtained. These
works, however, ignore the impact of KK graviton production at early times.
Whether the G^1 is the LKP or not, the G^n tower thus produced can decay to the
LKP, and depending on the reheating temperature, may lead to a modification of
the relic density. In this article, we show that this effect may lead to a
relevant modification of the range of KK masses consistent with the observed
relic density. Additionally, if evidence for UED is observed experimentally, we
find a stringent upper limit on the reheating temperature depending on the mass
of the LKP observed.

generically absent in the brane inflationary scenario. Depending on how the
brane inflationary universe originated, eternal inflation of the false vacuum
type is still quite possible. Since the inflaton is the position of the
D3-brane relative to the anti-D3-brane inside the compactified bulk with finite
size, its value is bounded. In DBI inflation, the warped space also restricts
the amplitude of the scalar fluctuation. These upper bounds impose strong
constraints on the possibility of eternal inflation. We find that eternal
inflation due to the random walk of the inflaton field is absent in both the
KKLMMT slow roll scenario and the DBI scenario. A more careful analysis for the
slow-roll case is also presented using the Langevin equation, which gives very
similar results. We discuss possible ways to obtain eternal inflation of the
random walk type in brane inflation. In the multi-throat brane inflationary
scenario, the branes may be generated by quantum tunneling and roll out the
throat. Eternal inflation of the false vacuum type inevitably happens in this
scenario due to the tunneling process. Since these scenarios have different
cosmological predictions, more data from the cosmic microwave background
radiation will hopefully select the specific scenario our universe has gone

Such settings include the Painlev\'e equations $P_I$ and $P_{II}$. If $S^+=0$,
then there is exactly one solution $y_0$ without singularities in
$H_{2\pi-\epsilon}$, and $y_0$ is entire iff $y_0=A(z,0)\equiv 0$. The
singularities of $y(x)$ mirror the singularities of the Borel transform of its
asymptotic expansion, $\mathcal{B}\tilde{y}$, a nonlinear analog of Stokes
phenomena. If $m=1$ and $A$ is a nonlinear polynomial with $A(z,0)\not\equiv 0$
a similar conclusion holds even if $A(0,\cdot)$ is linear. This follows from
the property that if $f$ is superexponentially small along $\RR^+$ and analytic
in $H_{\pi}$, then $f$ is superexponentially unbounded in $H_{\pi}$, a
consequence of decay estimates of Laplace transforms.

standard ``pseudocontinuation'' \cite{Shapiro}. This stresses the importance of
the notion of cohesivity, a comprehensive extension of analyticity introduced

Ornstein and Weiss roved the striking result that if $C$ is the class of

then every finitely observable function on $C$ is constant. This implies
Ornstein and Weiss' result, and extends it to many other families of processes,

invariants for processes arising from Kronecker systems, mild and strong mixing
zero entropy systems. It also implies that any finitely observable isomorphism
invariant defined on the family of processes arising from irrational rotations
must be constant for rotations belonging to a set of full Lebesgue measure.

  The first part of the work is devoted to the problem of associating to each
$L$-regular linear connection on $M$ a nonlinear $L$-connection on $M$. The
route we have followed is significantly different from that of Grifone. We
introduce an almost-complex and an almost-product structures on $M$ by means of
a given $L$-regular linear connection on $M$. The product of these two
structures defines a nonlinear $L$-connection on $M$, which generalizes
Grifone's nonlinear connection.
  The seconed part is devoted to the converse problem: associating to each
nonlinear $L$-connection \G on $M$ an $L$-regular linear connection on $M$;
called the $L$-lift of \G. The existence of this lift is established and the
fundamental tensors associated with it are studied.
  In the third part, we investigate the $L$-lift of a homogeneous
$L$-connection \G, called the Berwald $L$-lift of \G. Then we particularize our
study to the $L$-lift of a conservative $L$-connection. This $L$-lift enjoys
some interesting properties. We finally deduce various identities concerning
the curvature tensors of such a lift.
  Grifone's theory can be retrieved by letting $M$ be the tangent bundle of a
differentiable manifold and $L$ be the natural almost-tangent structure $J$ on
$M$.
