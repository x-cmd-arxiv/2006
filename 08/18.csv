that future laboratory searches for neutrino masses may play a crucial role in

around the neutron star, with total energy output of ~10^{36}erg/s. The corona
forms as a result of occasional starquakes that twist the external magnetic
field of the star and induce electric currents in the closed magnetosphere.
Once twisted, the magnetosphere cannot untwist immediately because of its
self-induction. The self-induction electric field lifts particles from the
stellar surface, accelerates them, and initiates avalanches of pair creation in
the magnetosphere. The created plasma corona maintains the electric current
demanded by curl(B) and regulates the self-induction e.m.f. by screening. This
corona persists in dynamic equilibrium: it is continually lost to the stellar
surface on the light-crossing time and replenished with new particles. In
essence, the twisted magnetosphere acts as an accelerator that converts the
toroidal field energy to particle kinetic energy. The voltage along the
magnetic field lines is maintained near threshold for ignition of pair
production, in the regime of self-organized criticality. The voltage is found
to be about 1 GeV which is in agreement with the observed dissipation rate
\~10^{36}erg/s. The coronal particles impact the solid crust, knock out
protons, and regulate the column density of the hydrostatic atmosphere of the
star. The transition layer between the atmosphere and the corona is the likely
source of the observed 100-keV emission from magnetars. The corona also emits
curvature radiation up to 10^{14}Hz and can supply the observed IR-optical
luminosity.

cloud that then becomes self-gravitating and undergoes global collapse.
Simultaneously, the turbulent, nonlinear density fluctuations induce fast,
local collapse events. The simulations show that: a) The clouds are not in a
state of equilibrium. Instead, they undergo secular evolution. Initially, their
mass and gravitational energy |Eg| increase steadily, while the turbulent
energy Ek reaches a plateau. b) When |Eg| becomes comparable to Ek, global
collapse begins, causing a simultaneous increase in both that maintains a
near-equipartition condition |Eg| ~ 2 Ek. c) Longer inflow durations delay the
onset of global and local collapse, by maintaining a higher turbulent velocity
dispersion in the cloud over longer times. d) The star formation rate is large
from the beginning, without any period of slow and accelerating star formation.
e) The column densities of the local star-forming clumps are very similar to
reported values of the column density required for molecule formation,
suggesting that locally molecular gas and star formation occur nearly
simultaneously. The MC formation mechanism discussed here naturally explains
the apparent ``virialized'' state of MCs and the ubiquitous presence of HI
halos around them. Within their assumptions, our simulations support the
scenario of rapid star formation after MCs are formed, although long (>~ 15
Myr) accumulation periods do occur during which the clouds build up their
gravitational energy, and which are expected to be spent in the atomic phase.

the closed-loop orbit solutions in non-axisymmetric potentials. The orbits are
in general non-circular and, for given triaxiality, their ellipticity depends
on the ratio of escape to circular velocities, V_esc^2/V_c^2. This ratio
increases steeply towards the center for cold dark matter (CDM) halo density
profiles, implying that even minor deviations from spherical symmetry may
induce large deviations from circular orbits in the velocity field of a gaseous
disk, especially near the center. This result suggests that caution should be
exercised when interpreting constraints on the presence of density cusps in the
dark halo derived from the innermost velocity profile. Simulated long-slit
rotation curves vary greatly in shape, depending primarily on the viewing angle
of the disk and on its orientation relative to the principal axes of the
potential. ""Solid-body"" rotation curves - typically interpreted as a signature
of a constant density core in the dark matter distribution - are often obtained
when the slit samples velocities near the major axis of the closed loop orbits.
Triaxial potentials imprint specific symmetries in 2D velocity fields,
generally inducing ""twists"" in the isovelocity contours and anti-symmetric
patterns in opposite quadrants. We suggest that triaxial halos may be
responsible for the variety of shapes of long-slit rotation curves of low
surface brightness (LSB) galaxies, as well as for the complex central
kinematics of LSBs, which are sometimes ascribed to the presence of ""radial
motions"" in the gas. We argue that LSB rotation curves might be reconciled with
the structure of CDM halos once the effects of halo triaxiality on the dynamics
of gaseous disks are properly taken into account.

followed by passive evolution and a constant star-formation rate since early
times; this suggests that few of these galaxies are undergoing major
starbursts. Approximately half the galaxies show a mid- to far-infrared excess
relative to the model SEDs, consistent with thermal emission from interstellar
dust. Two objects have power-law SEDs, indicating that they are dominated by
active galactic nuclei; both are detected in X-rays. The galaxies are grouped
by rest-frame color,quantitative optical morphology, and [OII] emission line
strength (possible indicator of star formation). On average, the panchromatic

simplest version of the external shock model, a specific relation should
prevail between the observed duration, isotropic equivalent energy, and photon
peak energy. In essence, this relation arises because both the burst duration
and the typical energy of the emitted synchrotron photons depend on the same
combination of the, usually poorly constrained, external density at the
deceleration radius, $n_{dec}$, and initial bulk Lorentz factor, $\Gamma_0$.
This has the fortunate consequence of making the relation independent of both
$\Gamma_0$ and $n_{dec}$. Unless the efficiency of electron acceleration is
very low, synchrotron gamma-rays from the external shock would fail to meet the
current observational constraints for the vast majority of GRBs, including
those with a smooth, single peak temporal profile. This argues either against
an external shock origin for the prompt emission in GRBs or for changes in our
understanding of the microphysical and radiation processes occurring within the
shocked region.

physics and cosmology. At z~30-300, the intergalactic medium (IGM) is visible
in 21 cm absorption against the cosmic microwave background (CMB), with a
strength that depends on the thermal (and ionization) history of the IGM. Here
we examine the constraints this background can place on dark matter decay and
annihilation, which could heat and ionize the IGM through the production of
high-energy particles. Using a simple model for dark matter decay, we show
that, if the decay energy is immediately injected into the IGM, the 21 cm
background can detect energy injection rates >10^{-24} eV cm^{-3} sec^{-1}. If
all the dark matter is subject to decay, this allows us to constrain dark
matter lifetimes <10^{27} sec. Such energy injection rates are much smaller
than those typically probed by the CMB power spectra. The expected brightness
temperature fluctuations at z~50 are a fraction of a mK and can vary from the
standard calculation by up to an order of magnitude, although the difference
can be significantly smaller if some of the decay products free stream to lower
redshifts. For self-annihilating dark matter, the fluctuation amplitude can
differ by a factor <2 from the standard calculation at z~50. Note also that, in
contrast to the CMB, the 21 cm probe is sensitive to both the ionization
fraction and the IGM temperature, in principle allowing better constraints on
the decay process and heating history. We also show that strong IGM heating and
ionization can lead to an enhanced H_2 abundance, which may affect the earliest
generations of stars and galaxies.

  v16 minor corrections, additions",,,"LAUR 06-5685","astro-ph",,"  Type Ia Supernovae (SNe) have been used by many to argue for an accelerated
expansion of the universe. However, high velocity and polarized features in
many nearby SNe Ia, and their inverse relation to luminosity, particularly for
polarization, are consistent with an extreme version of the axisymmetry seen in
SN 1987A, which could be the result of double degenerate merger-induced
core-collapse. This could be the correct paradigm for many SNe Ia and Ic, where
Ia's are both thermonuclear and core-collapsed objects, which leave
weakly-magnetized, rapidly spinning (~2 ms) pulsars. In this paradigm Ia/c is
produced from the merger of two degenerate cores of common envelope WR stars,
or of two CO white dwarfs. Its polar blowouts produce the observed high
velocity and polarized spectral features in Ia's, and its equatorial bulge is
much brighter in Ia's, due to the greater fraction of 56Ni contained within it.
These become classified as Ia's when viewed from the merger equator, and Ic's
when viewed from the poles, where a hypernova signature and a gamma-ray burst
(GRB) will be observed for lines of sight close to the merger axis. Thus
cosmology determined strictly from Ia's alone may be flawed because the local
sample is selectively biased. Finally, all GRBs start as the short-duration,
hard-spectrum variety (sGRBs), after which some are modified to the
long-duration, soft-spectrum variety (lGRBs) by interaction with the merger
common envelope and previous polar ejection. Thus the initial photon spectrum
of all GRBs is known.

comet's nucleus. Observations using the Mid-Infrared Spectrometer and Imager
(MIRSI) were performed at NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility, where the peak of
the comet's spectral energy distribution was observed between 8 and 25 microns.
In combination with the three near-IR spectra presented by Campins et al.
(2006, Astron. J. 132, 1346) that show the Wien-law tail of the thermal
emission, the data provide powerful constraints on surface properties of the
nucleus. We find that the nucleus's effective radius is 6.0+/-0.8 km. This is
one of the largest radii known among Jupiter-family comets, which is unusual
considering that the comet was discovered only recently. Its geometric albedo
is 0.059+/-0.023 in the H band, 0.037+/-0.014 in the R band, and 0.034+/-0.013
in the V band. We also find that the nucleus of 162P has little IR beaming, and
this implies that the nucleus has low thermal inertia. Including all near-IR
spectra yields a beaming parameter of 1.01+/-0.20. This result is in agreement
with others showing that cometary nuclei have low thermal inertia and little IR
beaming. If confirmed for many nuclei, the interpretation of radiometry may not
be as problematic as feared.

components analysis and discriminant function analysis to the spectroscopic
emission data set of Williams (1983). The two analysis methods reveal two
different sources of variation in the ratios of the emission lines. The source
of variation seen in the principal components analysis was shown to be
correlated with the binary orbital period. The source of variation seen in the
discriminant function analysis was shown to be correlated with the equivalent
width of the H$\beta$ line. Comparison of the data scatterplot with
scatterplots of theoretical models shows that Balmer line emission from T CrB
systems is consistent with the photoionization of a surrounding nebula.

require that this region of enhanced FUV has scales comparable to the observing

For low-mass sources, the required temperatures within the FUV models of T >

oscillations of the host star. We have therefore studied in this paper the
possible presence of a fourth planet in the system. During the past years we
have carried out additional and extremely precise radial-velocity measurements
with the HARPS spectrograph. We provide in this paper a full orbital solution

with HARPS we can confirm the presence of mu Ara c at P=9.64 days, which
produces a coherent RV signal over more than two years. The new orbital fit
sets the mass of mu Ara c to 10.5 M_Earth. Furthermore, we present the
discovery of mu Ara d, a new planet on an almost circular 310 days-period and

and precession. We use a sample of eight X-ray binaries and four Active

the X-ray binaries SMC X-1 and 4U 1907+09 all four mechanisms provide
precession periods compatible with those observed, while for Cyg X-1 and the

jump of the areal superfluid density for the strongly disordered samples. We
test the hypothesis that this unusual behavior is a manifestation of
finite-size effects by numerical study of the corresponding 2D bosonic model

of the underlying KT transition are severely smoothed out for finite system

consequence of a cooperation between the Fermi surface nesting, controlled by
the hopping integral in the $c$ direction, and the electron-electron

not been taken into account in most of the previous studies play an important
role.Mean field analysis at T=0 also supports the RPA results, and further
shows that in the $3\times 3$ charge ordered state, some portions of the Fermi
surface remain ungapped and are nested with a nesting vector close to the
modulation wave vector of the horizontal stripe ordering observed at low
temperatures in $X=MM'$(SCN)$_4$. We further study the possibility of
superconductivity by taking into account the distant off-site repulsions and
the band structure corresponding to $X=$I$_3$, in which superconductivity is
experimentally observed. We find that there is a close competition between

induced by the external electric field parallel to the quantum well. We find
that the spin polarization/coherence oscillates along the transport direction
even when there is no external magnetic field. We show that when the scattering
is strong enough, electron spins with different momentums oscillate in the same
phase which leads to equal transversal spin injection length and ensemble
transversal injection length. It is also shown that the intrinsic scattering is
already strong enough for such a phenomena. The oscillation period is almost
independent on the external electric field which is in agreement with the
latest experiment in bulk system at very low temperature [Europhys. Lett. {\bf

approach, the concentrations of magnetic ions are determined by the size of the
supercell in which there is only one magnetic ion per supercell in our method.
In order to distinguish the influence of dilution and disorder, there are two
kinds of supercells being used: the \textit{diluted and ordered} case and the
\textit{diluted and disordered} case. The configurational averaging of magnon
Green function due to disorder is treated in the augmented space formalism. The
random exchange integrals between two supercells are treated as a matrix. The
obtained magnon spectral densities are used to calculate the temperature
dependence of magnetization and Curie temperature. The results are shown as
following: (i) dilution leads to increasing the averaged distance of two
magnetic ions, further decreases the effective exchange integrals and is main
reason to reduce Curie temperature; (ii) spatial position disorder of magnetic
ions results in the dispersions of the exchange integrals between two
supercells and slightly changes ferromagnetic transition temperature; (iii) the
exponential damping of distance dependence obviously reduces Curie temperature

introducing a parameter $p$ which selects a neighbour for onward data transfer
depending on queued traffic. For every $\rho$ there is a critical value of $p$
above which the system become jammed. The $\rho-p$ phase diagram shows some

of electronic matter and give rise to low temperature states that range from
small moment ordering to exotic superconductivity, both of which are often in
close proximity to quantum critical points. These strong electronic
correlations are associated with the transfer of entropy from the local moment
degrees of freedom to the conduction electrons, and, as such, are intimately
related to the low temperature degeneracy of the (originally) moment bearing
ion. Here we report the discovery of six closely related Yb-based heavy fermion
compounds, YbT$_2$Zn$_{20}$, that are members of the larger family of dilute
rare earth bearing compounds: RT$_2$Zn$_{20}$ (T = Fe, Co, Ru, Rh, Os, Ir).
This discovery doubles the total number of Yb-based heavy fermion materials.
Given these compounds' dilute nature, systematic changes in T only weakly
perturb the Yb site and allow for insight into the effects of degeneracy on the
thermodynamic and transport properties of these model correlated electron
systems.

unit-vector field that points to a fixed direction at spatial infinity and
locally forms a knot with a soft core. The GL model, however, contains extra

change the fate of topologically non-trivial configurations. We investigate the

apply to three representative classes of graphs embeddable into a fixed

polyhedral embedding, and 3-connected graphs admitting a large-edge-width

strategy consists in upgrading a low cost general purpose processor core. This
approach is based on the personalization of a general RISC processor core
according the target multimedia application requirements. Thus, if the extra
cost is justified, the general purpose processor GPP core can be enforced with
instruction level coprocessors, coarse grain dedicated hardware, ad hoc
memories or new GPP cores. In this way the final design solution is tailored to
the application requirements. The proposed approach is based on three main
steps: the first one is the analysis of the targeted application using
efficient metrics. The second step is the selection of the appropriate
architecture template according to the first step results and recommendations.
The third step is the architecture generation. This approach is experimented
using various image and video algorithms showing its feasibility.

more precisely, two- and multi-party computation due to its universality.
Unfortunately, oblivious transfer cannot be achieved in an unconditionally
secure way for both parties from scratch. Therefore, it is a natural question
what information-theoretic primitives or computational assumptions oblivious
transfer can be based on.
  The results in our thesis are threefold. First, we present a protocol that
implements oblivious transfer from a weakened oblivious transfer called
universal oblivious transfer, where one of the two players may get additional
information. Our reduction is about twice as efficient as previous results.
  Weak oblivious transfer is an even weaker form of oblivious transfer, where
both players may obtain additional information about the other player's input,
and where the output can contain errors. We give a new, weaker definition of
weak oblivious transfer, as well as new reductions with a more detailed
analysis.
  Finally, we carry over our results to the computational setting and show how
a weak oblivious transfer that is sometimes incorrect and only mildly secure
against computationally bounded adversaries can be strengthened.

moderate energies is considered. These predictions suffer from substantial
renormalization scheme dependence, which is illustrated using as an example the
QCD effective charge appearing in the static interquark potential and the QCD
corrections to the Gross-Llewellyn-Smith sum rule in the deep inelastic
neutrino-nucleon scattering. To reduce this scheme dependence, it is proposed
to use a modified perturbation expansion, based on a modified couplant, which
is perturbatively consistent with the conventional running coupling parameter,
but is free from Landau singularity and has smaller renormalization scheme
dependence. The modified couplant is obtained by integrating the
renormalization group equation with an appropriately constructed nonpolynomial
generator. The renormalization scheme dependence of the perturbative
predictions in the modified expansion is discussed in detail, including the
predictions selected by the Principle of Minimal Sensitivity. It is shown that
the modified predictions are much more stable with respect to change of the
renormalization scheme parameters than the predictions obtained in the
conventional approach. It is also found that the modified predictions display
somewhat weaker energy dependence than the predictions obtained with the
conventional expansion, which may be interesting from the point of view of
comparing the low energy and high energy determinations of the strong coupling
parameter.

spectrum for the interpolated dual theories. In the specific case of a
generalized self-dual (GSD) model defined as the addition of the Maxwell term
to the self-dual model in $D=2+1$, previous master actions have furnished a
dual gauge theory which is either nonlocal or contains a ghost mode. Here we
show that by reducing the Maxwell term to first order by means of an auxiliary
field we are able to define a master action which interpolates between the GSD
model and a couple of non-interacting Maxwell-Chern-Simons theories of opposite
helicities. The presence of an auxiliary field explains the doubling of fields
in the dual gauge theory. A generalized duality transformation is defined and
both models can be interpreted as self-dual models. Furthermore, it is shown
how to obtain the gauge invariant correlators of the non-interacting MCS
theories from the correlators of the self-dual field in the GSD model and
vice-versa. The derivation of the non-interacting MCS theories from the GSD
model, as presented here, works in the opposite direction of the soldering
approach.

  Euler gives many elementary results on power residues modulo a prime number
p.
  He shows that the order of a subgroup generated by an element a in F_p^* must
divide the order p-1 of F_p^* (i.e. a special case of Lagrange's theorem for
cyclic groups).
  Euler also gives a proof of Fermat's little theorem, that a^{p-1} = 1 mod p
for a relatively prime to p (i.e. not 0 mod p). He remarks that this proof is
more natural, as it uses multiplicative properties of F_p^* instead of the

achieve a similar degree of agreement for the nuclear masses themselves it is
necessary to consider additional variables such as multipolar corrections to

key distribution using coherent states and postselection. By these phase
encodings, the probability of basis mismatch is reduced and total efficiency is
increased. We also propose mixed-state protocols by omitting a part of
classical communication steps in the efficient-phase-encoding protocols. The
omission implies a reduction of information to an eavesdropper and possibly
enhances the security of the protocols. We investigate the security of the
protocols against individual beam splitting attack.
