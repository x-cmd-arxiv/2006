synthetic data frames approximating those which will be taken by the instrument
in orbit. The program models astronomical sources and generates detector frames
using the predicted and measured optical properties of the telescope and MIRI.
These frames can then be used to illustrate and inform a range of operational

sources of gravitational waves that present and future detectors will study.
Apart from the energy and angular momentum that these waves carry, for
unequal-mass binaries there is also a net flux of linear momentum that implies
a recoil velocity of the resulting final black hole in the opposite direction.
We present a computation of the recoil velocity based on the close-limit
approximation scheme, which gives excellent results for head-on and grazing
collisions of black holes when compared to full numerical relativistic
calculations. We obtain a maximum recoil velocity of ~ 64 km/s for a symmetric
mass ratio eta = M_1 M_2/(M_1+M_2)^2 ~ 0.19 and an initial proper separation of
4 M, where M is the total ADM mass of the system. This separation is the
maximum at which the close-limit approximation is expected to provide accurate
results. If we supplement this estimate with PN calculations up to the
innermost stable circular orbit, we obtain a lower bound for the recoil
velocity, with a maximum around 84 km/s. This is a lower bound because it
neglects the initial merger phase. We can however obtain a rough estimate by
using PN methods or the close-limit approximation. Since both methods are known
to overestimate the amount of radiation, we obtain in this way an upper bound
for the recoil with maxima in the range of 220-265 km/s. We also provide
non-linear fits to these estimated upper and lower bounds. These estimates are
subject to uncertainties related to issues such as the choice of initial data
and higher effects in perturbation theory. Nonetheless, our estimates are
consistent with previous results in the literature and suggest a narrower range
of possible recoil velocities.

  X-1","To appear in ApJ on October 1st, proof version",,"10.1086/521011",,"astro-ph",,"  We have discovered a spectral transition from the low/hard (LH) state to the
high/soft (HS) state when Aquila X-1 was {\em declining} in observations made
with the {\it Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE)}. The 2--200 keV energy flux
corresponding to the state transition is $1.1\times{10}^{-9} ergs cm^{-2}
s^{-1}$, an order of magnitude lower than observed in the past. The 2--200 keV
peak flux of the following HS state is $1.6\times{10}^{-9} ergs cm^{-2}
s^{-1}$. The relation between the luminosity of the hard-to-soft state
transition and the peak luminosity of the following HS state confirms the
linear relation found previously. This implies that the luminosity of the
hard-to-soft state transition is not determined solely by the mass accretion
rate, but appears to be determined by the peak luminosity of the soft X-ray
outburst. We also found that the LH-to-HS state transition occurred at a
luminosity similar to that of the corresponding HS-to-LH state transition,
i.e., there is no apparent hysteresis. These results provide additional
evidence that the mass in the accretion disk affects the luminosity of the
hard-to-soft state transition, and that the accretion flow that powers the LH
state is related to the accretion flow that powers the HS state at a later
time.

innovative MHD simulations are devoted to the study of the interplay between a
stellar wind (having different ejection mass rates) and an MHD disc-driven jet
embedding the stellar wind. The transmagnetosonic, collimated MHD outflows are
investigated numerically using the VAC code. We first investigate the various
angular momentum transports occurring in the magneto-viscous accretion disc. We
then analyze the modifications induced by the interaction between the two
components of the outflow. Our simulations show that the inner outflow is
accelerated from the central object's hot corona thanks to both the thermal
pressure and the Lorentz force. In our framework, the thermal acceleration is
sustained by the heating produced by the dissipated magnetic energy due to the
turbulence. Conversely, the outflow launched from the resistive accretion disc
is mainly accelerated by the magneto-centrifugal force.}{The simulations show
that the MHD disc-driven outflow extracts angular momentum more efficiently
than do viscous effects in near-equipartition, thin-magnetized discs where
turbulence is fully developed. We also show that, when a dense inner stellar
wind occurs, the resulting disc-driven jet has a different structure, namely a
magnetic structure where poloidal magnetic field lines are more inclined
because of the pressure caused by the stellar wind. This modification leads to
both an enhanced mass-ejection rate in the disc-driven jet and a larger radial
extension that is in better agreement with the observations, besides being more
consistent.

investigate (and remove) biases in the estimate of angular momentum introduced

this many objects, the traditional lognormal function is no longer an adequate
description of the distribution of the dimensionless spin parameter lambda, and
we provide a different function that gives a better fit. The variation of spin
with halo mass is weak but detectable, although the trend depends strongly on
the halo definition used. The haloes exhibit a range of shapes, with a
preference for prolateness over oblateness. More massive haloes tend to be less
spherical and more prolate. We find that the more spherical haloes have spin in
the median, and those closest to spherical have a spin independent of mass. The
most massive have a spin independent of shape. The majority of haloes have
their angular momentum vector aligned with their minor axis and perpendicular
to their major axis. We find that higher tend to be more clustered, with a
stronger effect for more massive haloes. (abridged)

luminous galaxies. As they orbit within a growing host potential the subhaloes
are subject to tidal stripping and dynamical friction. We consider groups of

different concentrations associated with different formation times. We
investigate the variation of subhaloe (or satellite galaxy) velocity dispersion
with host concentration and/or formation time. In agreement with the Jeans
equation the velocity dispersion of subhaloes increases with the host
concentration. Between concentrations ~5 and ~20 the subhaloe velocity
dispersions increase by ~25 per cent. By applying a simplified tidal disruption
criterion, i.e. rejection of all subhaloes with a tidal truncation radius below
3 kpc at z=0, the central velocity dispersion of 'surviving' subhaloes
increases substantially for all concentrations. The enhanced central velocity
dispersion among surviving subhaloes is caused by a lack of slow tangential
motions. Additionally, we present a fitting formula for the velocity anisotropy
parameter \beta(r) which does not depend on concentration if the group-centric
distances are scaled by r_s, the characteristic radius of the NFW-profile.

function (hereafter referred to as the Einasto model when applied to internal
density profiles) describe simulated dark matter halos better than an NFW-like
model with equal number of parameters. Here we provide analytical expressions
for the logarithmic slopes of these models, and compare them with data from
real galaxies. Depending on the Einasto parameters of the dark matter halo, one
can expect an extrapolated, inner (0.01--1 kpc), logarithmic profile slope
ranging from -0.2 to -1.5, with a typical value at 0.1 kpc around -0.7.
Application of this (better fitting) model therefore alleviates some of the
past disagreement with observations on this issue. We additionally provide
useful expressions for the concentration and assorted scale radii: r_s, r_{-2},
r_e, R_e, r_virial, and r_max -- the radius where the circular velocity profile
has its maximum value. We also present the circular velocity profiles and the
radial behavior of rho(r)/sigma(r)^3 for both the Einasto and Prugniel-Simien
models. We find this representation of the phase-space density profile to be
well approximated by a power-law with slope slightly shallower than -2 near

Kormendy relation defined by luminous elliptical galaxies. These objects are
also seen to define the new, and equally strong, relation log(rho_e) = 0.5 -
2.5log(R_e), in which rho_e is the internal density at r=R_e. Simulated
(10^{14.5} M_sun) cluster-sized dark matter halos and the gas component of real
galaxy clusters follow the relation log(rho_e) = 2.5[1 - log(R_e)]. Given the

dwarf elliptical galaxies and galaxy clusters can have dark matter halos with
effective radii of comparable size to the effective radii of their baryonic

elliptical galaxies, with increasingly large profile shapes `n', to be dark
matter dominated at large radii requires dark matter halos with increasingly
large effective radii compared to the effective radii of their stellar

of the properties of E+As is not significantly different from that of
early-types with young stellar populations, dropping off rapidly towards denser
environments, and flattening off at densities < 0.1-0.3 Mpc^-2. The dearth of
E+A galaxies in dense environments confirms that E+As are most likely the
products of galaxy-galaxy merging or interactions, rather than star-forming
galaxies whose star formation has been quenched by processes unique to dense
environments. We see a tentative peak in the number of E+A galaxies at Sigma_10
\~ 0.1-0.3 Mpc^-2, which may represent the local galaxy density at which the
rate of galaxy-galaxy merging or interaction rate peaks. Analysis of the
spectra of our early-types with young stellar populations suggests that they
have a stellar component dominated by F stars, ~ 1-4 Gyr old, together with a
mature, metal-rich population characteristic of `typical' early-types. The
young stars represent > 10% of the stellar mass in these galaxies. This,
together with the similarity of the environments in which this `E+F' population
and the E+A galaxy sample are found, suggests that E+F galaxies used to be E+A

  in relative motion","9 pages, 5 figures, Astronomy & Astrophysics, in press",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20065012",,"astro-ph",,"  Context. We consider a simple self-gravitating disk, made of two fluid
components characterized by different effective thermal speeds and interacting
with one another only through gravity; two-component models of this type have
often been considered in order to estimate the impact of the cold interstellar
medium on gravitational instabilities in star-dominated galaxy disks.
  Aims. This simple model allows us to produce a unified description of
instabilities in non-viscous self-gravitating disks, some originating from
Jeans collapse, and others from the relative motion between the two components.
In particular, the model suggests that the small streaming velocity between the
two components associated with the so-called asymmetric drift may be the origin
of instability for suitable non-axisymmetric perturbations.
  Methods. The result is obtained by examining the properties of a local,
linear dispersion relation for tightly wound density waves in such
two-component model. The parameters characterizing the equilibrium model and
the related dispersion relation allow us to recover as natural limits the
cases, known in the literature, in which the relative drift between the two
components is ignored.
  Results. Dynamically, the instability is similar to (although gentler than)
that known to affect counter-rotating disks. However, in contrast to the
instability induced by counter-rotation, which is a relatively rare phenomenon,
the mechanism discussed in this paper is likely to be rather common in nature.
  Conclusions. We briefly indicate some consequences of the instability on the
evolution of galaxy disks and possible applications to other astrophysical
systems, in particular to protostellar disks and accretion disks.

against the fraction of the disc contribution in the overall spectral energy
distribution (SED). Using a sample of 4963 Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)

have a high radio:optical flux ratio when it has a high total luminosity or a
large non-thermal contribution to the SED. We find that one has to consider at

extend our DFLD to lower luminosities we also include a sample of
low-luminosity AGN. Using a simulated population of XRBs we show that stellar

significant change of exciton energies occurs with magnetic field: at low
fields exciton, localized in the MW, is higher in energy than that localized in
the NMW and efficient exciton relaxation from the MW to the NMW takes place for
all ADQWs. In all structures the giant Zeeman effect in the MW changes the
energy order of $\sigma^+$-polarized heavy hole (hh) excitons, localized in
different wells, at high B. Levels' crossing is accompanied by a reverse of
tunneling direction without anticrossing. Calculations of single-particle
states and their change with B indicate that the interwell exciton transfer is
forbidden in the single-particle picture at B $\gtrsim$ 1 T for all studied

of excitons is found in the whole magnetic field range regardless of tunneling
direction which evidences about importance of electron-hole Coulomb
correlations in tunneling process. Different charge-transfer mechanism are
analysed in details and elastic scattering due to strong disorder is suggested
as the main tunneling mechanism of excitons with underlying influence of the

of vortex-state magnetic dots, having closure magnetic flux are calculated. The
array dots have no direct contact between each other, and the sole source of
their interaction is the magnetic dipolar interaction. The magnon formalism
using Bose operators along with translational symmetry of the lattice, with the
knowledge of mode structure for the isolated dot, allows the diagonalization of
the system Hamiltonian giving the dispersion relation. Arrays of vortex-state
dots show a large variety of collective mode properties, such as positive or
negative dispersion for different modes. For their description, not only
dipolar interaction of effective magnetic dipoles, but non-dipolar terms common
to higher multipole interaction in classical electrodynamics can be important.
The dispersion relation is shown to be non-analytic as the value of the
wavevector approaches zero for all dipolar active modes of the single dot. For
vortex-state dots the interdot interaction is not weak, because, the dynamical
part (in contrast to the static magnetization of the vortex state) dot does not
contain the small parameter, the ratio of vortex core size to the dot radius.
This interaction can lead to qualitative effects like the formation of modes of
angular standing waves instead of modes with definite azimuthal number known
for the insolated vortex state dot.

spacetimes with horizon topology $S^2 \times S^1$. In the present paper, we
rule out for 'outermost' marginally outer trapped surfaces, in particular, for
cross sections of the event horizon in stationary black hole spacetimes, the
possibility of any such exceptional circumstances (which might have permitted,
e.g., toroidal cross sections). This follows from the main result, which is a
rigidity result for marginally outer trapped surfaces that are not of positive
Yamabe type.

aspects of the measurement of the general relativistic Lense-Thirring effect in
the gravitational field of the Earth. I) The proposal by such authors of using
the existing satellites endowed with some active mechanism of compensation of
the non-gravitational perturbations as an alternative strategy to improve the
currently ongoing Lense-Thirring tests is unfeasible because of the impact of
the uncancelled even zonal harmonics of the geopotential and of some
time-dependent tidal perturbations. II) It is shown that their criticisms about
the possibility of using the existing altimeter Jason-1 and laser-ranged Ajisai
satellites are groundless.III) Ciufolini and Pavlis also claimed that we would
have explicitly proposed to use the mean anomaly of the LAGEOS satellites in
order to improve the accuracy of the Lense-Thirrring tests. We prove that it is
false. In regard to the mean anomaly of the LAGEOS satellites, Ciufolini
himself did use such an orbital element in some previously published tests.
About the latest test performed with the LAGEOS satellites, IV) we discuss the
cross-coupling between the inclination errors and the first even zonal harmonic
as another possible source of systematic error affecting it with an additional
9% bias. V) Finally, we stress the weak points of the claims about the origin
of the two-nodes LAGEOS-LAGEOS II combination used in that test.

four-dimensional spacetime, called a 3-brane, embedded in a higher-dimensional
space, usually referred to as the bulk spacetime. In this paper we assume that
the 3-brane is a de Sitter space; there is only one extra spatial dimension,
assumed to be time dependent. By using the form of the brane-world
energy-momentum tensor suggested by Shiromizu et al. in the five-dimensional
Einstein equations, it is proposed that the cosmological expansion of the
3-brane may provide a possible explanation for the collapse of the extra
dimension, as well as for the energy stored in the resulting curled-up
dimension. More precisely, whenever the bulk cosmological constant \Lambda is
negative, the extra spatial dimension rapidly shrinks during the inflation of
the brane. When \Lambda is positive, on the other hand, the extra spatial
dimension either completely follows the cosmological expansion of the brane or
completely ignores it, thereby shrinking relative to the expanding space. This
behavior resembles the all-or-nothing behavior of ordinary systems in an
expanding universe, as recently demonstrated by R.H. Price.

[1], at leading order in \alpha_s, consider the contributions of higher
dimension condensates and keep terms which are linear in the light quark mass
m_q. We find M_X=(3925+- 127) MeV which is compatible, within the errors, with
he experimental candidate X(3872), while the SU(3) breaking-terms lead to an
unusual mass-splitting M_{X^{s}}-M_X=- (61+-30) MeV. The mass-difference
between the neutral states due to isospin violation of about (2.6-3.9) MeV is
much smaller than the value (8+-3) MeV proposed in [1]. For the b-quark, we
predict M_{X_b}= (10144+-106) MeV for the X_b(b\bar{b}q \bar{q}), which is much
below the {\bar B}B* threshold in contrast to the {\bar B}B* molecule
prediction [2], and for the X_b^s(b\bar{b}s \bar{s}), a mass-splitting
M_{X^s_{b}}-M_{X_b}=-(121+-182) MeV. Our analysis also indicates that the
mass-splitting between the ground state and the radial excitation of about
(225~250) MeV is much smaller than in the case of ordinary mesons and is
(within the errors) flavour-independent. We also extract the decay constants,
analogous to f_\pi, of such mesons, which are useful for further studies of
their leptonic and hadronic decay widths. The uncertainties of our estimates
are mainly due to the ones from the c and b quark masses.

renormalization of the former with non-diagonal mass counterterm matrices.
Diagonalization of the complete mass matrix leads to an explicit CKM
counterterm matrix, which automatically satisfies all the following important
properties: it is gauge independent, preserves unitarity, and leads to
renormalized amplitudes that are non-singular in the limit in which any two
fermions become mass degenerate.

following gap condition for all times: the spectrum of the generator consists
in finitely many isolated eigenvalues of finite algebraic multiplicity, away
from the rest of the spectrum. The restriction of the generator to the spectral
subspace corresponding to the distinguished eigenvalues is not assumed to be
diagonalizable. The presence of eigenilpotents in the spectral decomposition of
the generator forbids the evolution to follow the instantaneous eigenprojectors
of the generator in the adiabatic limit. Making use of superadiabatic
renormalization, we construct a different set of time-dependent projectors,
close to the instantaneous eigeprojectors of the generator in the adiabatic
limit, and an approximation of the evolution semigroup which intertwines
exactly between the values of these projectors at the initial and final times.
Hence, the evolution semigroup follows the constructed set of projectors in the
adiabatic regime, modulo error terms we control.

neuropsychology. We restrict ourselves to the problem that determinism seems to
allow only an illusion of freedom but random decissions do not contain any
freedom either. We show that this is a problem of natural sciences, not
philosophy. Physics motivates replacing determinism by the principle of weak
causality and introducing the concept of liberty. Its empirical basis remains
untouched, but the theoretical interpretations of the state space in Newton
theory and of the space-time in general relativity are changed. The emerging
understanding of time agrees with the idea suggested once by Popper. In
biology, the most important liberties are those of mutation, of motion and of
the portable neural representation. We distinguish freedom and liberty. Each
freedom is associated with some liberty and is defined as the ability to
perform three processes called realization, selection and use of memory. This
makes freedom accessible to experimental study. The freedom of will is
explained by giving account of the underlying specific liberty and processes.
While the realization has an ample space for randomness, the selection is
mostly causal. Thus, determinism can be rejected without forcing decissions to
be random. The experiments of Libet and the role of consciousness are
discussed.

points of Majorana's 10th article. In his article Majorana explicitly considers
quantum mechanics as an irreducible statistical theory because the theory is
not able to describe the time evolution of a single particle or atom in a
precise environment at a deterministic level. This lack of determinism at the
level of an elementary physical system motivated him to suggest a formal
analogy between statistical laws observed in physics and in the social
sciences. We hope the occasion of the centenary of the birth of Ettore Majorana
will be useful to remember and to reconsider not only his exceptional
achievements in theoretical physics but also his fresh and original views on

diffusion, by incorporating a random waiting time between particle jumps. In
finance, the particle jumps are log-returns and the waiting times measure delay
between transactions. These two random variables (log-return and waiting time)
are typically not independent. For these coupled CTRW models, we can now
compute the limiting stochastic process (just like Brownian motion is the limit
of a simple random walk), even in the case of heavy tailed (power-law) price
jumps and/or waiting times. The probability density functions for this limit
process solve fractional partial differential equations. In some cases, these
equations can be explicitly solved to yield descriptions of long-term price
changes, based on a high-resolution model of individual trades that includes
the statistical dependence between waiting times and the subsequent
log-returns. In the heavy tailed case, this involves operator stable space-time
random vectors that generalize the familiar stable models. In this paper, we
will review the fundamental theory and present two applications with
tick-by-tick stock and futures data.

risk factors) is (are) constituted of the assets whose returns it is (they are)
supposed to explain. As already reported in several articles, self-consistency
implies correlations between the return disturbances. As a consequence, the
alpha's and beta's of the factor model are unobservable. Self-consistency leads
to renormalized beta's with zero effective alpha's, which are observable with
standard OLS regressions. Analytical derivations and numerical simulations show
that, for arbitrary choices of the proxy which are different from the true
market portfolio, a modified linear regression holds with a non-zero value
$\alpha_i$ at the origin between an asset $i$'s return and the proxy's return.
Self-consistency also introduces ``orthogonality'' and ``normality'' conditions
linking the beta's, alpha's (as well as the residuals) and the weights of the
proxy portfolio. Two diagnostics based on these orthogonality and normality
conditions are implemented on a basket of 323 assets which have been components
of the S&P500 in the period from Jan. 1990 to Feb. 2005. These two diagnostics
show interesting departures from dynamical self-consistency starting about 2
years before the end of the Internet bubble. Finally, the factor decomposition
with the self-consistency condition derives a risk-factor decomposition in the
multi-factor case which is identical to the principal components analysis
(PCA), thus providing a direct link between model-driven and data-driven
constructions of risk factors.

determine whether intelligent life exists outside of our solar system, known as

primarily upon attempting to intercept possible radio transmissions at
different frequencies with arrays of radio telescopes. In addition,
astrophysical observations have also been undertaken to see if other worlds or
solar systems exist with similar conditions such as ours, which might be
conducive to life. And, numerous papers have been written exploring different
possibilities for the existence of life or why we have not observed it as of
yet, since none of these approaches have been successful. It may now be
possible to explore this issue from another standpoint. Recent theoretical and
experimental results in the field of biophysics appear to indicate the
possibility of quantum entanglement and nonlocality at the biological level,
between spatially separated pairs of human subjects and also between basins
containing neurons derived from human neural stem cells. If this research
continues to be upheld in a more replicable fashion, this could have very
important implications in the area of controllable superluminal communication.
Experiments are proposed in an attempt to address the issue of whether
controllable superluminal communication is possible and, if it is, to utilize
it in an attempt to determine if extraterrestrial intelligence really exists,
within the framework of astrobiological nonlocality.
