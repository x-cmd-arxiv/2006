spectrum contains substantial non-thermal components. The X-ray emission is
pulsed, with pulsed fractions that can be as high as ~ 70%. Several properties
of magnetars indicate the presence of persistent, static currents flowing
across the stellar surface and closing within the magnetosphere. The charges
supporting these currents supply a significant optical depth to resonant
cyclotron scattering in the 1-100 keV band. Here we describe a Monte Carlo
approach to calculating the redistribution of thermal seed photons in frequency
and angle by multiple resonant scattering in the magnetosphere. The calculation
includes the full angular dependence of the cyclotron scattering cross section,
the relativistic Doppler effect due to the motion of the charges, and allows
for an arbitrary particle velocity distribution and magnetic field geometry. We
construct synthetic spectra and pulse profiles for arbitrary orientations of
the spin axis, magnetic axis, and line of sight, using a self-similar, twisted
dipole field geometry, and assuming that the seed photons are supplied by
single-temperature black body emission from the stellar surface. Pulse profiles
and 1-10 keV spectra typical of AXPs are easily produced by this model, with
pulsed fractions of ~ 50%. However, this model cannot reproduce the hard,
rising energy spectra that are observed from SGRs during periods of activity,
without overproducing the thermal emission peak. This suggests that the 1-100
keV emission of SGRs has a common origin with the hard X-ray emission detected
from some AXPs above ~20 keV.

which prevents its bulk Lorentz factor from exceeding 1/theta (theta being the
jet opening angle) until it escapes from the core of its progenitor star, at a
radius of order 1e10 cm; dissipation may continue at larger radii. The
dissipated radiation will be partially thermalized, and we identify its thermal
peak (Doppler boosted by the outflow) with E_pk. The radiation comes, in
effect, from within the jet photosphere. The non-thermal, high energy part of
the GRB emission arises from Comptonization of this radiation by relativistic
electrons and positrons outside the effective photosphere. This model can
account naturally not only for the surprisingly small scatter in the various
claimed correlations, but also for the normalization, as well as the slopes. It
then has further implications for the jet energy, the limiting jet Lorentz
factor, and the relation of the energy, opening angle and burst duration to the
mass and radius of the stellar stellar progenitor. The observed relation
between pulse width and photon frequency can be reproduced by inverse-Compton
emission at ~ 1e14 cm from the engine, but there are significant constraints on
the energy distribution and isotropy of the radiating particles.

of dwarf irregular galaxies, but higher than that of ordinary dEs. Their
flattening distribution suggests the shape of a thick disk, similar to what has
been found for dEs with disk features in Paper I of this series. Their

significantly exceeding that of typical gas-rich galaxies at higher

rotation of the ionosphere relative to that of the underlying atmosphere. The
currents are the source for the non-axisymmetric components of the field. The
common rotation rates of these components and Saturn's kilometric radio (SKR)

naturally explains the constant measured values of D/H inside the Local Bubble,
the wide range of gas-phase D/H ratios observed in the intermediate regime (log
N(H I} = 19.2-20.7), and the low gas-phase D/H ratios observed at larger

depletion hypothesis: (i) correlations of gas-phase D/H ratios with depletions
of the refractory metals iron and silicon, and (ii) correlation with the
molecular hydrogen rotational temperature. Both of these tests are consistent
with deuterium depletion from the gas phase in cold, not recently shocked,
regions of the ISM, and high gas-phase D/H ratios in gas that has been shocked

the total (gas plus dust) D/H ratio within 1 kpc of the Sun is >=23.1 +/- 2.4

alternative possibility because of the modest infrared luminosity and
non-galaxy-nucleus nature of this component. The infrared K- and L-band spectra
of the infrared brightest nucleus, A, are typical of a normal starburst with no

ratio even in the AGN-hosting nucleus B may be due to the presence of a large

positionally coincident with the unidentified TeV $\gamma$-ray source, HESS
J1804$-$216. The X-ray sources are not time variable and show no counterpart in
other wavebands, except for the TeV source. Src 1 is unresolved at Suzaku
spatial resolution, whereas Src 2 is extended or composed of multiple sources.
The X-ray spectra are highly absorbed, hard, and featureless, and are well
fitted by absorbed power-law models with best-fit photon indices and absorption
columns of $-0.3_{-0.5}^{+0.5}$ and $0.2_{-0.2}^{+2.0}\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$

significantly larger than the total Galactic neutral hydrogen column in that

handful of TeV sources with known X-ray counterparts, HESS J1804$-$216 has the
largest ratio of TeV $\gamma$-ray to hard X-ray fluxes. We discuss the nature
of the emission and propose the Suzaku sources as plausible counterparts to the

  a few typos and given the final title","Nature444:1047-1049,2006","10.1038/nature05375",,"astro-ph",,"  It is now accepted that long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are produced
during the collapse of a massive star. The standard ""collapsar"" model predicts
that a broad-lined and luminous Type Ic core-collapse supernova (SN)
accompanies every long-duration GRB. This association has been confirmed in
observations of several nearby GRBs. Here we present observations of two nearby
long-duration GRBs that challenge this simple view. In the GRBs 060505 and
060614 we demonstrate that no SN emission accompanied these long-duration
bursts, down to limits hundreds of times fainter than the archetypal SN 1998bw
that accompanied GRB 980425, and fainter than any Type Ic SN ever observed.
Multi-band observations of the early afterglows, as well as spectroscopy of the
host galaxies, exclude the possibility of significant dust obscuration and show
that the bursts originated in star-forming regions. The absence of a SN to such
deep limits is qualitatively different from all previous nearby long GRBs and
suggests a new phenomenological type of massive stellar death. From the
supplementary material: Now we have observed SN-less GRBs in star-forming
regions, suggesting that a non-detection of a SN does not preclude a massive
progenitor. The position of the GRB, i.e. in a star-forming region or in an
older component, may be the only way to discriminate between merging compact
objects and massive stars as progenitors. In fact, several host galaxies for
short GRBs have been found to be as actively star-forming as some host galaxies
of long-duration GRBs. The GRB labels ""long"" and ""short"" have become synonymous
with ""massive stars"" and ""other progenitors"". These distinctions may need to be
relaxed.

gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and the peak bolometric luminosity of the underlying
supernovae (SNe), based on a sample of four pairs of GRBs-SNe with
spectroscopically confirmed connection. Combining it with the well-known
relation between the peak spectral energy and the isotropic equivalent energy
of GRBs, we obtain an upper limit on the isotropic energy of GRBs, which is
\approx 10^{52} erg (L_{SN,peak}/10^{43} erg s^{-1})^{10}, where L_{SN,peak} is
the peak bolometric luminosity of the SNe. Our results suggest that the
critical parameter determining the GRB-SN connection is the peak luminosity of
SNe, rather than the feature of the SN spectra and/or the SN explosion energy
as commonly hypothesized. Since it is generally believed that the peak
luminosity of SNe powered by radioactive decays is related to the amount of
56Ni produced in the SN explosion, the mass of 56Ni may be a key physical
factor for understanding the nature of GRBs and their connection with SNe.
Application of our relation to Type Ibc SNe with normal peak luminosities
indicates that if those normal SNe have GRBs accompanying them, the GRBs would
be extremely soft and sub-energetic in gamma-rays, and hence easier to detect
with X-ray or UV detectors than with gamma-ray detectors.

source of the necessary angular momentum. We find that the binary orbit must be
no wider than a few solar radii for a torus to form upon core collapse.
Comparing this criterion to the observed population of binaries containing two
compact objects suggests that rotation may have been important in the formation
of up to 50% of the observed systems. As these systems created a neutron star
and not a black hole they presumably did not produce highly luminous GRBs. We
suggest instead that they make the subset of GRBs in the relatively local
universe which have much lower luminosity.

with ordered magnetic moments on the 4f and 5d electrons induced by the
interaction with Fe. Increasing the Si content reduces the strength of the
hy-bridization between the 4f and conduction-band states which is reflected in
a growing occupation and magnetic polarization of the 4f states. Variations of
the shape and intensity of the L2,3-edge dichroism spectra, discussed in a
simple phenomenological model, show the importance of the exchange interaction
between the Ce-4f and 5d electrons, spin polarized by the interaction with Fe
at the interfaces, for the electronic structure of Ce at high Si concentration
and low temperature. A model of the band structure of rare-earth
transition-metal compounds permits to argue that magnetic order on the Ce 4f
electrons in the multilayers is due to different mechanisms: to hybridization
of the Ce-4f with the Fe-3d states at low Si concentration and to intra-atomic
4f-5d exchange at high Si concentration. This is at variance with magnetic
order in the intermetallics CeSi2-delta and CeSi which results from interaction
between the localized 4f magnetic moments mediated by the Si-derived (s,p)

discussed in both non-supersymmetric and supersymmetric contexts. The approach,
formulated in the Minkowski space-time, shows that theories with higher
derivative operators do not always have an improved UV behaviour, due to
subtleties related to the analytical continuation from the Minkowski to the
Euclidean metric. This continuation is further affected at the dynamical level
due to a field-dependence of the poles of the Green functions of the
particle-like states, for curvatures of the potential of order unity in ghost
mass units. The one-loop scalar potential in lambda*phi^4 theory with a single
higher derivative term is shown to have infinitely many counterterms, while for
a very large mass of the ghost the usual 4D renormalisation is recovered. In
the supersymmetric context of the O'Raifeartaigh model of spontaneous
supersymmetry breaking with a higher derivative (supersymmetric) operator, it
is found that quadratic divergences are present in the one-loop self-energy of
the scalar field. They arise with a coefficient proportional to the amount of
supersymmetry breaking and suppressed by the scale of the higher derivative
operator. This is also true in the Wess-Zumino model with higher derivatives

consider such models from a very general point of view, including those with

that the whole class of generalized Maxwell models satisfies properties which
one of them can be interpreted as an operator generalization of usual Lipschitz
conditions. This property allows to describe in detail a behavior of solutions
to the corresponding initial value problem. In particular, we prove in the most

Cauchy problem to those self-similar solutions, as time goes to infinity. The
properties of these self-similar solutions, leading to non classical

in the Torelli subgroup of the mapping class group. In the past these arguments
have been problematic because restricting the Torelli group to subsurfaces
gives different groups depending on how the subsurfaces are embedded. We define
a category $\TSur$ whose objects are surfaces together with a decoration
restricting how they can be embedded into larger surfaces and whose morphisms
are embeddings which respect the decoration. There is a natural ``Torelli
functor'' on this category which extends the usual definition of the Torelli
group on a closed surface. Additionally, we prove an analogue of the Birman
exact sequence for the Torelli groups of surfaces with boundary and use the
action of the Torelli group on the complex of curves to find generators for the
Torelli group. For genus $g \geq 1$ only twists about (certain) separating
curves and bounding pairs are needed, while for genus $g=0$ a new type of
generator (a ``commutator of a simply intersecting pair'') is needed. As a
special case, our methods provide a new, more conceptual proof of the classical
result of Birman-Powell which says that the Torelli group on a closed surface
is generated by twists about separating curves and bounding pairs.

Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) which gives a generalization of the
classical Euler-Lagrange and Weierstrass necessary optimality conditions of the
calculus of variations. Success in applying the PMP permits to obtain
candidates for a local minimum. In 1967 a direct method, which permits to
obtain global minimizers directly, without using necessary conditions, was
introduced by Leitmann. Leitmann's approach is connected, as showed by Carlson
in 2002, with ""Caratheodory's royal road of the Calculus of variations"". Here
we propose a related but different direct approach to problems of the calculus
of variations and optimal control, which permit to obtain global minima
directly, without recourse to needle variations and necessary conditions. Our
method is inspired by the classical Noether's theorem and its recent extensions
to optimal control. We make use of the variational symmetries of the problem,
considering parameter-invariance transformations and substituting the original
problem by a parameter-family of optimal control problems. Parameters are then
fixed in order to make the problem trivial, in some sense. Finally, by applying
the inverse of the chosen invariance-transformation, we get the global
minimizer for the original problem. The proposed method is illustrated, by
solving concrete problems, and compared with Leitmann's approach.

two-dimensional chaotic laminar flow, from a localized initial disturbance.
When the fluid mixing is sufficiently slow, the disturbance may spread and
eventually occupy the entire fluid domain. By contrast, rapid mixing tends to
dilute the initial state and so extinguish the disturbance. Such a dichotomy is
well known. However, we report here a hitherto apparently unremarked
intermediate case, a persistent highly localized disturbance. Such a localized
state arises when the Damkoehler number is great enough to sustain a hotspot,
but not so great as to lead to global spread. We show that such a disturbance
is located in the neighborhood of an unstable periodic orbit of the flow, and
we describe some limited aspects of its behavior using a reduced, lamellar
model.

of pseudorapidity, centrality and energy are studied in both the nucleon and
the constituent quark frameworks. In the present work, the calculation of the
number of nucleon and constituent quark participants using the nuclear overlap
model takes into account the fact that for the peripheral A+A and p+p
collisions can not be smaller than two. A striking agreement is seen between
the particle density in A+A and p(pbar)+p collisions, both at mid-rapidity and
in the fragmentation regions, when normalized to the number of participating
constituent quarks. The observations presented in this paper imply that the
number of constituent quark pairs participating in the collision controls the
particle production. One may therefore conjecture that the initial states in
A+A and p(pbar)+p collisions are similar when the partonic considerations are
used in normalization.

are well described by their spectro-temporal response field (STRF), are found
also to have a distinctive property that we call temporal symmetry. For
temporally symmetric neurons, every temporal cross-section of the STRF (impulse
response) is given by the same function of time, except for a scaling and a
""Hilbert rotation"". This property held in 85% of neurons (123 out of 145)
recorded from awake animals, and in 96% of neurons (70 out of 73) recorded from
anesthetized animals. This property of temporal symmetry is highly constraining
for possible models of functional neural connectivity within and into AI. We
find that the simplest models of functional thalamic input, from the ventral
Medial Geniculate Body (MGB), into the entry layers of AI are ruled out because
they are incompatible with the constraints of the observed temporal symmetry.
This is also the case for the simplest models of functional intracortical
connectivity. Plausible models that do generate temporal symmetry, both from
thalamic and intracortical inputs, are presented. In particular, we propose
that two specific characteristics of the thalamo-cortical interface may be
responsible. The first is a temporal mismatch between the fast dynamics of the
thalamus and the slow responses of the cortex. The second is that all thalamic
inputs into a cortical module (or a cluster of cells) must be restricted to one
point of entry (or one cell in the cluster). This latter property implies a
lack of correlated horizontal interactions across cortical modules during the
STRF measurements. The implications of these insights in the auditory system,
and comparisons with similar properties in the visual system, are explored.
