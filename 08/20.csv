Destiny mission data will be used to construct a high-precision Hubble diagram

strongly matter-dominated to the present when dark energy dominates. The
grism-images simultaneously provide broad-band photometry, redshifts, and SN
classification, as well as time-resolved diagnostic data for investigating
additional SN luminosity diagnostics. Destiny will be used in its third year as
a high resolution, wide-field imager to conduct a multicolor NIR weak lensing
(WL) survey covering 1000 square degrees. The large-scale mass power spectrum
derived from weak lensing distortions of field galaxies as a function of
redshift will provide independent and complementary constraints on the dark
energy equation of state. The combination of SN and WL is much more powerful
than either technique on its own. Used together, these surveys will have more
than an order of magnitude greater sensitivity than will be provided by ongoing
ground-based projects. The dark energy parameters, w_0 and w_a, will be

leads to identical conservation of the current and allows for the expression of
the charge as two dimensional surface integral (Noether's second theorem). In
the context of coordinate transformations, an additional step (Poincare
symmetry) is of physical interest and leads to the definition of the symmetric
Belinfante stress-energy tensor, which is then shown to be identically zero in
generally covariant first order theories. The intermediate step of linear
symmetry turns out to be important in general relativity when the customary
first order Lagrangian is used, which is covariant only under affine
transformations. In addition, we derive explicitely the canonical stress-energy

studying this larger class is to find protocols with promising performance
characteristics. This paper studies Markov chain models derived from protocols
in the TCP Paradigm. Protocols in the TCP Paradigm, as TCP, protect the network
from congestion by reducing the ""Congestion Window"" (the amount of data allowed
to be sent but not yet acknowledged) when there is packet loss or packet
marking, and increasing it when there is no loss. When loss of different
packets are assumed to be independent events and the probability p of loss is
assumed to be constant, the protocol gives rise to a Markov chain {W_n}, where
W_n is the size of the congestion window after the transmission of the n-th
packet. For a wide class of such Markov chains, we prove weak convergence
results, after appropriate rescaling of time and space, as p tends to 0. The
limiting processes are defined by stochastic differential equations. Depending
on certain parameter values, the stochastic differential equation can define an
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process or can be driven by a Poisson process.

By mean of the notion of capacity, we construct and study four conformal

properties of $r(I, M)=\bigcup_{k\geqslant 1} (I^{k+1}M: I^kM)$, {\it the
Ratliff-Rush ideal associated with $I$ and $M$}. When $M= R$ (or more generally
when $M$ is projective) then $r(I, M)= \widetilde{I}$, the usual Ratliff-Rush
ideal associated with $I$.
  If $I$ is a regular ideal and $\ann M=0$ we show that $\{r(I^n,M)
\}_{n\geqslant 0}$ is a stable $I$-filtration. If $M_{\p}$ is free for all
${\p}\in \spec R\setminus \mspec R,$ then under mild condition on $R$ we show
that for a regular ideal $I$, $\ell(r(I,M)/{\widetilde I})$ is finite. Further
$r(I,M)=\widetilde I $ if $A^*(I)\cap \mspec R =\emptyset $ (here $A^*(I)$ is
the stable value of the sequence $\Ass (R/{I^n})$). Our generalization also
helps to better understand the usual Ratliff-Rush filtration. When $I$ is a
regular $\m$-primary ideal our techniques yield an easily computable bound for
$k$ such that $\widetilde{I^n} = (I^{n+k} \colon I^k)$ for all $n \geqslant 1$.
For any ideal $I$ we show that $\widetilde{I^nM}=I^nM+H^0_I(M)\quad\mbox{for

R}(I,M)=\bigoplus_{n\geqslant 0} \widetilde {I^nM}$ is Noetherian if and only
if $\depth M>0$. Surprisingly if $\dim M=1$ then $\widetilde
G_I(M)=\bigoplus_{n\geqslant 0} \widetilde{I^nM}/{\widetilde{I^{n+1}M}}$ is
always a Noetherian and a Cohen-Macaulay $G_I(R)$-module. Application to
