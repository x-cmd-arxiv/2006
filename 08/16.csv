place consistent metallicity limits on IC 691 ([Z/Zsun] ~ -0.7) and the
metal-line absorber ([Z/Zsun] < -0.3). We also find that the galaxy's escape

produces an unbound starburst wind that escapes from its gravitational

of the gas the velocity dispersion of the DM is associated with a formal
temperature and thereby K_DM = \sigma_DM^2 \rho_DM^{-2/3} is defined. This DM
entropy is related to the DM phase space density by K_DM \propto Q_DM^{-2/3}.
In accord with other studies the DM phase space density follows a power law
behaviour, Q_DM \propto r^{-1.82}, which corresponds to K_DM \propto r^{1.21}.
The simulated intra-cluster gas has a flat entropy core within (0.8 \pm 0.4)
R_s, where R_s is the NFW scale radius. The outer profile follows the DM
behaviour, K_g \propto r^{1.21}, in close agreement with X-ray observations.
Upon scaling the DM and gas densities by their mean cosmological values we find
that outside the entropy core a constant ratio of K_g / K_{DM} = 0.71 \pm 0.18
prevails. By extending the definition of the gas temperature to include also
the bulk kinetic energy the ratio of the DM and gas extended entropy is found
to be unity for r > 0.8 R_s. The constant ratio of the gas thermal entropy to
that of the DM implies that observations of the intra-cluster gas can provide
an almost direct probe of the DM.

can cause a deviation from the standard light curve calibration employed when
using SNe Ia as standardizable distance candles and, if there is a systematic
evolution of the metallicity of SN Ia progenitors, could affect the
determination of cosmological parameters. Here we show that this metallicity
effect can be substantially larger than has been estimated previously, when the
neutronisation in the immediate pre-explosion phase in the CO white dwarf is
taken into account, and quantitatively assess the importance of metallicity
evolution for determining cosmological parameters. We show that, in principle,
a moderate and plausible amount of metallicity evolution could mimic a
lambda-dominated, flat Universe in an open, lambda-free Universe. However, the
effect of metallicity evolution appears not large enough to explain the high-z
SN Ia data in a flat Universe, for which there is strong independent evidence,
without a cosmological constant. We also estimate the systematic uncertainties
introduced by metallicity evolution in a lambda-dominated, flat Universe. We
find that metallicity evolution may limit the precision with which Omega_m and
w can be measured and that it will be difficult to distinguish evolution of the
equation of state of dark energy from metallicity evolution, at least from SN

magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. We present the detailed analysis of the
MHD waves, the cylindrical radial force balance, and the collimation of
magnetic tower jets. As magnetic energy is injected into a small central volume
over a finite amount of time, the magnetic fields expand down the background
density gradient, forming a collimated jet and an expanded ``lobe'' due to the
gradually decreasing background density and pressure. Both the jet and lobes
are magnetically dominated. In addition, the injection and expansion produce a
hydrodynamic shock wave that is moving ahead of and enclosing the magnetic
tower jet. This shock can eventually break the hydrostatic equilibrium in the
ambient medium and cause a global gravitational contraction. This contraction
produces a strong compression at the head of the magnetic tower front and helps
to collimate radially to produce a slender-shaped jet. At the outer edge of the
jet, the magnetic pressure is balanced by the background (modified) gas
pressure, without any significant contribution from the hoop stress. On the
other hand, along the central axis of the jet, hoop stress is the dominant
force in shaping the central collimation of the poloidal current. The system,
which possesses a highly wound helical magnetic configuration, never quite
reaches a force-free equilibrium state though the evolution becomes much slower
at late stages. The simulations were performed without any initial
perturbations so the overall structures of the jet remain mostly axisymmetric.

inferences concerning the overall population of planets. In recent years, the
refinement of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms has made it practical
to accurately characterize orbital parameters and their uncertainties from RV
observations of single-planet and weakly interacting multiple-planet systems.
Unfortunately, MCMC is not sufficient for Bayesian model selection, i.e.,
comparing the marginal posterior probability of models, as is necessary to
determine how strongly the observational data favor a model with n+1 planets
over a model with just n planets. Many of the obvious estimators for the
marginal posterior probability suffer from poor convergence properties. We
compare several estimators of the marginal likelihood and feature those that
display desirable convergence properties based on the analysis of a sample data
set for HD 88133b. We find that methods based on importance sampling are most
efficient, provided that a good analytic approximation of the posterior
probability distribution is available. We present a simple algorithm for using
a sample from the posterior to construct a mixture distribution that
approximates the posterior and can be used for importance sampling and Bayesian

a generalized Fermi-Dirac distribution with an effective temperature $T_e$.

the large-distance steady-state flow due to a local disturbance is commonly
described in terms of hydrodynamic screening -- beyond a correlation length
$\xi$ the response drops from that of the pure solvent, characterized by its
viscosity $\eta_0$, to that of the macroscopic liquid with viscosity $\eta$.
For cases where $\eta>>\eta_0$ we show, based on general conservation
arguments, that this screening picture, while being asymptotically correct,
should be refined in an essential way. The crossover between the microscopic
and macroscopic behaviors occurs gradually over a wide range of distances,
$\xi<<r<<\xi\sqrt{eta/\eta_0}$. In liquid-laden solids, such as colloidal
glasses, gels and liquid-filled porous media, where $\eta-->\infty$, this
intermediate behavior takes over the entire large-distance response. The
intermediate flow field, arising from the effect of mass displacement rather
than momentum diffusion, has several unique characteristics: (i) It has a
dipolar shape with a $1/r^3$ spatial decay, negative transverse components, and
vanishing angular average. (ii) Its amplitude depends on the liquid properties
through $\eta_0$ and $\xi$ alone; thus, in cases where $\xi$ is fixed by
geometry (e.g., for particulate liquids tightly confined in solid matrices),
the large-distance response is independent of particle concentration. (iii) The
intermediate field builds up non-diffusively, with a distance-independent
relaxation rate, making it dominant at large distances before steady state has
been reached. We demonstrate these general properties in three model systems.

cross-section of sleptons is enhanced over that of the MSSM by the process
$pp\to Z' \to \tilde{\ell} \tilde{\ell}^*$, so the discovery potential for
sleptons is greatly increased. The flavor and charge information in the
resulting decay, $\tilde{\ell} \to \ell + {LSP}$, provides a useful handle on
the identity of the LSP. With the help of the additional kinematical constraint
of an on-shell Z', we implement a novel method to measure all of the
superpartner masses involved in this channel. For certain final states with two
invisible particles, one can construct kinematic observables bounded above by
parent particle masses. We demonstrate how output from one such observable,
m_T2, can become input to a second, increasing the number of measurements one
can make with a single decay chain. The method presented here represents a new
class of observables which could have a much wider range of applicability.

spectral flowed state of the sector w=1 is involved. We give a formula that
shows how this observable can be expressed in terms of the four-point function
of non spectral flowed states. This means that the formula holding for the
winding violating four-string scattering processes in AdS_3 has a simple
expression in terms of the one for the conservative case, generalizing what is
known for the case of three-point functions, where the violating and the
non-violating structure constants turn out to be connected one to each other in
a similar way. What makes this connection particularly simple is the fact that,
unlike what one would naively expect, it is not necessary to explicitly solve
the five-point function containing a single spectral flow operator to this end.
Instead, non diagonal functional relations between different solutions of the
KZ equation turn out to be the key point for this short path to exist.
Considering such functional relation is necessary but it is not sufficient;
besides, the formula also follows from the relation existing between
correlators in both WZNW and Liouville conformal theories.

Hamiltonian variants. The mains results classify all admitted local point
symmetries and all admitted local conserved densities depending on up to first
order spatial derivatives, including any that exist only for special powers or
dimensions. All such cases for which these wave equations admit, in particular,
dilational energies or conformal energies and inversion symmetries are
determined. In addition, potential systems arising from the classified
conservation laws are used to determine nonlocal symmetries and nonlocal
conserved quantities admitted by these equations. As illustrative applications,
a discussion is given of energy norms, conserved H^s norms, critical powers for
blow-up solutions, and one-dimensional optimal symmetry groups for invariant
solutions.

A) states that that the rescaled flow at a singularity converges weakly to a

Conversely, any solution that decreases along some direction is the Borel sum

complex conjugation. The summation algorithm uses the formal solutions alone

not} excepted) there exists a nonempty set of solutions whose difference from
the ``optimally'' (i.e., near the least term) truncated asymptotic series is of
the same (exponentially small) order of magnitude as the least term of the
series. There is a family of generalized Borel summation formulas $\mathcal{B}$
which commute with the usual algebraic and analytic operations (addition,
multiplication, differentiation, etc). We show that there is exactly one of
them, $\mathcal{B}_0$, such that for any formal series solution $\tilde{f}$,
$\mathcal{B}_0(\tilde{f})$ differs from the optimal truncation of $\tilde{f}$

crossing a Stokes line, these terms vary smoothly on the Berry scale

accumulation of events which are constrained in the order of their occurrence.
A CBN is given by a partial order on a (finite) set of events. CBNs generalize
the oncogenetic tree models of Desper et al. by allowing the occurrence of an
event to depend on more than one predecessor event. The present paper studies
the statistical and algebraic properties of CBNs. We determine the maximum
likelihood parameters and present a combinatorial solution to the model
selection problem. Our method performs well on two datasets where the events
are HIV mutations associated with drug resistance. Concluding with a study of
the algebraic properties of CBNs, we show that CBNs are toric varieties after a
coordinate transformation and that their ideals possess a quadratic Gr\""{o}bner

component tree contains one or more of a specified set of vertices (called
nodes) on the outer face. For the uniform measure on groves, we compute the
probabilities of the different possible node connections in a grove. These
probabilities only depend on boundary measurements of the graph and not on the
actual graph structure, i.e., the probabilities can be expressed as functions
of the pairwise electrical resistances between the nodes, or equivalently, as
functions of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator (or response matrix) on the
nodes. These formulae can be likened to generalizations (for spanning forests)
of Cardy's percolation crossing probabilities, and generalize Kirchhoff's
formula for the electrical resistance. Remarkably, when appropriately
normalized, the connection probabilities are in fact integer-coefficient
polynomials in the matrix entries, where the coefficients have a natural
algebraic interpretation and can be computed combinatorially. A similar
phenomenon holds in the so-called double-dimer model: connection probabilities
of boundary nodes are polynomial functions of certain boundary measurements,
and as formal polynomials, they are specializations of the grove polynomials.
Upon taking scaling limits, we show that the double-dimer connection
probabilities coincide with those of the contour lines in the Gaussian free
field with certain natural boundary conditions. These results have direct
application to connection probabilities for multiple-strand SLE_2, SLE_8, and
SLE_4.

heterogeneity is in favor of synchronization in gradient networks. We analyze
the statistical properties of gradient networks and explore their dependence to
the other network parameters. Based on these understandings, we further propose
a new scheme for network synchronization distinguished by using less network

was achieved by a beam raster across a 12 mm diameter tantalum collimator at
the rates of 0.1 Hz in the vertical direction and 1 Hz in the horizontal
direction. Helium implantation into the very thin (approximately 80-100

approximately 10% of the helium retained) due to an under estimation of the
range by the code SRIM. The range of low energy helium in aluminum predicted by
Northcliffe and Shilling and the NIST online tabulation are observed on the
other hand to over estimate the range of low energy helium ions in aluminum. An
attempt to increase the amount of helium by implanting a second deeper layer
was also carried out, but it did not significantly increase the helium content
beyond the blistering limit (approximately 6 x 10^17 helium/cm^2). The
implanted targets were bombarded with moderately intense 4He and 16O beams of
50-100 particle nA . Rutherford Back Scattering of 1.0 and 2.5 MeV proton beams

redshift. This physical association then leads to the suggestion that the
redshifts of quasars are not really an indication of their distances. In this
investigation, it is argued that the high redshift can be due to the
gravitational redshift as an intrinsic redshift. Based on the proposed
local-ether theory, this intrinsic redshift is determined solely by the
gravitational potential associated specifically with the celestial object in
which the emitting sources are placed. During the process with which quasars
evolve into ordinary galaxies, the fragmentation of quasars and the formation
of stars occur and hence the masses of quasars decrease. Thus their
gravitational potentials and hence redshifts become smaller and smaller. This
is in accord with the aging of redshift during the evolution process. In some
observations, the redshifts of quasars have been found to follow the Karlsson
formula to exhibit a series of preferred peaks in their distributions. Based on
the quasar fragmentation and the local-ether theory, a new formula is presented
to interpret the preferred peaks quantitatively.

Two of these depend on mixing two types of boundary conditions. The other,
however, is a simple type of quantum graph in which the sign of the force
depends upon the number of edges.

coupled to a rather general environment, i.e., without using the Markov
approximation. Markovian errors generally require high-energy excitations (of
the reservoir) and tend to destroy the scalability of the adiabatic quantum
algorithm. We find that, under appropriate conditions (such as low
temperatures), the low-energy (i.e., non-Markovian) modes of the bath are most
important. Hence the scalability of the adiabatic quantum algorithm depends on
the infra-red behavior of the environment: a reasonably small coupling to the
three-dimensional electromagnetic field does not destroy the scaling behavior,
whereas phonons or localized degrees of freedom can be problematic. PACS:

particularly emphasized. As an example illustrating the method, the case of two

several points.

for the description of the cavity models obtained in this way are studied and

Updated version as published in PRA","Physical Review A, vol. 75, art. 042103 (2007)","10.1103/PhysRevA.75.042103",,"quant-ph",,"  Bell inequality violation is one of the most widely known manifestations of
entanglement in quantum mechanics; indicating that experiments on physically
separated quantum mechanical systems cannot be given a local realistic
description. However, despite the importance of Bell inequalities, it is not
known in general how to determine whether a given entangled state will violate
a Bell inequality. This is because one can choose to make many different
measurements on a quantum system to test any given Bell inequality and the
optimization over measurements is a high-dimensional variational problem. In
order to better understand this problem we present algorithms that provide, for
a given quantum state, both a lower bound and an upper bound on the maximal
expectation value of a Bell operator. Both bounds apply techniques from convex
optimization and the methodology for creating upper bounds allows them to be
systematically improved. In many cases these bounds determine measurements that
would demonstrate violation of the Bell inequality or provide a bound that
rules out the possibility of a violation. Examples are given to illustrate how
these algorithms can be used to conclude definitively if some quantum states
violate a given Bell inequality.
