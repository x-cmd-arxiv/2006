nucleosynthesis of medium and heavy elements in supernovae. Recent
hydrodynamical models of core-collapse supernovae show that a large amount of
proton rich matter is ejected under strong neutrino fluxes. This matter
constitutes the site of the vp-process where antineutrino absorption reactions
catalyze the nucleosynthesis of nuclei with A > 64. Supernovae are also
associated with the r-process responsible for the synthesis of the heaviest
elements in nature. Fission during the r-process can play a major role in
determining the final abundance patter and in explaining the almost universal
features seen in metal-poor r-process-rich stars.

found that for 5 out of 8 objects in the sample an effective diffusion
coefficient of the order of $10^{29}$ cm$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$ is needed. For AWM4,

intermittence in the process of metal spreading across the cluster. There is no
obvious dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the mass of the system.

We test the validity of analytic impulsive heating calculations using high

mass lost from the system. This energy criterion leads to an overestimate of
the stripped mass and underestimate of the disruption timescale since CDM
haloes are strongly bound in their inner parts. We show that a significant
fraction of material from CDM micro-haloes can be unbound by encounters with
Galactic substructure and stars, however the cuspy central regions remain
relatively intact. Furthermore, the micro-haloes near the solar radius are
those which collapse significantly earlier than average and will suffer very
little mass loss. Thus we expect a fraction of surviving bound micro-haloes, a
smooth component with narrow features in phase space, which may be uncovered by
direct detection experiments, as well as numerous surviving cuspy cores with
proper motions of arc-minutes per year, which can be detected indirectly via
their annihilation into gamma-rays.

weak lensing signal can be obtained from background galaxies, uncontaminated by
cluster members. For bluer colors, both background and cluster members are
present, reducing the distortion signal by the proportion of unlensed cluster
members. In deep Subaru and HST/ACS images of A1689 the tangential distortion
of galaxies with bluer colors falls rapidly toward the cluster center relative
to the lensing signal of the red background. We use this dilution effect to
derive the cluster light profile and luminosity function to large radius, with
the advantage that no subtraction of far-field background counts is required.
The light profile declines smoothly to the limit of the data, r<2Mpc/h, with a
constant slope, dlog(L)/dlog(r)=-1.12+-0.06, unlike the lensing mass profile
which steepens continuously with radius, so that M/L peaks at an intermediate
radius, ~100kpc/h. A flatter behavior is found for the more physically
meaningful ratio of dark-matter to stellar-matter, when accounting for the
color-mass relation of cluster members. The cluster luminosity function has a
flat slope, alpha=-1.05+-0.07, independent of radius and with no faint upturn
to M_i'<-12. We establish that the very bluest objects are negligibly
contaminated by the cluster V-i'<0.2, because their distortion profile rises
towards the center following the red background, but offset higher by ~20%.
This larger amplitude is consistent with the greater estimated depth of the
faint blue galaxies, z~=2.0 compared to z~=0.85 for the red background, a
purely geometric effect related to cosmological parameters. Finally, we improve
upon our earlier mass profile by combining both the red and blue background
populations, clearly excluding low concentration CDM profiles.

emission from accretion disk systems allows black hole spin to be a free
parameter in the fit, enabling the user to formally constrain the angular
momentum of a black hole, among other physical parameters of the system. In an
important extension of previous work, we derive constraints on the black hole
spin in MCG-6-30-15 using a self-consistent model for X-ray reflection from the
surface of the accretion disk while simultaneously accounting for absorption by
dusty photoionized material along the line of sight (the warm absorber). Even
including these complications, the XMM-Newton/EPIC-pn data require extreme
relativistic broadening of the X-ray reflection spectrum; assuming no emission
from within the radius of marginal stability, we derive a formal constraint on
the dimensionless black hole spin parameter of a > 0.987 at 90% confidence. The
principal unmodeled effect that can significantly reduce the inferred black
hole spin is powerful emission from within the radius of marginal stability.
Although significant theoretical developments are required to fully understand
this region, we argue that the need for a rapidly spinning black hole is robust
to physically plausible levels of emission from within the radius of marginal

Synthetic and empirical bolometric corrections also show fair agreement. A
careful comparison to temperatures, luminosities and angular diameters obtained
with other methods in literature shows that systematic effects still exist in
the calibrations at the level of a few percent. Our InfraRed Flux Method
temperature scale is 100K hotter than recent analogous determinations in the

scales and fits well the colours of the Sun. Our angular diameters are
typically 3% smaller when compared to other (indirect) determinations of

corrected predictions of the latest 3D model atmospheres and also with the
results of asteroseismology. Very tight empirical relations are derived for

effect of non-circular beam on the power spectrum is important at multipoles
larger than the beam-width. For recent experiments with high angular
resolution, optimal methods of power spectrum estimation are computationally
prohibitive and sub-optimal approaches, such as the Pseudo-Cl method, are used.
We provide an analytic framework for correcting the power spectrum for the

incomplete/masked sky maps). The approach is perturbative in the distortion of

paper, their suitability for direct imaging of extrasolar terrestrial planets
is reviewed. We also develop a linear-algebra based model of coronagraphy that
can both explain the behavior of existing coronagraphs and quantify the
coronagraphic performance limit imposed by fundamental physics. We find that
the maximum theoretical throughput of a coronagraph is equal to one minus the
non-aberrated non-coronagraphic PSF of the telescope. We describe how a
coronagraph reaching this fundamental limit may be designed, and how much
improvement over the best existing coronagraph design is still possible. Both
the analytical model and numerical simulations of existing designs also show
that this theoretical limit rapidly degrades as the source size is increased:
the ``highest performance'' coronagraphs, those with the highest throughput and
smallest Inner Working Angle (IWA), are the most sensitive to stellar angular
diameter. This unfortunately rules out the possibility of using a small IWA
(lambda/d) coronagraph for a terrestrial planet imaging mission.
  Finally, a detailed numerical simulation which accurately accounts for
stellar angular size, zodiacal and exozodiacal light is used to quantify the
efficiency of coronagraph designs for direct imaging of extrasolar terrestrial
planets in a possible real observing program. We find that in the photon noise
limited regime, a 4m telescope with a theoretically optimal coronagraph is able
to detect Earth-like planets around 50 stars with 1hr exposure time per target

indication of black hole formation. More importantly, the neutrino signals are
quite sensitive to the difference of equation of state and can be used as a
useful probe into the properties of dense matter. The event will be unique in
that they will be shining only by neutrinos (and, possibly, gravitational
waves) but not by photons, and hence they should be an important target of
neutrino astronomy.

only 1.3 pc, and its two main components have spectral types comparable to the
Sun. This is therefore a favorable target for an imaging search for extrasolar

is higher than its modeled mass, the difference being consistent with a
substellar companion of a few tens of Jupiter masses. Aims: We searched for
faint comoving companions to Alpha Cen B. As a secondary objective, we built a
catalogue of the detected background sources. Methods: We used the NACO
adaptive optics system of the VLT in the J, H, and Ks bands to search for
companions to Alpha Cen B. This instrument allowed us to achieve a very high
sensitivity to point-like sources, with a limiting magnitude of m\_Ks ~ 18 at
7"" from the star. We complemented this data set with archival coronagraphic
images from the HST-ACS instrument to obtain an accurate astrometric
calibration. Results: Over the observed area, we did not detect any comoving
companion to Alpha Cen B down to an absolute magnitude of 19-20 in the H and Ks
bands. However, we present a catalogue of 252 background objects within about
15"" of the star. This catalogue fills part of the large void area that
surrounds Alpha Cen in sky surveys due to the strong diffused light. We also
present a model of the diffused light as a function of angular distance for the
NACO instrument, that can be used to predict the background level for bright
star observations. Conclusions: According to recent numerical models, the
limiting magnitude of our search sets the maximum mass of possible companions
to 20-30 times Jupiter, between 7 and 20 AU from Alpha Cen B.

magnitude, M^*. The cosmic star formation rate (SFR) density at z~4 and z~5 is
measured from the luminosity functions. We examine the evolution of the cosmic
SFR density and its luminosity dependence over 0<z<6. The SFR density
contributed from brighter galaxies is found to change more drastically with
cosmic time. The contribution from brighter galaxies has a sharp peak around
z=3-4, while that from fainter galaxies evolves relatively mildly with a broad
peak at earlier epoch. Combining the observed SFR density with the standard
Cold Dark Matter model, we compute the cosmic SFR per unit baryon mass in dark
haloes, i.e., the specific SFR. The specific SFR is found to scale with
redshift as (1+z)^3 up to z~4, implying that the efficiency of star formation
is on average higher at higher redshift in proportion to the cooling rate
within dark haloes, while this is not simply the case at z>4.

Initially, the starburst powers a hot wind bound by a denser cold shell, which

fragment evolution is approximately ballistic while the hot bubble continues to
expand. As the fragments are gravitationally decelerated, their screening
ability of the starlight decreases as the UV starburst luminosity progressively
dims. LBG observations sample all these evolutionary phases. Finally, the

on an analysis of lV-diagrams (lVd) for two samples of maser stars: 771 OH/IR
stars and 363 SiO-maser stars. They are all close to the plane of the MW and
have long. from -45 to +45deg. The two lVds are compared and found to be very
similar. They also compare well with the lVd of interstellar CO, but there are
significant differences in detail between the stellar lVds and that of the ISM.
Based on the qualitative discussion we divide the lVds into seven areas. In
each area we compare the number of stars observed with those predicted by an
assumed set of orbits in a galactic potential. This potential is axially
symmetric but a weak rotating bar has been added. We conclude that the maser
stars move on almost circular orbits outside of about 3.5 kpc, but that the
orbits become more and more elongated when one goes deep inside our MW. We find
a strong effect of the Corotation (CR) resonance (res) at 3.3 kpc, we see a
small but noticeable effect of the Outer Lindblad res at 5 kpc and no effect of
the Inner Lindblad res at r=0.8 kpc. We find a set of 6 groups of orbits that
together predict counts in agreement with the counts of stars observed. We then
calculate the trajectory of each orbit and so find the distribution of the
maser stars in the plane of the MWG. This distribution has two new (but not
unexpected) features. The first is a bar-like distribution within 2 kpc from
the GC outlined. These orbits explain the high-vel stars near l=0deg in the
forbidden and the permitted quadrants. The second feature are two
""croissant""-like voids in the distribution close to the CR radius (3.3 kpc),
which are the consequence of the presence of the CR res. We find excellent

different ways. One possibility is to use the projector-operator techniques,
which pick up a set of trial atomic orbitals and project them onto the given
Hilbert space. Another possibility is to employ the downfolding method, which
eliminates the high-energy part of the spectrum and incorporates all related to
it properties into the energy-dependence of an effective Hamiltonian. We show
that by modifying the high-energy part of the spectrum of the original
Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$, which is rather irrelevant to the construction of WFs in
the low-energy part of the spectrum, these two methods can be formulated in an
absolutely exact and identical form, so that the main difference between them
is reduced to the choice of the trial orbitals. Concerning the latter part of
the problem, we argue that an optimal choice for trial orbitals can be based on
the maximization of the site-diagonal part of the density matrix. The main idea
is illustrated for a simple toy model, consisting of only two bands, as well as

nearest-neighbor sites and due to a lowering of the kinetic energy in a system

the spectral weight in the vicinity of the magnetic ordering transitions, both
in YTiO3 and SmTiO3. In the G-type antiferromagnet SmTiO3, the sign of the
change of the spectral weight at T_N depends on the polarization. This

  (2006)",,"10.1007/s10909-006-9229-1",,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.supr-con",,"  Turbulence in superfluids depends crucially on the dissipative damping in
vortex motion. This is observed in the B phase of superfluid 3He where the
dynamics of quantized vortices changes radically in character as a function of
temperature. An abrupt transition to turbulence is the most peculiar
consequence. As distinct from viscous hydrodynamics, this transition to
turbulence is not governed by the velocity-dependent Reynolds number, but by a
velocity-independent dimensionless parameter 1/q which depends only on the
temperature-dependent mutual friction -- the dissipation which sets in when
vortices move with respect to the normal excitations of the liquid. At large
friction and small values of 1/q < 1 the dynamics is vortex number conserving,
while at low friction and large 1/q > 1 vortices are easily destabilized and
proliferate in number. A new measuring technique was employed to identify this
hydrodynamic transition: the injection of a tight bundle of many small vortex
loops in applied vortex-free flow at relatively high velocities. These vortices
are ejected from a vortex sheet covering the AB interface when a two-phase
sample of 3He-A and 3He-B is set in rotation and the interface becomes unstable
at a critical rotation velocity, triggered by the superfluid Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability.

parameters, so for a given supersymmetry model it allows an unambiguous
prediction of the dark matter relic density. As a example, we scan over the
parameter space of the CMSSM, comparing the neutralino relic density
predictions with the bounds from WMAP. We find that the WMAP--allowed regions

the production of high-mass systems (H = dijet, heavy quarkonium, Higgs boson)
in double-gap exclusive diffractive pp scattering, pp -> p + (gap) + H + (gap)
+ p. It is based on the idea that hard and soft interactions proceed over
widely different time- and distance scales and are thus approximately
independent. The high-mass system is produced in a hard scattering process with
exchange of two gluons between the protons. Its amplitude is calculable in
terms of the gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in the protons,
which can be measured in J/psi production in exclusive ep scattering. The hard
scattering process is modified by soft spectator interactions, which we
calculate in a model-independent way in terms of the pp elastic scattering
amplitude. Contributions from inelastic intermediate states are suppressed. A
simple geometric picture of the interplay of hard and soft interactions in
diffraction is obtained. The onset of the black-disk limit in pp scattering at
TeV energies strongly suppresses diffraction at small impact parameters and is
the main factor in determining the RGS probability. Correlations between hard
and soft interactions (e.g. due to scattering from the long-range pion field of
the proton, or due to possible short-range transverse correlations between
partons) further decrease the RGS probability. We also investigate the
dependence of the diffractive cross section on the transverse momenta of the
final-state protons (""diffraction pattern""). By measuring this dependence one
can perform detailed tests of the interplay of hard and soft interactions, and
even extract information about the gluon GPD in the proton. Such studies appear

black hole entropy, are modified. But, for large values of the GCS coupling,
where the modification terms dominate the original terms, some exotic behaviors
occur, like as the roles of the mass and angular momentum are interchanged and
the black hole entropy depends more on the $inner$-horizon area than the outer
one. A basic physical problem of this system is that the form of entropy does
not guarantee the second law of thermodynamics, in contrast to the
Bekenstein-Hawking (BH) entropy. Moreover, this entropy does $not$ agree with
the statistical entropy, in contrast to a good agreement for small values of
the GCS coupling. Here I find that there is another entropy formula where the
usual BH form dominates the inner-horizon term again, as in the small GCS
coupling, such as the second law of thermodynamics can be guaranteed. I compare
the result of the holographic approach with the classical-
symmetry-algebra-based approach and I find exact agreements even with the

"math/0608592","Radford M. Neal","Radford M. Neal","Puzzles of Anthropic Reasoning Resolved Using Full Non-indexical
  Conditioning",,,,,"math.ST astro-ph stat.TH",,"  I consider the puzzles arising from four interrelated problems involving
`anthropic' reasoning, and in particular the `Self-Sampling Assumption' (SSA) -
that one should reason as if one were randomly chosen from the set of all
observers in a suitable reference class. The problem of Freak Observers might
appear to force acceptance of SSA if any empirical evidence is to be credited.
The Sleeping Beauty problem arguably shows that one should also accept the
`Self-Indication Assumption' (SIA) - that one should take one's own existence
as evidence that the number of observers is more likely to be large than small.
But this assumption produces apparently absurd results in the Presumptuous
Philosopher problem. Without SIA, however, a definitive refutation of the
counterintuitive Doomsday Argument seems difficult. I show that these problems
are satisfyingly resolved by applying the principle that one should always
condition on all evidence - not just on the fact that you are an intelligent
observer, or that you are human, but on the fact that you are a human with a
specific set of memories. This `Full Non-indexical Conditioning' (FNC) approach
usually produces the same results as assuming both SSA and SIA, with a
sufficiently broad reference class, while avoiding their ad hoc aspects. I
argue that the results of FNC are correct using the device of hypothetical
``companion'' observers, whose existence clarifies what principles of reasoning
are valid. I conclude by discussing how one can use FNC to infer how densely we
should expect intelligent species to occur, and by examining recent anthropic
arguments in inflationary and string theory cosmology.

compressed hydrogen atom in the core of stars, the laboratory synthesis of the
neutron from protons and electrons was claimed in the late 1960 by the Italian
priest-physicist Don Carlo Borghi and his associates via a metal chamber
containing a partially ionized hydrogen gas at a fraction of $1 bar$ pressure
traversed by an electric arc with $5 J$ energy and microwaves with $10^{10}
s^{-1}$ frequency. The experiment remained unverified for decades due to the
lack of theoretical understanding of the results. In this note we report
various measurements showing that, under certain conditions, electric arcs
within a hydrogen gas produce neutral, hadron-size entities that are absorbed
by stable nuclei and subsequently result in the release of detectable neutrons,
thus confirming Don Borghi's experiment. The possibility that said entities are
neutrons is discussed jointly with other alternatives. Due to their simplicity,
a primary scope of this note is to stimulate the independent re-run of the
tests as conducted or in suitable alternative forms.

full dynamical localization is absent and the quantum momentum distribution
develops power-law tails with anomalous decay exponents as in the case of a

these findings may be verified experimentally by using ultra cold atoms
techniques. It is found that ultra-cold atoms can indeed be utilized for the

  comments",,,,"quant-ph",,"  In the Bayesian approach to quantum mechanics, probabilities--and thus
quantum states--represent an agent's degrees of belief, rather than
corresponding to objective properties of physical systems. In this paper we
investigate the concept of certainty in quantum mechanics. Particularly, we
show how the probability-1 predictions derived from pure quantum states
highlight a fundamental difference between our Bayesian approach, on the one
hand, and Copenhagen and similar interpretations on the other. We first review
the main arguments for the general claim that probabilities always represent
degrees of belief. We then argue that a quantum state prepared by some physical
device always depends on an agent's prior beliefs, implying that the
probability-1 predictions derived from that state also depend on the agent's
prior beliefs. Quantum certainty is therefore always some agent's certainty.
Conversely, if facts about an experimental setup could imply agent-independent
certainty for a measurement outcome, as in many Copenhagen-like
interpretations, that outcome would effectively correspond to a preexisting
system property. The idea that measurement outcomes occurring with certainty
correspond to preexisting system properties is, however, in conflict with
locality. We emphasize this by giving a version of an argument of Stairs [A.
Stairs, Phil. Sci. 50, 578 (1983)], which applies the Kochen-Specker theorem to
an entangled bipartite system.
