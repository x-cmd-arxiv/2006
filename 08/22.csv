magnetic field in the nearby cluster of galaxies A2255. At radio wavelengths
A2255 is characterized by the presence of a polarized radio halo at the cluster
center, a relic source at the cluster periphery, and several embedded radio
galaxies. The polarized radio emission from all these sources is modified by
Faraday rotation as it traverses the magnetized intra-cluster medium. The
distribution of Faraday rotation can be used to probe the magnetic field
strength and topology in the cluster. For this purpose, we performed Very Large
Array observations at 3.6 and 6 cm of four polarized radio galaxies embedded in
A2255, obtaining detailed rotation measure images for three of them. We
analyzed these data together with the very deep radio halo image recently
obtained by us. We simulated random 3-dimensional magnetic field models
characterized by different power spectra and produced synthetic rotation
measure and radio halo images. By comparing the simulations with the data we
are able to determine the strength and the power spectrum of the intra-cluster
magnetic field fluctuations which best reproduce the observations. The data
require a steepening of the power spectrum spectral index from n=2, at the
cluster center, up to n=4, at the cluster periphery and the presence of
filamentary structures on large scales. The average magnetic field strength at
the cluster center is 2.5 muG. The field strength declines from the cluster
center outward with an average magnetic field strength calculated over 1 Mpc^3
of about 1.2 muG.

optical and radio values even when accounting for temperature, density, and
ionization structure or for optical extinction by dust. Using only M17 and S206
we determine dY/dZ = 1.41 +/- 0.62 in the Galaxy, consistent with standard
chemical evolution models. High helium abundances in the old stellar population
of elliptical galaxies can help explain the increase in UV emission with
shorter wavelength between 2000 and 1200 Angstrom, called the UV-upturn or UVX.
Our lower values of dY/dZ are consistent with a normal helium abundance at
higher metallicity and suggest that other factors, such as a variable red giant
branch mass-loss with metallicity, may be important. When combined with 4He
abundances in metal poor galaxy HII regions, Magellanic cloud HII regions, and
M17 that have been determined from optical recombination lines including the
effects of temperature fluctuations, our radio 4He/H abundance ratio for S206
is consistent with a helium evolution of dY/dZ = 1.6. A linear extrapolation to
zero metallicity predicts a 4He/H primordial abundance ratio about 5% lower

at long times, we can estimate the location and mass of the components of the
absorber. We interpret those constraints within the hypernova scenario showing
that the mass loss rate of the progenitor must have been ~10^{-4} solar masses
per year, suggestive of a very massive star. In addition, the wind termination

fundamental, first and possibly second overtone mode pulsations for the shorter

relation that is similar to the Long Secondary Periods of the Asymptotic Giant

into multiple peaks under a Lorentzian envelope, which we interpret as evidence
for stochastic oscillations, presumably caused by the interplay of convection
and pulsations. We find a strong 1/f noise component in the power spectra that
is remarkably similar in almost all stars of the sample. This behaviour fits
the picture of irregular photometric variability caused by large convection
cells, analogous to the granulation background seen in the Sun.

  Required","ApJLett submitted, 12 pages, small updates",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Long duration Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) have been strongly connected with core
collapse supernovae, so it was surprising when the recent GRB060614 (with a
reported redshift of 0.125) was found to have no visible supernova to deep
limits. Three separate groups have reached the same conclusion that this event
forces the existence of a new previously-unsuspected class of GRBs. The problem
with this conclusion is that the redshift is not secure, as the measured galaxy
emission lines simply give the redshift of the brightest galaxy near the
line-of-sight to the GRB afterglow. Fortunately, eight different luminosity
indicators are known which can give the luminosity (and hence redshift) of the
GRB itself. In combination, these luminosity indicators have already proven to
give redshifts with average one-sigma errors of 26% as based on 69 GRBs with
spectroscopic redshifts. For GRB060614, the luminosity indicators all uniformly
give a high luminosity for the burst which implies a high redshift. This can be
seen by the spiky many-peaked light curve, the high E_{peak} value, the
near-zero spectral lag, and the timing of the jet break. Quantitatively, we
derive a redshift of 1.97 (1.44<z<2.81 one-sigma) from the eight luminosity
indicators. Additional information from the detection of the afterglow in all
Swift UVOT bands further constrains the redshift to be <1.71, so the final
range of allowed redshift is 1.44<z<1.71, which readily explains why no
supernova was visible. Thus, GRB060614 is at high redshift and is certainly not
evidence for a new class of GRBs.

The IRAC observations allow us for the first time to constrain the rest-frame

photometric redshifts in the range 6.7-7.4, rest-frame colors U-V=0.2-0.4,
V-band luminosities L_V=0.6-3 x 10^10 L_sun, stellar masses 1-10 x 10^9 M_sun,
stellar ages 50-200 Myr, star formation rates up to ~25 M_sun/yr, and low

fairly similar to recently identified systems at z=5-6. The stellar mass

suggest they formed at z>8, during the era of cosmic reionization, but the star
formation rate density derived from their stellar masses and ages is not nearly
sufficient to reionize the universe. The simplest explanation for this
deficiency is that lower-mass galaxies beyond our detection limit reionized the

Surprisingly, we detected no emission lines for nine of these 20 galaxies. The

consistent with zero within 1 sigma for the remaining four. Thus, both the
Halpha measurements and the independent stellar continuum modeling imply that
45% of our K-selected galaxies are not forming stars intensely. This high
fraction of galaxies without detected line emission and low SFRs may imply that
the suppression of star formation in massive galaxies occurs at higher redshift

the burst light curve as large as 10 percent of peak luminosity. This is very
large compared to the current sensitivity of X-ray observations. More precise

velocity and/or light curve variations, which reveal frequencies of the
oscillation modes. To characterise radial and non-radial oscillations, line
profile variations are a valuable diagnostic. Here we present for the first
time a line profile analysis of pulsating red giants, taking into account the
small line profile variations and the predicted short damping and re-excitation
times. We do so by modelling the time variations in the cross correlation
profiles in terms of oscillation theory.
  Aims: The performance of existing diagnostics for mode identification is
investigated for known oscillating giants which have very small line profile
variations. We modify these diagnostics, perform simulations, and characterise
the radial and non-radial modes detected in the cross correlation profiles.
  Methods: Moments and line bisectors are computed and analysed for four
giants. The robustness of the discriminant of the moments against small
oscillations with finite lifetimes is investigated. In addition, line profiles
are simulated with short damping and re-excitation times and their line shapes
are compared with the observations.
  Results: For three stars, we find evidence for the presence of non-radial
pulsation modes, while for $\xi$ Hydrae perhaps only radial modes are present.
Furthermore the line bisectors are not able to distinguish between different
pulsation modes and are an insufficient diagnostic to discriminate small line
profile variations due to oscillations from exoplanet motion.

validity of using the infrared luminosity to estimate star formation rates of
luminous AGN by determining the relative significance of dust-heating by young,
massive stars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in QSO hosts and IRAS galaxies
with warm, AGN-like infrared colors. The HCN data show the PG QSO host IZw1 and
most of the warm IRAS galaxies to have high L_IR / L'_HCN (>1600) relative to
the cool IRAS galaxy population for which the median L_IR / L'_HCN ~
890(+440,-470). If the assumption is made that the infrared emission from cool
IRAS galaxies is reprocessed light from embedded star-forming regions, then
high values of L_IR / L'_HCN are likely the result of dust heating by the AGN.
Further, if the median ratio of L'_HCN / L'_CO ~ 0.06 observed for Seyfert
galaxies and IZw1 is applied to the PG QSOs not detected in HCN, then the
derived L_IR / L'_HCN correspond to a stellar contribution to the production of
L_IR of ~ 7-39%, and star formation rates ~ 2-37 M_sun/yr are derived for the
QSO hosts. Alternatively, if the far-infrared is adopted as the star formation
component of the total infrared in cool galaxies, the stellar contributions in
QSO hosts to their L_FIR are up to 35% higher than the percentages derived for
L_IR. This raises the possibility that the L_FIR in several of the PG QSO
hosts, including IZw1, could be due entirely to dust heated by young, massive
stars. Finally, there is no evidence that the global HCN emission is enhanced
relative to CO in galaxies hosting luminous AGN.

become eccentric, allowing material to fall back onto the donor star or out of
the system. A weak magnetic field on a rapidly spinning primary star propels
disc material outwards, allowing it to access these resonances. Numerical and
analytic calculations show that this state can be long lived (~10^11 yr). This
is because the magnetic propeller is required only to maintain access to the

nearby spiral galaxies, [O III] and [N II] emission lines were noted in some
cases. Three of these emission line sources are identified as likely planetary
nebula (PN) candidates and may represent a rare opportunity to study PNe whose
progenitor stars are known to be of intermediate masses. This paper presents
and discusses basic properties of the PN candidates and their host clusters.
Based on the observed emission line fluxes, the excitation parameters and
luminosities of the nebulae are derived. This allows a crude placement of the
central stars in two of the objects on the H-R diagram, and their temperatures
and luminosities are found to be consistent with post-AGB model tracks for a
central star mass of about 0.60 Msun. Host cluster ages and masses are
estimated from broad-band colours and by comparison with model SSP spectra. One
of the host clusters has an age of 32-65 Myrs, corresponding to a main sequence
turn-off mass of M(TO) = 6.6-9.0 Msun. For the other cluster the age is 282-407
Myrs, corresponding to M(TO) = 3.2-3.6 Msun. By estimating the number of stars
evolving off the main sequence per year, a total of 6 PNe are expected in our
full sample of 80 clusters for aPN lifetime of 10000 years. The factor of two
disagreement with the actual observed number may be due, among other things, to
uncertainties in PN lifetimes. It is interesting to note that all three PN
candidates are associated with clusters which are more diffuse than average.
While PNe have previously been found in some old globular clusters, the
candidates identified here are among the first identified in young star
clusters.

exciting star; furthermore it is surrounded along three quarters of its
periphery by a ring of atomic hydrogen. This spherical symmetry breaks down at
infrared and millimetre wavelengths. A molecular cloud of about 2000\msol lies
at the southwestern border of Sh2-219, in the HI gap. Two molecular
condensations, elongated along the ionization front, probably result from the

surprisingly, the brightest parts of the molecular cloud form a `chimney',
perpendicular to the ionization front. This chimney is closed at its south-west
extremity by H-alpha walls, thus forming a cavity. The whole structure is 7.5
pc long. A luminous H-alpha emission-line star, lying at one end of the chimney

instabilities due to dynamic strain aging and dislocation interaction. The
repeated breakaway of dislocations from and their recapture by solute atoms
leads to stress serrations and localized strain in the strain controlled
tensile tests, known as the Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect. In this present
work, we analyse the stress time series data of the observed PLC effect in the
constant strain rate tensile tests on Al-2.5%Mg alloy for a wide range of
strain rates at room temperature. The scaling behaviour of the PLC effect was
studied using two complementary scaling analysis methods: the finite variance
scaling method and the diffusion entropy analysis. From these analyses we could
establish that in the entire span of strain rates, PLC effect showed Levy walk
property. Moreover, the multiscale entropy analysis is carried out on the
stress time series data observed during the PLC effect to quantify the
complexity of the distinct spatiotemporal dynamical regimes. It is shown that
for the static type C band, the entropy is very low for all the scales compared
to the hopping type B and the propagating type A bands. The results are
interpreted considering the time and length scales relevant to the effect.

of interactions, Lifshitz transitions may become discontinuous in contrast to
the continuous transition in the original proposal by Lifshitz for
noninteracting systems. We focus on the quantum criticality at the endpoint of
discontinuous Lifshitz transitions, which we call the marginal quantum critical
point. It shows remarkable criticalities arising from its nature as a
topological transition. At the point, for the canonical ensemble, the
susceptibility of the order parameter chi is found to diverge as ln 1/|delta
Delta| when the ``neck'' of the Fermi surface collapses at the van Hove
singularity. More remarkably, it diverges as 1/|delta Delta| when the
electron/hole pocket of the Fermi surface vanishes. Here delta Delta is the
amplitude of the mean field measured from the Lifshitz critical point. On the
other hand, for the grand canonical ensemble, the discontinuous transitions
appear as the electronic phase separation and the endpoint of the phase
separation is the marginal quantum critical point. Especially, when a pocket of
the Fermi surface vanishes, the uniform charge compressibility kappa diverges
as 1/|delta n|, instead of chi, where delta n is the electron density measured
from the critical point. Accordingly, Lifshitz transition induces large
fluctuations represented by diverging chi and/or kappa. Such fluctuations must
be involved in physics of competing orders and influence diversity of strong
correlation effects.

between electron propagation via different channels connecting the leads, which
in the simplest case, for the magnetic field along the wire axis, can be
crudely characterized by relative winding numbers of paths enclosing the

spin-orbit coupling. The quantum-interference MC traces contain a wealth of

the levels is staircase-like. This behavior is explained by the interplay
between the adiabatic and the non-adiabatic regimes encountered during the

consider here two identical detectors having the same power spectral density of
noise, that of initial LIGO, located in the same place and having the same
orientation. We consider the cases of independent noise as well as that of
correlated noise. The coincident strategy involves separately making two
candidate event lists, one for each detector, and from these choosing those
pairs of events from the two lists which lie within a suitable parameter
window, which then are called as coincidence detections. The coherent strategy
on the other hand involves combining the data phase coherently, so as to obtain
a single network statistic which is then compared with a single threshold. Here
we attempt to shed light on the question as to which strategy is better. We
compare the performances of the two methods by plotting the Receiver Operating
Characteristics (ROC) for the two strategies. Several of the results are
obtained analytically in order to gain insight. Further we perform numerical
simulations in order to determine certain parameters in the analytic formulae
and thus obtain the final complete results. We consider here several cases from
the relatively simple to the astrophysically more relevant in order to
establish our results. The bottom line is that the coherent strategy although
more computationally expensive in general than the coincidence strategy, is
superior to the coincidence strategy - considerably less false dismissal
probability for the same false alarm probability in the viable false alarm
regime.

containing at least two U(1) gauge factors. Here, we point out that the
required multiple U(1) factors, the size of kinetic-mixing, and suitable matter
representations to allow for a detection in the near future occur naturally in
the context of string theory embeddings of the Standard Model. A detection of
minicharged particles in a low energy experiment would likely be a signal of an
underlying string theory and may provide a means of testing it.

mechanism resolves a class of repulson singularities which arise in the BMPV
geometry when D--branes are wrapped on K3. In the process, we show that the
interior of an enhancon shell can be a time machine due to non-vanishing
rotation. We link the resolution of the time machine to the recently proposed
resolution of the BMPV naked singularity / ""over-rotating"" geometry through the
expansion of strings in the presence of RR flux. We extend the analysis to
include a general class of BMPV black hole configurations, showing that any
attempt to ""over-rotate"" a causally sound BMPV black hole will be thwarted by
the resolution mechanism. We study how it may be possible to lower the entropy
of a black hole due to the non-zero rotation. This process is prevented from
occurring through the creation of a family of resolving shells. The second law
of thermodynamics is thereby enforced in the rotating geometry - even when
there is no risk of creating a naked singularity or closed time-like curves.

model, a model which serves as a prototype for theories which are based on
second plus fourth order derivative actions. Via a Dirac constraint method
quantization we construct the appropriate quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian and
Hilbert space for the system. We find that while the second-quantized Fock
space of the general Pais-Uhlenbeck model does indeed contain the negative norm
energy eigenstates which are characteristic of higher derivative theories, in
the limit in which we switch off the second order action, such ghost states are
found to move off shell, with the spectrum of asymptotic in and out S-matrix
states of the pure fourth order theory which results being found to be
completely devoid of states with either negative energy or negative norm. We
confirm these results by quantizing the Pais-Uhlenbeck theory via path
integration and by constructing the associated first-quantized wave mechanics,
and show that the disappearance of the would-be ghosts from the energy
eigenspectrum in the pure fourth order limit is required by a hidden symmetry
that the pure fourth order theory is unexpectedly found to possess. The
occurrence of on-shell ghosts is thus seen not to be a shortcoming of pure
fourth order theories per se, but rather to be one which only arises when
fourth and second order theories are coupled to each other.

problem of vorticity confinement in the exterior of a smooth bounded domain.
The main result in Marchioro's paper is that solutions of the incompressible 2D
Euler equations with compactly supported nonnegative initial vorticity in the
exterior of a connected bounded region have vorticity support with diameter
growing at most like $\mathcal{O}(t^{(1/2)+\vare})$, for any $\vare>0$. In
addition, if the domain is the exterior of a disk, then the vorticity support
is contained in a disk of radius $\mathcal{O}(t^{1/3})$. The purpose of the
present article is to refine Marchioro's results. We will prove that, if the
initial vorticity is even with respect to the origin, then the exponent for the
exterior of the disk may be improved to 1/4. For flows in the exterior of a
smooth, connected, bounded domain we prove a confinement estimate with exponent
1/2 (i.e. we remove the $\vare$) and in certain cases, depending on the
harmonic part of the flow, we establish a logarithmic improvement over the
exponent 1/2. The main new ingredients in our approach are: (1) a detailed
asymptotic description of solutions to the exterior Poisson problem near
infinity, obtained by the use of Riemann mappings; (2) renormalized energy
estimates and bounds on logarithmic moments of vorticity and (3) a new {\it a

symbolic sequence of a discrete dynamical system. For an appropriate choice of
the dynamical system, we could back-iterate and encode the message as the
initial condition of the dynamical system. We show that such an encoding
achieves Shannon's entropy and hence optimal for compression. It turns out that
the appropriate discrete dynamical system to achieve optimality is the
piecewise-linear Generalized Luroth Series (GLS) and further that such an
entropy coding technique is exactly equivalent to the popular Arithmetic Coding
algorithm. GLS is a generalization of Arithmetic Coding with different modes of
operation.
  GLS preserves the Lebesgue measure and is ergodic. We show that these
properties of GLS enable a framework for joint compression and encryption and
thus give a justification of the recent work of Grangetto et al. and Wen et al.
Both these methods have the obvious disadvantage of the key length being equal
to the message length for strong security. We derive measure preserving
piece-wise non-linear GLS (nGLS) and their skewed cousins, which exhibit Robust
Chaos. We propose a joint entropy coding and encryption framework using
skewed-nGLS and demonstrate Shannon's desired sensitivity to the key parameter.
Potentially, our method could improve the security and key efficiency over
Grangetto's method while still maintaining the total compression ratio. This is
a new area of research with promising applications in communications.

Zeeman shift and vector light-shift cancellation techniques. By introducing
both an H-maser and a Global Positioning System (GPS) carrier phase link, the
absolute frequency of the $^1S_0(F=9/2) - {}^3P_0(F=9/2)$ clock transition of
the $^{87}$Sr optical lattice clock is determined as 429,228,004,229,875(4) Hz,
where the uncertainty is mainly limited by that of the frequency link. The
result indicates that the Sr lattice clock will play an important role in the
scope of the redefinition of the ``second'' by optical frequency standards.

are performed, and the results show that the shape of $\chi^2$ distribution of
the signal channel looks different from those of the background channels, thus
it provides us by fitting the $\chi^2$ distribution of the data to extract the

At the end of the protocol, the flying atom completely disentangles from the
rest of the system, leaving both ions in a Bell-type state. Moreover, the
scheme is insensitive to the cavity field state and cavity losses. We also
address the situation in which dephasing and dissipation must be taken into
account for the flying atom on its way from one cavity to the other, and
discuss the applicability of the resulting noisy channel for performing quantum
teleportation.

place from modulus to phase of the bi-photon state and back again. We propose
an experiment to observe this migration in Hilbert space and to determine the
