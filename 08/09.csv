of the Magellanic System with the Milky Way (MW). The varied parameters cover
the phase space parameters, the masses, the structure, and the orientation of
both Magellanic Clouds, as well as the flattening of the dark matter halo of
the MW. The analysis was done by a specially adopted optimization code
searching for the best match between numerical models and the detailed HI map
of the Magellanic System by Bruens et al. (2005). The applied search algorithm
is a genetic algorithm combined with a code based on the fast, but
approximative restricted N-body method. By this, we were able to analyze more
than 10^6 models, which makes this study one of the most extended ones for the
Magellanic System. Here we focus on the flattening q of the axially symmetric
MW dark matter halo potential, that is studied within the range 0.74<=q<=1.20.
We show that creation of a trailing tail (Magellanic Stream) and a leading
stream (Leading Arm) is quite a common feature of the Magellanic System-MW
interaction, and such structures were modeled across the entire range of halo
flattening values. However, important differences exist between the models,
concerning density distribution and kinematics of HI, and also the dynamical
evolution of the Magellanic System. Detailed analysis of the overall agreement
between modeled and observed distribution of neutral hydrogen shows that the
models assuming an oblate (q<1.0) dark matter halo of the Galaxy allow for
better satisfaction of HI observations than models with other halo

nuclear fuel at their cores, in a strict sense, the process of release of
stored gravitational energy, known as, Kelvin - Helmholtz (KH) process is
either also operational albeit at an arbitrary slow rate, or lying in wait to
take over at the disruption of the nuclear channel. In fact, the latter mode of
energy release is the true feature of any self-gravity bound object including
stars. We also highligh the almost forgotten fact that Eddington was the first
physicist to introduce Special Relativity into the problem and correctly insist
that, actually, total energy stored in a star is not the mere Newtonian energy
but the total mass energy (E = M c^2). Accordingly, Eddington defined an
``Einstein Time Scale'' of Evolution where the maximum age of the Sun turned
out to be t_E = 1.4. 10^{13} yr. We extend this concept by introducing General
Relativity and show that the minimum value of depletion of total mass-energy is
t_E =infty not only for Sun but for and sufficiently massive or dense object.
We propose that this time scale be known in the name of ``Einstein -
Eddington''. We also point out that, recently, it has been shown that as
massive stars undergo continued collapse to become a Black Hole, first they
become extremely relativistic Radiation Pressure Supported Stars. And the life
time of such relativistic radiation pressure supported compact stars is indeed
dictated by this Einstein -Eddington time scale whose concept is formally
developed here. Since this observed time scale of this radiation pressure
supported quasistatic state turns out to be infinite, such objects are called
Magnetospheric Eternally Collapsing Objects (MECO).

gamma-ray light curve is marked by a soft precursor pulse some 200 s before the
main event; the lack of any intervening emission suggests that it is due to a
physical mechanism distinct from the GRB itself. The large time lag between the
precursor and the main emission enabled simultaneous observations in the
gamma-ray, X-ray, and optical band-passes, something only achieved for a
handful of events to date. While the contemporaneous X-rays are the low-energy
tail of the prompt emission, the optical does not directly track the gamma-ray
flux. Instead, the early-time optical data appear mostly consistent with the
forward shock synchrotron peak passing through the optical, and are therefore
likely the beginning of the afterglow. On hour time scales after the burst, the
X-ray and optical light curves are inconsistent with an adiabatic expansion of
the shock into the surrounding region, but rather indicate that there is a
period of energy injection. Observations at late times allow us to constrain
the collimation angle of the relativistic outflow to theta = 6.8 - 9.3 degrees.
Our estimates of both the kinetic energy of the afterglow and the prompt
gamma-ray energy release make GRB 050820A one of the most energetic events for

of radius and time, we find that the Lya color temperature may be negative in
large volumes surrounding the central source. Motivated by this result, we
explore the prospects for a population inversion in the hyperfine levels of
atomic hydrogen via the Wouthuysen-Field (WF) effect. The reason for this
exploration is clear: if 21-cm masers exist during the EoR, they could greatly
boost the expected 21-cm flux from this epoch. We find that population
inversion is unlikely to occur for several reasons: (1) the required Lya
luminosities of the central source exceed ~10e45 erg/s. The radiation pressure
exerted by such a large Lya flux likely halts the collapse of the cloud; (2)
When quantum corrections to the WF-coupling strength are applied, the required
Lya luminosities are (even) larger by orders of magnitude; (3) A relatively low
flux of Lya photons that is produced via other channels (x-ray heating,
collisional excitation of hydrogen) prevents the Lya color temperature from
becoming negative.

characterized by different mass accretion patterns. In the first ""developing
phase"", the disc is formed and develops towards a nearly Keplerian disc. It has
a relatively large, double-peaked mass-accretion rate with the higher peak by
the direct accretion at periastron, which is followed by the lower peak by the
accretion induced by a one-armed spiral wave. In the second ""transition phase"",
the disc is approximately Keplerian and grows with time. The mass-accretion
rate increases as the disc grows. In the second phase, there is a transition in
the mass accretion rate from a double peaked to a single peaked pattern. In the
final quasi-steady state, the mass-accretion rate is on average balanced with
the mass-transfer rate from the Be disc and exhibits a regular orbital
modulation. In the quasi-steady state, the mass-accretion rate has a single
peak by the wave-induced accretion as in a later stage of the transition phase.
The orbital modulation of X-ray maxima could provide not only a circumstantial

We find that when both visible and NIR polarization data are plotted as a
function of extinction, there is no evidence for a plateau or a saturation
effect in the polarization at Av ~ 1.3 as seen in dark clouds in Taurus. This
lack of saturation effect suggests that even in the denser parts of GF 9 we are
still probing the magnetic field. The visible polarization is smooth and has a
well-defined orientation. The IR data are also well defined but with a
different direction, and the FIR data in the core region are well defined and
with yet another direction, but are randomly distributed in the filament
region. On the scale of a few times the mean radial dimension of the molecular
cloud, it is as if the magnetic field were `blind' to the spatial distribution
of the filaments while on smaller scales within the cloud, in the core region
near the IRAS point source PSC 20503+6006, polarimetry shows a rotation of the
magnetic field lines in these denser phases. Hence, in spite of the fact that
the spatial resolution is not the same in the visible/NIR and in the FIR data,
all the data put together indicate that the field direction changes with the
spatial scale. Finally, the Chandrasekhar and Fermi method is used to evaluate
the magnetic field strength, indicating that the core region is approximately
magnetically critical. A global interpretation of the results is that in the
core region an original poloidal field could have been twisted by a rotating
elongated (core+envelope) structure. There is no evidence for turbulence and
ambipolar diffusion does not seem to be effective at the present time.

quasar detected at z =6.42 (Fan et al. 2003). Moreover, the SMBHs grow through
gas accretion below the Eddington limit in a self-regulated manner owing to
feedback. We find that the progenitors experience significant star formation
(up to 10^4 Msun/yr) preceding the major quasar phase such that the stellar
mass of the quasar host reaches 10^{12} Msun at z ~ 6.5, consistent with
observations of significant metal enrichment in SDSS J1148+5251. Our results
provide a viable formation mechanism for z ~ 6 quasars in the standard LCDM

quasars and the fundamental SMBH-host correlation in a hierarchical

Alfven waves, which are excited by the surface convections travel outwardly and
dissipate by nonlinear processes to accelerate and heat the stellar winds. We
dynamically treat these processes in open magnetic field regions from the
photospheres to 25 stellar radii. When the stars evolve to slightly blueward
positions of the dividing line (Linsky & Haisch), the steady hot corona with
temperature, ~ 1MK, suddenly disappears. Instead, many hot (~1MK) and warm
(~10^5K) bubbles are formed in cool (T<~2x10^4K) chromospheric winds because of
thermal instability; the red giant wind is not a steady stream but structured
outflow. As a result, the mass loss rates, \dot{M}, largely vary in time by 3-4
orders or magnitude in the RGB stars. Supported by magnetic pressure, the
density of hot bubbles can be kept low to reduce the radiative cooling and to
maintain the high temperature long time. Even in the stars redward of the
dividing line, hot bubbles intermittently exist, and they can be sources of
UV/soft X-ray emissions from hybrid stars. Nearly static regions are formed
above the photospheres of the RGB stars, and the stellar winds are effectively
accelerated from several stellar radii. Then, the wind velocity is much smaller
than the surface escape speed, because it is regulated by the slower escape
speed at that location. We finally derive an equation that determines \dot{M}
from the energetics of the simulated wave-driven winds in a forward manner. The
relation explains \dot{M} from MS to RGB, and it can play a complementary role
to the Reimers' formula, which is mainly for more luminous stars.

additional dust and also stellar light to heat the dust component. We use
multi-band photometry in U, B, V, R, and I- band combined with radiative
transfer through a dust component to fit simultaneously the vertical
surface-brightness and colour index profiles in all bands adopting a reasonable

reproduces the surface-brightness profiles in all bands with a moderately

Carretta and Gratton (1997) though we discuss why this may not be the best
determinant of metallicity; Leo I has a mean [Fe/H] = -1.34 and Leo II has a
mean [Fe/H] = -1.59. The metallicity distribution function of Leo I is
approximately Gaussian in shape with an excess at the metal-rich end, while
that of Leo II shows an abrupt cutoff at the metal-rich end. The lower mean
metallicity of Leo II is consistent with the fact that it has a lower
luminosity, hence lower total mass, than Leo I; thus the evolution of Leo II
may have been affected more by mass lost in galactic winds. We compare our
observed metallicity distribution functions to those inferred by Dolphin (2002)
from modelling of deep CMDs obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. The
models predict a median metallicity that is systematically more metal-rich than
observed, by 0.36 dex in the Leo I dSph, and by 0.49 dex in the Leo II dSph. We
show that differences this large are not likely caused by non-solar [Ca/Fe] in

radiation. This has required removal of foreground contamination as well as
detector noise bias with reliability and precision. Recently, a novel
model-independent method for the estimation of CMB angular power spectrum from
multi-frequency observations has been proposed and implemented on the first
year WMAP (WMAP-1) data by Saha et al.~2006. We review the results from WMAP-1
and also present the new angular power spectrum based on three years of the
WMAP data (WMAP-3). Previous estimates have depended on foreground templates
built using extraneous observational input to remove foreground contamination.
This is the first demonstration that the CMB angular spectrum can be reliably
estimated with precision from a self contained analysis of the WMAP data. The
primary product of WMAP are the observations of CMB in 10 independent
difference assemblies (DA) distributed over 5 frequency bands that have
uncorrelated noise. Our method utilizes maximum information available within
WMAP data by linearly combining DA maps from different frequencies to remove
foregrounds and estimating the power spectrum from the 24 cross power spectra
of clean maps that have independent noise. An important merit of the method is
that the expected residual power from unresolved point sources is significantly
tempered to a constant offset at large multipoles (in contrast to the ~l^2
contribution expected from a Poisson distribution) leading to a small
correction at large multipoles. Hence, the power spectrum estimates are less
susceptible to uncertainties in the model of point sources.

to provide high quality observations in rather different global environments.

the cosmological parameters of the Universe. When the measured density of
baryons (ordinary matter) is combined with standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis
calculations, the amounts of hydrogen, helium and lithium produced shortly
after the Big Bang can be predicted with unprecedented precision. The predicted
primordial lithium abundance is a factor of two to three higher than the value
measured in the atmospheres of old stars. With estimated errors of 10 to 25%,
this cosmological lithium discrepancy seriously challenges our understanding of
stellar physics, Big Bang nucleosynthesis or both. Certain modifications to
nucleosynthesis have been proposed, but found experimentally not to be viable.
Diffusion theory, however, predicts atmospheric abundances of stars to vary
with time, which offers a possible explanation of the discrepancy. Here we
report spectroscopic observations of stars in the metalpoor globular cluster
NGC 6397 that reveal trends of atmospheric abundance with evolutionary stage
for various elements. These element-specific trends are reproduced by
stellar-evolution models with diffusion and turbulent mixing. We thus conclude
that diffusion is predominantly responsible for the low apparent stellar
lithium abundance in the atmospheres of old stars by transporting the lithium
deep into the star.

Dark halo accretion rates are compared with numerical work and the consequences
for understanding AGN evolution are described. Results: The mean accretion rate
onto dark matter halos is shown to have a simple analytic form that agrees with
previous numerical work and that may easily be calculated for a wide range of
halo mass, redshift and cosmological parameters. The result offers a
significant improvement over published fitting formulae deduced from merger
trees. We then consider the growth of associated supermassive black holes, and
make a basic test of the simple hypothesis of `Pure Coeval Evolution' (PCE) in
which, on average, black hole growth tracks dark halo growth. We demonstrate
that both the absolute value of the integrated AGN bolometric luminosity
density and its cosmological evolution derived from hard X-ray surveys are
well-reproduced by PCE. Excellent agreement is found at z >~ 0.5, although the
observed luminosity density drops by a factor 2 compared with PCE by z=0: black
hole growth appears to decouple from halo growth at low redshifts, and this may
be related to the phenomenon of `cosmic downsizing'. Overall, AGN evolution
appears either to be caused by or to be closely linked to the slow-down in the
growth of cosmic structure. We also discuss the mean Eddington ratio averaged
over all galaxies, which is predicted to show strong evolution to higher values

is offset to the more evolved north-west clusters 4,5. This suggests that hard

the most massive youngest stars, but rather is connected with fast radiative
shocks. This conclusion is supported by the kinematical properties of the
ionised gas from the different emission lines as the velocity dispersion in the
HeII 4686A line is systematically higher, by ~50%-100%, than that in other

We calculate the time-distance diagram for f- and p-modes and show that it is
consistent with the SOHO/MDI observations. From the simulation data we
calculate travel time maps for surface gravity waves (f-mode). We also apply
correlation tracking to the simulated vertical velocity in the photosphere to
calculate the corresponding horizontal flows. We compare both of these to the
actual large-scale (filtered) simulation velocities. All three methods reveal
similar large scale convective patterns and provide an initial test of
time-distance methods.

nowadays routinely performed within the GW approximation for the electronic
self-energy. Nevertheless, certain numerical approximations and simplifications
are still employed in practice to make the computations feasible. An important
aspect for periodic systems is the proper treatment of the singularity of the
screened Coulomb interaction in reciprocal space, which results from the slow
1/r decay in real space. This must be done without introducing artificial
interactions between the quasiparticles and their periodic images in repeated
cells, which occur when integrals of the screened Coulomb interaction are
discretised in reciprocal space. An adequate treatment of both aspects is
crucial for a numerically stable computation of the self-energy. In this
article we build on existing schemes for isotropic screening and present an
extension for anisotropic systems. We also show how the contributions to the
dielectric function arising from the non-local part of the pseudopotentials can
be computed efficiently. These improvements are crucial for obtaining a fast
convergence with respect to the number of points used for the Brillouin zone
integration and prove to be essential to make GW calculations for strongly

theoretical predictions. However, for bilayer graphene only two studies are
known with predictions for the minimal conductivity different from our
calculated values. Similarly to the single layer case, the physical origin of
the minimal conductivity in bilayer graphene is also rooted back to the
intrinsic disorder induced by the Zitterbewegung which is related to the
trembling motion of the electron.

this proposal. Among others, we suggest a technique called adaptive routing
that provides secure intelligent routing capabilities to computer communication
networks. This technique uses the flow label, supports hybrid metrics, network
load sharing, and is not restricted to evaluation of performance on first hop
routers when making routing decisions. Selective anycasting is an extension to
the anycast addressing model that supports exclusion of members of groups that
perform poorly or inappropriately on a per-host basis. Distributed name lookup
is suggested for integrating self-forming and global networks where they
coexist. At last, we pose an address hierarchy to support unmanaged discovery
of services in unknown networks.

show that linear network coding across packets of a flow can sustain traffic
patterns that cannot be served if network coding were not allowed. Thus,
network coding leads to a larger rate region in a multicast crossbar switch. We
demonstrate a traffic pattern which requires a switch speedup if coding is not
allowed, whereas, with coding the speedup requirement is eliminated completely.
In addition to throughput benefits, coding simplifies the characterization of
the rate region. We give a graph-theoretic characterization of the rate region
with fanout splitting and intra-flow coding, in terms of the stable set
polytope of the 'enhanced conflict graph' of the traffic pattern. Such a
formulation is not known in the case of fanout splitting without coding. We
show that computing the offline schedule (i.e. using prior knowledge of the
flow arrival rates) can be reduced to certain graph coloring problems. Finally,
we propose online algorithms (i.e. using only the current queue occupancy
information) for multicast scheduling based on our graph-theoretic formulation.
In particular, we show that a maximum weighted stable set algorithm stabilizes
the queues for all rates within the rate region.

involve thousands of computing, data handling, and network resources. The
central problem in the scheduling of these resources is the coordinated
management of computation and data at multiple locations and not just data
replication or movement. However, this can prove to be a rather costly
operation and efficient sing can be a challenge if compute and data resources
are mapped without considering network costs. We have implemented an adaptive
algorithm within the so-called DIANA Scheduler which takes into account data
location and size, network performance and computation capability in order to
enable efficient global scheduling. DIANA is a performance-aware and
economy-guided Meta Scheduler. It iteratively allocates each job to the site
that is most likely to produce the best performance as well as optimizing the
global queue for any remaining jobs. Therefore it is equally suitable whether a
single job is being submitted or bulk scheduling is being performed. Results
indicate that considerable performance improvements can be gained by adopting
the DIANA scheduling approach.

parameters, $m_0$, $\zeta$, and $c_B=c_E$ are obtained by matching
finite-volume, heavy-heavy and heavy-light meson masses to the exact
relativistic spectrum through a finite-volume, step-scaling recursion
procedure. We demonstrate that accuracy on the level of a few percent can be
achieved by carrying out this matching on a pair of lattices with equal
physical spatial volumes but quite different lattice spacings. A fine lattice
with inverse lattice spacing $1/a=5.4$ GeV and $24^3 \times 48$ sites and a
coarse, $1/a=3.6$ GeV, $16^3 \times 32$ lattice are used together with a heavy
quark mass $m$ approximately that of the charm quark. This approach is unable
to determine the initially expected, four heavy-quark parameters: $m_0$,
$\zeta$, $c_B$ and $c_E$. This apparent non-uniqueness of these four parameters
motivated the analytic result, presented in a companion paper, that this set is
redundant and that the restriction $c_E=c_B$ is permitted through order $a|\vec
p|$ and to all orders in $m a$ where $\vec p$ is the heavy quark's spatial
momenta.

In our analysis, we first consider high-scale Yukawa textures which qualify
phenomenologically viable at tree level, and find that they get completely
disqualified after incorporating the threshold corrections. Next, we consider
Yukawa couplings, such as those with five texture zeroes, which are incapable
of explaining flavor-changing proceses. Incorporation of threshold corrections,
however, makes them phenomenologically viable textures. Therefore,
supersymmetric threshold corrections are found to leave observable impact on
Yukawa couplings of quarks, and any confrontation of high-scale textures with

optoelectronically by modulating the pump of one laser with the intensity
deviations of the other. Signal propagation time in the optoelectronic loop
causes a significant delay leading to the onset of oscillatory output.
Multiscale perturbation methods are used to describe the amplitude and period
of oscillations as a function of the coupling strength and delay time. For weak
coupling the oscillations have the laser's relaxation period, and the amplitude
varies as the one-fourth power of the parameter deviations from the bifurcation
point. For order-one coupling strength the period is determined as multiples of
the delay time, and the amplitude varies with a square-root power law. Because
we allow for independent control of the individual coupling constants, for
certain parameter values there is an atypical amplitude-resonance phenomena.
Finally, our theoretical results are consistent with recent experimental
observations when the inclusion of a low-pass filter in the coupling loop is

states. We show that the strategy is optimal in a local minimax sense for the
trace norm distance as well as other locally quadratic figures of merit. Local
minimax optimality means that given $n$ identical qubits, there exists no
estimator which can perform better than the proposed estimator on a
neighborhood of size $n^{-1/2}$ of an arbitrary state. In particular, it is
asymptotically Bayesian optimal for a large class of prior distributions.
  We present a physical implementation of the optimal estimation strategy based
on continuous time measurements in a field that couples with the qubits.
  The crucial ingredient of the result is the concept of local asymptotic
normality (or LAN) for qubits. This means that, for large $n$, the statistical
model described by $n$ identically prepared qubits is locally equivalent to a
model with only a classical Gaussian distribution and a Gaussian state of a
quantum harmonic oscillator.
  The term `local' refers to a shrinking neighborhood around a fixed state
$\rho_{0}$. An essential result is that the neighborhood radius can be chosen
arbitrarily close to $n^{-1/4}$. This allows us to use a two steps procedure by
which we first localize the state within a smaller neighborhood of radius
$n^{-1/2+\epsilon}$, and then use LAN to perform optimal estimation.

degree of freedom of a trapped ion can be used to perform weak force
measurements with Heisenberg-limited sensitivity. We propose methods to
engineer the Hamiltonian of the trapped ion to generate states with such small
scale structures, and we show how to use them in quantum metrology
applications.
