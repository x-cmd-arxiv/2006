gamma-ray source TeV J2032+4130 carried out with the Whipple Observatory 10 m
atmospheric Cherenkov telescope for a total of 65.5 hrs between 2003 and 2005.
The standard two-dimensional analysis developed by the Whipple collaboration
for a stand-alone telescope reveals an excess in the field of view at a
pre-trials significance level of 6.1 standard deviations. The measured position
of this excess is alpha(2000) =20 h 32 m 27 s, delta(2000) = 41 deg 39 min 17
s. The estimated integral flux for this gamma-ray source is about 8% of the
Crab-Nebula flux. The data are consistent with a point-like source. Here we
present a detailed description of the standard two-dimensional analysis
technique used for the analysis of data taken with the Whipple Observatory 10 m
telescope and the results for the TeV J2032+4130 campaign. We include a short
discussion of the physical mechanisms that may be responsible for the observed
gamma-ray emission, based on possible association with known astrophysical

point of view, their existence finds support in modern superstring theories,
both in compactification models and in theories with extended additional

cosmology and fundamental physics. One of the most effective ways to detect
cosmic strings is through their lensing signatures which appear to be
significantly different from those introduced by standard lenses (id est,
compact clumps of matter). In 2003, the discovery of the peculiar object CSL-1
(Sazhin et al.2003) raised the interest of the physics community since its
morphology and spectral features strongly argued in favour of it being the
first case of gravitational lensing by a cosmic string. In this paper we
provide a detailed description of the expected observational effects of a

produced on background galaxies. While high angular resolution images obtained

We show that such a merger produces two exponential disk components, with the
older, hotter component having a scale-length 20% larger than the
later-forming, cold disk. Rapid star formation during the merger quickly
enriches the protogalactic gas reservoir, resulting in high metallicities of
the forming stars. These stars form from gas largely polluted by Type II
supernovae, which form rapidly in the merger-induced starburst. After the
merger, a thin disk forms from gas which has had time to be polluted by Type Ia
supernovae. Abundance trends are plotted, and we examine the proposal that
increased star formation during gas-rich mergers may explain the high
alpha-to-iron abundance ratios which exist in the relatively high-metallicity
thick disk component of the Milky Way.

Despite their importance, a comprehensive knowledge of which massive stars
produce which SNe is hitherto lacking. We use a Monte Carlo method to predict
the mass-loss rates of massive stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (HRD)
covering all phases from the OB main sequence, the unstable Luminous Blue
Variable (LBV) stage, to the final Wolf-Rayet (WR) phase. Although WR produce
their own metals, a strong dependence of the mass-loss rate on the initial iron
abundance is found at sub-solar metallicities (1/10 -- 1/100 solar). This may
present a viable mechanism to prevent the loss of angular momentum by stellar
winds, which could inhibit GRBs occurring at solar metallicities -- providing a
significant boost to the collapsar model. Furthermore, we discuss recently
reported quasi-sinusoidal modulations in the radio lightcurves of SNe 2001ig

tachyon remains light throughout inflation, whereas n=4 contamination to the
spectrum is the dominant effect when the tachyon is heavy. We find constraints
on the parameters of warped-throat brane-antibrane inflation from
nongaussianity. For F-term and D-term inflation models from supergravity, we
obtain nontrivial constraints from the spectral distortion effect. We also
establish that our analysis applies to complex tachyon fields.

the six brightest PNe (Corradi et al. 2005) were derived using both the
empirical ICF method and photoionization modelling with CLOUDY. Different
aspects of the evolution of low and intermediate mass stars in a
low-metallicity environment are analysed using relationships between chemical
abundances. In addition, certain features of the chemical evolution of NGC147
were examined. In particular, the mean metallicity of PNe, O/H=8.06
(corresponding to [Fe/H](PNe)~-0.97), is close to the metallicity of the old
stellar population, [Fe/H]=-1.0 (Butler & Martinez-Delgado), suggesting a
negligible chemical enrichment during a substantial amount of time. Finally,
the luminosity-metallicity relationship for the dwarf galaxies of the Local
Group is discussed. The location in the luminosity-metallicity diagram of dSphs
does not exclude their formation from old dwarf irregular (dIrs) galaxies, but
it does exclude their formation from the present time dIrs, since the
differences between their metallicities are already present in their older
populations. The offset in the luminosity-metallicity relationship indicates a
faster enrichment of dSphs, and together with the different average abundance
ratio [O/Fe] demonstrates the different star formation histories for these two
types of galaxies.

the temperatures are higher than the sublimation temperature of solids. As the
star illuminates the innermost particles, which are immersed in gas at the
sublimation edge, these particles are subject to a photophoretic force. We
examine the motion of dust particles at the inner edge of protoplanetary disks
due to photophoretic drag. We find that, in a laminar disk, photophoretic drag
increases the size of the inner hole after accretion onto the central body has
become subdued. This region within the hole becomes an optically transparent
zone containing gas and large dusty particles (>>10 cm), but devoid of, or
strongly depleted in, smaller dust aggregates. Photophoresis can clear the
inner disk of dust out to 10 AU in less than 1 Myr. At late times, the edge
reaches a stable equilibrium between inward drift and photophoretic outward
drift, at a distance of some tens of AU. Eventually, the edge will move inwards
again as the disk disperses, shifting the equilibrium position back from about
40 AU to below 30 AU in 1-2 Myr in the disk model. In a turbulent disk,
diffusion can delay the clearing of a disk by photophoresis. Smaller and/or
age-independent holes of radii of a few AU are also possible outcomes of
turbulent diffusion counteracting photophoresis. This outward and then inward
moving edge marks a region of high dust concentration. This density
enhancement, and the efficient transport of particles from close to the star to
large distances away, can explain features of comets such as high measured
ratios of crystalline to amorphous silicates, and has a large number of other

determined here is compatible with accretion from a stellar wind. We use
cyclotron spectroscopy to determine the accretion geometry and to constrain the

reveal low plasma temperatures below 3 keV on both accretion spots. For the low
m_dot, high B plasma at the accretion spots in WXLMi, cyclotron cooling is
dominating thermal plasma radiation in the optical. Optical spectroscopy and

zones of several solar-type oscillating stars are used to characterize the

turbulent entropy fluctuations in the uppermost part of the convective zone of
such stars. These constraints, coupled with a theoretical model for stochastic
excitation, provide the rate 'P' at which energy is injected into the p-modes
by turbulent convection. These energy rates are compared with those derived
directly from the 3D simulations. The excitation rates obtained from the 3D
simulations are systematically lower than those computed from the
semi-analytical excitation model. We find that Pmax, the excitation rate
maximum, scales as (L/M)^s where s is the slope of the power law and L and M
are the mass and luminosity of the 1D stellar model built consistently with the
associated 3D simulation. The slope is found to depend significantly on the
adopted form of the eddy time-correlation ; using a Lorentzian form results in
s=2.6, whereas a Gaussian one gives s=3.1. Finally, values of Vmax, the maximum
in the mode velocity, are estimated from the computed power laws for Pmax and
we find that Vmax increases as (L/M)^sv. Comparisons with the currently
available ground-based observations show that the computations assuming a
Lorentzian eddy time-correlation yield a slope, sv, closer to the observed one
than the slope obtained when assuming a Gaussian. We show that the spatial

disks. Disk-forming wind models have, however, been found to be insufficient in
reproducing the observed dust emission. This problem arises due to the severe
assumption that, as for classical Be stars, the near-infrared excess emission
originates in the disk. Modeling of the free-free and free-bound emission
therefore results in an upper limit for the disk mass loss rate, hampering dust
condensation in the disk. We propose a revised scenario for the non-spherical
winds of B[e] supergiants: a normal B-type line-driven polar wind and an
outflowing disk-forming wind that is neutral in hydrogen at, or very close to
the stellar surface. We concentrate on the pole-on seen LMC B[e] supergiant
R126 and calculate the line luminosities of the optical [OI] emission lines
with an outflowing disk scenario. In addition, we compute the free-free and
free-bound emission from a line-driven polar wind and model the spectral energy
distribution in the optical and near-infrared. Good fits to the [OI] line
luminosities are achieved for an outflowing disk that is neutral in hydrogen
right from the stellar surface. Neutral thereby means that hydrogen is ionized
by less than 0.1%. Consequently, the free-free and free-bound emission cannot
(dominantly) arise from the disk and cannot limit the disk mass loss rate. The
hydrogen neutral outflowing disk scenario therefore provides an ideal
environment for efficient dust formation. The spectral energy distribution in
the optical and near-infrared range can be well fitted with the stellar
continuum plus free-free and free-bound emission from the polar line-driven
wind. Our modeling further delivers minimum values for \dot{M}(disk) > 2.5d-5
M_sun/yr and for the density contrast between equatorial and polar wind of ~10.

localized nature of the molecular orbitals. As a consequence, insulating
molecules in weak contact with metallic electrodes erroneously form highly
conducting junctions, a failure similar to the inability of local functionals
of describing Mott-Hubbard insulators. Here we present a fully self-consistent
and still computationally undemanding self-interaction correction scheme that
overcomes these limitations. The method is implemented in the Green's function
non-equilibrium transport code Smeagol and applied to the prototypical cases of
benzene molecules sandwiched between gold electrodes. The self-interaction
corrected Kohn-Sham highest occupied molecular orbital now reproduces closely
the negative of the molecular ionization potential and is moved away from the
gold Fermi energy. This leads to a drastic reduction of the low bias current in
much better agreement with experiments.

Efimov's prediction of a universal set of weakly bound trimer states appearing
for three identical bosons with a resonant two-body interaction. Surprisingly,
these states even exist in the absence of a corresponding two-body bound state
and their precise nature is largely independent of the particular type of the
two-body interaction potential. Efimov's scenario has attracted great interest
in many areas of physics; an experimental test however has not been achieved.
We report the observation of an Efimov resonance in an ultracold thermal gas of
cesium atoms. The resonance occurs in the range of large negative two-body
scattering lengths and arises from the coupling of three free atoms to an
Efimov trimer. We observe its signature as a giant three-body recombination
loss when the strength of the two-body interaction is varied near a Feshbach
resonance. This resonance develops into a continuum resonance at non-zero
collision energies, and we observe a shift of the resonance position as a
function of temperature. We also report on a minimum in the recombination loss

pathways. Our results confirm central theoretical predictions of Efimov physics

from one sender to one receiver. The relay is considered not only as a sender

problem of the relay channel under the situation that some of transmitted
messages are confidential to the relay. A security of such confidential
messages is measured by the conditional entropy. The rate region is defined by
the set of transmission rates for which messages are reliably transmitted and
the security of confidential messages is larger than a prescribed level. In
this paper we give two definition of the rate region. We first define the rate
region in the case of deterministic encoder and call it the deterministic rate
region. Next, we define the rate region in the case of stochastic encoder and
call it the stochastic rate region. We derive explicit inner and outer bounds
for the above two rate regions and present a class of relay channels where two
bounds match. Furthermore, we show that stochastic encoder can enlarge the rate

address the Dark Energy problem this expansion breaks down in realistic

inappropriate use of this expansion. For the stable models that modify gravity
only at small curvatures we find that when the asymptotic background curvature
is large we approximately recover the solutions of Einstein gravity through the
so-called Chameleon mechanism, as a result of the non-linear dynamics of the
extra scalar degree of freedom contained in the metric. In these models one
would observe a transition from Einstein to scalar-tensor gravity as the
Universe expands and the background curvature diminishes. Assuming an adiabatic
evolution we estimate the redshift at which this transition would take place
for a source with given mass and radius. We also show that models of dynamical
Dark Energy claimed to be compatible with tests of gravity because the mass of
the scalar is large in vacuum (e.g. those that also include R^2 corrections in
the action), are not viable.

approximate solutions together, but this procedure is difficult because
discontinuities can arise, leading to large violations of the Einstein
equations. In this paper, we provide an attempt to formalize this gluing scheme
by studying transition functions that join approximate solutions together. In
particular, we propose certain sufficient conditions on these functions and
proof that these conditions guarantee that the joined solution still satisfies
the Einstein equations to the same order as the approximate ones. An example is
also provided for a binary system of non-spinning black holes, where the
approximate solutions are taken to be given by a post-Newtonian expansion and a
perturbed Schwarzschild solution. For this specific case, we show that if the
transition functions satisfy the proposed conditions, the joined solution does
not contain any violations to the Einstein equations larger than those already
inherent in the approximations. We further show that if these functions violate
the proposed conditions, then the matter content of the spacetime is modified
by the introduction of a matter-shell, whose stress-energy tensor depends on
derivatives of these functions.

the relativistic quark model based on the quasipotential approach. Decays both
to heavy D^{(*)} and light \pi(\rho) mesons are considered. All relativistic
effects are systematically taken into account including contributions of the
negative-energy states and the wave function transformation from the rest to
moving reference frame. For heavy-to-heavy transitions the heavy quark
expansion is applied. Leading and subleading Isgur-Wise functions are
determined as the overlap integrals of initial and final meson wave functions.
For heavy-to-light transitions the explicit relativistic expressions are used
to determine the dependence of the form factors on the momentum transfer
squared. Such treatment significantly reduces theoretical uncertainties and
increases reliability of obtained predictions. All results for form factors,
partial and total decay rates agree well with recent experimental data and
unquenched lattice calculations. From this comparison we find the following
values of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements:
|V_{cb}|=(3.85\pm0.15\pm 0.20)*10^{-2} and
|V_{ub}|=(3.82\pm0.20\pm0.20)*10^{-3}, where the first error is experimental

problem of classifying the representations of the Poincare group ISO(D-1,1) to
the classication of the representations of the stability subgroups only.
Therefore, an exhaustive treatment of the two most important classes of unitary
irreducible representations, corresponding to massive and massless particles
(the latter class decomposing in turn into the ``helicity'' and the
""infinite-spin"" representations) may be performed via the well-known
representation theory of the orthogonal groups O(n) (with D-4<n<D). Finally,
covariant field equations are given for each unitary irreducible representation
of the Poincare group with non-negative mass-squared. Tachyonic representations
are also examined. All these steps are covered in many details and with
examples. The present notes also include a self-contained review of the
representation theory of the general linear and (in)homogeneous orthogonal
groups in terms of Young diagrams.

  \item give consequences concerning the space $M(2,k)$ of $k$ distinct points
in the plane, no four of which are the vertices of a parallelogram.
  \end{enumerate}
  The main result proven in this article is that the classical unordered
configuration of $k$ points in the plane is not a retract up to homotopy of the
space of $k$ unordered distinct points in the plane, no four of which are the
vertices of a parallelogram. The proof below is homotopy theoretic without an
explicit computation of the homology of these spaces.
  In addition, a second, speculative part of this article arises from the
failure of these methods in the case of odd primes $p$. This failure gives rise
to a candidate for the localization at odd primes $p$ of the double loop space
of an odd sphere obtained from the $p$-fold center of mass arrangement.
Potential consequences are listed.

only $G$-invariant equivalence relations on $\Omega$ are the trivial and
universal relations.
  If $\alpha \in \Omega$, then the orbits of the stabiliser $G_\alpha$ on
$\Omega$ are called the $\alpha$-suborbits of $G$; when $G$ acts transitively
the cardinalities of these $\alpha$-suborbits are the subdegrees of $G$.
  If $G$ acts primitively on an infinite set $\Omega$, and all the suborbits of
$G$ are finite, Adeleke and Neumann asked if, after enumerating the subdegrees
of $G$ as a non-decreasing sequence $1 = m_0 \leq m_1 \leq ...$, the subdegree
growth rates of infinite primitive groups that act distance-transitively on
locally finite distance-transitive graphs are extremal, and conjecture there
might exist a number $c$ which perhaps depends upon $G$, perhaps only on $m$,
such that $m_r \leq c(m-2)^{r-1}$.
  In this paper it is shown that such an enumeration is not desirable, as there
exist infinite primitive permutation groups possessing no infinite subdegree,
in which two distinct subdegrees are each equal to the cardinality of
infinitely many suborbits. The examples used to show this provide several novel
methods for constructing infinite primitive graphs.
  A revised enumeration method is then proposed, and it is shown that, under
this, Adeleke and Neumann's question may be answered, at least for groups
exhibiting suitable rates of growth.

cross-linked networks of semiflexible biopolymer filaments under simple shear.
Filamental constituents immersed in a fluid undergo thermally excited bending
motions. Pulling out these undulations results in an increase in the axial
stiffness. We analyze this stiffening behavior of 2D semiflexible filaments in
detail: we first investigate the average, {static} force-extension relation by
considering the initially present undulated configuration that is pulled
straight under a tensile force, and compare this result with the average
response in which undulation dynamics is allowed during pulling, as derived
earlier by MacKintosh and coworkers. We will show that the resulting mechanical
behavior is rather similar, but with the axial stiffness being a factor 2 to 4
larger in the dynamic model. Furthermore, we study the stretching contribution
in case of extensible filaments and show that, for 2D filaments, the mechanical
response is dominated by {enthalpic} stretching. Based on the single-filament
mechanics, we develop a 2D analytical model describing the mechanical behavior
of biopolymer networks under simple shear, adopting the affine deformation
assumption. These results are compared with discrete, finite-element (FE)
calculations of a network consisting of semiflexible filaments. The FE
calculations show that local, nonaffine filament reorientations occur that
induce a transition from a bending-dominated response at small strains to a
stretching-dominated response at larger strains. Stiffening in biopolymer
networks thus results from a combination of stiffening in individual filaments
and changes in the network topography.

in layers of 1.99 cm thickness, corresponding to 1.08 radiation lengths, the
energy fluctuations in the samples show distributions that vary significantly
with depth. The energy distributions are similar for incident electrons and
photons and were found to change systematically along the shower, varying
little with the initial energy. Three probability distributions have been
fitted to the data: negative binomial, log-normal and Gaussian distributions,
none of which gives a good fit over the full shower length. The obtained
parameterizations might be useful in the use of the maximum likelihood method
for estimating the energy. Two methods for estimating the energy have also been
studied. One method is based on fitting individual longitudinal shower profiles
with a $\Gamma$-function, the other one corrects the measured energy for
leakage by utilizing the energy deposited in the last layer. Our simulations
indicate that the last-layer correction method applied to photons and electrons

DCs frequently operate under stress conditions. Oxidative stress enhances the
production of inflammatory cytokines by DCs. We performed a proteomic analysis
to see which major changes occur, at the protein expression level, during DC
differentiation and maturation. Comparative two-dimensional gel analysis of the
monocyte, immature DC, and mature DC stages was performed. Manganese superoxide
dismutase (Mn-SOD) reached 0.7% of the gel-displayed proteins at the mature DC
stage. This important amount of Mn-SOD is a primary antioxidant defense system
against superoxide radicals, but its product, H(2)O(2), is also deleterious for
cells. Peroxiredoxin (Prx) enzymes play an important role in eliminating such
peroxide. Prx1 expression level continuously increased during DC
differentiation and maturation, whereas Prx6 continuously decreased, and Prx2
peaked at the immature DC stage. As a consequence, DCs were more resistant than
monocytes to apoptosis induced by high amounts of oxidized low density
lipoproteins containing toxic organic peroxides and hydrogen peroxide.
Furthermore DC-stimulated T cells produced high levels of receptor activator of
nuclear factor kappaB ligand, a chemotactic and survival factor for monocytes
and DCs. This study provides insights into the original ability of DCs to
express very high levels of antioxidant enzymes such as Mn-SOD and Prx1, to
detoxify oxidized low density lipoproteins, and to induce high levels of
receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand by the T cells they activate

algorithm is characterized by a very high convergence rate and features a
simple adaptive procedure that ensures likelihood increase in every iteration
and convergence to the maximum-likelihood state.
  We apply the algorithm to homodyne tomography of optical states and quantum
tomography of entangled spin states of trapped ions and investigate its
convergence properties.

presence of human ignorance, just like all other probabilities. The Born
interpretation of the square of modulus of the wave function arises from the
interaction of a quantum system with an observer, and probabilities will not
arise unless the observer is unable to access all the information available in
the system's wave function. Quantum mechanics generally does not permit all the
information to be obtained, even in principle, just as in relativity
information from outside the past light cone cannot be obtained. But
probabilities do not imply indeterminism. Instead, quantum mechanics is more
deterministic than classical mechanics.

between the states undergoing an avoided crossing with an overall enhancement
of multipartite entanglement at the closest point of approach, simultaneously
accompanied by diminishing two-body entanglement as measured by concurrence. We
find that both for stationary as well as nonstationary states, nonintegrability
leads to a destruction of two-body correlations and distributes entanglement
more globally.

harmonic oscillator and a transmission line (a waveguide, an optical fiber,
etc.) the quantum state of the oscillator can be transferred into that of
another oscillator coupled to the distant other end of the line, with a
fidelity that is independent of the initial state of both oscillators. For a
transfer time $T$, the fidelity approaches 1 exponentially in $\gamma T$ where
$\gamma$ is a characteristic damping rate. Hence, a good fidelity is achieved
even for a transfer time of a few damping times. Some implementations are
discussed.

maps (channels) acting on multi-partite quantum states. We assume that the
individual channels $\Lambda_j$ affect single-particle states so, that for an
arbitrary input $\rho_j$, the distance $D_j (\Lambda_j [ \rho_j ], \rho_j)$
between the input $\rho_j$ and the output $\Lambda_j [ \rho_j ]$ of the channel
is less than $\epsilon$. Given this assumption we show that for an arbitrary
{\em separable} two-partite state $\rho_{12}$ the distance between the input
$\rho_{12}$ and the output $\Lambda_1\otimes\Lambda_2[\rho_{12} ]$ fulfills the
bound $D_{12} (\Lambda_1 \otimes \Lambda_2 [ \rho_{12} ], \rho_{12}) \leq
\sqrt{2+ 2 \sqrt{(1-1/d_1)(1-1/d_2)}} \epsilon$ where $d_1$ and $d_2$ are
dimensions of first and second quantum system respectively. On the contrary,
entangled states are transformed in such a way, that the bound on the action of
the local channels is $D_{12} (\Lambda_1 \otimes \Lambda_2 [ \rho_{12} ],
\rho_{12}) \leq 2 \sqrt{2 - 1/d} \: \epsilon$, where $d$ is the dimension of
the smaller of the two quantum systems passing through the channels. Our
results show that the fundamental distinction between the set of separable and
the set of entangled states results into two different bounds which in turn can
be exploited for a discrimination between the two sets of states. We generalize
our results to multi-partite channels.
