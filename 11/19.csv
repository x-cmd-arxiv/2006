absorption lines, including numerous lines at z=0 and a putative OVIII K-alpha

Using all available Chandra LETG spectra and analysis techniques developed for
such z=0 X-ray absorption along other sightlines, we revisit these previous
detections. We detect 4 absorption lines at >3\sigma significance (OVII
K-alpha/beta, OVIII K-alpha, and NeIX K-alpha), with OVII K-alpha being a
7.3\sigma detection. The 1\sigma ranges of z=0 OVII column density and Doppler
parameter are consistent with those derived for Mrk 421 and within 2\sigma of
the Mrk 279 absorption. Temperatures and densities inferred from the relative
OVII and other ionic column densities are found to be consistent with either
the local warm-hot intergalactic medium or a Galactic corona. Unlike the local
X-ray absorbers seen in other sightlines, a link with the low- or high-velocity
far-ultraviolet OVI absorption lines cannot be ruled out. The z=0.055 OVIII
absorption reported by Fang et al. is seen with 3.5\sigma confidence in the
ACIS/LETG spectrum, but no other absorption lines are found at the same
redshift.

deficiency in the cluster, with ~40% of the galaxies in the core of the cluster
showing modest deficiencies of typically a factor of 2-3. The HI morphology of
some galaxies shows that the HI disk is smaller than the optical disk and
slightly offset from the stars. We find a correlation between HI deficiency and
the ratio of the HI disk size to optical disk size. More HI deficient galaxies
have relatively smaller HI disks, a configuration that is usually attributed to
an interaction between the ISM of the galaxy and the hot ICM. Such a result is
surprising since the Pegasus cluster has a low level of X-ray emission, and a
low velocity dispersion. The low velocity dispersion, coupled with the lack of
a dense hot ICM indicate that ram pressure stripping should not play a
significant role in this environment. In addition, two of the galaxies, NGC7604
and NGC7648, are morphologically peculiar. Their peculiarities indicate
contradictory scenarios of what is triggering their unusual star formation.
Halpha imaging, along with long-slit spectroscopy of NGC7648 reveal
morphological features which point to a recent tidal interaction. On the other
hand, Halpha imaging,along with VLA HI mapping, of NGC7604 reveal morphological
features suggestive of a ram pressure event. Our data indicate that ISM-ICM
interactions may play a role in a wider variety of environments than suggested
by simple ram pressure arguments.

transform a differentially rotating supermassive star into a multiple black

of the instability on parameters of the equilibrium model. We find that many of
the models constructed exhibit non-axisymmetric instabilities with corotation
points, even for low values of T/|W|, which lead to a fission of the stars into
one, two or three fragments, depending on the initial perturbation.
  At least in the models selected here, an m=1 mode becomes unstable at lower
values of T/|W|, which would seem to favor a scenario where one black hole with
a massive accretion disk forms. In this case, we have gained evidence that low
values of compactness of the initial model can lead to a stabilization of the
resulting fragment, thus preventing black hole formation in this scenario.

to 86m, and a spectral resolution of 1500, we measured the extension of the

continuum visibilities were interpreted by fitting simple geometric models
consisting of uniform and Gaussian ellipses, ring and binary models. The
visibilities and differential phases in the BrG line were interpreted using
skewed ring models aiming to perform a limited parametric reconstruction of the
extension and kinematics of the line forming region. The limited uv coverage
does not allow discrimination between filled models and rings. Binary models
are discarded because the measured closure phase in the continuum is close to
zero. The visibilities in the lines are at a low level compared to their nearby
continuum, consistent with a more extended line forming region for HeI2.06 than
BrG. The ellipse models for the continuum and for the lines are highly
flattened and share the same position angle. Two radial velocity fields are
apparent in the BrG line: a 'slow' expanding ring-like structure (v~1800km/s),
and a 'fast' structure extended in the E-W direction (v~2500-3000km/s). These
results confirm the basic fireball model, contrary to the conclusions of other

the gauge and Higgs fields propagate in the bulk while the matter fields are on

both moduli and anomaly mediations, and their weak scale values can be
analytically solved for in terms of a single overall mass scale M. The expected

relations of the popular correlation measures to the covariance, which arise
under the assumptions (well holding at RHIC) that the distributions are sharply
peaked in n and that the dynamical compared to statistical fluctuations are
small.

6.06x10-4 Hartree. The dominant decay mode of the states will be radiative
decay into a configuration that autoionizes or undergoes positron annihilation.
The NaPs system of the same symmetry is also electronically stable with a

  protein folding",,"Protein Science 15, 1608-1618 (2006)",,,"q-bio.BM",,"  The folding of naturally occurring, single domain proteins is usually
well-described as a simple, single exponential process lacking significant
trapped states. Here we further explore the hypothesis that the smooth energy
landscape this implies, and the rapid kinetics it engenders, arises due to the
extraordinary thermodynamic cooperativity of protein folding. Studying
Miyazawa-Jernigan lattice polymers we find that, even under conditions where
the folding energy landscape is relatively optimized (designed sequences
folding at their temperature of maximum folding rate), the folding of
protein-like heteropolymers is accelerated when their thermodynamic
cooperativity enhanced by enhancing the non-additivity of their energy
potentials. At lower temperatures, where kinetic traps presumably play a more
significant role in defining folding rates, we observe still greater
cooperativity-induced acceleration. Consistent with these observations, we find
that the folding kinetics of our computational models more closely approximate
single-exponential behavior as their cooperativity approaches optimal levels.
These observations suggest that the rapid folding of naturally occurring
proteins is, at least in part, consequences of their remarkably cooperative
folding.

  Biology, figures not included in this submission",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.76.021909",,"q-bio.PE q-bio.CB",,"  This paper develops models describing asexual and sexual replication in
sporulating organisms. Replication via sporulation is the replication strategy
for all multicellular life, and may even be observed in unicellular life (such
as with budding yeast). We consider diploid populations replicating via one of
two possible sporulation mechanisms: (1) Asexual sporulation, whereby adult
organisms produce single-celled diploid spores that grow into adults
themselves. (2) Sexual sporulation, whereby adult organisms produce
single-celled diploid spores that divide into haploid gametes. The haploid
gametes enter a haploid ""pool"", where they may recombine with other haploids to
form a diploid spore that then grows into an adult. We consider a haploid
fusion rate given by second-order reaction kinetics. We work with a simplified
model where the diploid genome consists of only two chromosomes, each of which
may be rendered defective with a single point mutation of the wild-type. We
find that the asexual strategy is favored when the rate of spore production is
high compared to the characteristic growth rate from a spore to a reproducing
adult. Conversely, the sexual strategy is favored when the rate of spore
production is low compared to the characteristic growth rate from a spore to a
reproducing adult. As the characteristic growth time increases, or as the
population density increases, the critical ratio of spore production rate to
organism growth rate at which the asexual strategy overtakes the sexual one is
pushed to higher values. Therefore, the results of this model suggest that, for
complex multicellular organisms, sexual replication is favored at high
population densities, and low growth and sporulation rates.

interaction between two atoms (one of them is excited0 embedded in an absorbing

medium, which solves the problem of divergence. The force between two plane
dilute dielectric media is calculated at pair interaction approximation. We
show that the result of quantum electrodynamics differs from the Lifshitz
formula for dilute gas media at high temperatures (if the number of excited
atoms is significant). According to quantum electrodynamics, the interaction
may be either attractive or repulsive depending on the temperature and the
density numbers of the media.
