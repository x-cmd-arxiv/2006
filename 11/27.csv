accretion as well as ejection processes in the nearly edge-on classical T Tauri

  AA Tau's light curve is modulated with a period of 8.22d. The recurrent
luminosity dips are due to the periodic occultation of the central star by the
magnetically-warped inner disk edge located at about 9 Rstar. Balmer line
profiles exhibit a clear rotational modulation of high-velocity redshifted
absorption components with a period of 8.22 days as well, with a maximum
strength when the main accretion funnel flow passes through the line of sight.
At the same time, the luminosity of the system decreases by about 1 mag,
indicative of circumstellar absorption of the stellar photosphere by the
magnetically-warped, corotating inner disk edge. The photospheric and HeI
radial velocities also exhibit periodic variations, and the veiling is
modulated by the appearance of the accretion shock at the bottom of the
accretion funnel. Diagnostics of hot winds and their temporal behaviour are
also presented.
  The peculiar geometry of the young AA Tau system (nearly edge-on) allows us
to uniquely probe the acretion-ejection region close to the star. We find that
most spectral and photometric diagnostics vary as expected from models of
magnetically-channelled accretion in young stars, with a large scale
magnetosphere tilted by 20 deg onto the star's spin axis. We also find evidence
for time variability of the magnetospheric accretion flow on a timescale of a
few rotational periods.

drawn from progenitors of local early-type galaxies, with the characteristic
quasar luminosity L* reflecting a characteristic mass of 'active' BH/host
populations at each redshift. Evolving observed high-z quasar clustering to z=0
predicts a trend of clustering in 'quasar remnants' as a function of stellar
mass identical to that observed for early-types. However, quasar clustering
does not simply reflect observed early (or late)-type populations; at each
redshift, quasars cluster as an 'intermediate' population. Comparing with the
age of elliptical stellar populations reveals that this 'intermediate'
population represents those ellipticals undergoing or terminating their final
significant star formation at each epoch. Assuming that quasar triggering is
associated with the formation/termination epoch of ellipticals predicts quasar
clustering at all observed redshifts without any model dependence or
assumptions about quasar light curves, lifetimes, or accretion rates. This is
not true for disks or quasar halos: i.e. quasars do not generically trace star
formation, disks, or halo assembly. Quasar clustering at all z is consistent
with a constant halo mass ~4x10^{12} M_sun, similar to local 'group scales.'
The observations support a scenario in which major mergers trigger quasar
activity and dominate bright, high-z quasar populations. We show that
measurements of quasar clustering versus luminosity at z~1 can be used to
constrain different lower-luminosity AGN fueling mechanisms, and that high-z
clustering is sensitive to whether or not systems 'shut down' growth at z>3.

density ratio increases from 4 (z=0) to 15 (z=1). It means that more than 80%
of the star-forming activity in the Universe is hidden by dust at z=1. To
explore this issue further, we have performed a combined analysis of the galaxy
sample in FUV and FIR. For the Local Universe we used GALEX-IRAS sample,
whereas at z=1 we used the Lyman-break galaxy sample selected by GALEX bands
constructed by Burgarella et al. (2005), which is known to be representative of
visible (i.e., non-obscured) star-forming galaxies at z=1. From these datasets,
we constructed the LFs of the FUV-selected galaxies by the survival analysis
to, take into account the upper-limit data properly. We discovered that the FIR
LF of the Lyman-break galaxies show a significant evolution comparing with the
local FIR LF, but it is a factor of 2-3 lower than the global FIR LF (Le Floc'h
et al. 2005). This indicates that the evolution of visible galaxies is not
strong enough to explain the drastic evolution of the FIR LF. Namely, a
FIR-luminous, rapidly diminishing population of galaxies is required.

on later evolutionary stages. Complementing the model with a simple, physically
plausible, recipe for the evolution of dust attenuation in metal poor galaxies
we reproduce the luminosity functions (LFs) of LBGs and of LAEs at different
redshifts. This recipe yields a much faster increase with galactic age of
attenuation in more massive galaxies, endowed with higher star formation rates.
These objects have therefore shorter lifetimes in the LAE and LBG phases, and
are more easily detected in the dusty submillimeter bright phase. The short UV
bright lifetimes of massive objects strongly mitigate the effect of the fast
increase of the massive halo density with decreasing redshift, thus accounting
for the weaker evolution of the LBG LF, compared to that of the halo mass
function, and the even weaker evolution between z~6 and z~3 of the LAE LF. LAEs
are on the average expected to be younger, with lower stellar masses, and
associated to less massive halos than LBGs. Finally, we show that the
intergalactic medium can be completely reionized at redshift z~6-7 by massive

through a suite of different observations as a function of redshift. In this

which all highlight the importance of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO)
for probing the ""dark physics"" of the Universe. I also summarize the recent
measurements of the BAO in large galaxy redshift surveys. I then look forward

""Wide-Field Multi-Object Spectrograph"" (WFMOS) for the Subaru telescope. The
baseline design of this facility includes ~4500 spectroscopic fibers over a

perform massive spectroscopic surveys of both distant galaxies and faint stars

also be a unique user-facility allowing astronomers to address a host of

exploitation of the collective properties of the predicted low-frequency (25 to

equidistant separation of their periods for a given angular degree (l). The
Power Spectrum (PS) of the Power Spectrum Density (PSD), reveals a significant
structure indicating the presence of features (peaks) in the PSD with near
equidistant periods corresponding to l=1 modes in the range n=-4 to n=-26. The
study of its statistical significance of this feature was fully undertaken and
complemented with Monte Carlo simulations. This structure has a confidence
level better than 99.86% not to be due to pure noise. Furthermore, a detailed
study of this structure suggests that the gravity modes have a much more
complex structure than the one initially expected (line-widths, magnetic
splittings...). Compared to the latest solar models, the obtained results tend
to favor a solar core rotating significantly faster than the rest of the
radiative zone. In the framework of the Phoebus group, we have also applied the
same methodology to other helioseismology instruments on board SoHO and ground

quasar absorption line systems at z<1, using the dataset of Morris & Jannuzi
(2006; paper I) on 16 lines of sight (LOS) with UV spectroscopy and galaxy
multi-object spectroscopy. The measurements are made in 2-D redshift space out
to pi=20/h Mpc (comoving) along the LOS and out to 2/h Mpc projected; as a
function of HI column density in the range N(HI) = 1E13-1E19 cm^-2, for CIV
systems and as a function of galaxy spectral type. This extends the
absorber-galaxy pair count analysis of paper I. We find that the peak amplitude
of xi(AG) at the smallest separations increases slowly as the lower limit on
N(HI) is increased from 1E13 to 1E16 cm^-2, and then jumps sharply (albeit with
substantial uncertainty) at N(HI)>1E17 cm^-2. For CIV absorbers, the peak
strength of xi(AG) is comparable to that of HI absorbers with N(HI)>1E16.5
cm^-2.
  We do not reproduce the differences reported by Chen et al. between 1-D
xi(AG) measurements using galaxy sub-samples of different spectral types, but
the full impact of systematic differences in our samples is hard to quantify.
We compare the observations with smoothed particle hydrodynamical (SPH)
simulations and discover that in the observations xi(AG) is more concentrated
to the smallest separations than in the simulations. The latter also display a
`finger of god' elongation of xi(AG) along the LOS in redshift space, which is
absent from our data, but similar to that found by Ryan-Weber for the
cross-correlation of quasar absorbers and HI-emission-selected galaxies. The
physical origin of these `fingers of god' is unclear and we highlight several
possible areas for further investigation.

obscured ionization front that is most easily seen at infrared and radio
wavelengths. It is nearly edge-on, thus offering an excellent opportunity to
study the way in which the gas changes from fully ionized to molecular as
radiation from the ionizing stars penetrates into the gas. M17 is also one of
the very few H II regions for which the magnetic field strength can be measured
in the photodissociation region ( PDR) that forms the interface between the
ionized and molecular gas. Here we model an observed line of sight through the
gas cloud, including the H+, H0 (PDR), and molecular layers, in a fully
self-consistent single calculation. An interesting aspect of the M17 SW bar is
that the PDR is very extended. We show that the strong magnetic field that is
observed to be present inevitably leads to a very deep PDR, because the
structure of the neutral and molecular gas is dominated by magnetic pressure,
rather than by gas pressure, as previously had been supposed.We also show that
a wide variety of observed facts can be explained if a hydrostatic geometry
prevails, in which the gas pressure from an inner X-ray hot bubble and the
outward momentum of the stellar radiation field compress the gas and its
associated magnetic field in the PDR, as has already been shown to occur in the
Orion Nebula. The magnetic field compression may also amplify the local
cosmic-ray density. The pressure in the observed magnetic field balances the
outward forces, suggesting that the observed geometry is a natural consequence
of the formation of a star cluster within a molecular cloud.

first passage times (FPTs) and the first passage leapovers (FPLs). While, in
general, the FPT problem has been studied quite extensively, the FPL problem
has hardly attracted any attention. Considering a particle that starts at the
origin and performs random jumps with independent increments chosen from a Levy
stable probability law $\lambda_(alpha,beta)(x)$, the FPT measures how long it
takes the particle to arrive at or cross a target. The FPL addresses a
different question: Given that the first passage jump crosses the target, then
how far does it get beyond the target? These two properties are investigated
for three subclasses of Levy stable motions: (i) symmetric Levy motions
characterized by Levy index $\alpha$ ($0<\alpha<2$) and skewness parameter
$\beta=0$, (ii) one-sided Levy motions with $0<\alpha<1$, $\beta=1$, and (iii)
two-sided skewed Levy motions, the extreme case, $1<\alpha<2$, $\beta=-1$.

binding energy and the spin polarization at the Fermi level. All those adsorbed
chains studied have ferromagnetic ground state, but only their specific types
and geometries demonstrated high spin polarization near the Fermi level. Their
magnetic moment and binding energy in the ground state display interesting
variation with the number of $d-$electrons of the TM atom. We also show that
specific chains of transition metal atoms adsorbed on a SWNT can lead to
semiconducting properties for the minority spin-bands, but semimetallic for the
majority spin-bands. Spin-polarization is maintained even when the underlying
SWNT is subjected to high radial strain. Spin-dependent electronic structure
becomes discretized when TM atoms are adsorbed on finite segments of SWNTs.
Once coupled with non-magnetic metal electrodes, these magnetic needles or
nanomagnets can perform as spin-dependent resonant tunnelling devices. The
electronic and magnetic properties of these nanomagnets can be engineered
depending on the type and decoration of adsorbed TM atom as well as the size

the work of Poincare, as it is relevant in areas ranging from the foundations
of statistical physics to the stability of the solar system. Along this
transition, atypical structures like the first chaotic regions to appear, or
the last regular islands to survive, play a crucial role in many physical
situations. For instance, resonances and separatrices determine the fate of
planetary systems, and localised objects like solitons and breathers provide
mechanisms of energy transport in nonlinear systems such as Bose-Einstein
condensates and biological molecules. Unfortunately, despite the fundamental
progress made in the last years, most of the numerical methods to locate these
'rare' trajectories are confined to low-dimensional or toy models, while the
realms of statistical physics, chemical reactions, or astronomy are still hard
to reach. Here we implement an efficient method that allows one to work in
higher dimensions by selecting trajectories with unusual chaoticity. As an
example, we study the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam nonlinear chain in equilibrium and show
that the algorithm rapidly singles out the soliton solutions when searching for
trajectories with low level of chaoticity, and chaotic-breathers in the
opposite situation. We expect the scheme to have natural applications in
celestial mechanics and turbulence, where it can readily be combined with
existing numerical methods

external electric field. We first test this method in quenched QCD with the RG
improved gauge action on a $16^3\times 32$ lattice at $a^{-1}\simeq$ 2 GeV,
employing two different lattice fermion formulations, the domain-wall fermion
and the clover fermion for quarks, at relatively heavy quark mass $(m_{PS}/m_V
\simeq 0.85)$. We obtain non-zero values of NEDM from calculations with both
fermion formulations. We next consider some systematic uncertainties of our
method for NEDM, using $24^3\times 32$ lattice at the same lattice spacing only
with the clover fermion. We finally investigate the quark mass dependence of
NEDM and observe a non-vanishing behavior of NEDM toward the chiral limit. We
interpret this behavior as a manifestation of the pathology in the quenched
approximation.

leptogenesis""), in the context of the inverse seesaw mechanism. In this model
there are lepton number (L) conserving and L-violating soft
supersymmetry-breaking B-terms involving the singlet sneutrinos which, together
with the -- generically small-- L-violating parameter responsible of the
neutrino mass, give a small mass splitting between the four singlet sneutrino
states of a single generation. In combination with the trilinear soft
supersymmetry breaking terms they also provide new CP violating phases needed
to generate a lepton asymmetry in the singlet sneutrino decays. We obtain that
in this scenario the lepton asymmetry is proportional to the L-conserving soft
supersymmetry-breaking B-term, and it is not suppressed by the L-violating
parameters. Consequently we find that, as in the standard see-saw case, this
mechanism can lead to sucessful leptogenesis only for relatively small value of
the relevant soft bilinear coupling. The right-handed neutrino masses can be
sufficiently low to elude the gravitino problem. Also the corresponding Yukawa
couplings involving the lightest of the right-handed neutrinos are constrained
to be \sum |Y_{1k}|^2\lesssim 10^{-7} which generically implies that the
neutrino mass spectrum has to be strongly hierarchical.

specific way three free parameters into three masses), a simple empirical sum
rule for three charged-lepton masses is found, predicting m_\tau = 1776.9926
MeV, when the experimental values of m_e and m_\mu are used as an input. The
experimental value to be compared with is m_\tau = 1776.99^{+0.29}_{-0.26} MeV.
This satisfactory sum rule (equivalent to a simple parameter constraint in the
mass formula) is linear in masses and involves integers as its coefficients.
The author believes that such a simple and precise mass sum rule for charged
leptons may help in the process of developing realistic models for mass spectra
of fundamental fermions. In the second part of the paper, another equivalent
parametrization of the charged-lepton mass formula is described, corresponding
to an oscillatory picture of their mass matrix, where two matrices appear
playing the role of annihilation and creation operators in the generation

carry fractional electric charge. A similar structure applies to the 2+1
dimensional quantum Hall effect where the hierarchy of Hall plateaux can be
understood in terms of an action of the modular group and the stability of Hall
plateaux is due to the fact that odd denominator Hall conductivities are
attractive infra-red fixed points. There is a mass gap for electrically charged

represent black brane, with inner and outer event horizons, an extreme black
brane or a naked singularity provided the parameters of the solutions are
chosen suitably. We also compute temperature, entropy, charge, electric
potential, mass and angular momentum of the black brane solutions, and show
that these quantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. We find that the
conserved quantities are independent of the Born-Infeld parameter $\beta $,
while they depend on the dilaton coupling constant $\alpha$. We also find the
total mass of the black brane with infinite boundary as a function of the
entropy, the angular momenta and the charge and perform a stability analysis by
computing the heat capacity in the canonical ensemble. We find that the system
is thermally stable for $\alpha \leq 1$ independent of the values of the charge
and Born-Infeld parameters, while for $\alpha> 1$ the system has an unstable
phase. In the latter case, the solutions are stable provided $\alpha \leq
\alpha_{\max}$ and $\beta \geq \beta_{\min}$, where $% \alpha_{\max}$ and
$\beta_{\min}$ depend on the charge and the dimensionality of the spacetime.
That is the solutions are unstable for highly nonlinear electromagnetic field
or when the dilaton coupling constant is large.

The results are very simple and similar to those of the single field inflation,
mainly depend on the underlying spectrum of the masses. The mass distribution
is heavily constrained by the power spectrum of density perturbations P and the
spectral index n. The overall mass scale gives the amplitude of P, and n is
affected by the number of fields and the spacing between masses in the
distribution. The drop-out effect of the massive fields makes the perturbation
spectrum typically redder than the single field inflation spectrum. We
illustrate this using two different mass distributions.

high or low degree of coherence in binary state variables. The degree of
randomness and coherence of the binary sequence are measured by entropy and
mutual information, depending on local structure that consists of a node with a
highly connected, called hub and its upstream nodes, and types of Boolean
functions for the nodes. With a large number of output connections from a hub,
the effects of Boolean function on the hub are more prominent. The local
structures that give larger entropy tend to give rise to larger mutual
information. Based on the numerical results and structural conditions we
derived a time-independent transmission characteristic function of state
variables for the local structures. We obtained good relationships between the
numerical and analytical results, which indicate that dynamical properties from

and B_0 -> \infty with q B_0 fixed where q is the charge and B_0 the field
strength) there always exists a bound state for a system of two identical
charged particles in a constant magnetic field, provided that there is a
short-range uniformly attractive potential between them. Moreover, it is shown
that in this limit {\it any} potential with an attractive s-wave scattering
length will posses bound states provided that the range of the potential is
much smaller than the characteristic magnetic length, r_0 = (\frac{q
B_0}{4})^{-1/2}. For this case, the binding is computed numerically. We
estimate the size of the magnetic field needed to approximately reach a regime
where the formal limit considered becomes a good approximation to the dynamics.

of diffusing and chemically reacting species (e.g. enzymes). Such
reaction-diffusion processes can be mathematically modelled using either
deterministic partial-differential equations or stochastic simulation
algorithms. The latter provide a more detailed and precise picture, and several
stochastic simulation algorithms have been proposed in recent years. Such
models typically give the same description of the reaction-diffusion processes
far from the boundary of the simulated domain, but the behaviour close to a
reactive boundary (e.g. a membrane with receptors) is unfortunately
model-dependent. In this paper, we study four different approaches to
stochastic modelling of reaction-diffusion problems and show the correct choice
of the boundary condition for each model. The reactive boundary is treated as
partially reflective, which means that some molecules hitting the boundary are
adsorbed (e.g. bound to the receptor) and some molecules are reflected. The

reactivity of the boundary (e.g. on the rate constant of the adsorbing chemical
reaction and on the number of available receptors), and on the stochastic model
used. This dependence is derived for each model.

porosity, static airflow resistivity, tortuosity, and two characteristic
lengths. In recent decades, different methods have been developed in order to
characterize these parameters. These methods may be divided following three
approaches: i) inverse, ii) indirect and iii) direct. The inverse approach is
based on an optimisation problem where the material parameters are adjusted in
the acoustic model to reproduce acoustical measurements. The indirect approach
is based on the acoustical model from which analytical expressions linking the
material parameters to acoustical measurements are derived. Contrary to the
previous two approaches, the direct approach is not based on acoustical
measurements. It is based on the physical and mathematical definition of the
parameters and requires dedicated equipments. In this study, the five
parameters have been measured for different porous materials using some direct,
indirect and inverse methods. A comparison of the different results is carried
out, and shows that the different methods may yield large variability in the
found parameters. A discussion is given to explain the observed variability and
the limitations of the methods.

whole system is simulated with an integrated traffic simulator, that is based
on a realistic microscopic traffic model for longitudinal movements and lane

by comparing the simulation results with analytical calculations. By means of

- the idea that God is playing at dice. Later he changed his ground, and
focussed instead on the point that the Copenhagen Interpretation leads to what
Einstein saw as the abandonment of physical realism. We argue here that
Einstein's initial intuition was perfectly sound, and that it is precisely the
fact that quantum mechanics is a fundamentally probabilistic theory which is at
the root of all the controversies regarding its interpretation. Probability is
an intrinsically logical concept. This means that the quantum state has an
essentially logical significance. It is extremely difficult to reconcile that
fact with Einstein's belief, that it is the task of physics to give us a vision
of the world apprehended sub specie aeternitatis. Quantum mechanics thus
presents us with a simple choice: either to follow Einstein in looking for a
theory which is not probabilistic at the fundamental level, or else to accept
that physics does not in fact put us in the position of God looking down on
things from above. There is a widespread fear that the latter alternative must
inevitably lead to a greatly impoverished, positivistic view of physical
theory. It appears to us, however, that the truth is just the opposite. The
Einsteinian vision is much less attractive than it seems at first sight. In
particular, it is closely connected with philosophical reductionism.

that the environment, by means of a dissipative interaction, furnishes a

amplitude damping channel provided by a two-level system's interaction with its
environment in the weak Born-Markov approximation. This is contrasted with a
