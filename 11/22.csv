the numerical evaluation of both the perturbation equations and the integrals

where the potential has a ""feature"", in the vicinity of which the slow roll
parameters may take on large, transient values. This introduces both scale and
shape dependent non-Gaussianities into the primordial perturbations. As an
example of our methodology, we examine the ``step'' potentials which have been
invoked to improve the fit to the glitch in the $<TT>$ $C_l$ for $l \sim 30$,
present in both the one and three year WMAP data sets. We show that for the
typical parameter values, the non-Gaussianities associated with the step are
far larger than those in standard slow roll inflation, and may even be within
reach of a next generation CMB experiment such as Planck. More generally, we
use this example to explain that while adding features to potential can improve
the fit to the 2-point function, these are generically associated with a
greatly enhanced signal at the 3-point level. Moreover, this 3-point signal
will have a very nontrivial shape and scale dependence, which is correlated
with the form of the 2-point function, and may thus lead to a consistency check
on the models of inflation with non-smooth potentials.

obtained using PMAS/PPAK@3.5m CAHA to obtain a complete flux limited sample of
cluster members within its field-of-view (~74""X64""). In addition of 31 galaxies
with known redshifts in the outer regions, we built up a final sample of 59

morphologies were obtained using deep images taken with the HST/ACS camera in
the BVRI and z-bands. The CM diagram shows that the E-type galaxies cover the
range of brighter and redder colors. A large fraction of spiral galaxies
($\sim$50%) is found. They cover a wide range in colors. This result, together
with the distributions of ages, metallicities and masses, indicates that E-type
galaxies are more massive and have older stellar populations, while L-type
galaxies are less massive and have a wider range of stellar Our results agree
with a proposed two-step scenario for the evolution of galaxies in clusters. In
addition, an extremely blue merging galaxy system is found at the core, with
the nominal redshift of the cluster.

field is not confined to the crust. We compute global Alfv\'{e}n modes for a

that the presence of a realistic crust has a negligible effect on Alfv\'{e}n

crossings between torsional Alfv\'{e}n modes and torsional crust modes. For
magnetar-like magnetic field strengths, the spacing between consecutive
Alfv\'{e}n modes is of the same order as the gap of avoided crossings. As a
result, it is not possible to identify modes of predominantly crustal character

excellent agreement between our computed frequencies and observed frequencies

analysis is used to identify distinct emission components in the X-ray
spectrum, possible alternative physical models for those components are then
compared statistically. Results: The source spectral variability is
well-explained by additive variations, with smaller extra contributions most
likely arising from variable absorption. The principal varying component,
eigenvector one, is found to have a steep (photon index 2.4) power-law shape,
affected by a low column of ionised absorption that leads to the appearance of
a soft excess. Eigenvector one varies by a factor 10 in amplitude on
time-scales of days and appears to have broad ionised Fe K-alpha emission
associated with it: the width of the ionised line is consistent with an origin
at about 100 gravitational radii. There is also a strong component of
near-constant emission that dominates in the low state, whose spectrum is
extremely hard above 1 keV, with a soft excess at lower energies, and with a
strong edge at Fe K but remarkably little Fe K-alpha emission. Although this
component may be explained as relativistically-blurred reflection from the
inner accretion disc, we suggest that its spectrum and lack of variability may
alternatively be explained as either (i) ionised reflection from an extended
region, possibly a disc wind, or (ii) a signature of absorption by a disc wind
with a variable covering fraction. Absorption features in the low state may
indicate the presence of an outflow.

X-ray binaries (XRBs) follows the analytical prediction of a jet model where
the jet carries a constant fraction of the accretion power. The radio emission
can therefore be used as a tracer of the accretion rate. This measure is
normalised with efficiently radiating objects. As it is independent of the
X-ray fluxes, the measure allows us to compare the accretion rate dependency of
the bolometric X-ray luminosity of BHs and NSs. For NSs, it scales linearly
with accretion rate while the scaling for BHs is quadratic - as expected for
inefficient accretion flows. We find the same behaviour in AGN. This new
approach uses the jet power to obtain the accretion rate. Thus, we know both
the jet power and the radiated power of an accreting BH. This allows us to show
that some accretion power is likely to be advected into the black hole, while
the jet power dominates over the bolometric luminosity of a hard state BH.

periods of order 300 ms (some as short as 20 ms) in core-collapse supernovae.

the inevitable conclusion that pulsar spin is directly correlated with the
rotation of the progenitor star. So far, however, stellar theory has not been
able to explain the distribution of pulsar spins, suggesting that the birth
rotation is either too slow or too fast. Here we report a robust instability of
the stalled accretion shock in core-collapse supernovae that is able to
generate a strong rotational flow in the vicinity of the accreting

proto-neutron star to generate a final spin period consistent with

galaxies have furnished controversial results with some works favouring the
presence of a large amount of dark matter in the outer regions and others
arguing in favour of no dark matter at all. In order to shed new light on this
controversy, we propose here a new phenomenological description of the total
mass profile of galaxies. Under the hypothesis of spherical symmetry, we assume
a double power-law expression for the global M/L ratio Upsilon(r)=
Upsilon_0(r/r_0) ^{alpha}(1+r/r_0)^{beta}. In particular, Upsilon propto
r^{alpha} for r/r_0<<1 so that alpha=0 mimics a constant M/L ratio in the inner
regions, while, for (r/r_0>>1), Upsilon propto r^{alpha+beta} thus showing that
models with alpha+beta=0 have an asymptotically constant M/L ratio. A wide
range of possibilities is obtained by varying the slope parameters in the range
we determine on the basis of physical considerations. Choosing a general
expression for the luminosity density profile j(r), we work out an effective
galaxy model that accounts for all the phenomenology observed in real
elliptical galaxies. We derive the main dynamics and lensing properties of such
an effective model. We analyze a general class of models, able to take into
account different dynamical trends. We are able to obtain analytical
expressions for the main dynamical and lensing quantities. We show that
constraining the values of alpha+beta makes it possible to analyze the problem
of the dark matter in elliptical galaxies. Indeed, positive values of
alpha+beta would be a strong evidence for dark matter. Finally we indicate
possible future approaches in order to face the observational data, in
particular using velocity dispersion profiles and lensed quasar events.

planet-finding techniques. These observations provide information on the
asteroidal and cometary material orbiting these stars - data that can be
correlated with any planets that may eventually be found. We have found
significant excess 70um emission toward 12 stars. Combined with an earlier
study, we find an overall 70um excess detection rate of $13 \pm 3$% for mature
cool stars. Unlike the trend for planets to be found preferentially toward
stars with high metallicity, the incidence of debris disks is uncorrelated with
metallicity. By newly identifying 4 of these stars as having weak 24um excesses
(fluxes $\sim$10% above the stellar photosphere), we confirm a trend found in
earlier studies wherein a weak 24um excess is associated with a strong 70um
excess. Interestingly, we find no evidence for debris disks around 23 stars
cooler than K1, a result that is bolstered by a lack of excess around any of
the 38 K1-M6 stars in 2 companion surveys. One motivation for this study is the
fact that strong zodiacal emission can make it hard or impossible to detect
planets directly with future observatories like the {\it Terrestrial Planet
Finder (TPF)}. The observations reported here exclude a few stars with very
high levels of emission, $>$1,000 times the emission of our zodiacal cloud,

70, and 160 microns obtained as part of the Spitzer Survey of the Small
Magellanic Cloud (S3MC,Bolatto et al. 2006). These maps cover most of the
active star formation in the SMC Bar and the more quiescent Wing. We combine
our maps with literature data to derive the dust surface density across the
SMC. We find a total dust mass of Mdust = 3 10^5 Msun, implying a
dust-to-hydrogen ratio over the region studied of log D/H = -2.86, or 1-to-700,
which includes H_2. Assuming the dust to trace the total gas column, we derive
H_2 surface densities across the SMC. We find a total H_2 mass M_H2 = 3.2 10^7
Msun in a distribution similar to that of the CO, but more extended. We compare
profiles of CO and H_2 around six molecular peaks and find that on average H_2
is more extended than CO by a factor of \sim 1.3. The implied CO-to-H_2
conversion factor over the whole SMC is XCO = 13 +/- 1 10^21 cm^-2 (K km/s)^-1.
Over the volume occupied by CO we find a lower conversion factor, XCO = 6 +/- 1
10^21 cm^-2 (K km/s)^-1, which is still a few times larger than that found
using virial mass methods. The molecular peaks have H_2 surface densities
\Sigma_H2 \approx 180 +/- 30 Msun pc^-2, similar to those in Milky Way GMCs,
and correspondingly low extinctions, A_V \sim 1 - 2 mag. To reconcile these
measurements with predictions by the theory of photoionization-regulated star
formation, which requires A_V \sim 6, the GMCs must be \sim 3 times smaller
than our 46 pc resolution element. We find that for a given hydrostatic gas
pressure, the SMC has a 2 - 3 times lower ratio of molecular to atomic gas than
spiral galaxies. Combined with the lower mean densities in the SMC this may
explain why this galaxy has only 10% of its gas in the molecular phase.

growth of the radius of hotspots with source size. Better fits to the
distributions of most of the data in three low-frequency surveys can be found
with sensible choices of model parameters but no model yet considered gives a
good match to all of the survey data simultaneously, nor does any do a good job

too small to completely discriminate among the models. We calculate the volume
fraction of the ``relevant universe'' cumulatively occupied by the expanding
radio galaxy lobes over the quasar era, when these powerful radio galaxies were
much more common, and when they have been argued to play an important role in
triggering galaxy formation and spreading magnetic fields and metals. We found

without any human intervention. This resulted in the first UVES exposure of

evidence for time variability of allowed transitions involving FeII
fine-structure levels, and metastable levels of both FeII and NiII, at the

arising from metastable levels of FeII and NiII along any GRB sightline. We
model the observed evolution of the level populations with three different
excitation mechanisms: collisions, excitation by infra-red photons, and
fluorescence following excitation by ultraviolet photons. Our data allow us to
reject the collisional and IR excitation scenarios with high confidence. The UV
pumping model, in which the GRB afterglow UV photons excite a cloud of atoms
with a column density N, distance d, and Doppler broadening parameter b,
provides an excellent fit, with best-fit values: log N(FeII)=14.75+0.06-0.04,
log N(NiII)=13.84+/-0.02, d=1.7+/-0.2 kpc (but see Appendix A), and b=25+/-3
km/s. The success of our UV pumping modeling implies that no significant amount
of FeII or NiII is present at distances smaller than ~1.7 kpc (but see erratum
in Appendix A), most likely because it is ionized by the GRB X-ray/UV flash.
Because neutral hydrogen is more easily ionized than FeII and NiII, this
minimum distance also applies to any HI present. [abridged]

accurate CCD photometry in the V and I pass-bands. These clusters are in fact
located in the Third Galactic Quadrant. We aim to obtain the basic parameters
of these objects, which in some cases are still disputed in the literature. In
the case of VdB-Hagen 4 we provide the first estimate of its fundamental

analysis is based on the comparison between field stars decontaminated Color
Magnitude Diagrams and stellar models. Particular care is devoted to the
assessment of the data quality, and the statistical field stars
decontamination. The library of stellar isochrones from Girardi et al. (2000)
is adopted in this study. The analysis we carried out allowed us to solve a few
inconsistencies in the literature regarding Haffner 8 and NGC 2509. Collinder
74 is found to be significantly older than reported before. VdB-Hagen 4 is a
young open cluster located more than 20 kpc from the Galactic center. Such an
extreme distance is compatible with the cluster belonging to the
Norma-Cygnusarm.

examine the luminosity function (LF) of spiral galaxies with different
inclination angles. We find that the characteristic luminosity of the LF,
$L^*$, decreases with increasing inclination, while the faint-end slope,
$\alpha$, depends only weakly on it. The inclination-dependence of the LF is
consistent with that expected from a simple model where the optical depth is
proportional to the cosine of the inclination angle, and we use a likelihood
method to recover both the coefficient in front of the cosine, $\gamma$, and
the LF for galaxies viewed face-on. The value of $\gamma$ is quite independent
of galaxy luminosity in a given band, and the values of $\gamma$ obtained in
this way for the 5 SDSS bands give an extinction curve which is a power law of
wavelength ($\tau\propto\lambda^{-n}$), with a power index $n=0.96\pm0.04$.
Using the dust extinction for galaxies obtained by Kauffmann et al. (2003), we
derive an `extinction-corrected' luminosity function for spiral galaxies. Dust
extinction makes $M^*$ dimmer by about 0.5 magnitudes in the $z$-band, and
about 1.2 magnitudes in the $u$- band. Since our analysis is based on a sample
where selection effects are well under control, the dimming of edge-on galaxies
relative to face-on galaxies is best explained by assuming that galaxy disks
are optically thick in dust absorptions.

in terms of a dynamic equation which follows from the Helfrich Hamiltonian, the
dynamics of the diffusing particle is described by a Langevin or Smoluchowski
equation. In the latter equations, the curvature of the surface needs to be
accounted for, which makes particle diffusion a function of membrane
fluctuations. In our scheme these coupled dynamic equations, the membrane
equation and the Langevin equation for the particle, are numerically integrated
to simulate diffusion in a membrane. The simulations are used to study the
ratio of the diffusion coefficient projected on a flat plane and the
intramembrane diffusion coefficient for the case of free diffusion. We compare

G between two arbitrarily chosen nodes where each link has the same unit

range of values of G, with a power-law tail distribution \Phi_{SF}(G) \sim
G^{g_G}, where g_G = 2\lambda - 1, where \lambda is the decay exponent for the
scale-free network degree distribution. We confirm our predictions by
simulations of scale-free networks solving the Kirchhoff equations for the
conductance between a pair of nodes. The power-law tail in \Phi_{SF}(G) leads
to large values of G, thereby significantly improving the transport in
scale-free networks, compared to Erdos-Renyi networks where the tail of the
conductivity distribution decays exponentially. Based on a simple physical
'transport backbone' picture we suggest that the conductances of scale-free and
Erdos-Renyi networks can be approximated by ck_Ak_B/(k_A+k_B) for any pair of
nodes A and B with degrees k_A and k_B. Thus, a single quantity c, which
depends on the average degree <k> of the network, characterizes transport on
both scale-free and Erdos-Renyi networks. We determine that c tends to 1 for
increasing <k>, and it is larger for scale-free networks. We compare the
electrical results with a model for frictionless transport, where conductance
is defined as the number of link-independent paths between A and B, and find
that a similar picture holds. The effects of distance on the value of
conductance are considered for both models, and some differences emerge.

modulated periodically in time drive the current and act as beam-splitters. The
current has a flux dependent part $I^{(\Phi)}$ as well as a flux independent
part $I^{(0)}$. Both current parts show oscillations as a function of frequency
on the two scales determined by the lengths of the interferometer arms. In the
non-adiabatic, high frequency regime $I^{(\Phi)}$ oscillates with a constant
amplitude while the amplitude of the oscillations of $I^{(0)}$ increases
linearly with frequency. The flux independent part $I^{(0)}$ is insensitive to

suppressed with increasing temperature. We also find that for low amplitude,
adiabatic pumping rectification effects are absent for semitransparent

interferometer arms to a voltage probe. For a long charge relaxation time of
the voltage probe, giving a constant probe potential, $I^{(\Phi)}$ and the part
of $I^{(0)}$ flowing in the arm connected to the probe are suppressed with
increased coupling to the probe. For a short relaxation time, with the
potential of the probe adjusting instantaneously to give zero time dependent
current at the probe, only $I^{(\Phi)}$ is suppressed by the coupling to the

input in few passes and perform computations with sublinear resources. This
method does not work for truly massive data where even making a single pass
over the data with a processor is prohibitive. Successful log processing
systems in practice such as Google's MapReduce and Apache's Hadoop use multiple
machines. They efficiently perform a certain class of highly distributable
computations defined by local computations that can be applied in any order to
the input.
  Motivated by the success of these systems, we introduce a simple algorithmic
model for massive, unordered, distributed (mud) computation. We initiate the
study of understanding its computational complexity. Our main result is a
positive one: any unordered function that can be computed by a streaming
algorithm can also be computed with a mud algorithm, with comparable space and
communication complexity. We extend this result to some useful classes of
approximate and randomized streaming algorithms. We also give negative results,
using communication complexity arguments to prove that extensions to private
randomness, promise problems and indeterminate functions are impossible.
  We believe that the line of research we introduce in this paper has the
potential for tremendous impact. The distributed systems that motivate our work
successfully process data at an unprecedented scale, distributed over hundreds

network-centric software systems on the field of software architecture. We
first develop an insight concerning the term ""network-centric"" by presenting
its origin and its implications within the context of software architecture. On
the basis of this insight, we present our definition of a network-centric
framework and its distinguishing characteristics. We then enumerate the
challenges that face the field of software architecture as software development
shifts from a platform-centric to a network-centric model. In order to face
these challenges, we propose a formal approach embodied in a new architectural
style that supports overcoming these challenges at the architectural level.
Finally, we conclude by presenting an illustrative example to demonstrate the
usefulness of the concepts of network centricity, summarizing our
contributions, and linking our approach to future work that needs to be done in
this area.

could enable constructing large numbers of devices able to sense, compute and
act in micron-scale environments. Such microscopic machines, of sizes
comparable to bacteria, could simultaneously monitor entire populations of
cells individually in vivo. This paper reviews plausible capabilities for
microscopic robots and the physical constraints due to operation in fluids at
low Reynolds number, diffusion-limited sensing and thermal noise from Brownian
motion. Simple distributed controls are then presented in the context of
prototypical biomedical tasks, which require control decisions on millisecond
time scales. The resulting behaviors illustrate trade-offs among speed,
accuracy and resource use. A specific example is monitoring for patterns of
chemicals in a flowing fluid released at chemically distinctive sites.
Information collected from a large number of such devices allows estimating
properties of cell-sized chemical sources in a macroscopic volume. The
microscopic devices moving with the fluid flow in small blood vessels can
detect chemicals released by tissues in response to localized injury or
infection. We find the devices can readily discriminate a single cell-sized
chemical source from the background chemical concentration, providing
high-resolution sensing in both time and space. By contrast, such a source
would be difficult to distinguish from background when diluted throughout the
blood volume as obtained with a blood sample.

  Stable Random Projections",,,,,"cs.DS cs.IT cs.LG math.IT",,"  This paper will focus on three different aspects in improving the current
practice of stable random projections.
  Firstly, we propose {\em very sparse stable random projections} to
significantly reduce the processing and storage cost, by replacing the
$\alpha$-stable distribution with a mixture of a symmetric $\alpha$-Pareto
distribution (with probability $\beta$, $0<\beta\leq1$) and a point mass at the
origin (with a probability $1-\beta$). This leads to a significant
$\frac{1}{\beta}$-fold speedup for small $\beta$.
  Secondly, we provide an improved estimator for recovering the original
$l_\alpha$ norms from the projected data. The standard estimator is based on
the (absolute) sample median, while we suggest using the geometric mean. The
geometric mean estimator we propose is strictly unbiased and is easier to
study. Moreover, the geometric mean estimator is more accurate, especially
non-asymptotically.
  Thirdly, we provide an adequate answer to the basic question of how many
projections (samples) are needed for achieving some pre-specified level of
accuracy. \cite{Proc:Indyk_FOCS00,Article:Indyk_TKDE03} did not provide a
criterion that can be used in practice. The geometric mean estimator we propose
allows us to derive sharp tail bounds which can be expressed in exponential
forms with constants explicitly given.

  application to tree crown extraction",,,,,"cs.CV",,"  Many image processing problems involve identifying the region in the image
domain occupied by a given entity in the scene. Automatic solution of these
problems requires models that incorporate significant prior knowledge about the
shape of the region. Many methods for including such knowledge run into
difficulties when the topology of the region is unknown a priori, for example
when the entity is composed of an unknown number of similar objects.
Higher-order active contours (HOACs) represent one method for the modelling of
non-trivial prior knowledge about shape without necessarily constraining region
topology, via the inclusion of non-local interactions between region boundary
points in the energy defining the model. The case of an unknown number of
circular objects arises in a number of domains, e.g. medical, biological,
nanotechnological, and remote sensing imagery. Regions composed of an a priori
unknown number of circles may be referred to as a `gas of circles'. In this
report, we present a HOAC model of a `gas of circles'. In order to guarantee
stable circles, we conduct a stability analysis via a functional Taylor
expansion of the HOAC energy around a circular shape. This analysis fixes one
of the model parameters in terms of the others and constrains the rest. In
conjunction with a suitable likelihood energy, we apply the model to the
extraction of tree crowns from aerial imagery, and show that the new model
outperforms other techniques.

(m_{u,d},m_s) where the finite temperature transition at \mu=0 is second order.
We confirm that the physical point lies on the crossover side of this line. Our
data are consistent with a tricritical point at (m_{u,d},m_s) = (0,\sim 500)
MeV.
  Then, using an imaginary chemical potential, we determine in which direction
this second-order line moves as the chemical potential is turned on. Contrary
to standard expectations, we find that the region of first-order transitions
shrinks in the presence of a chemical potential, which is inconsistent with the
presence of a QCD critical point at small chemical potential.

  figures, in Spanish",,,,"hep-th",,"  This thesis deals with the construction of an eleven-dimensional gauge
theory, off-shell invariant, for the M Algebra. The theory is built using a
Transgression Form as a Lagrangian.
  In order to accomplish this, one must first analyze the general construction
of Transgression Gauge Field Theories, for an arbitrary symmetry group (Chapter
3). Some interesting results regarding this point are (1) the calculation of
Noether Charges which are off-shell conserved, (2) the association of the
double connection structure of the Transgression Form with both orientations of
the basis manifold and (3) the Subspace Separation Method, which allows us to
divide the action in bulk and boundary terms, and to split them in terms which
reflect the physics corresponding to a symmetry group choice.
  To construct the gauge theory explicitly, it is necessary to buid a new
mathematical tool, called S-Expansion procedure. Analyzing the M Algebra under
the light of this method, it is possible to construct an invariant tensor for
it. This method is developed in a general way and, given a Lie algebra and an
Abelian, finite semigroup, it allows us to generate new Lie algebras
(S-Expanded Algebras, Resonant Subalgebras, Resonant Forced Algebras).
  Applying this tool, an invariant tensor for the M Algebra is constructed,
which serves as the basis upon which a Transgression Gauge Field Theory for the
M Algebra (Chapter 5) is constructed. The relationship between the
four-dimensional dynamics from this theory and the eleven-dimensional torsion
is also considered. Finally, we close with an analysis of the possible
applications of the developed tools, in the context of Cosmology, Supergravity
and String Theory.

hyperbolic PDE's with constant coefficients with the initial data being a
multi-wavepacket. By definition a general wavepacket has a well defined
principal wave vector, and, as we proved in previous works, the nonlinear
dynamics preserves systems of wavepackets and their principal wave vectors.
Here we study the nonlinear evolution of a special class of wavepackets, namely
particle-like wavepackets. A particle-like wavepacket is of a dual nature: on
one hand, it is a wave with a well defined principal wave vector, on the other
hand, it a particle in the sense that it can be assigned a well defined
position in the space. We prove that under the nonlinear evolution a generic
multi-particle wavepacket remains to be a multi-particle wavepacket with a high
accuracy, and every constituting single particle-like wavepacket not only
preserves its principal wave number but also it has a well-defined space
position evolving with a constant velocity which is its group velocity.
Remarkably the described properties hold though the involved single
particle-like wavepackets undergo nonlinear interactions and multiple
collisions in the space. We also prove that if principal wavevectors of
multi-particle wavepacket are generic, the result of nonlinear interactions
between different wavepackets is small and the approximate linear superposition
principle holds uniformly with respect to the initial spatial positions of
wavepackets.

The standard frequentist practice is to reject the null hypothesis when the
p-value is smaller than a threshold value $\alpha$, usually 0.05. We ask the
question how many of the null hypotheses a frequentist rejects are actually
true. Precisely, we look at the Bayesian false discovery rate
$\delta_n=P_g(\theta\in\Theta_0|p-value<\alpha)$ under a proper prior density
$g(\theta)$. This depends on the prior $g$, the sample size $n$, the threshold
value $\alpha$ as well as the choice of the test statistic. We show that the
Benjamini--Hochberg FDR in fact converges to $\delta_n$ almost surely under $g$
for any fixed $n$. For one-sided null hypotheses, we derive a third order
asymptotic expansion for $\delta_n$ in the continuous exponential family when
the test statistic is the MLE and in the location family when the test
statistic is the sample median. We also briefly mention the expansion in the
uniform family when the test statistic is the MLE. The expansions are derived
by putting together Edgeworth expansions for the CDF, Cornish--Fisher
expansions for the quantile function and various Taylor expansions. Numerical
results show that the expansions are very accurate even for a small value of
$n$ (e.g., $n=10$). We make many useful conclusions from these expansions, and
specifically that the frequentist is not prone to false discoveries except when
the prior $g$ is too spiky. The results are illustrated by many examples.

We give an explicit representation of the rate functional which is a positive

the free energy cost ${\cal F}^*$ to undergo a phase change (the surface
tension). The ${\cal F}^*$ is the cost of one single phase change and depends
on the temperature and magnitude of the field. The other is a bulk contribution
due to the presence of the random magnetic field. We characterize the

described by a stationary renewal process related to the $h-$extrema for a
bilateral Brownian motion studied by Neveu and Pitman, where $h$ in our context

its asymptotic distribution for testing equality of two multinomial

terms of increasing convex order (ICX). ICX is less restrictive than stochastic
order and is a notion that has found applications in insurance and actuarial
science. In this paper we propose a new test for ICX. The new test has several
advantages over the LRT and over any test procedure that depends on asymptotic
theory for implementation. The advantages include the following: (i) The test
is exact (non-asymptotic). (ii) The test is performed by conditioning on
marginal column totals (and row totals in a full multinomial model for a
$2\times C$ table). (iii) The test has desirable monotonicity properties. That
is, the test is monotone in all practical directions (to be formally defined).
(iv) The test can be carried out computationally with the aid of a computer
program. (v) The test has good power properties among a wide variety of
possible alternatives. (vi) The test is admissible. The basis of the new test
is the directed chi-square methodology developed by Cohen, Madigan, and

  Paris in October 2004",,,,"math.NT",,"  Let E be an elliptic curve over Q (or, more generally, a number field). Then
on the one hand, we have the finitely generated abelian group E(Q), on the
other hand, there is the Shafarevich-Tate group Sha(Q,E). Descent is a general
method of getting information on both of these objects - ideally complete
information on the Mordell-Weil group E(Q), and usually partial information on
Sha(Q,E).
  What descent does is to compute (for a given n > 1) the n-Selmer group
Sel^(n)(Q,E); it sits in an exact sequence
  0 --> E(Q)/nE(Q) --> Sel^(n)(Q,E) --> Sha(Q,E)[n] --> 0 and thus contains
combined information on E(Q) and Sha(Q,E). The main problem I want to discuss
in this ``short course'' is how to actually do this explicitly, with some
emphasis on obtaining representations of the elements of the Selmer group as
explicit covering spaces of E. These explicit representations are useful in two
respects - they allow a search for rational points (if successful, this proves
that the element is in the image of the left hand map above), and they provide
the starting point for performing ``higher'' descents (e.g., extending a
p-descent computation to a p^2-descent computation).

in helping proper native folding of ribozymes and structured regulatory motifs
in mRNA untranslated regions. Yet, the underlying mechanisms and coding
requirements for efficient co-transcriptional folding remain unclear.
Traditional approaches have intrinsic limitations to dissect RNA folding paths,
as they rely on sequence mutations or circular permutations that typically
perturb both RNA folding paths and equilibrium structures. Here, we show that
exploiting sequence symmetries instead of mutations can circumvent this problem
by essentially decoupling folding paths from equilibrium structures of designed
RNA sequences. Using bistable RNA switches with symmetrical helices conserved
under sequence reversal, we demonstrate experimentally that native and
transiently formed helices can guide efficient co-transcriptional folding into
either long-lived structure of these RNA switches. Their folding path is
controlled by the order of helix nucleations and subsequent exchanges during
transcription, and may also be redirected by transient antisense interactions.
Hence, transient intra- and intermolecular base pair interactions can
effectively regulate the folding of nascent RNA molecules into different native
structures, provided limited coding requirements, as discussed from an
information theory perspective. This constitutive coupling between RNA
synthesis and RNA folding regulation may have enabled the early emergence of
autonomous RNA-based regulation networks.

Our numerical results show the dependence of the entanglement evolution upon
the initial state of the system and its spin components. The differences with
previous analyses accomplished by using the von Neumann entropy are discussed.
The evaluation of the entanglement dynamics in terms of the linear entropy
results to be much less demanding from the computational point of view, not
requiring the diagonalization of the density matrix.

two-atom interaction in a thermal cavity. The photon-number-dependent parts in
the evolution operator are canceled with the strong resonant classical field
added. As a result, our scheme is immune to thermal field, and does not require
the cavity to remain in the vacuum state throughout the procedure. Besides,
large detuning between the atoms and the cavity is not necessary neither,
leading to potential speed up of quantum operation. Finally, we show by
numerical simulation that the proposed scheme is equal to demonstrate the
Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm with high fidelity.

which must be distinguished to avoid interpretational problems. We construct
two languages $\mathcal{L}^{\ast}(x)$ and $\mathcal{L}(x)$ with classical
set-theoretical semantics which allow us to illustrate those meanings and to
show that the non-Boolean lattice of propositions of quantum logic (QL) can be
obtained by selecting a subset of \textit{p-testable} propositions within the
Boolean lattice of all propositions associated with sentences of
$\mathcal{L}(x)$. Yet, the aforesaid semantics is incompatible with the
standard interpretation of quantum mechanics (QM) because of known no-go
theorems. But if one accepts our criticism of these theorems and the ensuing SR
(semantic realism) interpretation of QM, the incompatibility disappears, and
the classical and quantum notions of truth can coexist, since they refer to
different metalinguistic concepts (\textit{truth} and \textit{verifiability
according to QM}, respectively). Moreover one can construct a quantum language
$\mathcal{L}_{TQ}(x)$ whose Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra is isomorphic to QL, the
sentences of which state (testable) properties of individual samples of
physical systems, while standard QL does not bear this interpretation.

We present the spectral theory of the light-atoms interaction and show how
particular spectral modes of quantum light couple to spatial modes of the
extended atomic ensemble. We show how this interaction can be used for quantum
memory storage and retrieval and for deterministic entanglement protocols. The
proposed protocols are attractive due to their simplicity since they involve
just a single pass of light through atoms without the need for elaborate pulse
shaping or quantum feedback. As a practically relevant example we consider the
interaction of a light pulse with hyperfine components of D1 line of 87Rb. The
quality of the proposed protocols is verified via analytical and numerical
analysis.
