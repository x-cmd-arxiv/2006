morphology on environment, using color and H-alpha equivalent width as
star-formation history indicators, using concentration and central surface
brightness as morphological indicators, and using clustocentric distance as an
environment indicator. Clustocentric distance has the virtue that it can be
measured with very high precision over a large dynamic range. We find the
following asymmetry between morphological and star-formation history
parameters: star-formation history parameters relate directly to the
clustocentric distance while morphological parameters relate to the
clustocentric distance only indirectly through their relationships with
star-formation history. This asymmetry has important implications for the role
that environment plays in shaping galaxy properties and it places strong
constraints on theoretical models of galaxy formation. Current semi-analytic
models do not reproduce this effect.

inelastically colliding hard disks confined in a two-dimensional annulus, the
inner circle of which represents a ""thermal wall"". When described by granular
hydrodynamic equations, the basic steady state of this system is an azimuthally
symmetric state of increased particle density at the exterior circle of the
annulus. When the inelastic energy loss is sufficiently large, hydrodynamics
predicts spontaneous symmetry breaking of the annular state, analogous to the
van der Waals-like phase separation phenomenon previously found in a driven
granular gas in rectangular geometry. At a fixed aspect ratio of the annulus,
the phase separation involves a ""spinodal interval"" of particle area fractions,
where the gas has negative compressibility in the azimuthal direction. The heat
conduction in the azimuthal direction tends to suppress the instability, as
corroborated by a marginal stability analysis of the basic steady state with
respect to small perturbations. To test and complement our theoretical
predictions we performed event-driven molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of
this system. We clearly identify the transition to phase separated states in
the MD simulations, despite large fluctuations present, by measuring the
probability distribution of the amplitude of the fundamental Fourier mode of
the azimuthal spectrum of the particle density. We find that the instability
region, predicted from hydrodynamics, is always located within the phase
separation region observed in the MD simulations. This implies the presence of
a binodal (coexistence) region, where the annular state is metastable. The
phase separation persists when the driving and elastic walls are interchanged,
and also when the elastic wall is replaced by weakly inelastic one.

between the detector and the field engenders entanglement between them, and
tracing out the field leads to a mixed state of the detector even for a

field's backreaction is ignored in that the detector no longer behaves like a
perfect thermometer. From a calculation of the evolution of the reduced density
matrix of the detector, we find that the transition probability from the
initial ground state over an infinitely long duration of interaction derived
from time-dependent perturbation theory is existent in the exact solution only
in transient under special limiting conditions corresponding to the Markovian
regime. Furthermore, the detector at late times never sees an exact Boltzmann
distribution over the energy eigenstates of the free detector, thus in the

questions of central interest in understanding the properties of the strongly
interacting matter produced in heavy ion collisions. We argue that these
questions can be addressed in the framework of field theories with strong time
dependent external sources. Albeit such field theories are non-perturbative for
arbitrarily weak coupling, moments of the multiplicity distribution can be
computed systematically in powers of the coupling constant. We demonstrate that
the average multiplicity can be (straightforwardly) computed to leading order
in the coupling and (remarkably) to next-to-leading order as well. We relate
our formalism to results from previous 2+1 and 3+1 dimensional numerical
simulations of the Glasma fields. The expanding Glasma is unstable; small
fluctuations in the initial conditions grow exponentially with the square root
of the proper time. Whether this explosive growth leads to early thermalization
in heavy ion collisions requires at present a better understanding of these
fluctuations on the light cone. In the final lecture, motivated by recent work

we argue that the semiclassical structure of finite temperature gauge fields
for T < T_c is dominated by calorons with non-trivial holonomy. By simulating a
dilute gas of calorons with identical holonomy, superposed in the algebraic
gauge, we are able to reproduce the confining properties below T_c up to
distances r = O(4 fm} >> \rho (the caloron size). We compute Polyakov loop
correlators as well as space-like Wilson loops for the fundamental and adjoint
representation. The model parameters, including the holonomy, can be inferred
from lattice results as functions of the temperature.

coupled with interacting quantum fields. The models contain vertices with
dimensionality greater than four, a finite number of matter operators and a
finite or reduced number of independent couplings. An interesting class of
models is obtained from ordinary power-counting renormalizable theories,
letting the couplings depend on the scalar curvature R of spacetime. The
divergences are removed without introducing higher-derivative kinetic terms in
the gravitational sector. The metric tensor has a non-trivial running, even if
it is not quantized. The results are proved applying a certain map that
converts classical instabilities, due to higher derivatives, into classical
violations of causality, whose effects become observable at sufficiently high
energies. We study acausal Einstein-Yang-Mills theory with an R-dependent gauge
coupling in detail. We derive all-order formulas for the beta functions of the
dimensionality-six gravitational vertices induced by renormalization. Such beta
functions are related to the trace-anomaly coefficients of the matter
subsector.

six dimensions with emphasis on anomaly cancellation. In general,
six-dimensional chiral supergravities suffer from gravitational, gauge and
mixed anomalies which render the theories inconsistent at the quantum level.
Consistency is restored if the anomalies of the theory cancel via the
Green-Schwarz mechanism or generalizations thereof. The anomaly cancellation
conditions translate into a certain set of constraints for the gauge group of
the theory as well as on its matter content. For the case of ungauged theories
these constraints admit numerous solutions but, in the case of gauged theories,
the allowed solutions are remarkably few. In this thesis, we examine these
anomaly cancellation conditions in detail and we present all solutions to these
conditions under certain restrictions on the allowed gauge groups and
representations, imposed for practical reasons. We also briefly examine anomaly
cancellation in the context of Horava-Witten-type compactifications of minimal
seven-dimensional supergravity. Finally, we discuss some basic aspects of 4D
compactifications of the gauged models.

Navier-Stokes equations concern the possibility of defining uniquely the
kinetic equation underlying such models and furthermore, the construction of a
kinetic theory implying also the energy equation. The latter condition is
consistent with the requirement that fluid fields result classical solutions of
the fluid equations. These issues appear of potential relevance both from the
mathematical viewpoint and for the physical interpretation of the theory. In
this paper we intend to prove that the non-uniqueness feature can be resolved
by imposing suitable assumptions. These include, in particular, the requirement
that the kinetic equation be equivalent, in a suitable sense, to a
Fokker-Planck kinetic equation. Its Fokker-Planck coefficients are proven to be
uniquely determined by means of appropriate prescriptions. In addition, as a
further result, it is proven that the inverse kinetic equation satisfies both
an entropy principle and the energy equation for the fluid fields.

astrophysical context, is the description of highly magnetized plasmas based on
a covariant formulation of gyrokinetic dynamics. An interesting case in
question is that in which the background electric field (produced either by the
same plasma of by other sources) results suitably small (or vanishing) with
respect to the magnetic field, while at the same time short-wavelength EM
perturbations can be present. The purpose of this work is to extend the
relativistic gyrokinetic theory developed by Beklemishev \textit{et al.}
[1999-2005] to include, in particular, also the treatment of such a case. We
intend to show that this requires the development of a perturbative expansion
involving simultaneously both the particle 4-position vector and the
corresponding \textit{4-velocity vector}. For this purpose a synchronous form
of the relativistic Hamilton variational principle is adopted.

superposition states in an interacting system are to be quantified. We propose
here a measure of size for such superposition states that is based on what
measurements can be performed to probe and distinguish the different branches
of the state. The measure allows comparison of the effective size for
superposition states in very different physical systems. It can be applied to a
very general class of superposition states and reproduces known results for
near-ideal cases. Comparison with a prior measure based on analy- sis of
coherence between branches indicates that significantly smaller effective
superposition sizes result from our measurement-based measure. Application to a
system of interacting bosons in a double-well trapping potential shows that the
effective superposition size is strongly dependent on the relative magnitude of
the barrier height and interparticle interaction.

them an attractive area of study for devising quantum algorithms for
long-standing open problems as well as those arising in the field of quantum
computing. In the case of continuous-time quantum random walks, such peculiar
dynamics can arise from simple evolution operators closely resembling the
quantum free-wave propagator. We investigate the divergence of quantum walk
dynamics from the free-wave evolution and show that in order for
continuous-time quantum walks to display their characteristic propagation, the
state space must be discrete. This behavior rules out many continuous quantum
systems as possible candidates for implementing continuous-time quantum random
