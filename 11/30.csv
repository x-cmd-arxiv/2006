unobserved; thus, the absence of rotation over our large radial range appears
to be an intrinsic feature of the globular cluster system in M104. We discuss
ways to explain this low rotation, including the possibility that angular
momentum has been transferred to even larger radii through galaxy mergers. The
cluster velocity dispersion is ~230 km/s within several arcmin of the galaxy

of M104 using our velocity dispersion profile, together with the Jeans equation

agreement with the mass inferred from the stellar and gas rotation curve within
3 arcmin radius. The M/L_V increases from ~4 near the galaxy center to ~17 at 7
arcmin radius (~20 kpc, or 4 R_e), thus giving strong support for the presence

statistical arguments. We are sensitive to companions in the separation range
0.1''-11'' (13-1430 AU) and K<17. We detect 62 secondaries of which 18 are

0.06<q<0.55. We include in our sample a subset of 9 targets with multi-color
ADONIS observations from Kouwenhoven et al. (2005). In the ADONIS survey
secondaries with K<12 were classified as companions; those with K>12 as
background stars. Our multi-color analysis demonstrates that the simple K=12
criterion correctly classifies the secondaries in ~80% of the cases. We
reanalyse the total ADONIS/NACO sample and conclude that of the 176
secondaries, 25 are physical companions, 55 are candidates, and 96 are
background stars. Although we are sensitive and complete to brown dwarfs as
faint as K=14 in the separation range 130-520 AU, we detect only one, giving a
brown dwarf companion fraction of 0.5% (M>30 MJ). However, the number of brown
dwarfs is consistent with an extrapolation of the stellar companion mass
distribution. This indicates that the physical mechanism for the formation of
brown dwarfs around intermediate mass stars is similar to that of stellar
companions, and that the embryo ejection mechanism does not need to be invoked

of the Lambda CDM model, providing constraints on the nature of dark matter.
Recent work investigating mass distributions of individual galaxy clusters
using gravitational lensing has illuminated potential inconsistencies between
the predictions of structure formation models relating halo mass to
concentration and those relationships as measured in massive clusters. However,
such analyses typically employ only simple spherical halo models with canonical
NFW slopes, while the halos formed in simulations show a range of more complex
features. Here we investigate the impact of such expected deviations from the
canonical NFW halo profile on mass and parameter estimation using weak
gravitational lensing on massive cluster scales. The most important deviation
is halo triaxiality because it is impossible even with fiducial weak lensing
data to fully resolve the three-dimensional structure of the halo due to
lensing's sensitivity only to projected mass. Significant elongation of the
halo along the line of sight can cause the mass and concentration to be
overestimated by as much as 50% and by a factor of 2, respectively, while
foreshortening has the opposite effect. Additionally, triaxial halos in certain
orientations are much better lenses than their spherical counterparts of the
same mass, indicating that clusters chosen for study because of evident lensing
are likely to be drawn from the high-triaxiality end of the halo shape
distribution. While the effects of triaxiality alone may not be enough to fully
explain the very high concentrations reported for some clusters, they go a long
way in easing the tensions between observations and the predictions of the cold
dark matter paradigm. (Abridged)

halt a massive cooling flow in a galaxy cluster and give rise to a

centre of a spherical halo with the mass of the Virgo cluster. Initially, all
the baryons are in a hot intracluster medium in hydrostatic equilibrium within
the dark matter's gravitational potential. The black hole accretes the
surrounding gas at the Bondi rate and a fraction of the accretion power is
returned into the intracluster medium mechanically through the production of
jets. The accretion, initially slow (~0.0002MSun/yr), becomes catastrophic, as
the gas cools and condenses in the dark matter's potential. Therefore, it
cannot prevent the cooling catastrophe at the centre of the cluster. However,
after this rapid phase, where the accretion rate reaches a peak of ~0.2MSun/yr,
the cavities inflated by the jets become highly turbulent. The turbulent mixing
of the shock-heated gas with the rest of the intracluster medium puts a quick
end to this short-lived rapid-growth phase. After dropping by almost two orders
of magnitudes, the black hole accretion rate stabilises at ~0.006MSun/yr,
without significant variations for several billions of years, indicating that a
self-regulated steady-state has been reached. This accretion rate corresponds
to a negligible increase of the black hole mass over the age of the Universe,
but is sufficient to create a quasi-equilibrium state in the cluster core.

results for redshifts from 0 to 3, by defining a less noisy estimator of

The substantial population in the n=2 shell of H I in this quasar's absorber
likely arises from Ly-alpha trapping. In an absorber sufficiently optically
thick to show Balmer absorption, soft X-rays from the quasar penetrate to large
\tau_Ly\alpha and ionize H I. Recombination then creates Ly-alpha photons that
increase the n=2 population by a factor \tau_Ly\alpha since they require about
\tau_Ly\alpha scatterings to diffuse out of the absorber. Observing Ly-alpha
trapping in a quasar absorber requires a large but Compton-thin column of gas

plasma to the specified source. The drop of the X-ray flux density in a
transitive frequency region is associated with the interplay of ordinary
synchrotron cooling and weaker magnetic fields concomitant with the smaller
scale filaments that allow the electron injection, while the radio-optical
synchrotron continuum is dominantly established by the major electrons that are
quasi-secularly bound to larger filaments. With reference to, particularly, the
updated external Compton model, we demonstrate that in the Klein-Nishina regime
fading inverse Comptonization, the injected electrons can be stochastically
energized up to a Lorentz factor as high as $5\times 10^{10}$ in the temporal
competition with diffuse synchrotron cooling; this value is larger than that
attainable for a simple DSA scenario based on the resonant scattering diffusion
of the gyrating electrons bound to a supposed magnetic field homogeneously
pervading the entire knot. The upper limits of the photon frequency boosted via
conceivable inverse Compton processes are predicted to be of the common order
of $\sim 10^{30}$ Hz. The variability of the broadband spectrum is also

wavelengths ranging from the UV to the submm. To demonstrate the power of such
a tool we compute predictions of the source-lens clustering effect on the
convergence statistics, and quantify the impact of weak lensing on galaxy
counts in two different filters. We find that the source-lens clustering effect
skews the probability density function of the convergence towards low values,
with an intensity which strongly depends on the redshift distribution of
galaxies. On the other hand, the degree of enhancement or depletion in galaxy
counts due to weak lensing is independent of the source-lens clustering effect.
We discuss the impact on the two-points shear statistics to be measured by
future missions like SNAP and LSST. The source-lens clustering effect would
bias the estimation of sigma_8 from two point statistics by 2% -5%. We conclude
that accurate photometric redshifts for individual galaxies are necessary in

observations. Although about 2000 pulsars have been discovered to date, little
is known about their emission mechanism. Large vacuum gaps probably exist and a
non-neutral plasma made of electrons in some regions and of positrons in some
other regions fills space to form an electrosphere. The purpose of this work is
to study the stability properties of the differentially rotating equatorial
disk in the pulsar's electrosphere for which the magnetic field is assumed to
be dipolar. In contrast to previous studies, the magnetic field is not
restricted to be uniform. A pseudo-spectral Galerkin method using Tchebyshev
polynomials expansion is developed to compute the spectrum of the diocotron
instability in a non-neutral plasma column confined between two cylindrically
conducting walls. Moreover, the inner wall carries a given charge per unit
length in order to account for the presence of a charged neutron star at the
centre of the electrosphere. We show several eigenfunctions and eigenspectra
obtained for different initial density profiles and electromagnetic field
configurations useful for laboratory plasmas. The algorithm is very efficient
in computing the fastest growing modes. Applications to a cylindrical
electrosphere are also shown for several differential rotation profiles. It is
found that the growth rates of the diocotron instability are of the same order
of magnitude as the rotation rate.

distribution of masses and the spatial distribution of subhaloes within the
main haloes.
  We carry out three $\Lambda$CDM simulations with different resolutions using
the AMIGA code. Dark matter haloes are identified using an algorithm that is
based on the adaptive grid structure of the simulation code. The haloes we find
encompass the mass scales from $10^8\mathrm{M}_{\sun}$ to
$10^{15}\mathrm{M}_{\sun}$.
  We find that if we have to study the halo structure (search for subhaloes),
the haloes have to contain at least $10^4$ particles. For such haloes, where we
can resolve substructure, we determined the subhalo mass function and found
that it is close to a power law with the slope -0.9 (at present time),
consistent with previous studies. This slope depends slightly on the redshift
and it is approximately the same for main haloes.
  The subhalo mass fraction ($M_{\s subH}/M_{\s MH}$) is between 0.08 and 0.2,
increasing slightly with redshift and with the mass of the main halo. Its
distribution is approximated using the Weibull distribution at different
epochs. The mean values of subhalo mass are independent of the main halo mass.
The spatial density of subhaloes, scaled to the virial radius of the main halo
($r_{\s vir}$), is independent of redshift and follows the $r^{1/3}$ rule.

studied as a function of tip bias, tip/sample distance and light intensity. In
order to extend the range of application of future spin injection experiments,
the measurements are carried out under nitrogen gas at room temperature. It is
found that while tunneling of valence band electrons is described by a standard
process between the semiconductor valence band and the metal, the tunneling of
photoelectrons obeys a Fowler-Nordheim-like process directly from the
conduction band. In the latter case, the bias dependence of the photocurrent as
a function of distance is in agreement with theoretical predictions which
include image charge effects. Quantitative analysis of the bias dependence of
the dark and photocurrent spectra gives reasonable values for the distance, and
for the tip and metal work functions. For small distances image charge effects
induce a vanishing of the barrier and the bias dependence of the photocurrent
is exponential. In common with many works on field emission, fluctuations in
the tunneling currents are observed. These are mainly attributed to changes in
the prefactor for the tunneling photocurrent, which we suggest is caused by an
electric-field-induced modification of the thickness of the natural oxide layer
covering the tip apex.

logarithmically on time, indicating that the quakes are triggered by record

its phases and both its Pauli like magnetic susceptibility and resistivity are
an order of magnitude larger than those of simple metals. Curium is also highly
resistive but its susceptibility is Curie-like at high temperatures and orders
antiferromagnetically at low temperatures. The anomalous properties of the late
actinides stem from the competition between the itinerancy and localization of
its f electrons, which makes the late actinides elemental strongly correlated
materials. A central problem in this field is to understand the mechanism by
which these materials resolve these conflicting tendencies. In this letter we
identify the electronic mechanisms responsible for the anomalous behaviour of
late actinides. We revisit the concept of valence using theoretical approach
that treats magnetism, Kondo screening, atomic multiplet effects, spin orbit
coupling and crystal field splitting on the same footing. Plutonium is found to
be in a rare mixed valent state, namely its ground state is a superposition of
two distinct valencies. Curium settles in a single valence magnetically ordered
state at low temperatures. The f7 atomic configuration of Curium is contrasted
with the multiple configuration manifolds present in Plutonium ground state
which we characterize by a valence histogram. The balance between the Kondo
screening and magnetism is determined by the competition between spin orbit
coupling and the strength of atomic multiplets which is in turn regulated by
the degree of itinerancy. The approach presented here, highlights the
electronic origin of the bonding anomalies in plutonium and can be applied to
predict generalized valences and the presence or absence of magnetism in other
compounds starting from first principles.

readily accessed in a slave boson mean field formulation, and are energetically
favorable when the Kondo interaction is between a local moment and an electron

studied. Effective mass and quasiparticle residue show large angle dependence
on the Fermi surface. Remarkably in certain cases, the quasiparticle residue
goes to zero at isolated points (in two dimensions) on the Fermi surface. The
excitations at these points then include a free fractionalized spinon. We also
point out the possibility of quantum Hall phenomena in two dimensional Kondo

case for elasticity tensors such as strain and the fourth order tensor of

of this paradigm at the team level. Since these claims are cognitive in nature,
its seems important to assess them empirically. After a brief presentation of
the main concepts of the OO paradigm, the claims about the superiority of OO
design are outlined. The core of this paper consists of a review of empirical
studies of OOD. We first discuss results concerning OOD by individuals. On the
basis of empirical work, we (1) analyse the design activity of novice OO
designers, (2) compare OO design with procedural design and, (3) discuss a
typology of problems relevant for the OO approach. Then we assess the claims
about naturalness and ease of OO design. The next part discusses results on OO
software reuse. On the basis of empirical work, we (1) compare reuse in the OO
versus procedural paradigm, (2) discuss the potential for OO software reuse and
(3) analyse reuse activity in the OO paradigm. Then we assess claims on
reusability. The final part reviews empirical work on OO design by teams. We
present results on communication, coordination, knowledge dissemination and

a power-law form. Most of the evidence showing the power-law distribution is
based on BGP data. However, it was recently argued that since BGP collects data
in a tree-like fashion, it only produces a sample of the degree distribution,
and this sample may be biased. This argument was backed by simulation data and
mathematical analysis, which demonstrated that under certain conditions a tree
sampling procedure can produce an artificail power-law in the degree
distribution. Thus, although the observed degree distribution of the AS-graph
follows a power-law, this phenomenon may be an artifact of the sampling
process. In this work we provide some evidence to the contrary. We show, by
analysis and simulation, that when the underlying graph degree distribution
obeys a power-law with an exponent larger than 2, a tree-like sampling process
produces a negligible bias in the sampled degree distribution. Furthermore,
recent data collected from the DIMES project, which is not based on BGP
sampling, indicates that the underlying AS-graph indeed obeys a power-law
degree distribution with an exponent larger than 2. By combining this empirical
data with our analysis, we conclude that the bias in the degree distribution
calculated from BGP data is negligible.

permuting its coordinates and by rotating each coordinate by a fixed phase

methods, the following question is considered in this paper. For a given binary
code, how much PMEPR reduction can be achieved when the phase shifts are taken
from a 2^h-ary phase-shift keying (2^h-PSK) constellation? A lower bound on the
achievable PMEPR is established, which is related to the covering radius of the
binary code. Generally speaking, the achievable region of the PMEPR shrinks as
the covering radius of the binary code decreases. The bound is then applied to
some well understood codes, including nonredundant BPSK signaling, BCH codes
and their duals, Reed-Muller codes, and convolutional codes. It is demonstrated
that most (presumably not optimal) phase-shift designs from the literature
attain or approach our bound.

the Casimir energy induced by the bulk graviton-gravitino mass-shift on the

sensible only if the number of extra dimension n=2. We extend our study to the
Randall-Sundrum model. Invoking the chirality-flip on the boundaries for
SUSY-breaking, the zero-mode gravitino contribution to the Casimir energy does
give rise to the double hierarchy. Unfortunately since the higher Kaluza-Klein
modes acquire relative mass-shifts at the TeV level, the zero-mode contribution
to Casimir energy is overshadowed.

the necessary enhancement to neutralino annihilation rates, these models tend
to give elevated direct detection scattering rates compared to predictions from
SUSY models with universal soft breaking terms. We present neutralino direct
detection cross sections from a variety of models containing a well-tempered
neutralino, and find cross section asymptotes with detectable scattering rates.
These asymptotic rates provide targets that various direct CDM detection
experiments should aim for. In contrast, in models where the neutralino mass
rather than its composition is varied to give the WMAP relic density via either
resonance annihilation or co-annihilation, the neutralino remains essentially
bino-like, and direct detection rates may be below the projected reaches of all
proposed experiments.

as to how the theory of general relativity is put into practice and becomes
part of our everyday life. This paper gives a short and instructive derivation
of an important formula used in the GPS, and is aimed at graduate students and
general physicists.
  The theoretical background of the GPS (see \cite{ashby}) uses the
Schwarzschild spacetime to deduce the {\it approximate} formula, $ds/dt\approx
1+V-\frac{|\vv|^2}{2}$, for the relation between the proper time rate $s$ of a
satellite clock and the coordinate time rate $t$. Here $V$ is the gravitational
potential at the position of the satellite and $\vv$ is its velocity (with
light-speed being normalized as $c=1$). In this note we give a different
derivation of this formula, {\it without using approximations}, to arrive at
$ds/dt=\sqrt{1+2V-|\vv|^2 -\frac{2V}{1+2V}(\n\cdot\vv)^2}$, where $\n$ is the
normal vector pointing outward from the center of Earth to the satellite. In
particular, if the satellite moves along a circular orbit then the formula
simplifies to $ds/dt=\sqrt{1+2V-|\vv|^2}$.
  We emphasize that this derivation is useful mainly for educational purposes,
as the approximation above is already satisfactory in practice.

  For an arbitrary number of strands, finding the geodesic length of an element
is NP-hard, by a 1991 result of by Paterson and Razborov. We show that a good
estimation of the geodesic length of a braid in Artin's presentation is
measuring the length of its rational form in the \emph{BKL} presentation. This
is proved theoretically for the worst case, and experimental evidence is
provided for the generic case.

\phi}{\partial t_j}(\t) \frac{\partial}{\partial x}, j=1,..., n, \t\in \Omega,

hypoelliptic. This was the case when $n=1$ but in the case $n>1$, an inaccurate
reading of the proof given by Maire (see also Tr\`eves) of the hypoellipticity
of such systems, under the condition that $\phi$ does not admit any local
maximum or minimum (through a non standard subelliptic estimate), was
supporting the belief for this folk theorem. Quite recently, J.L. Journ\'e and
J.M.Tr\'epreau show by examples that there are very simple systems (with
polynomial $\phi$'s) which were hypoelliptic but not subelliptic in the
standard $L^2$-sense. So it is natural to analyze this problem of
subellipticity which is in some sense intermediate (at least when $\phi$ is
$C^\infty$) between the maximal hypoellipticity (which was analyzed by
Helffer-Nourrigat and Nourrigat) and the simple local hypoellipticity (or local
microhypoellipticity) and to start first with the easiest non trivial examples.
The analysis presented here is a continuation of a previous work by the first

consensus control strategy is implemented only based on the state information
at some discrete times of each agent's neighbors. The asynchronization means
that each agent's update times, at which the agent adjusts its dynamics, are
independent of others'. Furthermore, it is assumed that the communication
topology among agents is time-dependent and the information transmission is
with bounded time-varying delays. If the union of the communication topology
across any time interval with some given length contains a spanning tree, the
consensus problem is shown to be solvable. The analysis tool developed in this
paper is based on the nonnegative matrix theory and graph theory. The main
contribution of this paper is to provide a valid distributed consensus
algorithm that overcomes the difficulties caused by unreliable communication
channels, such as intermittent information transmission, switching

has its obvious practical applications. Simulation examples are provided to

cycles through a number of allosteric states, the $T$ state, with high affinity
for substrate proteins (SPs), the ATP-bound $R$ state, and the
$R^{\prime\prime}$ ($GroEL-ADP-GroES$) complex. Structures are known for each
of these states. Here, we use a self-organized polymer (SOP) model for the
GroEL allosteric states and a general structure-based technique to simulate the
dynamics of allosteric transitions in two subunits of GroEL and the heptamer.
The $T \to R$ transition, in which the apical domains undergo counter-clockwise
motion, is mediated by a multiple salt-bridge switch mechanism, in which a
series of salt-bridges break and form. The initial event in the $R \to
R^{\prime\prime}$ transition, during which GroEL rotates clockwise, involves a
spectacular outside-in movement of helices K and L that results in K80-D359
salt-bridge formation. In both the transitions there is considerable
heterogeneity in the transition pathways. The transition state ensembles (TSEs)
connecting the $T$, $R$, and $R^{\prime\prime}$ states are broad with the the
TSE for the $T \to R$ transition being more plastic than the $R\to
R^{\prime\prime}$ TSE. The results suggest that GroEL functions as a
force-transmitting device in which forces of about (5-30) pN may act on the SP
during the reaction cycle.

necessary that theoretical models describe the macromolecular interaction
energetics accurately. While several methods have been proposed, there has not
been a careful comparison of how well the different methods are able to predict
biologically important quantities such as the correct DNA binding sequence,
total binding free energy, and free energy changes caused by DNA mutation. In
addition to carrying out the comparison, we present two important theoretical
models developed initially in protein folding that have not yet been tried on
protein-DNA interactions. In the process, we find that the results of these

the case of mixed states by utilizing the kronecker product approximate
technique. As applications, we give the analytic approximation of the criterion
for weakly mixed tripartite quantum states and investigate the full
