galaxy has an extremely extended HI disk, which allows us to trace the rotation
curve out to unprecedented distances in terms of the optical disk: we reach 42
B-band exponential scale lengths or about 7 kpc. The HI disk is strongly
warped, but the warp is very symmetric. The distribution and kinematics are
accurately derived by building model data cubes, which closely reproduce the
observations. In order to account for the observed features in the data cube,
radial motions of the order of 5-13 km/s are needed. They are consistent with
an inner bar of several hundreds of pc and accretion of material in the outer
regions.
  The observed rotation curve was decomposed into its stellar, gaseous and dark
components. The Burkert dark halo (with a central constant density core)
provides very good fits. The dark halo density distribution predicted by the
LambdaCDM theory fails to fit the data, unless NGC 3741 is a 2.5-sigma
exception to the predicted relation between concentration parameter and virial
mass and has at the same time a high value of the virial mass (though poorly
constrained) of 10$^{11}$ solar masses. Noticeably, MOND seems to be consistent
with the observed rotation curve. Scaling up the contribution of the gaseous
disk also gives a good fit.

Milky Way-size halo with Mvir=1.8x10^12 Msun in a WMAP 3-year cosmology, using
234 million particles. Over 10,000 subhalos can be identified at z=0: Their
cumulative mass function is well-fit by N(>Msub)= 0.0064 (Msub/Mvir)^(-1) down
to Msun=4x10^6 Msun. The total mass fraction in subhalos is 5.3%, while the
fraction of surface mass density in substructure within a projected distance of
10 kpc from the halo center is 0.3%. Because of the significant contribution
from the smallest resolved subhalos, these fractions have not converged yet.
Sub-substructure is apparent in all the larger satellites, and a few dark
matter lumps are resolved even in the solar vicinity. The number of dark
satellites with peak circular velocities above 10 km/s (5 km/s) is 124 (812):
of these, 5 (26) are found within 0.1 Rvir, a region that appeared practically
smooth in previous simulations. The neutralino self-annihilation gamma-ray
emission from dark matter clumps is approximately constant per subhalo mass
decade. Therefore, while in our run the contribution of substructure to the
gamma-ray luminosity of the Galactic halo amounts to only 40% of the total
spherically-averaged smooth signal, we expect this fraction to grow
significantly as resolution is increased further. An all-sky map of the
expected annihilation gamma-ray flux reaching a fiducial observer at 8 kpc from
the Galactic center shows that at the current resolution a small number of
subhalos start to be bright enough to be visible against the background from
the smooth density field surrounding the observer.

short-term variability phase when compared to the past with a correlated >~4
day time scale amplitude increase of up to 35%, which is systematically more
pronounced towards higher frequencies. The obtained frequency dependent
variability amplitudes and time lags contradict expectations from interstellar
scintillation and strongly suggest a source intrinsic origin of this inter-day
variability. A 7-day spectral evolution study indicate time-variable
synchrotron self-absorption and expansion of the emission region, consistent
with standard models. Assuming relativistic boosting, our different estimates
of the Doppler factor yield robust lower limits of D_var,IC > 5-22 using the

Although high, these values are in good agreement with Doppler factors obtained

unique tool for experimentally testing general relativity (GR), whose validity
has been confirmed with a precision unavailable in laboratory experiments. In
particular, indirect evidence of the existence of gravitational waves has been
obtained. Radio pulsars in binary systems (which have come to be known as
recycled) have completed the accretion stage, during which neutron star spins
reach millisecond periods and their magnetic fields decay 2 to 4 orders of
magnitude more weakly than ordinary radio pulsars. Among about a hundred known
recycled pulsars, many have turned out to be single neutron stars. The high
concentration of single recycled pulsars in globular clusters suggests that
close stellar encounters are highly instrumental in the loss of the companion.
A system of one recycled pulsar and one 'normal' one discovered in 2004 is the
most compact among binaries containing recycled pulsars [2]. Together with the
presence of two pulsars in one system, this suggests new prospects for further
essential improvements in testing GR. This paper considers theoretical
predictions of binary pulsars, their evolutionary formation, and mechanisms by
which their companions may be lost. The use of recycled pulsars in testing GR
is discussed and their possible relation to the most intriguing objects in the

weakened by atmospheric effects become indistinguishable from the continuum for
moderate scattering optical depths in the magnetosphere. Furthermore, the hard
excess becomes more pronounced due to resonant scattering and the resulting
spectra closely resemble the observed magnetar spectra. We argue that while the
absence of proton cyclotron lines in the observed spectra are inconclusive
about the surface field strengths of magnetars, the continuum carries nearly
unique signatures of the field strength and can thus be used to infer this
quantity. We fit our theoretical spectra with a phenomenological two-blackbody
model and compare our findings to source spectra with existing two-blackbody
fits. The field strengths that we infer spectroscopically are in remarkable
agreement with the values inferred from the period derivative of the sources

identified to date. Comparing spectra of young brown dwarfs, field dwarfs, and
giant stars, we define a 1.49-1.56 micron H2O index capable of determining
spectral type to within 1 sub-type, independent of gravity. We have also
defined an index based on the 1.14 micron sodium feature that is sensitive to
gravity, but only weakly dependent on spectral type for field dwarfs. Our 1.14
micron Na index can be used to distinguish young cluster members (t <~ 5 Myr)
from young field dwarfs, both of which may have the triangular H-band continuum
shape which persists for at least tens of Myr. Using effective temperatures
determined from the spectral types of our objects along with luminosities
derived from near and mid-infrared photometry, we place our objects on the H-R
diagram and overlay evolutionary models to estimate the masses and ages of our
young sources. Three of our sources have inferred ages (t ~= 10-30 Myr)
significantly older than the median stellar age of their parent clouds (1-3
Myr). For these three objects, we derive masses ~3 times greater than expected
for 1-3 Myr old brown dwarfs with the bolometric luminosities of our sources.
The large discrepancies in the inferred masses and ages determined using two

the observed projected correlation function w(\theta) with models derived
within the so-called Halo Occupation Scenario show that these sources have to
be hosted by haloes more massive than ~10^{13.4} M_\odot. This value is
significantly higher than that for the typical galactic haloes hosting massive

we perform simulations to deblend the quasar from the host under conditions
similar to those actually observed. We find that the host galaxy has an

surrogate for the bulge velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) of the host galaxies of
high-redshift quasars, and the black hole -- bulge ($M_{BH}-\sigma$) relation
obtained with this assumption departs significantly from the $M_{BH}-\sigma$
relation in the local universe. In this study, we first present an
investigation of the correlation between the CO line width and the bulge
velocity dispersion using a sample of 33 nearby Seyfert galaxies. We find that
the formula adopted in previous studies, $\sigma=\rm{FWHM(CO)}/2.35$, is
generally not a good approximation. Using it, one may underestimate the value
of bulge velocity dispersion significantly when the CO line is narrower than
400 $km s^{-1}$. By involving the galactic inclination angle $i$ as an
additional parameter, we obtain a tight correlation between the
inclination-corrected CO line width and the bulge velocity dispersion, namely,
$\rm {FWHM(CO)}/\sin i=-67.16\pm80.18+(3.62\pm0.68)\sigma$. Using this new
relation, we can better estimate the bulge velocity dispersion from the CO line
width if the galactic inclination is known. We apply this new relation to nine
high-redshift quasars with CO line detections and find that they are consistent
with the local $M_{BH}-\sigma$ relation if their inclination angles are around
$15^o$. The possible smaller inclinations of the high-redshift quasars are
preferred because of their relatively greater likelihood of detection, and are
also consistent with their relatively smaller CO line widths compared to
submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) at high redshift having a similar total amount of
molecular gas. Future observations are needed to confirm these results.

that using adaptive block power of two timesteps does not increase the error in
symplecticity. In contrast to other high-order, symplectic, individual
timestep, momentum-preserving algorithms, the algorithm takes only forward
timesteps. We compare a code integrating an N-body system using the algorithm
with a direct-summation force calculation to standard stellar cluster
simulation codes. We find that our algorithm has about 1.5 orders of magnitude
better symplecticity and momentum conservation errors than standard algorithms
for equivalent numbers of force evaluations and equivalent energy conservation

been uniformly enriched prior to their formation. Furthermore, the metal-poor

protostars through their natal molecular clouds may be crucial in determining
the properties of stars through competitive accretion and dynamical
interactions. Walsh, Myers & Burton recently investigated whether such motions
might be observable in the earliest stages of star formation by measuring the
relative shifts of line-centre velocities of low- and high-density tracers of
low-mass star-forming cores. They found very small (~0.1 km/s) relative
motions. In this paper, we analyse the hydrodynamical simulation of Bate,
Bonnell & Bromm and find that it also gives small relative velocities between
high-density cores and low-density envelopes, despite the fact that competitive
accretion and dynamical interactions occur between protostars in the
simulation. Thus, the simulation is consistent with the observations in this
respect. However, we also find some differences between the simulation and the
observations. Overall, we find that the high-density gas has a higher velocity
dispersion than that observed by Walsh et al. We explore this by examining the
dependence of the gas velocity dispersion on density and its evolution with
time during the simulation. We find that early in the simulation the gas
velocity dispersion decreases monotonically with increasing density, while
later in the simulation, when the dense cores have formed multiple objects, the
velocity dispersion of the high-density gas increases. Thus, the simulation is
in best agreement with the observations early on, before many objects have
formed in each dense core.

determine an accurate X-ray position of the object, and derive light curves,
spectra and flux in four XMM-Newton observations. Results. The positions of the
X-ray source and the helium star candidate coincide within 0.11""+-0.45"". The
X-ray light curves show irregular variability. During one XMM-Newton
observation, the flux increased by about a factor of ten in 10 hours. The
spectrum can be modelled by a power-law with Gamma~2.45 with additional
relatively weak line emission, notably around 0.95 kev. The mean observed
(absorbed) luminosity in the 0.2-10 kev band is ~2x10^38 erg/s. Conclusions.
NGC 300 X-1 is a good candidate for a Wolf-Rayet/black-hole X-ray binary: its
position coincides with a Wolf-Rayet candidate and the unabsorbed X-ray
luminosity reached L(0.2-10 kev)~1x10^39 erg/s, suggesting the presence of a
black hole.

the resulting angular momentum of the accreted material is decoupled from that
of the pre-existing galaxy. The presence of stars counter-rotating with respect
to other stars and/or gas represents an extreme case of decoupling. (Aims)
NGC5719, an almost edge-on Sab galaxy with a prominent skewed dust lane, shows
a spectacular on-going interaction with its face-on Sbc companion NGC5713.
Observations of such interacting systems provide insight into the processes at
work in assembling and reshaping galaxies. (Methods) Studies were made of the
distribution and kinematics of neutral hydrogen in the NGC5719/13 galaxy pair
and the ionised gas and stellar kinematics along the major axis of NGC5719.
(Results) Two HI tidal bridges that loop around NGC5719 and connect to NGC5713,
and two HI tidal tails departing westward from NGC5713 were detected. There is
a correspondence between the HI condensations and the location of clumps of
young stars within and outside the disc of NGC5719. The low-mass satellite
PGC135857 at the tip of the northern tail was detected in HI, and is likely a
by-product of the interaction. The neutral and ionised hydrogen in the disc of
NGC5719 are counter-rotating with respect to the main stellar disc. The
counter-rotating stellar disc contains about 20% of the stars in the system,
and has the same radial extension as the main stellar disc. This is the first
interacting system in which a counter-rotating stellar disc has been detected.
(Conclusions) The data support a scenario where HI from the large reservoir
available in the galaxy's surroundings was accreted by NGC5719 onto a
retrograde orbit and subsequently fuelled the in-situ formation of the
counter-rotating stellar disc.

comprises their wind ram pressures, mass fluxes, and terminal wind velocities.
The wind properties are determined through a polytropic magnetised wind model,
assuming power laws for the dependence of the thermal and magnetic wind
parameters on the stellar rotation rate. We use empirical data to constrain
theoretical wind scenarios, which are characterised by different rates of
increase of the wind temperature, wind density, and magnetic field strength.
Scenarios based on moderate rates of increase yield wind ram pressures in
agreement with most empirical constraints, but cannot account for some
moderately rotating targets, whose high apparent mass loss rates are
inconsistent with observed coronal X-ray and magnetic properties. For fast
magnetic rotators, the magneto-centrifugal driving of the outflow can produce
terminal wind velocities far in excess of the surface escape velocity.
Disregarding this aspect in the analyses of wind ram pressures leads to
overestimations of stellar mass loss rates. The predicted mass loss rates of
cool main-sequence stars do not exceed about ten times the solar value. Our
results are in contrast with previous investigations, which found a strong
increase of the stellar mass loss rates with the coronal X-ray flux. Owing to
the weaker dependence, we expect the impact of stellar winds on planetary
atmospheres to be less severe and the detectability of magnetospheric radio
emission to be lower then previously suggested. Considering the rotational
evolution of a one solar-mass star, the mass loss rates and the wind ram
pressures are highest during the pre-main sequence phase.

reactive coupling between the backward propagating whistler (fast) waves in the
moving electron frame and the forward propagating sound (slow) waves in the ion

propagate obliquely to the unperturbed magnetic field and have mixed
polarization with significant electromagnetic components. A physical picture of
the instability emerges in the limit of large wavenumber characteristic of the

particular case of small deformations of the interface relative to its flat
configuration. We apply this analogy to compute the asymptotic decay of the
effective force between particles trapped at a fluid interface, extending the
validity of previous results. Second, we address the case of deformations of a
non-flat interface. We compute the deformation of a spherical droplet due to
the electric field of a charged particle trapped at its surface and conclude
that the interparticle capillary force is unlikely to explain certain recent
experimental observations. Finally we discuss the application to a generally

quantum dot coupled to a normal metal lead and a ferromagnetic lead (NM-QD-FM).
We use the master equation approach to calculate the spin-resolved currents in
the presence of an external bias and an intra-dot Coulomb interaction. We find
that for a range of positive external biases (current flow from the normal
metal to the ferromagnet) the current polarization
$\wp=(I_\uparrow-I_\downarrow)/(I_\uparrow+I_\downarrow)$ is suppressed to
zero, while for the corresponding negative biases (current flow from the
ferromagnet to the normal metal) $\wp$ attains a relative maximum value. The
system thus operates as a rectifier for spin--current polarization. This effect
follows from an interplay between Coulomb interaction and nonequilibrium spin
accumulation in the dot. In the parameter range considered, we also show that
the above results can be obtained via nonequilibrium Green functions within a
Hartree-Fock type approximation.

presence of two correlated noise sources is analyzed: (i) an external
multiplicative time correlated noise, which mimics the interaction between the
system and the environment; (ii) a dichotomous stochastic process, whose jump
rate is a periodic function, which represents the interaction parameter between
the species. The moment equations for the species densities are derived in
Gaussian approximation, using a mean field approach. Within this formalism we
study the effect of the external time correlated noise on the ecosystem
dynamics. We find that the time behavior of the $1^{st}$ order moments are
independent on the multiplicative noise source. However the behavior of the
$2^{nd}$ order moments is strongly affected both by the intensity and the
correlation time of the multiplicative noise. Finally we compare our results
with those obtained studying the system dynamics by a coupled map lattice
model.

other than s-wave has been found in several classes of materials, including
heavy fermion (HF), high-T_c, and organic superconductors. Unconventional
superconductivity is characterized by anisotropic superconducting gap
functions, which may have zeros (nodes) along certain directions in the
Brillouin zone. The nodal structure is closely related to the pairing
interaction, and it is widely believed that the presence of nodes is a
signature of magnetic or some other exotic, rather than conventional
phonon-mediated, pairing mechanism. Therefore experimental determination of the
gap function is of fundamental importance. However, the detailed gap structure,
especially the direction of the nodes, is an unresolved issue in most
unconventional superconductors. Recently it has been demonstrated that the
thermal conductivity and specific heat measurements under magnetic field
rotated relative to the crystal axes are a powerful method for determining the
shape of the gap and the nodal directions in the bulk. Here we review the

measured by calculating ArXiv citation impact differentials at the level of

Kaluza-Klein (NKK) theory of gravity is presented in this talk notes. In this
analysis we recover the well-known result $\frac{delta \rho}{\rho}\simeq 2\Phi$
obtained typically in the standard 4D semiclassical approach to inflation and
also the spectrum of this fluctuations becomes dependent of the fifth
(space-like) coordinate. This fact allows to establish an interval of values
for the wave number associated with the fifth dimension.

specification consists of five conditions: four, which we treat here as valid

perturbation. In this work, we utilize a newly developed form of the perturbed
Einstein equations to establish a condition -- on a particular tetrad component
of the stress-energy tensor -- under which the full IRG/ORG can be imposed.
Using gauge freedom, we are able to impose the full IRG for Petrov type II and
type D backgrounds, using a different tetrad for each case. As a specific
example, we work through the process of imposing the IRG in a Schwarzschild
background, using a more traditional approach. Implications for metric
reconstruction using the Teukolsky curvature perturbations in type D spacetimes

first law of thermodynamics. We find that the unified first law firstly
proposed by Hayward to treat the ""outer""trapping horizon of dynamical black
hole can be used to the apparent horizon (a kind of ""inner"" trapping horizon in
the context of the FRW cosmology) of the FRW universe. We discuss three kinds
of gravity theorties: Einstein theory, Lovelock thoery and scalar-tensor
theory. In Einstein theory, the first law of thermodynamics is always satisfied
on the apparent horizon. In Lovelock theory, treating the higher derivative
terms as an effective energy-momentum tensor, we find that this method can give
the same entropy formula for the apparent horizon as that of black hole
horizon. This implies that the Clausius relation holds for the Lovelock theory.
In scalar-tensor gravity, we find, by using the same procedure, the Clausius
relation no longer holds. This indicates that the apparent horizon of FRW
universe in the scalar-tensor gravity corresponds to a system of
non-equilibrium thermodynamics. We show this point by using the method
developed recently by Eling {\it et al.} for dealing with the $f(R)$ gravity.

supermassive black hole can be accurately approximated by a point particle
moving in a Kerr background. This paper presents progress on finding the
electromagnetic and gravitational field of a point particle in a black-hole
spacetime and on computing the self-force in a ``radiation gauge.'' The gauge
is chosen to allow one to compute the perturbed metric from a gauge-invariant
component $\psi_0$ (or $\psi_4$) of the Weyl tensor and follows earlier work by
Chrzanowski and Cohen and Kegeles (we correct a minor, but propagating, error
in the Cohen-Kegeles formalism). The electromagnetic field tensor and vector
potential of a static point charge and the perturbed gravitational field of a
static point mass in a Schwarzschild geometry are found, surprisingly, to have
closed-form expressions. The gravitational field of a static point charge in
the Schwarzschild background must have a strut, but $\psi_0$ and $\psi_4$ are
smooth except at the particle, and one can find local radiation gauges for
which the corresponding spin $\pm 2$ parts of the perturbed metric are smooth.
Finally a method for finding the renormalized self-force from the Teukolsky
equation is presented. The method is related to the Mino, Sasaki, Tanaka and
Quinn and Wald (MiSaTaQuWa) renormalization and to the Detweiler-Whiting
construction of the singular field. It relies on the fact that the renormalized
$\psi_0$ (or $\psi_4$) is a {\em sourcefree} solution to the Teukolsky
equation; and one can therefore reconstruct a nonsingular renormalized metric
in a radiation gauge.

semi-classical interpretation as a quantum version of a classical spacetime,

which can be tracked down to the complexification of the phase space necessary
in its construction. This suggests a generalization of the state to real values

one can generalize the state to real variables and the result is surprising in
that it appears to open up an infinite class of physical states. We show that
these states closely parallel the ordinary momentum eigenstates of

role of the momentum. With this identification, the states inherit many of the

physical interpretation of the generalized Kodama states. We first show that
the states are the three dimensional boundary degrees of freedom of two
familiar 4-dimensional topological invariants: the second Chern class and the
Euler class. Using this, we show that the states have the familiar
interpretation as WKB states, in this case corresponding not only to de Sitter
space, but also to first order perturbations therein. In an appropriate spatial
topology, the de Sitter solution has pure Chern-Simons functional form, and is
the unique state in the class that is identically diffeomorphism and SU(2)
gauge invariant. The q-deformed loop transform of this state yields evidence of
a cosmological horizon when the deformation parameter is a root of untiy. We
then discuss the behavior of the states under discrete symmetries, showing that
the states violate $P$ and $T$ due to the presence of the Immirzi parameter,
but they are $CPT$ invariant. We conclude with an interesting connection
between the physical inner product and the Macdowell Mansouri formulation of
gravity.

with that on a fixed background geometry.
  In the simplified context of two dimensions, we show how a method invented to
analyze the critical behaviour of spin systems on flat lattices can be adapted
to the fluctuating ensemble of curved spacetimes underlying the Causal
Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) approach to quantum gravity. We develop a
systematic counting of embedded graphs to evaluate the thermodynamic functions
of the gravity-matter models in a high- and low-temperature expansion. For the
case of the Ising model, we compute the series expansions for the magnetic
susceptibility on CDT lattices and their duals up to orders 6 and 12, and
analyze them by ratio method, Dlog Pad\'e and differential approximants. Apart
from providing evidence for a simplification of the model's analytic structure
due to the dynamical nature of the geometry, the technique introduced can shed
further light on criteria \`a la Harris and Luck for the influence of random
geometry on the critical properties of matter systems.

strongly interacting medium presumably created in high energy heavy ion
collisions it is necessary to know their free masses reliably. The rho(770)
mass quoted in the last two editions of the Review of Particle Physics is
significantly larger than the values quoted in previous editions. The new value
is mostly influenced by the results of recent experiments CMD-2 and SND at the
VEPP-2M e+e- collider at Novosibirsk. We show that the values of the mass and
width of the rho(770) meson measured in the e+e- -> pi+pi- annihilation depend
crucially on the parametrization used for the pion form factor. We propose a
parametrization of the rho(770) contribution to the pion form factor based on
the running mass calculated from a single-subtracted dispersion relation and
compare it with the parametrization based on the formula of Gounaris and
Sakurai used recently by the CMD-2 collaboration. We show that our
parametrization gives equally good or better fits when applied to the data of
the CMD-2, SND, and KLOE collaborations, but yields much smaller values of the
rho(770) mass, consistent with the photoproduction and hadronic reactions
results. Our fit to the KLOE data becomes exceptionally excellent (confidence
level of 99.88%) if an energy shift of about 2 MeV in the rho-omega region is
allowed.

to the Standard Model Higgs boson. Nevertheless, we point out some enhancements
in its couplings to bottom and tau pairs, ranging from a few per cent in most
of the CMSSM parameter space, up to several per cent in the favored region of
tan(beta)\sim 50 and the pseudoscalar Higgs mass of m_A\lsim 1 TeV. We also
find that the other Higgs bosons are typically heavier, although not
necessarily much heavier. For values of the h^0 mass within the 95% probability
range as determined by our analysis, a 95% CL exclusion limit can be set with
about 2/fb of integrated luminosity per experiment, or else with 4/fb (12/fb) a
3 sigma evidence (5 sigma discovery) will be guaranteed. We also emphasize that
the alternative statistical measure of the mean quality-of-fit favors a
somewhat lower Higgs mass range; this implies even more optimistic prospects
for the CMSSM light Higgs search than the more conservative Bayesian approach.
In conclusion, for the above CMSSM parameter ranges, especially m_0, either
some evidence will be found at the Tevatron for the light Higgs boson or, at a
high confidence level, the CMSSM will be ruled out.

low-energy supersymmetry is to arrange for the scalar soft terms to vanish
simultaneously at a scale $M_{c}$ much larger than the electroweak scale. This
occurs naturally in a number of scenarios, such as no-scale models, gaugino
mediation, and several models with strong conformal dynamics. Unfortunately,
the most basic version of this approach that incorporates gaugino mass
unification and zero scalar masses at the grand unification scale is not
compatible with collider and dark matter constraints. However, experimental
constraints can be satisfied if we exempt the Higgs bosons from flowing to zero
mass value at the high scale. We survey the theoretical constructions that
allow this, and investigate the collider and dark matter consequences. A
generic feature is that the sleptons are relatively light. Because of this,
these models frequently give a significant contribution to the anomalous
magnetic moment of the muon, and neutralino-slepton coannihilation can play an
important role in obtaining an acceptable dark matter relic density.
Furthermore, the light sleptons give rise to a large multiplicity of lepton
events at colliders, including a potentially suggestive clean trilepton signal
at the Tevatron, and a substantial four lepton signature at the LHC.

drive the Universe to the metastable vacuum even if it began after inflation in

take into account two new effects. First is the effect of the mass-gap of the
gauge degrees of freedom in the confining supersymmetry preserving vacua, and
second, is the effect of the back reaction of the MSSM sector on the SUSY
breaking ISS sector. It is shown that, even though the mass-gap is
parametrically smaller than the <\phi> vevs, it drastically reduces the
temperature required for the Universe to be driven to the metastable vacuum:
essentially any temperature larger than the supersymmetry breaking scale \mu is
sufficient. On the other hand we also find that any reasonable transmission of
SUSY breaking to the MSSM sector has no effect on the vacuum transitions to,
and the stability of the SUSY breaking vacuum. We conclude that for these
models the early Universe does end up in the SUSY breaking vacuum.

the failure of the conformal embedding view: whereas the ""target space"" of the

string theories spacetime, the one-dimensional source space does not describe a

background with constant five form Ramond-Ramond flux (RR plane wave). It is
argued that there exists a universal sector of string configurations
independent of the null coordinate $x^-$ such that the space-time action
evaluated at such a configuration is same in the RR plane wave and flat
background. By naturally assuming its validity for the open strings we further
argue that the D-branes extending along $x^{\pm}$ are universal in these two
backgrounds. Moreover, a universal D-brane which is BPS in flat space must be
tachyon-free in RR plane wave and a non-BPS D-brane should have a real tachyon
whose potential is universal. Given the above observation we then proceed to
describe open string theories for the non-BPS D-branes in RR plane wave. It is
suggested that the light-cone Green-Schwarz fermions on the world-sheet satisfy
certain bi-local boundary condition similar to that corresponding to flat
space. We attempt a canonical quantisation with this boundary condition which
gives rise to an open string spectrum similar to that in flat space -
containing an R and NS sectors of states. In this process we encounter certain
subtleties involving the R sector zero modes. Although the derivation of the R
sector zero mode spectrum using the open string theory has not been completely
settled, we suggest definite answer by requiring consistency with the relevant
space-time interpretation. We finally generalise the above basic features of
universality to all the exact pp-wave backgrounds with the same dilaton profile

about the UV structure are also commented. We argue that the effective higher
derivative interactions are suppressed as long as the Fourier transform of the
time-dependent coupling is UV-finite. Our result holds for scalar
configurations that are BPS but with arbitrary time-dependence. This suggests
the existence of non-renormalization theorem for such a new class of
time-dependent theories. Altogether, it implies that such a super-Yang-Mills is
scale-invariant, and that its dual bulk quantum gravity might behave regularly
near the big bang.

  The idea is to use techniques from algebraic geometry to calculate the

line bundles over Hilbert modular surfaces which vanish along these Teichmuller

general spline smoothing techniques and on the use of some tools that have been
recently developed in the context of image warping to compute smooth
diffeomorphisms. This diffeomorphic spline is defined as the solution of an
ordinary differential equation governed by an appropriate time-dependent vector
field. This solution has a closed form expression which can be computed using
classical unconstrained spline smoothing techniques. This method does not
require the use of quadratic or linear programming under inequality constraints
and has therefore a low computational cost. In a one dimensional setting
incorporating diffeomorphic constraints is equivalent to impose monotonicity.
Thus, as an illustration, it is shown that such a monotone spline can be used
to monotonize any unconstrained estimator of a regression function, and that
this monotone smoother inherits the convergence properties of the unconstrained
estimator. Some numerical experiments are proposed to illustrate its finite
sample performances, and to compare them with another monotone estimator. We
also provide a two-dimensional application on the computation of
diffeomorphisms for landmark and image matching.

subject of interest for the last three decades. Recent experimental data on

exploring moments of spin structure functions and their corresponding sum rules
(i.e. the generalized Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn, Burkhardt-Cottingham and Bjorken).
The Burkhardt-Cottingham sum rule is verified to good accuracy. The spin
structure moments data are compared with Chiral Perturbation Theory

calculations agree reasonably well with the first moment of the spin structure

approximation to describe the atomic many-particle problem in conjunction with
a nonrelativistic quantum-electrodynamic approach to treat the photon-electron

a complex absorbing potential that is derived from smooth exterior complex
scaling. The solution to the two-color (x-ray plus laser) problem is discussed

representation of the Hamiltonian. Alternative treatments with time-independent
and time-dependent non-Hermitian perturbation theories are presented that
exploit the weak interaction strength between x rays and atoms. We apply the

edge. A pronounced modification of the cross section is found in the presence

allowed, each of the successively transmitted constituents is delayed by a
subluminal time. When the thickness of the well is much smaller in comparision
with a characteristic length of the incident wave packet, the reshaped wave
packet in transmission maintains the profile of the incident wave packet. In
the case of potential-barrier tunneling that is classically forbidden, though
each of the successively transmitted constituents is delayed by a time that is
