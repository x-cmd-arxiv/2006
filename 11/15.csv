the large scale, 300 kpc long X-ray jet in PKS1127-145, a radio loud quasar at
redshift z=1.18. With this deep X-ray observation we now clearly discern the
complex X-ray jet morphology and see substructure within the knots. The X-ray
and radio jet intensity profiles are seen to be strikingly different with the
radio emission peaking strongly at the two outer knots while the X-ray emission
is strongest in the inner jet region. The jet X-ray surface brightness
gradually decreases by an order of magnitude going out from the core. The new
X-ray data contain sufficient counts to do spectral analysis of the key jet
features. The X-ray energy index of the inner jet is relatively flat with
alpha_X = 0.66 +/-0.15 and steep in the outer jet with alpha_X = 1.0 +/-0.2. We
discuss the constraints implied by the new data on the X-ray emission models
and conclude that ``one-zone'' models fail and at least a two component model
is needed to explain the jet's broad-band emission. We propose that the X-ray
emission originates in the jet proper while the bulk of the radio emission
comes from a surrounding jet sheath. We also consider intermittent jet activity
as a possible cause of the observed jet morphology.

discovery, as a member of a double neutron star system. Observations of such
binary pulsars allow the measurement of general relativistic effects, which in
turn lead to information about the orbiting objects and, in a few cases, to
tests of theories of gravity. Methods: Regular timing observations have been
carried out with three of the largest European radio telescopes involved in
pulsar research. The prospects of continued observations were studied with
simulated timing data. Pulse scattering times were measured using dedicated
observations at 1.4 GHz and at 3.1 GHz, and the corresponding spectral index
has also been determined. The possibility of detecting the yet unseen companion
as a radio pulsar was also investigated. A study of the natal kick received by
the younger neutron star at birth was performed. Results: We present an up to
date and improved timing solution for the binary pulsar PSR J1811-1736. One
post-Keplerian parameter, the relativistic periastron advance, is measured and
leads to the determination of the total mass of this binary system. The pulse
profile at 1.4 GHz is heavily broadened by interstellar scattering, limiting
the timing precision achievable at this frequency and the measurability of
other post-keplerian parameters. Interstellar scattering is unlikely to be the
reason for the continued failure to detect radio pulsations from the companion
of PSR J1811-1736. The probability distribution that we derive for the
amplitude of the kick imparted on the companion neutron star at its birth
indicates that the kick has been of low amplitude.

the Cartwheel with XMM-Newton in two epochs, six months apart. After having
been at its brightest for at least 4 years, the source has dimmed by at least a

shown to yield a spectral component contributing in the far UV band, and would
then be currently unobservable. On the contrary, the bulk Comptonization of
broad line photons may yield a significant feature in the soft X-ray band. Such
a feature is time-dependent and transient, and dominates over the non thermal

puzzling X-ray activity that in some cases continues for hours after the burst.
It is difficult to reconcile such time scales with the viscous time scales that
an accretion disk can plausibly provide. Here I discuss the accretion activity
expected from the material that is launched into eccentric, but gravitationally
bound orbits during a compact binary merger coalescence. From a simple
analytical model the time scales and accretion luminosities that result from
fallback in the aftermath of a compact binary merger are derived. For the
considered mass range, double neutron star binaries are relatively homogeneous
in their fallback luminosities. Neutron star black hole systems show a larger
spread in their fallback behaviour. While the model is too simple to make
predictions about the detailed time structure of the fallback, it makes
reasonable predictions about the gross properties of the fallback. About one
hour after the coalescence the fallback accretion luminosity can still be as
large as $\sim 10^{45}$ erg/s, a fraction of which will be transformed into
X-rays. Large-scale amplitude variations in the X-ray luminosities can
plausibly be caused by gravitational fragmentation, which for the
high-eccentricity fallback should occur more easily than in an accretion disk.

relevant physics step by step. In this paper we present a first set of

three-dimensional simulations, together with two-dimensional test cases. The
simulations follow the evolution of radio cavities, modeled as bubbles filled

cooling. We find that the bubble rise retards the development of a cooling flow
by inducing motions in the ICM which repeatedly displace the material in the
core. Even bubbles initially set significantly far from the cluster center
affect the cooling flow, although much later than the beginning of the
simulation. The effect is, however, modest: the cooling time is increased by at
most only 25%. As expected, the overall evolution of pure hydrodynamic bubbles
is at odds with observations, showing that some additional physics has to be
considered in order to match the data.

HD100546 (Lisse et al. 2007). Lacking in carbonaceous and ferrous materials but
including small icy grains, the composition of the HD 69830 dust resembles that
of a disrupted P or D-type asteroid. The amount of mass responsible for the
observed emission is the equivalent of a 30 km radius, 2500 kg m-3 sphere,
while the radiative temperature of the dust implies that the bulk of the
observed material is at ~1.0 AU from the central source, coincident with the
2:1 and 5:2 mean motion resonances of the outermost of 3 Neptune-sized planets
detected by Lovis et al. (2006). In our solar system, P and D-type asteroids
are both large and numerous in the outer main belt and near Jupiter (e.g. the
Hildas and Trojans) and have undergone major disruptive events to produce
debris disk-like structures (c.f. the Karin and Veritas families 5-8 Myrs ago).
The short-lived nature of the small and icy dust implies that the disruption
occurred within the last year, or that replenishment due to ongoing collisional
fragmentation is occurring.

function of redshift and optical luminosity. The sample contains more than
30,000 objects and spans a redshift range of 0<z<5 and a luminosity range of
-30<M_i<-22. We use both the radio-to-optical flux ratio (R parameter) and
radio luminosity to define radio-loud quasars. After breaking the correlation
between redshift and luminosity due to the flux-limited nature of the sample,
we find that the RLF of quasars decreases with increasing redshift and
decreasing luminosity. The relation can be described in the form of
log(RLF/(1-RLF)) = b_0 + b_z log(1+z) + b_M (M_{2500}+26), where M_{2500} is
the absolute magnitude at rest-frame 2500A, and b_z, b_M<0. When using R>10 to
define radio-loud quasars, we find that b_0=-0.132+/-0.116, b_z=-2.052+/-0.261,
and b_M=-0.183+/-0.025. The RLF at z=0.5 declines from 24.3% to 5.6% as
luminosity decreases from M_{2500}=-26 to M_{2500}=-22, and the RLF at
M_{2500}=-26 declines from 24.3% to 4.1% as redshift increases from 0.5 to 3,
suggesting that the RLF is a strong function of both redshift and luminosity.
We also examine the impact of flux-related selection effects on the RLF
determination using a series of tests, and find that the dependence of the RLF
on redshift and luminosity is highly likely to be physical, and the selection
effects we considered are not responsible for the dependence.

emphasize that the statement that halo accretion histories are independent of
halo environments is a simplifying assumption, rather than a prediction of the

correlated walks and I show that excursion set theory makes a qualitatively
simple and general prediction for the relation between halo accretion histories
and halo environments: regions of high density preferentially contain
late-forming halos and conversely for regions of low density. I conclude with a
brief discussion of this prediction in the context of recent numerical studies

that penetrates the color-flavor locked phase produces an instability for field
values larger than the charged gluons' Meissner mass. As a consequence, the
ground state is restructured forming a vortex state characterized by the
condensation of charged gluons and the creation of magnetic flux tubes. In the
vortex state the magnetic field outside the flux tubes is equal to the applied
one, while inside the tubes its strength increases by an amount that depends on
the amplitude of the gluon condensate. This paramagnetic behavior of the color
superconductor can be relevant for the physics of compact stars.

-1.3 to +0.3, and variable abundance ratios. We develop a method to estimate
mean ages and abundances of Fe, C, N, Mg, and Ca that explores the sensitivity
of the various indices to those parameters. When applied to high-S/N Galactic
cluster data, the models match the clusters' elemental abundances and ages with
high precision. Analyzing stacked SDSS spectra of early-type galaxies brighter
than Lstar, we find mean luminosity-weighted ages of the order of ~ 8 Gyr and
iron abundances slightly below solar. Abundance ratios, [X/Fe], are higher than
solar, and correlate positively with galaxy luminosity. Nitrogen is the element
whose abundance correlates the most strongly with luminosity, which seems to
indicate secondary enrichment. This result may impose a lower limit of 50-200
Myr to the time-scale of star formation in early-type galaxies. Unlike in the
case of clusters, in galaxies bluer Balmer lines yield younger ages than Hbeta.
This age discrepancy is stronger for lower luminosity galaxies. We examine four
scenarios to explain this trend. The most likely is the presence of small
amounts of a young/intermediate-age SP component. Two-component models provide
a better match to the data when the mass fraction of the young component is a
few %. This result implies that star formation has been extended in early-type
galaxies, and more so in less massive galaxies, lending support to the
``downsizing'' scenario. It also implies that SP synthesis models are capable
of constraining not only the mean ages of SPs in galaxies, but also their age
spread.

sources. Both $r_{\rm max}$ and $Q_{\rm max}$ in the sample of sources, and the
rms amplitude and coherence of the kHz QPOs in individual sources show a
similar behaviour with hardness. This similarity argues against the
interpretation that the drop of coherence and rms amplitude of the lower kHz
QPO at high QPO frequencies in individual sources is a signature of the
innermost stable circular orbit around a neutron star.

constraints on possible emission mechanisms.Imaging data were acquired with the
adaptive optics assisted NIR instrument NACO and the MIR instrument VISIR at

of spatial resolution and sensitivity. An extended ridge of emission is found
to be present in the immediate vicinity of Sgr A* and thus renders any
detection of a point source difficult. No MIR point source related to Sgr A*
was detected during the observations. We derive a tight upper limit of 22+-4
mJy (dereddened) on any possible point source present during the observations
in the night of 4/5 June 2006. The absence of a flare in simultaneous
observations at 2.2 mum and the low limits on any possible variability in the
MIR suggest strongly that Sgr A* was in a quasi-quiescent state during this
night. During the night from 5 to 6 June 2006, Sgr A* was found to be variable
on a low level at 3.8 mum. No point source at 8.6 mum was detected during the
simultaneous MIR observations. Due to the poorer atmospheric conditions a
higher upper limit of 60+-30mJy was found for Sgr A* at 8.6 mum during the
second night. The observations are consistent with theoretical predictions. If
the published models are correct, the observations demonstrate successfully
that a 8.6 mum counterpart of Sgr A* can be easily detected in its flaring
state. Spectral indices derived from simultaneous observations of flaring
emission from Sgr A* at NIR and MIR wavelengths will enable us to distinguish
between different kinds of flare models.

years. Light curves of all observations show an erratic behaviour with sudden
increases in the source emission on timescales variable from hundreds to
thousands of seconds. There are no indications of changes in the source
spectral hardness, with the possible exception of the RXTE pointed observation.
Timing analysis does not reveal the presence of coherent pulsations or
periodicities either in the pointed observations in the range from 2 ms to 2000
s or in the long-term RXTE ASM light curve on timescales from days to years.
The 0.2-150 keV spectrum, obtained with BeppoSAX, is the widest for this source
available to date in terms of spectral coverage and is well described by a
model consisting of a lower-energy thermal component (hot diffuse gas) plus a
higher-energy (Comptonization) emission, with the latter modified by a
partially-covering cold absorber plus a warm (ionized) absorber. A blackbody
modelization of our BeppoSAX low-energy data is ruled out. The presence of a
complex absorber local to the source is also supported by the 0.1-2 keV ROSAT
spectrum. RXTE, EXOSAT and Swift X-ray spectroscopy is consistent with the
above results, but indicates variations in the density and the ionization of
the local absorber. A 6.5 keV emission line is possibly detected in the
BeppoSAX and RXTE spectra. All this information suggests that the scenario that

imposed toroidal magnetic fields. The inner and outer cylinders can be either
insulating or conducting; the inner one rotates, the outer one is stationary.
The magnetic Prandtl number can be as small as 10-5, approaching realistic
liquid-metal values. The magnetic field destabilizes the flow, except for
radial profiles of B$_\phi$(R) close to the current-free solution. The profile
with B$_{in}$=B$_{out}$ (the most uniform field) is considered in detail. For
weak fields the TC-flow is stabilized, until for moderately strong fields the
m=1 azimuthal mode dramatically destabilizes the flow again. There is thus a
maximum value for the critical Reynolds number. For sufficiently strong fields
(as measured by the Hartmann number) the toroidal field is always unstable,
even for Re=0.
  The electric currents needed to generate the required toroidal fields in
laboratory experiments are a few kA if liquid sodium is used, somewhat more if
gallium is used. Weaker currents are needed for wider gaps, so a wide-gap
apparatus could succeed even with gallium. The critical Reynolds numbers are
only somewhat larger than the nonmagnetic values, so such an experiment would
require only modest rotation rates.

transitions of HCOOH, HCOOCH3, CH3OCH3, CH3CN, and C2H5CN in a sample of

Those around black holes convert 5 -- 40 per cent of rest-mass energy to
radiation. Like water circling a drain, inflowing mass must lose angular
momentum, presumably by vigorous turbulence in disks, which are essentially
inviscid. The origin of the turbulence is unclear. Hot disks of electrically
conducting plasma can become turbulent by way of the linear magnetorotational
instability. Cool disks, such as the planet-forming disks of protostars, may be
too poorly ionized for the magnetorotational instability to occur, hence
essentially unmagnetized and linearly stable. Nonlinear hydrodynamic
instability often occurs in linearly stable flows (for example, pipe flows) at
sufficiently large Reynolds numbers. Although planet-forming disks have extreme
Reynolds numbers, Keplerian rotation enhances their linear hydrodynamic
stability, so the question of whether they can be turbulent and thereby
transport angular momentum effectively is controversial. Here we report a
laboratory experiment, demonstrating that non-magnetic quasi-Keplerian flows at
Reynolds numbers up to millions are essentially steady. Scaled to accretion
disks, rates of angular momentum transport lie far below astrophysical
requirements. By ruling out purely hydrodynamic turbulence, our results
indirectly support the magnetorotational instability as the likely cause of
turbulence, even in cool disks.

relative to the Galactic plane, $b=+45^{o}$ and $b=-45^{o}$. The large size of
each field, 60 deg$^{2}$, and the faint limiting apparent magnitude, g=22, give
us the chance to determine reliable parameters for three components, thin and
thick discs and halo, in the north and south hemispheres of the Galaxy, except
the scalelengths for two discs which are adopted from Juri\'c et al. (2005).
Metallicities were evaluated by a recent calibration for SDSS, and absolute
magnitudes of stars with $4<M(g)\leq8$ were derived as a function of (g-r)
colour and metallicity. Conspicuous differences could not be detected between
the corresponding Galactic model parameters for the thin disc of north and
south fields, and our results are consistent with the ones in the literature.
The same case is valid for the halo, especially the axis ratios for two fields
are exactly equal, $\kappa=0.45$. The metallicity distribution for unevolved G
type stars with $5<M(g)\leq6$ shows three substructures relative to the
distance from the Galactic plane: for $z^{*}<3$ kpc, the metallicity gradient
for two fields is $d[M/H]/dz \sim -0.20(\pm0.02)$ dex kpc$^{-1}$, consistent
with the formation scenario of the thin disc. For $5<z^{*}<10$ kpc, $d[M/H]/dz
\sim -0.03(\pm0.001)$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ for two fields, confirming that the
metallicity gradient for the halo component is close to zero. When we combine

different modes, which are documented in hard and soft spectral states,
commonly attributed to an advection-dominated flow (ADAF) inside a truncated
disk and standard disk accretion, respectively.
  At the times of spectral transition an intermediate state is observed, for
which the accretion flow pattern is still unclear.
  Aims: We analyze the geometry of the accretion flow when the mass flow rate
in the disk decreases (soft/hard transition) and evaporation of gas into the
coronal flow leads to disk truncation.
  Methods: We evaluate the physics of an advection-dominated flow affected by
thermal conduction to a cool accretion disk underneath.
  We find re-condensation of gas from the ADAF into the underlying inner disk
at distances from the black hole and at rates, that depend on the properties of
the hot ADAF and vary with the mass accretion rate. This sustains an inner disk
for longer than a viscous decay time after the spectral transition occurred, in
accordance with the spectra that indicate cool gas in the neighborhood of the
accreting black hole. The model allows us to understand why Cyg X-1 does not
show hysteresis in the spectral state transition luminosity that is commonly
observed for X-ray transient sources.

the spin orbit interaction, and which are different from conventional
insulators. This distinction is characterized by Z_2 topological invariants,
which characterize the groundstate. In two dimensions there is a single Z_2
invariant which distinguishes the ordinary insulator from the quantum spin Hall
phase. In three dimensions there are four Z_2 invariants, which distinguish the
ordinary insulator from ""weak"" and ""strong"" topological insulators. These
phases are characterized by the presence of gapless surface (or edge) states.
In the 2D quantum spin Hall phase and the 3D strong topological insulator these
states are robust and are insensitive to weak disorder and interactions. In
this paper we show that the presence of inversion symmetry greatly simplifies
the problem of evaluating the Z_2 invariants. We show that the invariants can
be determined from the knowledge of the parity of the occupied Bloch
wavefunctions at the time reversal invariant points in the Brillouin zone.
Using this approach, we predict a number of specific materials are strong
topological insulators, including the semiconducting alloy Bi_{1-x} Sb_x as
well as \alpha-Sn and HgTe under uniaxial strain. This paper also includes an
expanded discussion of our formulation of the topological insulators in both
two and three dimensions, as well as implications for experiments.

oscillations as a function of detector voltage and interaction time. This is a
unique consequence of the non-Gaussian properties of the shot noise, and only
occurs in the strong coupling regime, when the phase contributed by a single
electron exceeds pi. The resulting formula reproduces the recent surprising
experimental observations reported in [I. Neder et al., cond-mat/0610634], and
indicates a general explanation for similar visibility oscillations observed
earlier in the Mach-Zehnder interferometer at large bias voltage. We explore in

impurities (dye) in a compressible nematic solvent. We use a fluctuating
hydrodynamic description when the system is in fully thermodynamic equilibrium
and in a non-equilibrium steady state ($NESS$) induced by a dye-concentration
gradient. We find that the equilibrium spectrum is symmetric (Lorentzian) with
respect to the frequency shifts, but anisotropic through its explicit
dependence on the ratio of the parallel and normal diffusion coefficients of
the dye. The values of these coefficients were taken from experimental
measurements of diffusion of methylred and nitrozo di-methyl aniline in a
$MBBA$ solvent. We find that the compressibility of the solvent increases the
maximum and the width at half height of the Rayleigh peak, with respect to the
incompressible case \cite{suspension1}. This increase varies between 12% and
25%, respectively, when the impurities concentrations is the range of 1% - 5%.
The $NESS$ induces a coupling between the concentration fluctuations of the dye
and the hydrodynamic fluctuations of the solvent. In this case the
compressibility effects may increase the maximum and the width of the central
peak up to $% 25%$, for values of the concentration gradient four orders of
magnitude smaller than those considered in the incompressible case. For the
nonequilibrium Brillouin part of the spectrum we find that the intensities of
the sound propagation modes are unequal and one of the peaks shrinks in the
same amount as the other increases. This asymmetry increases linearly with the
magnitude of the solute concentration gradient. The maximum difference between
the nonequilibrium and equilibrium contributions to the Brillouin spectrum for
various values of the external gradient is also estimated.

perihelion advances which amount to tens-hundreds of arcseconds per century for
the outer planets. As for other previously proposed non-conventional
gravitational explanations of the Pioneer anomaly, the answer of the latest
observational determinations of the residual perihelion rates by RAS IAA is
neatly and unambiguously negative. The presence of another possible candidate
to explain the Pioneer anomaly, i.e. the extra-potential \delta\Phi_N, linear
in distance, from the first sector of the Jaekel and Reynaud model, is ruled
out not only by the residuals of the optical data of the outer planets
processed with the recent RAS IAA EPM2004 ephemerides but also by those
produced with other, older dynamical theories like, e.g., the well known NASA
JPL DE200.

the supernova parameters (the average energies and luminosities) can be
separated from the unknown neutrino oscillation parameters ($\theta_{13}$ and
the neutrino mass hierarchy). Three types of experiments, all in the 100-kton
class, are compared. These are: a 540 kton water-Cherenkov detector, a 100 kton
liquid Argon detector and a 50 kton scintillator detector. We demonstrate that
practically all of these proposed detectors have the possibility to determine
the hierarchy of the neutrino masses if the angle $\theta_{13}$ is sufficiently
large ($\sin^2(\theta_{13}) > 10^{-4}$) and the hierarchy of the average
energies is larger than about 20%. They can at the same time determine some of
the supernova parameters well. The average energy of the $\nu_\mu$ and
$\nu_\tau$ species can be determined within 5% uncertainty in most of the
parameter space suggested by supernova simulations. The detection of several
separable channels measuring different combinations of charged current and
neutral current processes is crucial for determining the value of $\theta_{13}$

can be determined rather well even if only the main charged current detection
channel is available.

limit. In this limit we solve the theory exactly and show that the action of
the strongly coupled boundary theory scales as $\ln(1+\alpha)/ (1+\alpha)^2$.
This result is remarkably close to the $-1/(1+\alpha)^2$ scaling of the
Einstein gravity action for AdS-Taub-NUT space. These results explain the
numerical agreement presented in hep-th/0503238, and the soft logarithmic
departure is interpreted as a prediction for the contribution due to higher

corrected effective action we argue that the Bekenstein-Hawking-Wald entropy of

entropy of the same system up to an overall normalization constant. While the
normalization constant cannot be determined by the symmetry principles alone,
it can be related to a similar normalization constant that appears in the
expression for small black holes without angular momentum in one less
dimension. Thus agreement between statistical and macroscopic entropy of
(d-1)-dimensional non-rotating elementary string states would imply a similar
agreement for a d-dimensional elementary string state with spin. Our analysis
also determines the structure of the near horizon geometry and provides us with
a geometric derivation of the Regge bound. These studies give further evidence
that a ring-like horizon is formed when large angular momentum is added to a
small black hole.

completely non-unitary contractions with rank one defect operators acting on
some Hilbert space of dimension $N\leq\infty$. This model complements nicely
the well-known models of Liv$\rm{\check{s}}$ic and Sz.-Nagy--Foias. We show
that each such an operator is unitarily equivalent to some truncated CMV matrix
obtained from the ``full'' CMV matrix by deleting the first row and the first
column, and acting in $\ell^2$ ($\dC^N$). This result can be viewed as a
nonunitary version of the famous characterization of unitary operators with a
simple spectrum due to Cantero, Moral and Vel\'azquez. It is shown that another
functional model for contractions with rank one defect operators takes the form
of the compression $f(\zeta)\to P_\cK (\zeta f(\zeta))$ on the Hilbert space
$L^2(\dT,d\mu)$ with a probability measure $\mu$ onto the subspace
$\cK=L^2(\dT,d\mu)\ominus \dC$. We develop direct and inverse spectral analysis
for finite and semi-infinite truncated CMV matrices. In particular, we study
the problem of reconstruction of such matrices from their spectrum or the mixed
spectral data involving Schur parameters. The uniqueness theorem for recovered
truncated CMV matrix from the given mixed spectral data is established. In this
part the paper is closely related to the results of Hochstadt and
Gesztesy--Simon obtained for finite self-adjoint Jacobi matrices.

$w(B) := \sum_{a \in B} w(a)$ among all branchings with the maximum ardinality

one node of any color), then there exists an $O(\min(n^2, m \log n))$ method,

the last decade. For instance, the distribution of the rate of stock price
variation and of personal assets show the power law. While these results reveal
the striking scale invariance of financial markets, the behaviour of price in
real economy is less known in spite of its extreme importance. As an example of
markets in real economy, here we take up the price of precious stones which
increases with size while the amount of their production rapidly decreases with
size. We show for the first time that the price of natural precious stones
(quartz crystal ball, gemstones such as diamond, emerald, and sapphire) as a
function of weight obeys the power law. This indicates that the price is
determined by the same evaluation measure for different sizes. Our results
demonstrate that not only the distribution of an economical observable but also
the price itself obeys the power law. We anticipate our findings to be a
starting point for the quantitative study of scale invariance in real economy.
While the Black--Sholes model provided the framework for optimal pricing in
financial markets, our method of analysis prvides a new framework that
characterizes the market in real economy.

electrostatic potential. Important aspects of Debye screening concern, in
particular, the investigation of non-linear charge screening effects taking
place in strongly-coupled plasmas, that imply a reduction of the effective
charge characterizing the Debye-H\""{u}ckel potential. These effects are
particularly relevant in dusty plasmas which are characterized by high-Z
particles. The investigation of the effective interactions of these particles
has attracted interest in recent years especially for numerical simulations. In
this work we intend to analyze the consistency of the traditional mathematical
model for the Debye screening. In particular, we intend to prove that the 3D
Poisson equation involved in the DH model does not admit strong solutions. For
this purpose a modified model is proposed which takes into account the effect
of local plasma sheath (i.e., the local domain near test particles where the
plasma must be considered discrete). Basic consequences of the model are
discussed, which concern the asymptotic properties of the solutions determined
both for weakly and strongly coupled plasmas. As an application the charge
screening effect in strongly coupled plasmas is investigated and an explicit
expression of the effective charge for the asymptotic DH potential is
determined.

can be captured by the rigid base-pair model, whose strains are the relative
position and orientation of adjacent base-pairs. Corresponding elastic
potentials have been obtained from all-atom MD simulation and from
high-resolution structural data. On the scale of a hundred nm, DNA is
successfully described by a continuous worm-like chain model with homogeneous
elastic properties characterized by a set of four elastic constants, which have
been directly measured in single-molecule experiments. We present here a theory
that links these experiments on different scales, by systematically
coarse-graining the rigid base-pair model for random sequence DNA to an
effective worm-like chain description. The average helical geometry of the
molecule is exactly taken into account in our approach. We find that the
available microscopic parameters sets predict qualitatively similar mesoscopic
parameters. The thermal bending and twisting persistence lengths computed from
MD data are 42 and 48 nm, respectively. The static persistence lengths are
generally much higher, in agreement with cyclization experiments. All
microscopic parameter sets predict negative twist-stretch coupling. The
variability and anisotropy of bending stiffness in short random chains lead to
non-Gaussian bend angle distributions, but become unimportant after two helical
turns.

  independently by Yoran and Short (quant-ph/0611241)",,,,"quant-ph",,"  In this note we describe a simple and intriguing observation: the quantum
Fourier transform (QFT) over $Z_q$, which is considered the most ``quantum''
part of Shor's algorithm, can in fact be simulated efficiently by classical
computers.
  More precisely, we observe that the QFT can be performed by a circuit of
poly-logarithmic path-width, if the circuit is allowed to apply not only
unitary gates but also general linear gates. Recalling the results of Markov
and Shi [MaSh] and Jozsa [Jo] which provided classical simulations of such
circuits in time exponential in the tree-width, this implies the result stated
in the title.
  Classical simulations of the FFT are of course meaningless when applied to
classical input strings on which their result is already known; Our observation
might be interesting only in the context in which the QFT is used as a
subroutine and applied to more interesting superpositions. We discuss the
reasons why this idea seems to fail to provide an efficient classical
simulation of the entire factoring algorithm.
  In the course of proving our observation, we provide two alternative proofs
of the results of [MaSh,Jo] which we use. One proof is very similar in spirit
to that of [MaSh] but is more visual, and is based on a graph parameter which
we call the ``bubble width'', tightly related to the path- and tree-width. The
other proof is based on connections to the Jones polynomial; It is very short,
if one is willing to rely on several known results.

believed to occur. Correlations, and not entanglement, have been identified as
a necessary ingredient for mixed-state quantum computation speedups. Here we
show that correlations, as measured through the operator Schmidt rank, are
indeed present in large amounts in the DQC1 circuit. This provides evidence for
the preclusion of efficient classical simulation of DQC1 by means of a whole
class of classical simulation algorithms, thereby reinforcing the conjecture
that DQC1 leads to a genuine quantum computational speedup.
