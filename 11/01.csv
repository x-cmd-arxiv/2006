(R ~1000) optical spectroscopy, and distances using optical photometry combined
with 2MASS near-infrared photometry. For objects within 25 pc (Catalogue of
Nearby Stars, and NStars Database horizons), we determine a trigonometric
parallax via CTIOPI (Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory Parallax

within 25 pc, a volume that contains 107 WDs with trigonometric parallaxes.
Interesting objects include two that are likely double degenerates including
one with a magnetic component, one that is a cool (T$_{eff}$ ~5000 K) likely
mixed atmosphere WD with deficient flux at near-infrared wavelengths, and two
that are metal-rich. Observations are underway via the Hubble Space Telescope

other previously known WDs) for dynamical mass determinations. All ground-based
observations are obtained as part of the SMARTS (Small and Moderate Aperture

theory and to determine the age and helium content of stars. We study the
eclipsing double-lined spectroscopic binary system RS Cha, for which we have
accurate observations of the parameters of both stars (masses, radii,
luminosities, effective temperatures and metallicity). Aims: We have calculated
several sets of stellar models for the components of the RS Cha system, with
the aim of reproducing simultaneously the available observational constraints
and to estimate the age and initial helium abundance of the system. Methods:
Using the CESAM stellar evolution code, we model both components starting from
the initial mass and metallicity and adjusting the input parameters and physics
in order to satisfy the observational constraints. Results: We find that the
observations cannot be reproduced if we assume that the abundance ratios are
solar but they are satisfied if carbon and nitrogen are depleted in the RS Cha
system with respect to the Sun. This is in accordance with the abundances
observed in other young stars. The RS Cha system is in an evolutionary stage at
the end of the PMS phase where models are not strongly sensitive to various
physical uncertainties. However we show that the oscillations of these two
stars, which have been detected, would be able to discriminate between
different options in the physical description of this evolutionary phase.

numerically, including magnetic fields. The magnetic tension force is expected
to work against the main driver of the NTSI -- namely transverse momentum
transport. However, depending on the field strength and orientation, the
instability may grow. For fields aligned with the inflow, we find that the NTSI
is suppressed only when the Alfv\'en speed surpasses the (supersonic)
velocities generated along the collision interface. Even for fields
perpendicular to the inflow, which are the most effective at preventing the
NTSI from developing, internal structures form within the expanding slab
interface, probably leading to fragmentation in the presence of self-gravity or
thermal instabilities. High Reynolds numbers result in local turbulence within
the perturbed slab, which in turn triggers reconnection and dissipation of the
excess magnetic flux. We find that when the magnetic field is initially aligned
with the flow, there exists a (weak) correlation between field strength and gas
density. However, for transverse fields, this correlation essentially vanishes.
In light of these results, our general conclusion is that instabilities are
unlikely to be erased unless the magnetic energy in clouds is much larger than
the turbulent energy. Finally, while our study is motivated by the scenario of
molecular cloud formation in colliding flows, our results span a larger range
of applicability, from supernovae shells to colliding stellar winds.

(8.0 um) and MIPS imaging shows evidence of a bow shock associated with the

nebular material. The ratio of emission at 24 to 70 um is higher in the

for elevated dust temperatures (T_d > 90 K) in the shock region. The nebular
imaging reveals that the morphology is band dependent, with varying
contributions from aromatic emission features, H2, and dust emission. Nebular
spectroscopy is used to quantify these contributions, showing several aromatic
emission bands between 6-14 um, the S(5), S(3), S(2), and S(1) pure rotational

interactions (direct and inverse beta decays), which proceed on relatively long
time scales. If the density of a matter element is perturbed, it will relax to
the new chemical equilibrium through non-equilibrium reactions, which produce
entropy that is partly released through neutrino emission, while a similar
fraction heats the matter and is eventually radiated as thermal photons. We
examined two possible mechanisms causing such density perturbations: 1) the
reduction in centrifugal force caused by spin-down (particularly in millisecond
pulsars), leading to ""rotochemical heating"", and 2) a hypothetical
time-variation of the gravitational constant, as predicted by some theories of
gravity and current cosmological models, leading to ""gravitochemical heating"".
If only slow weak interactions are allowed in the neutron star (modified Urca
reactions, with or without Cooper pairing), rotochemical heating can account
for the observed ultraviolet emission from the closest millisecond pulsar, PSR
J0437-4715, which also provides a constraint on |dG/dt| of the same order as
the best available in the literature.

order 100 are obtained relative to ordinary Monte Carlo radiative transfer. In
practical applications, speed-up factors of order ten (Mazzali et al. 2001) and
perhaps more are possible. The speed-up factor is likely to be significantly
application-dependent and there is a trade-off between speed-up and accuracy.
This paper and past work (Mazzali et al. 2001) suggest that giant-steps error
can probably be kept to a few percent by using sufficiently large
boundary-layer optical depths while still maintaining large speed-up factors.
Thus, giant steps can be characterized as a moderate accuracy radiative
transfer technique.

million supernovae lightcurves without spectra. The multi-band lightcurves for
each candidate will provide a probability of being Ia (pure) but the full
sample will be significantly contaminated with other types of supernovae and
transients. Given a sample of N supernovae with mean probability, P, of being
Ia, BEAMS delivers parameter constraints equal to NP
spectroscopically-confirmed SNIa. In addition BEAMS can be simultaneously used
to tease apart different families of data and to recover properties of the
underlying distributions of those families (e.g. the Type Ibc and II
distributions). Hence BEAMS provides a unified classification and parameter
estimation methodology which may be useful in a diverse range of problems such
as photometric redshift estimation or, indeed, any parameter estimation problem

equation of state and radiative opacities in the atmosphere, which are major

both the radiation spectrum and the thermal luminosity of a neutron star can be

Upstream of the shock, these waves make electrons lag behind ions so that a
longitudinal electric field arises and the electrons are accelerated up to the
ion kinetic energy. Then thermalization at the shock front results in a plasma
with equal temperatures of electrons and ions. Downstream of the shock, the
amplitude of the maser-generated wave may exceed the strength of the
shock-compressed background magnetic field. In this case the shock-accelerated
particles radiate via nonlinear Compton scattering rather than via a
synchrotron mechanism. The spectrum of the radiation differs, in the
low-frequency band, from that of the synchrotron radiation, providing possible

in good agreement with recent high-quality observations of cool core clusters,
suggesting that the simulation grossly follows the processes that structure the
intracluster medium (ICM) in these objects. Cool cores are a ubiquitous
phenomenon in the simulation at low and high redshift, regardless of a
cluster's dynamical state. This is at odds with the observations and so
suggests there is still a heating mechanism missing from the simulation. Using
a simple, observable measure of the concentration of the ICM, which correlates
with the apparent mass deposition rate in the cluster core, we find a large
dispersion within regular clusters at low redshift, but this diminishes at
higher redshift, where strong ""cooling-flow"" systems are absent in our
simulation. Consequently, our results predict that the normalisation and
scatter of the luminosity-temperature relation should decrease with redshift;
if such behaviour turns out to be a correct representation of X-ray cluster
evolution, it will have significant consequences for the number of clusters

transfer modeling of the X-ray reflection due to emission from magnetic flares
close to the marginally stable orbit. The hard X-ray primary radiation coming
from the flare source illuminates the accretion disk. A Compton
reflection/reprocessed component coming from the disk surface is computed for
different emission directions. We assume that the density structure remains
adjusted to the hydrostatic equilibrium without external illumination because
the flare duration is only a quarter-orbit. The model takes into account the
variations of the incident radiation across the hot spot underneath the flare
source. The integrated spectrum seen by a distant observer is computed for
flares at different orbital phases close to the marginally stable orbit of a

calculations include relativistic and Doppler corrections of the spectra using
a ray tracing technique. We explore the practical possibilities to map out the

greatly enhanced irradiation by cosmic rays produced at the shocked interface
between the ejecta and the molecular gas. Over the past decade, broad-band
observations have provided important clues about these relativistic particles
and indicate that they may dominate over the locally observed cosmic-ray
population by a significant amount. In this paper, we estimate the enhancement
and find that the cosmic ray energy density can be up to $\sim$1000 times
larger in the molecular cloud than in the field. This enhancement can last for
a few Myr and leads to a corresponding increase in the ionization fraction,
which has important consequences for star formation. Ionization fractions in]
molecular cloud cores determine, in part, the rate of ambipolar diffusion, an
important process in core formation and pre-collapse evolution. Ionization
fractions in newly formed circumstellar disks affect the magneto-rotational
instability mechanism, which in turn affects the rate of disk accretion. As
estimated here, the increased ionization acts to increase the ambipolar
diffusion time by a factor of $\sim30$ and thereby suppresses star formation.
In contrast, the increased ionization fraction reduces the sizes of dead zones
in accretion disks (by up to an order of magnitude) and thus increases disk
accretion rates (by a comparable factor).

interpret the spectra using optically thin thermal models with variable
abundances, together with an absorption column density. For BP Tau and AB Aur
we derive electron densities from the O VII triplets. Using the O VII/O VIII
count ratios as a diagnostic for cool plasma, we find that CTTS display a soft
excess (with equivalent electron temperatures of ~ 2.5-3 MK) when compared with
WTTS or zero-age main-sequence stars. Although the O VII triplet in BP Tau is
consistent with a high electron density (3.4 x 10^11 cm^-3), we find a low
density for the accreting Herbig star AB Aur (n_e < 10^10 cm^-3). The element
abundances of accreting and non-accreting stars are similar. The Ne abundance
is found to be high (4-6 times the Fe abundance) in all K and M-type stars. In
contrast, for the three G-type stars (SU Aur, HD 283572, and HP Tau/G2), we
find an enhanced Fe abundance (0.4-0.8 times solar photospheric values)

high-resolution studies of T Tauri stars, we find a soft excess in all
accreting stars, but in none of the non-accretors. On the other hand, high
electron density and high Ne/Fe abundance ratios do not seem to be present in

Both problems imply a possible underestimation of the absorption toward GRO

  We also discuss the main issue concerning the absolute magnitude of the
secondary star in our own maximum-distance method, that has been used on GRO

microquasar are not definitive, and that the mean properties of the secondary
star is not so much different from that of a normal single star of same

associated with the open cluster NGC 6242, we rise the question: which
black-hole is the closest to the Sun? In that context, we quickly discuss the
situation of the microquasar 1A 0620-00, by addressing the specific point of
its 30-years-old extinction value.

the surface properties of the stars, based on the cross-correlation function
bisector, and that is now accessible thanks to the advent of a high-resolution
echelle spectrograph called CRIRES at the VLT. We quickly discuss the strengths

which the total resistance was constructed by taking account of the effects
between a d-wave superconductor and a diffusive normal metal (DN) at a junction

predicted by Catalan (Appl. Phys. Lett. 88, 102902 (2006)). Since the
magnetodielectric effect does not occur due to a coupling of polarization and
magnetization as expected in magnetoferroelectrics, we call it improper
magnetodielectric effect. Below 175 K the magnetodielectric effect is by
several orders of magnitude lower due to the decreased conductivity. Several
phonons exhibit gradual softening with increasing temperature, which explains
the previously observed high-frequency permittivity increase on heating. The
observed non-complete phonon softening seems to be the consequence of the
first-order nature of the ferroelectric transition.

and compared with single crystals. In general, the permittivity in ceramics and
thin films is markedly reduced compared to the single crystals mainly because
of low-permittivity grain boundaries - dead layers - (sometimes also
nano-cracks) present in the samples. In SrTiO3 and BaTiO3, this dielectric
reduction is fully explained by stiffening of the soft mode frequency. In most
other ferroelectrics, the soft mode accounts only partly for such a
permittivity reduction, since the transition is only partially driven by the
phonon mode softening. In these cases, additional relaxational dispersion below
the optical phonon range (central mode) accounts for the main part of the
dielectric anomaly near Tc. Influence of nano-cracks on reduced permittivity
near Tc and related stiffening of the central mode is manifested in the
antiferroelectric PbZrO3 ceramics.

rate/distortion function R_{X|Y}, assuming the side information Y is available
at the encoder. In this paper we construct a structured class of asymptotically
optimal quantizers for this problem: under the assumption of high correlation
between source X and side information Y, we show there exist quantizers within
our class whose performance comes arbitrarily close to Wyner's bound. As an
application illustrating the relevance of the high-correlation asymptotics, we
also explore the use of these quantizers in the context of a problem of data
compression for sensor networks, in a setup involving a large number of devices
collecting highly correlated measurements within a confined area. An important
feature of our formulation is that, although the per-node throughput of the
network tends to zero as network size increases, so does the amount of
information generated by each transmitter. This is a situation likely to be
encountered often in practice, which allows us to cast under new--and more
``optimistic''--light some negative results on the transport capacity of

values (from the viewpoint of supersymmetric models) for the mass and the
thermal averaged cross section times the velocity of the cold relic and we
investigate scenaria of equilibrium and non-equilibrium production. In the case
(i) a low reheat temperature, in the range (1-20) GeV, significantly
facilitates the achievement of an acceptable CDM abundance. On the other hand,
the presence of kination in the case (ii) can lead to an enhancement of the CDM

avoided, in the case (iii). In a such situation, the temperature turns out to
be frozen to a plateau value which is, mostly, lower than about 40 GeV.

Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model extended by three right
handed neutrinos, $\nu_{R_i}$ and their corresponding SUSY partners, ${\tilde
\nu}_{R_i}$, ($i=1,2,3$), and use the seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass
generation. We include the predictions for the branching ratios of two types of
lepton flavour violating channels, $l_j \to \l_i \gamma$ and $l_j \to 3 l_i$,
and compare them with the present bounds and future experimental sensitivities.
We first analyse the dependence of the branching ratios with the most relevant
SUSY seesaw parameters, and we then focus on the particular sensitivity to
$\theta_{13}$, which we find specially interesting on the light of its
potential future measurement. We further study the constraints from the
requirement of successfully producing the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via
thermal leptogenesis, which is another appealing feature of the SUSY seesaw
scenario. We conclude with the impact that a potential measurement of
$\theta_{13}$ can have on lepton flavour violating physics. This is a very

solutions has recently prompted a statistical approach towards extracting
phenomenological predictions from string theory. Unfortunately, for most
classes of string models, direct enumeration of all solutions is not
computationally feasible and thus statistical studies must resort to other
methods in order to extract meaningful information. In this paper, we discuss
some of the issues that arise when attempting to extract statistical
correlations from a large data set to which our computational access is
necessarily limited. Our main focus is the problem of ``floating
correlations''. As we discuss, this problem is endemic to investigations of
this type and reflects the fact that not all physically distinct string models
are equally likely to be sampled in any random search through the landscape,
thereby causing statistical correlations to ``float'' as a function of sample
size. We propose several possible methods that can be used to overcome this
problem, and we show through explicit examples that these methods lead to
correlations and statistical distributions which are not only stable as a
function of sample size, but which differ significantly from those which would
have been naively apparent from only a partial data set.

2) do extend holomorphically and uniquely to the domain D. It was a
long-standing open problem to derive a proof using only analytic discs, as did
Hurwitz (1897), Hartogs (1906) and E.E. Levi (1911) in some special, model
cases. Quite unexpectedly, Fornaess in 1998 exhibited a topologically strange
(nonpseudoconvex) domain D^F in C^2 that cannot be filled in by holomorphic
discs, when one makes the additional requirement that discs must all lie
entirely inside D^F. However, one should point out that the standard,
unrestricted disc method usually allows discs to go outsise the domain (just
think of Levi pseudoconcavity). Confirming these rather ancient expectations,
we show that the global Hartogs extension theorem can be established in such a
natural way.

deformations of the data $(f, v)$. We link the Matveev complexity $c(X)$ of $X$
with counting the \emph{double-tangent} trajectories of the $v$-flow, i.e. the
trajectories that are tangent to the boundary $\d X$ at a pair of distinct
points. Let $gc(X)$ be the minimum number of such trajectories, minimum being
taken over all nonsingular $v$'s. We call $gc(X)$ the \emph{gradient
complexity} of $X$. Next, we prove that there are only finitely many $X$ of
bounded gradient complexity, provided that $X$ is irreducible and boundary
irreducible with no essential annuli. In particular, there exists only finitely
many hyperbolic manifolds $X$ with bounded $gc(X)$. For such $X$, their
normalized hyperbolic volume gives an upper bound of $gc(X)$. If an irreducible
and boundary irreducible $X$ with no essential annuli admits a nonsingular
gradient flow with no double-tangent trajectories, then $X$ is a standard ball.
All these and many other results of the paper rely on a careful study of the
stratified geometry of $\d X$ relative to the $v$-flow. It is characterized by
failure of $\d X$ to be \emph{convex} with respect to a generic flow $v$. It
turns out, that convexity or its lack have profound influence on the topology
of $X$. This interplay between intrinsic concavity of $\d X$ with respect to
any gradient-like flow and complexity of $X$ is in the focus of the paper.

Tychonoff closures of the classes.
  When $C$ arises as the dual of a cubulation -- or discrete system of
halfspaces -- $\HH$ of a CAT(0) space $X$ (for example, the Niblo-Reeves
cubulation of the Davis-Moussong complex of a finite rank Coxeter group), we
show how $\HH$ induces a function $\rho:\bd X\to\Re C$. We develop a notion of
uniformness for $\HH$, generalizing the parallel walls property enjoyed by
Coxeter groups, and show that, if the pair $(X,\HH)$ admits a geometric action
by a group $G$, then the fibers of $\rho$ form a stratification of $\bd X$
graded by the order structure of $\Re C$. We also show how this structure
computes the components of the Tits boundary of $X$.
  Finally, using our result from another paper, that the uniformness of a
cubulation as above implies the local finiteness of $C$, we give a condition
for the co-compactness of the action of $G$ on $C$ in terms of $\rho$,
generalizing a result of Williams, previously known only for Coxeter groups.

are studied. First, we analyze longitudinal pion spectra from $E_{\rm lab}= 2A$
GeV to $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV within Landau's hydrodynamical model and the
UrQMD transport approach. From the measured data on the widths of the pion
rapidity spectra, we extract the sound velocity $c_s^2$ in the early stage of
the reactions. It is found that the sound velocity has a local minimum
(indicating a softest point in the equation of state, EoS) at $E_{\rm
beam}=30A$ GeV. This softening of the EoS is compatible with the assumption of
the formation of a mixed phase at the onset of deconfinement. Furthermore, the
energy excitation function of elliptic flow ($v_2$) from $E_{\rm beam}=90A$ MeV
to $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV is explored within the UrQMD framework and
discussed in the context of the available data. The transverse flow should also
be sensitive to changes in the equation of state. Therefore, the
underestimation of elliptic flow by the UrQMD model calculation above $E_{\rm
lab}= 30A$ GeV might also be explained by assuming a phase transition from a
hadron gas to the quark gluon plasma around this energy. This would be
consistent with the model calculations, indicating a transition from hadronic
matter to ``string matter'' in this energy range.

regarded as small perturbations superimposed on the primary circulations (PC).
The reason behind this treatment roots in an observation that the magnitude of
the SC is about 10 orders of magnitude smaller than that of the PC. This
approximation underlines all of the hurricane theories up until now. Recently,
Kieu (2004) proposes a revitalizing theory for the development of hurricanes
for which a class of exact solutions of the primitive equations is obtained
explicitly without appealing to scaling approximation. The solutions share some
of the most important dynamical aspects with observations. According to this
theory, the SC turns out to be particular important in determining the
three-dimensional structure and temporal evolution of axisymmetric hurricanes.
Like all theories for the hurricane development, Kieu's theory however contains
an infinite growth of the SC with time. In this study, it will be shown that
the infinite growth does not occur. In fact, the solution becomes stationary
after a period of time and the SC is able to maintain itself without blowing
exponentially if the nonlinear terms in the vertical momentum equation are
included. In addition, the SC tends to force the peripheral convection to
converge toward the center and builds up a more concentric vortex with a
typical hurricane-eye structure. Some potential roles of the SC in the
formation of hurricane eyes are discussed.

that have detected the anisotropy of the speed of light, implying the absolute
motion of the detecting apparatus through a dynamical space. This light-speed
anisotropy is consistent with relativistic effects and Lorentz symmetry,
contrary to prevailing beliefs in physics. The theoretical and experimental
evidence implies that physics has failed to realise the existence of a
dynamical 3-space, and that motion relative to that space is the cause of
various relativistic effects, as proposed by Lorentz in 1899. This has resulted
in a necessary generalisation of the Maxwell, Schrodinger and Dirac equations,
which then provide an explanation for gravity as an emergent phenomenon within
the new physics. From the generalised Dirac equation we show that the spacetime
formalism is derivable, but as merely a mathematical construct whose geodesics
arise from the trajectories of quantum wavepackets in the 3-space. However the
metric of this spacetime is shown not to satisfy the Hilbert-Einstein
equations, except in the special case of the Schwarzschild metric. Hence we
demonstrate that the successes of the General Relativity formalism have been
more illusory than real, that its successes are in fact quite limited, which
explains why it failed to account for the bore hole anomaly, the so-called
`dark matter' spiral galaxy rotation anomaly, the systematics of black hole
masses and so on. It also failed in that the dynamics of the 3-space is
determined by two fundamental constants, namely G and the fine structure

We attribute this to the enhancement of short-range collisional flux by the
long-range excitation of atom pairs to an attractive molecular potential. For
larger detunings and short delays, we find that a leading pulse can suppress
the rate of collisions caused by a following pulse. This is due to a depletion

raises the question of their relevance to the turbulent transition process.
Here a series of numerical experiments are conducted in which we look for the
spatial signature of these travelling waves in transitionary flows. Working
within a periodic pipe of 5D (diameters) length, we find that travelling waves
with low wall shear stresses (lower branch solutions) are on a surface which
separates initial conditions which uneventfully relaminarise and those which
lead to a turbulent evolution. Evidence for recurrent travelling wave visits is
found in both 5D and 10D long periodic pipes but only for those travelling
waves with low-to-intermediate wall shear stress and for less than about 10% of
the time in turbulent flow. Given this, it seems unlikely that the mean
turbulent properties such as wall shear stress can be predicted as an expansion
over the travelling waves in which their individual properties are
appropriately weighted. Rather, further dynamical structures such as periodic
orbits need to be isolated and included in any such expansion.

strong correlation between the width of the scintillation light distribution in
continuous crystals and the depth of interaction of the gamma-ray. For
measuring the distribution width, an inexpensive modification of the commonly
used charge dividing circuits that allows analogue and instantaneous
computation of the 2nd moment has been developed and is presented in this work.
The method has been tested with a detector made of a continuous
LSO-scintillator of dimensions 42x42x10 cubic mm and optically coupled to the
compact large area position sensitive photomultiplier H8500 from Hamamatsu. The
mean resolution in all non-trivial moments was found to be smaller than 5% but
their direct use as estimates for the three-dimensional photoconversion
position turned out to be unsuitable. Standard polynomial interpolation in
higher dimensions has been adopted to reconstruct the impact positions of the
gamma-rays from the measured moments. When using the reconstructed impact
positions, the intrinsic mean spatial resolution of the detector was found to
be 1.9 mm for the transverse components and 3.9 mm for the depth of
interaction. Using directly the bare moments as position estimate, the
intrinsic mean spatial resolution of the detector was found to be 3.4 mm and
4.9 mm, respectively. The cost for the required detector improvements are
essentially negligible.

methods are employed to efficiently evolve these gPC coefficients in time and
compute their coarse-grained stationary state and/or limit cycle solutions,
circumventing the derivation of explicit, closed-form evolution equations.
Ensemble realizations of the oscillators and their statistics can be readily
reconstructed from these gPC coefficients. We apply this methodology to the
synchronization of yeast glycolytic oscillators coupled by the membrane
exchange of an intracellular metabolite. The heterogeneity consists of a single
random parameter, which accounts for glucose influx into a cell, with a
Gaussian distribution over the population. Coarse projective integration is

graph. Of course, if two graphs are isomorphic their associated states are the
same. Also, we know local operations do not change the entanglement of quantum
states. Therefore, graph states that are either isomorphic or equivalent under
the local Clifford group have the same properties. In this paper, we first
establish a bound on the number of graph states which are neither isomorphic
nor equivalent under the action of local Clifford group.
  Also, we study graph states in non-binary case. We translate the action of
local Clifford group, as well as measurement of Pauli operators, into
transformations on their associated graphs.
  Finally, we present an efficient algorithm to verify whether two graph
states, in non-binary case, are locally equivalent or not.

in spin systems and free Bosonic gases. We explain how entanglement can be
observed using entanglement witnesses which are themselves constructed within
the framework of thermodynamics and thus macroscopic observables. These
thermodynamical entanglement witnesses result in bounds on macroscopic
parameters of the system, such as the temperature, the energy or the
susceptibility, below which entanglement must be present. The derived bounds
indicate a relationship between the occurrence of entanglement and the
establishment of order, possibly resulting in phase transition phenomena. We
give a short overview over the concepts developed in condensed matter physics
to capture the characteristics of phase transitions in particular in terms of
order and correlation functions. Finally we want to ask and speculate whether
entanglement could be a generalised order concept by itself, relevant in
(quantum induced) phase transitions such as BEC, and that taking this view may
help us to understand the underlying process of high-T superconductivity.

implement control of quantum systems protected against decoherence via

  Part of the challenge in studying control over multiple logical qubits, is
that QIP test-beds have not had sufficient resources to analyze encodings
beyond the simplest ones. The most relevant resources are the number of
available qubits and the cost to initialize and control them. Here we
demonstrate an encoding of logical information that permits the control over
multiple logical qubits without full initialization, an issue that is
particularly challenging in liquid state NMR. The method of subsystem
pseudo-pure state will allow the study of decoherence control schemes on up to

a key obtained from QC for authentication purposes in later rounds of QC. In
particular, the eavesdropper gains partial knowledge on the key in QC that may
have an effect on the security of the authentication in the later round. Our
initial analysis indicates that this partial knowledge has little effect on the
authentication part of the system, in agreement with previous results on the
issue. However, when taking the full QC protocol into account, the picture is
different. By accessing the quantum channel used in QC, the attacker can change
the message to be authenticated. This, together with partial knowledge of the
key, does incur a security weakness of the authentication. The underlying
reason for this is that the authentication used, which is insensitive to such
message changes when the key is unknown, becomes sensitive when used with a
partially known key. We suggest a simple solution to this problem, and stress
usage of this or an equivalent extra security measure in QC.

photons have only particle-like fluctuations, on the other hand, the binary
