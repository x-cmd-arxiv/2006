is required to reproduce the observed properties of the MW; (ii) stars with
[Fe/H]<-2.5 form in halos accreting Galactic Medium (GM) enriched by earlier
supernova explosions; (iii) the fiducial model (Zcr=10^-4Zsun,m_PopIII=200Msun)
provides an overall good fit to the MDF but cannot account for the two stars
with [Fe/H]<-5; the latter can be accommodated if Zcr<10^-6Zsun but such model
overpopulates the range -5.3<[Fe/H]<-4 in which no stars have been detected;
(iv) the current non-detection of metal-free stars robustly constrains either
Zcr>0 or the masses of the first stars m_PopIII>0.9Msun; (v) the statistical
impact of second generation stars, i.e stars forming out of gas polluted only
by metal-free stars, is negligible in current samples; (vi) independently of
Zcr, 60% of metals in the GM are ejected through winds by halos with masses

a high dark matter content or by the presence of unbound stars in a disrupted

are thought to have the well-known agemetallicity degeneracy, but some recent
works show that colors can also be used. A simple stellar population synthesis
model is widely used, but there is no analysis for its colors. We try to find
colors that can potentially be used to determine the age and metallicity of
stellar populations by the standard model. Principal component analysis and
relative sensitive parameter techniques are used in this work. As a result,
U-K, U-H, U-J, B-K, B-H, U-I, B-J, and V-K are found to be more important for
studying populations than others. Pairs of colors such as B-K and B-V are found
to be able to disentangle the stellar age-metallicity degeneracy via the
high-resolution model, while pairs such as U-K and R-I may be used instead when
the low-resolution model is used. Furthermore, the u-g and r-i colors of the
low-resolution model seem to have the same potential, but there are no such
colors for the high-resolution one. In conclusion, some colors have been shown
to have the potential to determine the age and metallicity of stellar
populations, but relative metallicity and age sensitivities of colors in
different stellar population synthesis models are usually different. In
addition, minor star formations will make star systems look younger and more
metal rich than their dominating populations.

  Properties","10 pages, 3 figures, submitted to PRD",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Using a number of numerical tests and analytic arguments we investigate how
measurements of cosmic shear lead to constraints on dark energy. We find that,
in contrast to the case with galaxy number density correlation functions,
standard rulers in the matter power spectrum play no significant role.
Sensitivity to distance ratios is provided by the ratios in the lensing kernel.
An absolute distance scale can only be established by breaking a potential
degeneracy between growth and distance which can be done if the growth-redshift
relation and distance-redshift relations are parameterized with sufficiently
few parameters. For the quality of dark energy determination, growth
determination is primarily important because it improves the distance
reconstructions. The information about dark energy in the growth-redshift
relation is always of secondary importance though the amount it contributes is
highly dependent on what priors are taken in the cosmological parameter space.
We also explain the dependence of dark energy constraints from cosmic shear,
relative distance measures (supernovae) and absolute distance measures (baryon
acoustic oscillations) on assumptions about the mean curvature.

spiral galaxies and a balance of previous detections of extraplanar gas in the
targeted galaxies we propose a global picture where the outer gas disk (beyond
the optical radius R_25) is removed much earlier than expected by the classical
ram pressure criterion. Based on the two-phase nature of atomic hydrogen
located in a galactic disk, we argue that the warm diffuse HI in the outer
galactic disk is evaporated much more rapidly than the cold dense HI.
Therefore, after a ram pressure stripping event we can only observe atomic
hydrogen which was cold and dense before it was removed from the galactic disk.
This global picture is consistent with all available observations. We detect
between 0.3% and 20% of the stripped mass assuming an initially non-deficient
galaxy and between 3% and 70% of the stripped mass assuming an initially HI
deficient galaxy (def=0.4). Under the latter assumption we estimate an
evaporation rate by dividing the missing mass by the estimated time to peak ram
pressure from dynamical simulations. We find evaporation rates between 10 and
100 M_solar/yr.

Orion A North & South, and Orion B North & South. We find that two of the

completeness limits, and contain a larger number of sources, so we concentrate
on these two. We compare the data with archive data from the Spitzer Space

pre-stellar in nature. We extract all of the pre-stellar cores from the data
and make a histogram of the core masses. This can be compared to the stellar
initial mass function (IMF). We find the high-mass core mass function follows a
roughly Salpeter-like slope, just like the IMF, as seen in previous work. Our
deeper maps allow us to see that the core mass function (CMF) turns over at ~
1.3 Mo, about a factor of 4 higher than our completeness limit. This turnover
has never previously been observed, and is only visible here due to our much
deeper maps. It mimics the turnover seen in the stellar IMF at ~ 0.1 Mo. The
low-mass side of the CMF is a power-law with an exponent of 0.35 +/- 0.2, which
is consistent with the low-mass slope of the young cluster IMF of 0.3 +/- 0.1.
This shows that the CMF continues to mimic the shape of the IMF all the way
down to the lower completeness limit of these data at ~ 0.3 Mo.

Compton emission integral for low energies of the incident photon and electron
and compare the derived analytic expressions with the results obtained by
numerical integrations of the full double Compton cross section. We explicitly
derived analytic approximations to the low frequency double Compton emission

combining the analytic approximations given in this paper, an accuracy of

The estimated age, reddening and distance for the programme clusters were
compared with published vales of the literature and discussed in this context.
The current paper shows that CP2 stars are present continuously in very young
(7Myr) to intermediate age (500Myr) open clusters at distances larger than 2kpc
from the Sun.

best candidates to be observed with transmission spectroscopy in the

characteristics of planetary density, orbital parameters and parent star
distance and brightness. Here we simulate transmission spectra of these two
planets during their primary eclipse in the MIR, and we present sensitivity
studies of the spectra to the changes of atmospheric thermal properties,
molecular abundances and C/O ratios. Our model predicts that the dominant
species absorbing in the MIR on hot Jupiters are water vapor and carbon
monoxide, and their relative abundances are determined by the C/O ratio. Since
the temperature profile plays a secondary role in the transmission spectra of
hot Jupiters compared to molecular abundances, future primary eclipse
observations in the MIR of those objects might give an insight on EGP
atmospheric chemistry. We find here that the absorption features caused by
water vapor and carbon monoxide in a cloud-free atmosphere, are deep enough to
be observable by the present and future generation of space-based
observatories, such as Spitzer Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope.
We discuss our results in light of the capabilities of these telescopes.

gives an estimate of the size of these welded microcontacts. The DC value of

Deformation is frequency dependent: in the low frequency range (~ 1 kHz), the

range changes the deformation to oblate. We attempt to explain this behaviour
with a theoretical model, based on the minimization of the total free energy of
the vesicle. The energy terms taken into account include the membrane bending
energy and the energy of the electric field. The latter is calculated from the

simplified expression for the deformation, which retains the frequency
dependence of the exact expression and may provide a better substitute for the

only in the limit of low frequencies. The model with the anisotropic membrane
permittivity imposes two constraints on the values of material constants:
tangential component of dielectric permittivity tensor of the phospholipid

estimate of the intrinsic pendulum noise floor in the absence of sensor related
force noise. The apparatus has shown a torque noise near to its mechanical
thermal noise limit, and would allow to place upper limits on GRS related
disturbances with a best sensitivity of 300 fN/Hz^(1/2) at 1mHz, a factor 50
from the LISA goal. Also, we discuss the characterization of the gravity

length is effectively unconstrained, searches for all possible lifetime and
NLSP topologies predicted by GMSB models in e+e- collisions are performed on
the data sample collected by OPAL at centre-of-mass energies up to 209 GeV at
LEP. Results independent of the NLSP lifetime are presented for all relevant
final states including direct NLSP pair-production and, for the first time,
also NLSP production via cascade decays of heavier SUSY particles. None of the

presented at the 95% confidence level both for direct NLSP production and for

1.0(5.0) time 10^21 POT/year, if the hierarchy is normal. We also study the
influence of the octant degeneracy on the capability of T2KK experiment to
determine the mass hierarchy and the leptonic CP phase. The capability of
rejecting the wrong mass hierarchy grows with increasing sin^2 theta_atm when
the hierarchy is normal, whereas it is rather insensitive to sin^2 theta_atm

and some parts of these papers are reproduced here. These papers further
extended works by Lepowsky and by Milas. Following our joint papers, I explain
the general principles of twisted modules for vertex operator algebras in their
powerful formulation using formal series, and derive general relations
satisfied by twisted and untwisted vertex operators. Using these, I prove new
""equivalence"" and ""construction"" theorems, identifying a set of sufficient
conditions in order to have a twisted module for a vertex operator algebra, and
a simple way of constructing the twisted vertex operator map. This essentially
combines our general relations for twisted modules with ideas of Li (1996), who
had obtained similar construction theorems using different relations. Then, I
show how to apply these theorems in order to construct twisted modules for the
Heisenberg vertex operator algebra. I obtain in a new way the explicit twisted
vertex operator map, and in particular give a new derivation and expression for
the formal operator $\Delta_x$ constructed some time ago by Frenkel, Lepowsky
and Meurman. Finally, I reproduce parts of our joint papers. The untwisted
relations in the Heisenberg vertex operator algebra are employed to explain
properties of a certain central extension of a Lie algebra of differential
operators on the circle, in relation to the Riemann Zeta function at negative
integers. A family of representations for this algebra are constructed from
twisted modules for the vertex operator algebra, and are related to the
Bernoulli polynomials at rational values.

$\{X_i(0)\}_{i\in \mathbb{Z}^d}$ is a shift-invariant and shift-ergodic random

where the diffusion function is subquadratic. In particular, let
$\hat{a}(i,j)={1/2}[a(i,j)+a(j,i)]$, $i,j\in \mathbb{Z}^d$, denote the
symmetrized transition kernel. We show that: (A) If $\hat{a}(\cdot,\cdot)$ is

$\hat{a}(\cdot,\cdot)$ is transient, then there exist $b_*\geq b_2>0$ such
that: (B1)d The system converges to an equilibrium $\nu_{\Theta}$ (with mean
$\Theta$) if $0<b<b_*$. (B2) The system locally dies out if $b>b_*$. (B3)
$\nu_{\Theta}$ has a finite 2nd moment if and only if $0<b<b_2$. (B4) The 2nd
moment diverges exponentially fast if and only if $b>b_2$. The equilibrium
$\nu_{\Theta}$ is shown to be associated and mixing for all $0<b<b_*$. We argue
in favor of the conjecture that $b_*>b_2$. We further conjecture that the
system locally dies out at $b=b_*$. For the case where $a(\cdot,\cdot)$ is
symmetric and transient we further show that: (C) There exists a sequence
$b_2\geq b_3\geq b_4\geq ... >0$ such that: (C1) $\nu_{\Theta}$ has a finite

$\lim_{m\to\infty}(m-1)b_m=c=\sup_{m\geq 2}(m-1)b_m$. The proof of these
results is based on self-duality and on a representation formula through which
the moments of the components are related to exponential moments of the
collision local time of random walks. Via large deviation theory, the latter
lead to variational expressions for $b_*$ and the $b_m$'s, from which sharp
bounds are deduced. The critical value $b_*$ arises from a stochastic
representation of the Palm distribution of the system. The special case where
$a(\cdot,\cdot)$ is simple random walk is commonly referred to as the parabolic
Anderson model with Brownian noise. This case was studied in the memoir by

analytical results are illustrated with calculations for the case of point
separations in the direction perpendicular to the interface. For the incident
plus reflected field, the dependence of the complex-valued and inhomogeneous
spatial correlation function on the permittivity, permeability and conductivity
of the medium is determined. For the refracted field, the spatial correlation
is again complex-valued but homogeneous and highly sensitive to the value of
the refractive index. Based on the derived dependencies, novel nonlocal
measurement methods for precision characterization of electromagnetic material
properties are suggested. The influence of the directionality of incidence for
electromagnetic beams is investigated. Narrowing the beam width results in a
slower decrease of the amplitude of the correlation function as a function of
point separation. Previously obtained asymptotic results for statistically
homogeneous random free fields are retrieved as special cases.

discriminated before saturation. This is in stark contrast with the response
curves of sensory neurons, whose dynamic range is small, usually covering only
about one decade. We claim that this paradox can be solved by means of a
collective phenomenon. By coupling excitable elements with small dynamic range,
the {\em collective} response function shows a much larger dynamic range, due
to the amplification mediated by excitable waves. Moreover, the dynamic range
is optimal at the phase transition where self-sustained activity becomes
stable, providing a clear example of a biologically relevant quantity being
optimized at criticality. We present a pedagogical account of these ideas,

and differential reproduction, or selection. The population is modelled as a
finite-type Markov branching process in continuous time, and the associated
genealogical tree is viewed both in the forward and the backward direction of
time. The stationary type distribution of the reversed process, the so-called
ancestral distribution, turns out as a key for the study of mutation-selection
balance. This balance can be expressed in the form of a variational principle
that quantifies the respective roles of reproduction and mutation for any
possible type distribution. It shows that the mean growth rate of the
population results from a competition for a maximal long-term growth rate, as
given by the difference between the current mean reproduction rate, and an
asymptotic decay rate related to the mutation process; this tradeoff is won by
the ancestral distribution.
  Our main application is the quasispecies model of sequence evolution with
mutation coupled to reproduction but independent across sites, and a fitness
function that is invariant under permutation of sites. Here, the variational
principle is worked out in detail and yields a simple, explicit result.

width increases by 23% within 24 h postfeeding, inducing significant increases
in villus length and intestinal mass. By 6 days postfeeding, enterocyte volume
had peaked, following as much as an 80% increase. Contributing to enterocyte
hypertrophy is the cellular accumulation of lipid droplets at the tips and
edges of the villi of the proximal and middle small intestine, but which were
absent in the distal small intestine. At 3 days postfeeding, conventional and
environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed cracks and lipid extrusion
along the narrow edges of the villi and at the villus tips. Transmission
electron microscopy demonstrated the rapid postprandial lengthening of
enterocyte microvilli, increasing 4.8-fold in length within 24 h, and the
maintaining of that length through digestion. Beginning at 24 h postfeeding,
spherical particles were found embedded apically within enterocytes of the
proximal and middle small intestine. These particles possessed an annular-like
construction and were stained with the calcium-stain Alizarine red S suggesting
that they were bone in origin. Following the completion of digestion, many of
the postprandial responses were reversed, as observed by the atrophy of
enterocytes, the shortening of villi, and the retraction of the microvilli.
Further exploration of the python intestine will reveal the underlying

degrees as the original network. In this paper we argue that this ensemble can
be more than just a null model -- it also carries information about the
original network and factors that affect its evolution. By mapping out this
ensemble in the space of some low-level network structure -- in our case those
measured by the assortativity and clustering coefficients -- one can for
example study how close to the valid region of the parameter space the observed
networks are. Such analysis suggests which quantities are actively optimized
during the evolution of the network. We use four very different biological
networks to exemplify our method. Among other things, we find that high
clustering might be a force in the evolution of protein interaction networks.

  the second version",,"10.4006/1.3153419",,"quant-ph",,"  In this paper, we analyze the relationship between entropy and information in
the context of the mixing process of two identical ideal gases. We will argue
that entropy has a special information-based feature that is enfolded in the
statistical entropy, but the second law does not include it directly.
Therefore, in some given processes in thermodynamics where there is no matter
and energy interaction between the system and environment, the state of the
system may go towards a situation of lower probability to increase observer's
information in environment. This is a kind of an information-based interaction
in which the total entropy is not constrained by the second law.

provides an instructive example of the relation between classical motion and
the quantum mechanical energy spectrum. We extend previous work on the
anisotropic oscillator with incommensurate frequencies and the isotropic
oscillator to the case with commensurate frequencies for which the Lissajous
curves appear as classical periodic orbits. Because of the three different
scenarios depending on the ratio of its frequencies, the two-dimensional
harmonic oscillator offers a unique way to explicitly analyze the role of
symmetries in classical and quantum mechanics.

with coefficients in GF(2) is found to fully accommodate the algebra of 15
operators - generalized Pauli matrices - characterizing two-qubit systems. The
relevant sub-configuration consists of 15 points each of which is either
simultaneously distant or simultaneously neighbor to (any) two given distant
points of the line. The operators can be identified with the points in such a
one-to-one manner that their commutation relations are exactly reproduced by
the underlying geometry of the points, with the ring geometrical notions of
neighbor/distant answering, respectively, to the operational ones of
commuting/non-commuting. This remarkable configuration can be viewed in two
principally different ways accounting, respectively, for the basic 9+6 and 10+5
factorizations of the algebra of the observables. First, as a disjoint union of
the projective line over GF(2) x GF(2) (the ""Mermin"" part) and two lines over
GF(4) passing through the two selected points, the latter omitted. Second, as
the generalized quadrangle of order two, with its ovoids and/or spreads
standing for (maximum) sets of five mutually non-commuting operators and/or
groups of five maximally commuting subsets of three operators each. These
findings open up rather unexpected vistas for an algebraic geometrical
modelling of finite-dimensional quantum systems and give their numerous
applications a wholly new perspective.

  version",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using the Green's function associated with the one-dimensional Schroedinger
equation it is possible to establish a hierarchy of sum rules involving the
eigenvalues of confining potentials which have only a boundstate spectrum. For
some potentials the sum rules could lead to divergences. It is shown that when
this happens it is possible to examine the separate sum rules satisfied by the
even and odd eigenstates of a symmetric confining potential and by subtraction
cancel the divergences exactly and produce a new sum rule which is free of
divergences. The procedure is illustrated by considering symmetric power law
potentials and the use of several examples. One of the examples considered
shows that the zeros of the Airy function and its derivative obey a sum rule
and this sum rule is verified. It is also shown how the procedure may be
generalised to establish sum rules for arbitrary symmetric confining
potentials.
