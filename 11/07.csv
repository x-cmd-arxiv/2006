matter (DM) particles. The DM particle chi_1 can feature an electric or
magnetic transition dipole moment which couples it with photons and a heavier
neutral particle chi_2. Resonant photon scattering then takes place at a
special energy set by the masses of chi_1 and chi_2, with the width of the

constraints on the parameter space of the model from stellar energy losses,
data from SN 1987A, the Lyman-alpha forest, Big Bang nucleosynthesis,
electro-weak precision measurements and accelerator searches. We show that the
velocity broadening of the resonance plays an essential role for the
possibility of the detection of a spectral feature originating from resonant
photon-DM scattering. Depending upon the particle setup and the DM surface mass
density, the favored range of DM particle masses lies between tens of keV and a

photons within the expanding flow leads to a decrease of their energy which is
of first order in V/c (where V is the outflow velocity). The downscattering
effect of first order in V/c in the diverging flow is explained by
semi-analytical calculations and confirmed by MC simulations. We conclude that
redshifted lines and downscattering bumps are intrinsic properties of the
powerful outflows for which Thomson optical depth is greater than one. We
fitted our model line profiles to the observations using four free parameters,
\beta=V/c, optical depth of the wind \tau, the wind temperature kT_e and the
original line photon energy E_0. We show how the primary spectrum emitted close
to the black hole is modified by reprocessing in the warm wind. In the
framework of the our wind model the fluorescent iron line K_alpha is formed in
the partly ionized wind as a result of illumination by central source continuum
photons. The demonstrated application of our outflow model to the XMM

to abandon the epicyclic approximation and the approximation of infinite
isothermal layers, which are commonly adopted in this technique, failed to
improve the situation substantially. We conclude that the main drawback of
techniques based on the Jeans equations is that the system of equations
employed is not closed, and therefore requires adopting an essentially ad hoc
additional closure condition. A new iterative approach to constructing
equilibrium N-body models with a given density distribution is proposed. The
main idea behind this approach is that a model is first constructed using some
approximation method, and is then allowed to adjust to an equilibrium state
with the specified density and the required parameters of the velocity
distribution remaining fixed in the process. This iterative approach was used
to construct isotropic, spherically symmetric models and models of stellar
disks embedded in an external potential. The numerical models constructed prove
to be close to equilibrium. It is shown that the commonly adopted assumption
that the profile of the radial velocity dispersion is exponential may be wrong.
The technique proposed can be applied to a wide range of problems involving the
construction of models of stellar systems with various geometries.

with redshift. We find that real mergers are harder to recognize at high
redshift, and also that the chance superposition of unrelated galaxies often
produces the appearance of mergers where in reality none exists. In particular,
we estimate that 1.5 - 2.0% of objects randomly added to ACS images are
misclassified as mergers due to projection with unrelated objects, and as a
result, that 40% of the apparent mergers in COSMOS at z=0.7 are likely to be

twisting plumes of plasma heated by many star passages through the disk. Each
plume rotates a fraction of the toroidal flux into poloidal flux, always in the
same direction, through a finite angle, and proportional to its diameter. The
predicted growth rate of poloidal magnetic flux, based upon two analytic
approaches and numerical simulations, leads to a rapid exponentiation of a seed
field, \sim 0.1 to \sim 0.01 per Keplerian period of the inner part of the
disk. The initial value of the seed field may therefore be arbitrarily small
yet reach, through dynamo gain, saturation very early in the disk history.
Because of tidal disruption of stars close to the black hole, the maximum
growth rate occurs at a radius of about 100 gravitational radii from the
central object. The generated mean magnetic field, a quadrupole field, has
predominantly even parity so that the radial component does not reverse sign
across the midplane. The linear growth is predicted to be the same by each of
the following three theoretical analyses: the flux conversion model, the mean
field approach, and numerical modeling. The common feature is the conducting

centre of debate because it has been suggested to have an extremely high helium

presence of extreme horizontal branch stars of omega Cen as well. This demands
a relative helium to metal enrichment of deltaY/deltaZ ~ 70; that is, more than
one order of magnitude larger than the generally accepted value. Candidate
solutions, namely, AGB stars, massive stars, and supernovae, have been
suggested; but in this study, we show that none of them is a viable channel, in
terms of reproducing the high value of deltaY/deltaZ for the constrained age
difference between the red and blue populations. Essentially no populations
with an ordinary initial mass function, including those candidates, can produce
such a high deltaY/deltaZ because they all produce metals as well as helium. As
an alternative, we investigate the possibility of the stochastic ``first star''
contamination to the gas from which the younger generation of omega Cen formed.
This requires the assumption that Population III star formation episode
overlaps with that of Population II. While the required condition appears
extreme, very massive objects in the first star generation provide a solution
that is at least as plausible as any other suggestions made before.

for overlap. Furthermore, the constraint R<1.8 suggests that the Universe at

halos is determined using a sample of 625 nearby groups and clusters from the
SDSS. Brightest group and cluster galaxies (BCGs) are more likely to host a
radio-loud AGN than other galaxies of the same stellar mass (by less than a
factor of two at a stellar mass of 5e11 M_sun, but over an order of magnitude
below 1e11 M_sun). The distribution of radio luminosities for BCGs does not
depend on stellar mass, however, and is similar to that of field galaxies of
the same mass. Neither the radio-loud fraction nor the radio luminosity
distribution of BCGs depends strongly on the cluster velocity dispersion. The
radio-AGN fraction is also studied as a function of clustercentric distance:
only within 0.2 r_200 do cluster galaxies exhibit an enhanced likelihood of
radio-loud AGN activity, approaching that of the BCGs. The radio-loud AGN
properties of both BCGs and non-BCGs can naturally be explained if this
activity is fuelled by cooling from hot gas surrounding the galaxy. Using
observational estimates of the mechanical output of the radio jets, the
time-averaged energy output associated with recurrent radio source activity is
estimated for all group/cluster galaxies. Within the cooling radius of the
cluster, the radio-mode heating from the BCG dominates over that of all other
galaxies combined. The scaling between total radio-AGN energy output and
cluster velocity dispersion is considerably shallower than the sigma^4 scaling
of the radiative cooling rate. Thus, unless either the mechanical-to-radio
luminosity ratio or the efficiency of converting AGN mechanical energy into
heating increases by 2-3 orders of magnitude between groups and rich clusters,
radio-mode heating will not balance cooling in systems of all masses.

microwave background (CMB) radiation made with the Arcminute Cosmology
Bolometer Array Receiver (ACBAR). In this paper, we use a new analysis
technique and include 30% more data from the 2001 and 2002 observing seasons
than the first release to derive a new set of band-power measurements with
significantly smaller uncertainties. The planet-based calibration used
previously has been replaced by comparing the flux of RCW38 as measured by
ACBAR and BOOMERANG to transfer the WMAP-based BOOMERANG calibration to ACBAR.
The resulting power spectrum is consistent with the theoretical predictions for
a spatially flat, dark energy dominated LCDM cosmology including the effects of
gravitational lensing. Despite the exponential damping on small angular scales,
the primary CMB fluctuations are detected with a signal-to-noise ratio of
greater than 4 up to multipoles of l=2000. This increase in the precision of
the fine-scale CMB power spectrum leads to only a modest decrease in the
uncertainties on the parameters of the standard cosmological model. At high
angular resolution, secondary anisotropies are predicted to be a significant
contribution to the measured anisotropy. A joint analysis of the ACBAR results
at 150 GHz and the CBI results at 30 GHz in the multipole range 2000 < l < 3000
shows that the power, reported by CBI in excess of the predicted primary
anisotropy, has a frequency spectrum consistent with the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and inconsistent with primary CMB. The results
reported here are derived from a subset of the total ACBAR data set; the final
ACBAR power spectrum at 150 GHz will include 3.7 times more effective

propelled to larger radii, depleting the inner accretion disc. The propeller
therefore has the effect of stabilizing the inner disc and allowing the outer
disc to accumulate mass. The outbursts of WZ Sge are then regulated by the
(magnetically determined) evolution of the surface density of the outer disc at
a radius close to the tidal limit. Numerical models confirm that the recurrence
time can be significantly extended in this way. The outbursts are expected to
be superoutbursts since the outer disc radius is forced to exceed the tidal
(3:1 resonance) radius. The large, quiescent disc is expected to be massive,
and to be able to supply the observed mass accretion rate during outburst. We
predict that the long-term spin evolution of the white dwarf spin will involve
a long cycle of spin up and spin down phases.

clouds while dissipating kinetic energy, producing regions that are locally
gravitationally bound and collapse to form stars. In addition to triggering the
star formation process, the clumpy gas passing through the shock naturally
generates the observed velocity dispersion size relation of molecular clouds.
In this scenario, the internal motions of GMCs need not be turbulent in nature.
The coupling of the clouds' internal kinematics to their externally triggered
formation removes the need for the clouds to be self-gravitating. Globally
unbound molecular clouds provides a simple explanation of the low efficiency of
star formation. While dense regions in the shock become bound and collapse to
form stars, the majority of the gas disperses as it leaves the spiral arm.

generally good tracers of the cluster path quite far from the cluster center

direction of the Galaxy center. In particular, the orientation of the inner
part of the tails is highly correlated to the cluster orbital phase and to the

integral-field spectroscopic survey has further demonstrated that early-type
galaxies often display nebular emission. Furthermore, the SAURON data have
shown that such emission comes with an intriguing variety of morphologies,
kinematic behaviours and line ratios.
  Perhaps most puzzling was the finding that round and slowly rotating objects
generally display uncorrelated stellar and gaseous angular momenta, consistent
with an external origin for the gas, whereas flatter and fast rotating galaxies
host preferentially co-rotating gas and stars, suggesting internal production
of gas. Alternatively, a bias against the internal production of ionised gas
and against the acquisition of retrograde material may be present in these two
kinds of objects, respectively.
  In light of the different content of hot gas in these systems, with slowly
rotating objects being the only systems capable of hosting massive X-ray halos,
we suggest that a varying importance of evaporation of warm gas in the hot
interstellar medium can contribute to explain the difference in the relative
behaviour of gas and stars in these two kinds of objects. Namely, whereas in
X-ray bright and slowly rotating galaxies stellar-loss material would quickly
evaporate in the hot medium, in X-ray faint and fast rotating objects such
material would be allowed to lose angular momentum and settle in a disk, which
could also obstruct the subsequent acquisition of retrograde gas. Evidence for
a connection between warm and hot gas phases, presumably driven by heat
conduction, is presented for four slowly rotating galaxies with CHANDRA

to an intimate connection between the energetic outflows driven by AGN and the

triggered by the cooling gas, how long the activity lasts for and how these
effects give rise to the observed distribution of morphologies of the outflows.
In this contribution we concentrate on the high radio luminosity end of the AGN
population. While most of the heating of the environmental gas may be due to
less luminous and energetic outflows, these more powerful objects have a very
profound influence on their surroundings. We will describe a simple model for
powerful radio galaxies and radio-loud quasars that explains the dichotomy of
their large-scale radio morphologies as well as their radio luminosity

non-linear over-dense blobs of gas cool fast and are removed from the ICM

galaxy-scale strong-lens systems has led to an interpretation based on the
presence of a high mass-fraction of cold-dark-matter (CDM) substructures around
galaxies, as predicted by numerical N-body simulations. The flux-ratio anomaly
is particularly evident in the radio-loud quadruple gravitational lens system
CLASS B2045+265. In this paper, new high-resolution radio, optical, and
infrared imaging of B2045+265 is presented which sheds more light on this
anomaly and its possible causes. First, deep Very Long Baseline Array
observations show very compact images, possibly with a hint of a jet, but with
no evidence for differential scattering or scatter broadening. Second, optical
and infrared observations with the Hubble Space Telescope and through
Adaptive-Optics imaging with the W. M. Keck Telescope, show a previously
undiscovered object -- interpreted as a (tidally disrupted) dwarf satellite
based on its colours and slight extension -- between the main lens galaxy and
the three anomalous flux-ratio images. Third, colour variations in the
early-type lens galaxy indicate recent star-formation, possibly the result of
secondary infall of gas-rich satellites. A population of such galaxies around
the lens system could explain the previously discovered strong [O II] emission.
However, spiral structure and/or normal star formation in the lens galaxy
cannot be excluded. In light of these new data, we propose a lens model for the
system, including the observed dwarf satellite, which reproduces all positional
and flux-ratio constraints, without the need for additional CDM substructure.

Adaptive optics on ground based telescopes is the only method today to obtain

been assembled into a single progenitor. With this definition, it is possible
to derive a simple but useful analytic estimate of the distribution of halo
formation times. The standard estimate of this distribution depends on the
shape of the conditional mass function--the distribution of progenitor masses
of a halo as a function of time. If the spherical collapse model is used to
estimate the progenitor mass function, then the formation times one infers
systematically underestimate those seen in numerical simulations of
hierarchical gravitational clustering. We provide estimates of halo formation
which may be related to an ellipsoidal collapse model. These estimates provide
a substantially better description of the simulations. We also provide an
alternative derivation of the formation time distribution which is based on the
assumption that haloes increase their mass through binary mergers only. Our
results are useful for models which relate halo structure to halo formation.

  Methods: The density and dust temperature profiles for a range of models of
flaring and self-shadowed disks around a typical Herbig Ae star are used
together with 2-dimensional ultraviolet (UV) radiative transfer to calculate
the chemistry and gas temperature. In each model the line profiles and
intensities for the fine structure lines of [O I], [C II] and [C I] and the
pure rotational lines of CO, CN, HCN and HCO+ are determined.
  Results: The chemistry shows a strong correlation with disk mass. Molecules
that are easily dissociated, like HCN, require high densities and large
extinctions before they can become abundant. The products of photodissociation,
like CN and C2H, become abundant in models with lower masses. Dust settling
mainly affects the gas temperature, and thus high temperature tracers like the
O and C+ fine structure lines. The carbon chemistry is found to be very
sensitive to the adopted PAH abundance. The line ratios CO/13CO, CO/HCO+ and [O

appropriate period ratios significantly corroborates the SBBH interpretation.
This is illustrated for a binary model where optical longterm periodicity is
related to accretion disk interactions, radio periodicity to Newtonian jet
precession, and periodicities in the high energy bands to the orbital motion of

grain-grain displacement, has devoted increasing interest in the last decade.
In this work, we analyzed features about the interface scaling of these
clusters through large scale simulations (up to $3\times 10^7$ particles) of
two-dimensional growth processes with special emphasis on the off-lattice Eden
model. The central objective is to discuss an important pitfall associated to
the evaluation of the growth exponent $\beta$ of these systems. We show that
the $\beta$ value depends on the choice of the origin used to determine the
interface width. We considered two strategies frequently used. When the width
is evaluated in relation to the center of mass (CM) of the border, the exponent
obtained for the Eden model was $\beta_{CM}=0.404\pm0.013$, in very good
agreement with previous reported values. However, if the border CM is replaced
by the initial seed position (a static origin), the exponent $\beta_0=0.333\pm
0.010$, in complete agreement with the KPZ value $\beta_{KPZ}=1/3$, was found.
The difference between $\beta_{CM}$ and $\beta_{0}$ was explained through the
border CM fluctuations that grow faster than the overall interface
fluctuations. Indeed, we show that the exponents $\beta_0$ and $\beta_{CM}$
characterize large and small wavelength fluctuations of the interface,
respectively. These finds were also observed in three distinct lattice models,
in which the lattice-imposed anisotropy is absent.

probability has a power law dependence with the number of occupied nearest
neighbors. Large scale simulations ($N\gtrsim 4\times 10^9$ particles) were
used to determine the time evolution of $w$. We found that a suitable choice of
the power exponent removes the lattice-induced cluster anisotropy and provides
a growth exponent in very good agreement with the KPZ universality class. Also,
the present model corroborates the results found in off-lattice simulations, in
which the center of mass fluctuations are considered in the interface scaling

diffusion decoupled from the spin dynamics. It is shown that there exist
several qualitatively different dynamic behaviors of the spin density, which

sticky-hard-sphere (SHS) potential, describing hard spheres interacting via
strong and very short-ranged attractive forces, give rise, within the
Percus-Yevick (PY) approximation, to a system of coupled quadratic equations
which, in general, cannot be solved either analytically or numerically. We
review and compare two recent alternative proposals, which we have attempted to
by-pass this difficulty. In the first one, truncating the density expansion of
the direct correlation functions, we have considered approximations simpler
than the PY one. These $C_{n}$ approximations can be systematically improved.
We have been able to provide a complete analytical description of polydisperse
SHS fluids by using the simplest two orders $C_{0}$ and $C_{1}$, respectively.
Such a simplification comes at the price of a lower accuracy in the phase
diagram, but has the advantage of providing an analytical description of
various new phenomena associated with the onset of polydispersity in phase
equilibria (e.g. fractionation). The second approach is based on a perturbative
expansion of the polydisperse PY solution around its monodisperse counterpart.
This approach provides a sound approximation to the real phase behavior, at the
cost of considering only weak polydispersity. Although a final seattlement on
the soundness of the latter method would require numerical simulations for the
polydisperse Baxter model, we argue that this approach is expected to keep
correctly into account the effects of polydispersity, at least qualitatively.

governed by small nonlinear effects. It is concluded that the free charge
compensation of bound polarization charges can lead to substantial reduction of
the domain wall mobility even in the case when the mobility of free charge
carriers is high. This mobility reduction gives rise to an additional imprint
mechanism which may play essential role in switching properties of

Among the interesting aspects of the electronic structure of the materials are
the contributions from both $A$ and $B$ atoms to states near the Fermi energy
and to the total magnetic moment. The magnitude of the total magnetic moment,
which depends as well on the kind of $C$ atoms, shows a trend consistent with
the Slater-Pauling type behavior in several classes of these compounds. The
localized moment in these magnetic compounds resides at the $B$ site. Other
than in the classical Cu$_2$-based Heusler compounds, the $A$ atoms in Co$_2$,
Fe$_2$, and Mn$_2$ based compounds may contribute pronounced to the total
magnetic moment.

step-by-step manner. The Kondo temperature increases from 105 to 170 K with a
decreasing the number of nearest neighbor molecules from six to zero. This
Kondo temperature variation is originated from the scattering of surface
electrons by the molecules located at the edges of the molecular layer, which
reduces spin-electron coupling strength for the molecules inside the layer.
Investigations on different molecular arrangements indicate that the observed

applied to matrices over the binary field, yields a powerful decomposition
theory for binary linear codes. In this paper, we give an overview of this code
decomposition theory, and discuss some of its implications in the context of
the recently discovered formulation of maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding of a
binary linear code over a discrete memoryless channel as a linear programming
problem. We translate matroid-theoretic results of Gr\""otschel and Truemper
from the combinatorial optimization literature to give examples of non-trivial
families of codes for which the ML decoding problem can be solved in time
polynomial in the length of the code. One such family is that consisting of
codes $C$ for which the codeword polytope is identical to the Koetter-Vontobel
fundamental polytope derived from the entire dual code $C^\perp$. However, we
also show that such families of codes are not good in a coding-theoretic sense
-- either their dimension or their minimum distance must grow sub-linearly with
codelength. As a consequence, we have that decoding by linear programming, when
applied to good codes, cannot avoid failing occasionally due to the presence of
pseudocodewords.

the bound. Furthermore, we show how the encodings can be extended to LTL with
past operators (PLTL). The generalised encoding is still of linear size, but
cannot detect minimal length counterexamples. By using the virtual unrolling
technique minimal length counterexamples can be captured, however, the size of
the encoding is quadratic in the specification. We also extend virtual
unrolling to Buchi automata, enabling them to accept minimal length
counterexamples.
  Our BMC encodings can be made incremental in order to benefit from
incremental SAT technology. With fairly small modifications the incremental
encoding can be further enhanced with a termination check, allowing us to prove
properties with BMC. Experiments clearly show that our new encodings improve
performance of BMC considerably, particularly in the case of the incremental
encoding, and that they are very competitive for finding bugs. An analysis of
the liveness-to-safety transformation reveals many similarities to the BMC
encodings in this paper. Using the liveness-to-safety translation with
BDD-based invariant checking results in an efficient method to find shortest
counterexamples that complements the BMC-based approach.

generators of the symmetries on the phase space. In particular, this provides a
criterion for the preservation of supersymmetries. For bosonic symmetries
corresponding to diffeomorphisms, our prescription coincides with the method of
Wald et al.
  We then illustrate these methods in the case of certain supergravity theories
in $d=4$. In minimal AdS supergravity, the boundary conditions such that the
supercharges exist as Hamiltonian generators of supersymmetry transformations
are unique within the usual framework in which the boundary metric is fixed. In
extended ${\mathcal N}=4$ AdS supergravity, or more generally in the presence
of chiral matter superfields, we find that there exist many boundary conditions
preserving ${\mathcal N}=1$ supersymmetry for which corresponding generators
exist. These choices are shown to correspond to a choice of certain arbitrary
boundary ``superpotentials,'' for suitably defined ``boundary superfields.'' We
also derive corresponding formulae for the conserved bosonic charges, such as
energy, in those theories, and we argue that energy is always positive, for any
supersymmetry-preserving boundary conditions. We finally comment on the
relevance and interpretation of our results within the AdS-CFT correspondence.

cosmic string or the wedge disclination in solids. Its another, equally
important, function is to be a representative of quasiregular singularities.
  From all these of views it seems interesting to find out whether there exist
other similar singularities. To specify what ""similar"" means I introduce the
notion of the string-like singularity, which is, roughly speaking, an
absolutely mild singularity concentrated on a curve or on a 2-surface S
(depending on whether the space is three- of four-dimensional). A few such
singularities are already known: the aforementioned conical singularity, two
its Lorentzian versions, the ""spinning string"", the ""screw dislocation"", and
Tod's spacetime. In all these spacetimes S is a straight line (or a plane) and
one may wonder if this is an inherent property of the string-like
singularities. The aim of this paper is to construct string-like singularities
with less trivial S. These include flat spacetimes in which S is a spiral, or
even a loop. If such singularities exist in nature (in particular, as an
approximation to gravitational field of strings) their cosmological and
astrophysical manifestations must differ drastically from those of the
conventional cosmic strings. Likewise, being realized as topological defects in
crystals such loops and spirals will probably also have rather unusual
properties.

functions, in turn, are determined by correlations of momentum flow operators
with each other and with light-like Wilson lines, which describe the coupling
of soft, wide-angle radiation to jets. We observe that leading power
corrections to the mean values of event shapes are determined by the
correlation of a single momentum flow operator with the relevant Wilson lines.
This generalizes arguments for the universality of leading power corrections
based on the low-scale behavior of the running coupling or resummation. We also
show how a study of the angularity event shapes can provide information on
correlations involving multiple momentum flow operators, giving a window to the
system of QCD dynamics that underlies the variety of event shape functions. In

space that experience a decay to a collapsing space, or to a Minkowski vacuum,
never return back to dS space. The channels of irreversible vacuum decay serve
as sinks for the probability flow. The existence of such sinks is a
distinguishing feature of the string theory landscape. We describe relations
between several different probability measures for eternal inflation taking
into account the existence of the sinks. The local (comoving) description of
the inflationary multiverse suffers from the so-called Boltzmann brain (BB)
problem unless the probability of the decay to the sinks is sufficiently large.
We show that some versions of the global (volume-weighted) description do not
have this problem even if one ignores the existence of the sinks. We argue that
if the number of different vacua in the landscape is large enough, the
anthropic solution of the cosmological constant problem in the string landscape
scenario should be valid for a broad class of the probability measures which
solve the BB problem. If this is correct, the solution of the cosmological
constant problem may be essentially measure-independent. Finally, we describe a
simplified approach to the calculations of anthropic probabilities in the
landscape, which is less ambitious but also less ambiguous than other methods.

bulk scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter on two codimension
one parallel branes in a $(D+1)$-dimensional background spacetime
${\mathrm{AdS}}_{D1+1}\times \Sigma $ with a warped internal space $\Sigma $.
It is assumed that on the branes the field obeys Robin boundary conditions.
Using the generalized zeta function technique in combination with contour
integral representations, the surface energies on the branes are presented in
the form of the sums of single brane and second brane induced parts. For the
geometry of a single brane both regions, on the left (L-region) and on the
right (R-region), of the brane are considered. The surface densities for
separate L- and R-regions contain pole and finite contributions. For an
infinitely thin brane taking these regions together, in odd spatial dimensions
the pole parts cancel and the total surface energy is finite. The parts in the
surface densities generated by the presence of the second brane are finite for
all nonzero values of the interbrane separation. The contribution of the
Kaluza-Klein modes along $\Sigma $ is investigated in various limiting cases.
It is shown that for large distances between the branes the induced surface
densities give rise to an exponentially suppressed cosmological constant on the
brane. In the higher dimensional generalization of the Randall-Sundrum
braneworld model, for the interbrane distances solving the hierarchy problem,
the cosmological constant generated on the visible brane is of the right order
of magnitude with the value suggested by the cosmological observations.

constructed. The structure then revealed turns out to be that of a strongly

  In the present paper, the framework will be connected to more conventional
field theoretic concepts. The Fock complex vertex operator implementation of
the interactions in the BRST-BV formulation of the theory will be elaborated.
The relation between the vertex order expansion and homological perturbation
theory will be clarified. A formal non-obstruction argument is reviewed. The
syntactically derived sh-Lie algebra structure is semantically mapped to the
Fock complex implementation and it is shown that the recursive equations
governing the higher order vertices are reproduced.
  Global symmetries and subsidiary conditions are discussed and as a result the
tracelessness constraints are discarded. Thus all equations needed to compute
the vertices to any order are collected. The framework is general enough to
encompass all possible interaction terms.
  Finally, the abstract framework itself will be strengthened by showing that
it can be naturally phrased in terms of the theory of categories.

fixed p that provides an effective means for ascertaining whether or not an
arbitrary integer c is a cubic residue modulo p. As an illustration of this
technique, we determine whether 1982 is a cubic residue modulo the 131-digit
prime p=(3^19+5^82)/4, a question which is essentially impossible to answer
with Lehmer's original criterion.

similar asymptotic results under independence together with convergence to zero
of one of a series of dependence measures including the multivariate extension
of Pearson's correlation, the relative entropy or other multivariate divergence
measures. A closely related result involves conditions for convergence in

time series $\{X_t\}$ in terms of weak convergence of
$h(\xi_t,\xi_{t+1},...,\xi_{t+m-1})$, where $\{\xi_t\}$ is a sequence of

often not known. Thus, the most powerful test or other optimal procedure for
one model, e.g. recessive, may be quite inefficient if another model, e.g.
dominant, describes the inheritance process. Rather than choose among the
procedures that are optimal for a particular model, it is preferable to see a
method that has high efficiency across a family of scientifically realistic
models. Statisticians well recognize that this situation is analogous to the
selection of an estimator of location when the form of the underlying
distribution is not known. We review how the concepts and techniques in the
efficiency robustness literature that are used to obtain efficiency robust
estimators and rank tests can be adapted for the analysis of genetic data. In
particular, several statistics have been used to test for a genetic association
between a disease and a candidate allele or marker allele from data collected
in case-control studies. Each of them is optimal for a specific inheritance
model and we describe and compare several robust methods. The most suitable
robust test depends somewhat on the range of plausible genetic models. When
little is known about the inheritance process, the maximum of the optimal
statistics for the extreme models and an intermediate one is usually the
preferred choice. Sometimes one can eliminate a mode of inheritance, e.g. from
prior studies of family pedigrees one may know whether the disease skips
generations or not. If it does, the disease is much more likely to follow a
recessive model than a dominant one. In that case, a simpler linear combination
of the optimal tests for the extreme models can be a robust choice.

the leaves represent the units of the population, interior nodes represent
partial sums of the population, and the root node represents the total sum of
the population. We prove that the optimal sampling pattern varies dramatically

optimal for trees with ``positive correlation progression'', it provides the
worst possible sampling with ``negative correlation progression.'' As an
analysis tool, we introduce and study a class of independent innovations trees

Couette flow in a channel is studied in the limit of strong rotation and
stratification. An energy argument is used to show that unstable perturbations
must have large wavenumbers. This motivates the use of a WKB-approach which, in
the first instance, provides an approximation for the dispersion relation of
the various waves that can propagate in the flow. These are Kelvin waves,
trapped near the channel walls, and inertia-gravity waves with or without
turning points.
  Although, the wave phase speeds are found to be real to all algebraic orders
in the Rossby number, we establish that the flow, whether cyclonic or
anticyclonic, is unconditionally unstable. This is the result of linear
resonances between waves with oppositely signed wave momenta. We derive
asymptotic estimates for the instability growth rates, which are exponentially
small in the Rossby number, and confirm them by numerical computations. Our
results, which extend those of Kushner et al (1998) and Yavneh et al (2001),
highlight the limitations of the so-called balanced models, widely used in
geophysical fluid dynamics, which filter out Kelvin and inertia-gravity waves
and hence predict the stability of the Couette flow. They are also relevant to
the stability of Taylor-Couette flows and of astrophysical accretion discs.

problems related to the interpretation of Quantum Mechanics could emerge from a
re-evaluation of the main paradox of early Greek thought: the paradox of Being
and non-Being, and the solutions presented to it by Plato and Aristotle.
Plato's and Aristotle's systems are argued here to do on the ontological level
essentially the same: to introduce stability in the world by introducing the
notion of a separable, stable object, for which a principle of contradiction is
valid: an object cannot be and not-be at the same place at the same time. After
leaving Aristotelian metaphysics, early modern science had to cope with these
problems: it did so by introducing ``space'' as the seat of stability, and
``time'' as the theater of motion. But the ontological structure present in
this solution remained the same. Therefore the fundamental notion `separable
system', related to the notions observation and measurement, themselves related
to the modern concepts of space and time, appears to be intrinsically
problematic, because it is inextricably connected to classical logic on the
ontological level. We see therefore the problems dealt with by quantum logic
not as merely formal, and the problem of `non-locality' as related to it,
indicating the need to re-think the notions `system', `entity', as well as the
implications of the operation `measurement', which is seen here as an
application of classical logic (including its ontological consequences) on the
material world.

single-stranded (ss) RNA viruses organise a significant part of their genome in
a dodecahedral cage as a RNA duplex structure that mirrors the symmetry of the
capsid. Bruinsma and Rudnick have suggested a model for the structural
organisation of the RNA in these cages. It is the purpose of this paper to
further develop their approach based on results from the areas of graph theory
and DNA network engineering. We start by suggesting a scenario for pariacoto
virus, a representative of this class of viruses, that is energetically more
favorable than those derived previously. We then show that it is a
representative of a whole family of cage structures that abide to the same
construction principle, and then derive the energetically optimal configuration
for a second family of cage structures along similar lines. Finally, we give
reasons for the conjecture that these two families are more likely to occur in
nature than other scenarios.

the analysis of complex, stochastic models of gene regulatory networks. This
task involves (a) identifying observables that best describe the state of these
complex systems and (b) characterizing the dynamics of the observables. In a
previous paper [13], we assumed that good observables were known a priori, and
presented an equation-free approach to approximate coarse-grained quantities
(i.e, effective drift and diffusion coefficients) that characterize the
long-time behavior of the observables. Here we use diffusion maps [9] to
extract appropriate observables (""reduction coordinates"") in an automated
fashion; these involve the leading eigenvectors of a weighted Laplacian on a
graph constructed from network simulation data. We present lifting and
restriction procedures for translating between physical variables and these
data-based observables. These procedures allow us to perform equation-free
coarse-grained, computations characterizing the long-term dynamics through the
design and processing of short bursts of stochastic simulation initialized at
appropriate values of the data-based observables.

undone by collecting classical information from the environment and using such

example of environment-assisted correction. Moreover, we present the

of two dipole-dipole interacting atoms, each modelled by two complete sets of
angular momentum multiplets. We establish the breakdown of the few-level
approximation by first proving the intuitive result that the dipole-dipole
induced energy shifts between collective two-atom states depend on the length
of the vector connecting the atoms, but not on its orientation, if complete and
degenerate multiplets are considered. A careful analysis of our findings
reveals that the simplification of the atomic level scheme by artificially
omitting Zeeman sublevels in a few-level approximation generally leads to
incorrect predictions. We find that this breakdown can be traced back to the
dipole-dipole coupling of transitions with orthogonal dipole moments. Our
interpretation enables us to identify special geometries in which partial
few-level approximations to two- or three-level systems are valid.

about the actual state of a physical system and are represented in standard

considers a (pure) entangled state of a compound system $\Omega$ and performs
partial traces on the projection operator representing it. Yet, they do not
represent mixed states (or proper mixtures) of the subsystems in this case, but
improper mixtures, since the coefficients in the convex sums expressing them
never bear the ignorance interpretation. Hence, one cannot attribute states to
the subsystems of a compound physical system in QM (subentity problem). We
discuss here two alternative proposals that can be worked out within the
Brussels and Lecce approaches. We firstly summarize the general framework
provided by the former, which suggests that improper mixtures could be
considered as new pure states. Then, we show that improper mixtures can be
considered as true (yet nonpure) states also according to the latter. The two
proposals seem to be compatible notwithstanding their different terminologies.
