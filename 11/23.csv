Planck mass, may obtain different values within different universes in an
encompassing multiverse. We investigate the range over which the Planck mass
may scan while still satisfying anthropic constraints. The window for
anthropically allowed values of the Planck mass may have important consequences
for landscape predictions. For example, if the likelihood to observe some value
of the Planck mass is weighted by the inflationary expansion factors of the
universes that contain that value, then it appears extremely unlikely to
observe the value of the Planck mass that is measured within our universe. This
is another example of the runaway inflation problem discussed in recent
literature. We also show that the window for the Planck mass significantly
weakens the anthropic constraint upon the cosmological constant when both are
allowed to vary over a landscape.

have a definite frequency as in a normal mode decomposition, and numerical
integration of a coupled set of amplitude equations is required to characterize
their time dependence. Their generic time dependence, however, is oscillatory
with slowly-varying frequency and amplitude, and one can construct accurate
analytical solutions by applying the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method to the
full set of amplitude equations. The solutions have the following properties:
1) Their accuracy increases with wavenumber, so that most perturbations that
fit within the disk are well-approximated as modes with time-dependent
frequencies and amplitudes. 2) They can be broadly classed as incompressive and
compressive perturbations, the former including the nonaxisymmetric extension
of magnetorotationally unstable modes, and the latter being the extension of
fast and slow modes to a differentially-rotating medium. 3) Wave action is
conserved, implying that their energy varies with frequency. 4) Their shear
stress is proportional to the slope of their frequency, so that they transport
angular momentum outward (inward) when their frequency increases (decreases).
The complete set of solutions constitutes a comprehensive linear test suite for
numerical MHD algorithms that incorporate a background shear flow. I conclude
with a brief discussion of possible astrophysical applications.

wide range of masses. One currently favoured explanation is that less massive
galaxies are less able to retain the gas and stellar ejecta and thus may lose
the freshly produced metals in the form of galactic outflows. Galaxies with a
low current star formation rate have been found to contain star clusters up to
a lower mass limit. Since stars are predominately born in clusters, and less
massive clusters have been found to be less likely to contain very massive
stars, this implies that in environments or at times of low star formation, the
stellar initial mass function does not extend to as high masses as during high
star formation epochs. It is found that the oxygen yield is reduced by a factor
of thirty when the star formation rate is decreased by 3 to 4 orders of
magnitude. With this concept, chemical evolution models for galaxies of a range
of masses are computed and shown to provide an excellent fit to the
mass-metallicity relation derived recently by Tremonti et al. (2004).
Furthermore, the models match the relation between galaxy mass and effective
yield. Thus, the scenario of a variable integrated stellar initial mass
function, which is based on the concept of formation of stars in clusters, may
offer an attractive alternative or partial explanation of the mass-metallicity
relation in galaxies.

have shown from theoretical calculations on the stellar evolution that the
colors of MS stars are shifted to those of the observed blue MS if the surface
layers are polluted by He-rich materials with the mass of ~ 0.1 solar mass.
Stars are supposed to be polluted through numerous encounters with the ejecta
descended from massive asymptotic giant-branch (AGB) stars. Two populations of
stars with different kinematics exceptionally observed in omega Cen indicate
that kinematically cooler stars are more polluted through encounters with AGB
ejecta than kinematically hotter ones because the accretion rate is inversely
proportional to the cube of the relative velocity. We propose that both of
these factors split the MS in omega Cen. This theoretical scheme explains why
only omega Cen exhibit a double MS and matches the amount of He necessary to
produce the blue MS with that supplied from massive AGB stars. Furthermore, we
predict that even if globular clusters (GCs) possess only one generation of
stars, the velocity dispersion of stars broaden the MS in the color-magnitude
diagram as long as the GCs are massive enough to keep the AGB ejecta after the
burst of star formation. This view explains the broad MS recently found in the
GC NGC 2808 which exhibits no scatter in [Fe/H] and thus is likely to consist
of a single generation of stars unlike the case of omega Cen.

forced precession, we propose a quark planet model to this precession henomenon
instead, in which the pulsar is torqued by a quark planet. We construct this
model by constraining mass of the pulsar ($M_{\rm psr}$), mass of the planet
($M_{\rm pl}$) and orbital radius of the planet ($r_{\rm pl}$). Five aspects
are considered: derived relation between $M_{\rm psr}$ and $r_{\rm pl}$,
movement of the pulsar around the center of mass, ratio of $M_{\rm psr}$ and
$M_{\rm pl}$, gravitational wave radiation timescale of the planetary system,
and death-line criterion. We also calculate the range of precession period
derivative and gravitational wave strength (at earth) permitted by the model.
Under reasonable parameters, the observed phenomenon can be understood by a
pulsar ($10^{-4}\sim10^{-1}M_{\odot}$) with a quark planet
($10^{-8}\sim10^{-3}M_{\odot}$) orbiting it. According to the calculations

canonical steep-shallow-normal decay typical of early X-ray afterglows has been
monitored optically. We present a detailed analysis of the intrinsic
extinction, elemental abundances and spectral energy distribution. From the
absorption measured in the low X-ray band we find possible evidence for an
overabundance of some alpha elements such as oxygen, [O/Zn]=0.7+/-0.3, or,
alternatively, for a significant presence of molecular gas. The IR-to-X-ray
Spectral Energy Distribution measured at 80 minutes after the burst is
consistent with the cooling break lying between the optical and X-ray bands.
Extensive modelling of the intrinsic extinction suggests dust with big grains
or grey extinction profiles. The early optical break is due either to an energy
injection episode or, less probably, to a stratified wind environment for the
circumburst medium.

accurate observational constraints to structure of its component stars. In
addition to the classical non-seismic constraints, there are also seismic
constraints for the interior models of $\alpha$ Cen A and B. These two types of
constraint give very different values for the age of the system. While we
obtain 8.9 Gyr for the age of the system from the non-seismic constraints, the
seismic constraints imply that the age is about 5.6-5.9 Gyr. There may be
observational or theoretical reasons for this discrepancy, which can be found
by careful consideration of similar stars. The $\alpha$ Cen binary system, with
its solar type components, is also suitable for testing the stellar mass
dependence of the mixing-length parameter for convection derived from the
binaries of Hyades. The values of the mixing-length parameter for $\alpha$ Cen
A and B are 2.10 and 1.90 for the non-seismic constraints. If we prioritize to
the seismic constraints, we obtain 1.64 and 1.91 for $\alpha$ Cen A and B,
respectively. By taking into account of these two contrasting cases for stellar
mass dependence of the mixing-length parameter, we derive two expressions for
its time dependence, which are also compatible with the mass dependence of the
mixing-length parameter derived from the Hyades stars. For assessment, these
expressions should be tested in other stellar systems and clusters.

the plane found by Sawa & Fujimoto 2005. Why? The second part of this study is
devoted to answer this question and to find a dynamical justification for the
planar distribution. To this aim, we apply the Hamilton Method (Minimum Action)
to investigate the dynamics of the two major system of the Local Group, Milky
Way and Andromeda, under the action of external forces exerted by nearby
galaxies or groups external to the Local Group. We find that the planar
istribution is fully compatible with the minimum action and that the external
force field is likely parallel to the plane. It pulls the galaxies of the Local
Group without altering their planar distribution. Special care is paid to
evaluate the robustness of this result. Conclusion: in this paper we have
examined the spatial distribution of galaxies in the Local Group. They are
confined to a plane that can be statistically and dynamically understood as the
result of the Minimum Action. The planar distribution seems to be stable for a
large fraction of the Hubble time. The external force field, that has likely
been constant over the same time interval, does not alter the planar
distribution as it is nearly parallel to it. Effects due to undetected halos of
sole Dark Matter are briefly discussed. They could be a point of uncertainty of
the present study.

loops at low temperatures caused by spin glass ordering at the interface. In

theory is commonly applied on the premise that ""low energy"" describes both the
spin and charge sectors. However, when the interactions in the system are very
strong, as they typically are at low particle densities, the ratio of spin to
charge energy may become exponentially small. It is then possible at very low
temperatures for the energy to be low compared to the characteristic charge
energy, but still high compared to the characteristic spin energy. This energy
window of near ground-state charge degrees of freedom, but highly thermally

using first-principles calculations. We show that this phenomenon is realizable
if in-plane homogeneous electric fields are applied across the zigzag-shaped
edges of the graphene nanoribbons, and that their magnetic property can be
controlled by the external electric fields. The results are not only of
scientific interests in the interplay between electric fields and electronic
spin degree of freedom in solids but may also open a new path to explore
spintronics at nanometre scale, based on graphene.

follows : for each base $(i)$ of the sequence of length N, we consider the

sequence. We numerically compute the probability distributions $P_1(w)$ of the
maximal weight, the probability distribution $\Pi(Y_2)$ of the parameter
$Y_2(i)= \sum_j w_i^2(j)$, as well as the average values of the moments
$Y_k(i)= \sum_j w_i^k(j)$. We find that there are two important temperatures
$T_c<T_{gap}$. For $T>T_{gap}$, the distribution $P_1(w)$ vanishes at some
value $w_0(T)<1$, and accordingly the moments $\bar{Y_k(i)}$ decay
exponentially in $k$. For $T<T_{gap}$, the distributions $P_1(w)$ and
$\Pi(Y_2)$ present the characteristic Derrida-Flyvbjerg singularities at
$w,Y_2=1/n$ for $n=1,2..$. In particular, there exists a temperature-dependent
exponent $\mu(T)$ that governs these singularities and the decay of the moments
$ \bar{Y_k(i)} \sim 1/k^{\mu(T)}$. The exponent $\mu(T)$ grows from
$\mu(T=0)=0$ up to $\mu(T_{gap}) \sim 2$. The study of spatial properties
indicates that the critical temperature $T_c$ where the roughness exponent
changes from the low temperature value $\zeta \sim 0.67$ to the high
temperature value $\zeta \sim 0.5$ corresponds to the exponent $\mu(T_c)=1$.
For $T<T_c$, there exists frozen pairs of all sizes, whereas for $T_c< T
<T_{gap}$, there exists frozen pairs, but only up to some characteristic length
diverging as $\xi(T) \sim 1/(T_c-T)^{\nu}$ with $\nu \simeq 2$. The
similarities and differences with the weight statistics in L\'evy sums and in

increase. We describe an algorithm which compensates for this message overhead

regularised by a finite spatial profile. We show, under mild technical
assumptions, that the zero size limit of the detector response is well defined,
independent of the choice of the profile function, and given by a manifestly
finite integral formula that no longer involves epsilon-regulators or limits.
Applications to specific trajectories are discussed, recovering in particular
the thermal result for uniform acceleration. Extensions of the model to de
Sitter space are also considered.

dwarf (WD) and a brown dwarf (BD) in a close circular orbit of about 116 min.
I, first, constrain the admissible range of values for the inclination i by
noting that, from looking for deviations from the third Kepler law, the
quadrupole mass moment Q would assume unlikely large values, incompatible with
zero at more than 1-sigma level for i < 35 deg and i > 43 deg. Then, by
conservatively assuming that the most likely values for i are those that
prevent such an anomalous behavior of Q, i.e. those for which the third Kepler
law is an adequate modeling of the orbital period, I obtain i=39 +/- 2 deg.
Such a result is incompatible with the value i=35 deg quoted in literature by
more than 2 sigma. Conversely, it is shown that the white dwarf's mass range
obtained from spectroscopic measurements is compatible with my experimental
range, but not for i=35 deg. As a consequence, my estimate of $i$ yields an
orbital separation of a=(0.59 +/- 0.05)R_Sun and an equilibrium temperature of
BD of T_eq=(2087 +/- 154)K which differ by 10% and 4%, respectively, from the

optimisation of further essential properties. We summarise simulation results

so-called mu term inevitably involves a massless pseudoscalar boson eta, which
is problematic for b-physics and cosmological axion limit. With the mu term
introduced by hand, the eta boson acquires mass m_eta ~ mu, which can be
lighter than half the Higgs boson mass in a large portion of the parameter
space. In addition, the introduced mu term generates sizable coupling of
H-eta-eta. The Higgs boson can dominantly decay into a pair of eta's especially
when mH below the WW threshold. Another new decay channel of H->Z+eta can be
dominant or compatible with H -> WW for mH above the Z+eta threshold. We show
that the LEP bound on the Higgs boson mass is loosened to some extent due to
this new H->eta eta decay channel as well as the reduced coupling of H-Z-Z. The
Higgs boson mass bound falls to about 110 GeV for f=3-4 TeV. Since the eta
boson decays mainly into a bb pair, H-> eta eta -> 4b and H-> Z eta -> Z bb
open up other interesting search channels in the pursuit of the Higgs boson in
the future experiments. We discuss on these issues.

convolutions of universal distribution and fragmentation functions with gluonic

gauge-invariant weighted sums of Feynman diagrams. The weight factors are a
direct consequence of the (diagram-dependence of) gauge links. The best known
consequence of the gauge links is the generation of the Sivers effect that is a
source for single-spin asymmetries. Moreover, due to the dependence of the
gauge links on the color-flow of the hard diagram the Sivers effect in SIDIS
enters with opposite sign as it does in Drell-Yan scattering. The weight
factors in the gluonic pole cross sections are the appropriate generalizations
to more complicated processes of this relative sign difference. Furthermore, it

presence of the magnetic field is seen to break the degeneracy of the vacuum

general connection between the Hagedorn temperature of planar N=4 SYM on R x
S^3 in the decoupling limit and the thermodynamics of the Heisenberg chain.
This is used to study the Hagedorn temperature for small and large value of the
effective coupling. We consider the dual decoupling limit of type IIB strings
on AdS_5 x S^5. We find a Penrose limit compatible with the decoupling limit
that gives a magnetic pp-wave background. The breaking of the symmetry by the
magnetic field on the gauge theory side is seen to have a geometric counterpart
in the derivation of the Penrose limit. We take the decoupling limit of the
pp-wave spectrum and succesfully match the resulting spectrum to the low energy
spectrum on the gauge theory side. This enables us to match the Hagedorn
temperature of the pp-wave to the Hagedorn temperature of the gauge theory for
large effective coupling. This generalizes the results of hep-th/0608115 to the

strings may all be different, as may be found for example in a network of
$(p,q)$ cosmic superstrings. We concentrate on three aspects of junction
dynamics. First we consider the propagation of small amplitude waves across a
static three-string junction. Then, generalizing our earlier work, we determine
the kinematic constraints on two colliding strings with different tensions. As
before, the important conclusion is that strings do not always reconnect with a
third string; they can pass straight through one another (or in the case of
non-abelian strings become stuck in an X configuration), the constraint
depending on the angle at which the strings meet, on their relative velocity,
and on the ratios of the string tensions. For example, if the two colliding
strings have equal tensions, then for ultra-relativistic initial velocities
they pass through one another. However, if their tensions are sufficiently
different they can reconnect. Finally, we consider the global properties of
junctions and strings in a network. Assuming that, in a network, the incoming
waves at a junction are independently randomly distributed, we determine the
r.m.s. velocities of strings and calculate the average speed at which a
junction moves along each of the three strings from which it is formed. Our
findings suggest that junction dynamics may be such as to preferentially remove
the heavy strings from the network leaving a network of predominantly light
strings. Furthermore the r.m.s. velocity of strings in a network with junctions
is smaller than 1/\sqrt{2}, the result for conventional Nambu-Goto strings
without junctions in Minkowski spacetime.

This includes the Calabi-Yau like compactifications with (2,2) world-sheet
superconformal symmetry, as well as more general vacua with only (2,0)
superconformal symmetry. In contrast to our earlier classification that
utilized a montecarlo technique to generate random sets of GGSO phases, in this
paper we present the results of a complete classification of the subclass of
the models in which the four dimensional gauge group arises solely from the
null sector. In line with the results of the statistical classification we find
a bell shaped distribution that peaks at vanishing net number of generations

producing a modular symbol (for GL2(Q)!!!) with values in locally constant
distributions on M2(Q) taking values in the space of cuspidal power series in
two variables (see Definition 5). We can recover the above cited result by
restricting to a principal open invariant for the action of $\Gamma_1(N)$ and
to the homogeneous degree $k-2$ part of the power series. We should also
mention that Colmez [Col] constructs similar distributions (zEis(k; j)). The
modification in the definition of such distributions allow us to observe
further relations among these distributions (Manin Relations) which in turn
makes possible the existence of our construction. In the last section we
exhibit some instances of these relations for the full modular group.

constituents. The relevant probability is the volume fraction of the elementary
constituents that belong to a given constituent and undergo a given stimulus.
Assuming only obvious constraints in MAXENT means describing a maximally
disordered material. This is proved to have the same average stimulus in each
constituent. By adding a constraint in MAXENT, a new model, potentially
interesting e.g. for texture prediction, is obtained.

polypeptide chain is able to knot itself during the folding process to form
these highly intricate protein topologies is not known. Here, we perform a
computational study on the 160-amino acid homodimeric protein YibK which, like
other proteins in the SpoU family of MTases, contains a deep trefoil knot in
its C-terminal region. In this study, we use a coarse-grained C-alpha-chain
representation and Langevin dynamics to study folding kinetics. We find that
specific, attractive nonnative interactions are critical for knot formation. In
the absence of these interactions, i.e. in an energetics driven entirely by
native interactions, knot formation is exceedingly unlikely. Further, we find,
in concert with recent experimental data on YibK, two parallel folding pathways
which we attribute to an early and a late formation of the trefoil knot,
respectively. For both pathways, knot formation occurs before dimerization. A
bioinformatics analysis of the SpoU family of proteins reveals further that the
critical nonnative interactions may originate from evolutionary conserved
hydrophobic segments around the knotted region.

fitness. The second is a simple model that explicitly describes
genotype-to-phenotype and phenotype-to-fitness maps allowing for neutrality at

theoretical predictions for the Renyi information obtained by Eve as a function
of the errors she imparts to Alice and Bob's sifted key bits. The current
experiment is a physical simulation of a true attack, because Eve has access to
Bob's physical receiver module. This experiment illustrates the utility of an
efficient deterministic quantum logic for performing realistic physical
simulations of quantum information processing functions.

lithium waves. Using an atom interferometer, we have measured the real and
imaginary part of the index of refraction $n$ for argon, krypton and xenon, as
a function of the gas density for several velocities of the lithium beam. The
linear dependence of $(n-1)$ with the gas density is well verified. The total
collision cross-section deduced from the imaginary part is in very good
agreement with traditional measurements of this quantity. Finally, as predicted
by theory, the real and imaginary parts of $(n-1)$ and their ratio $\rho$
exhibit glory oscillations.

Heisenberg formalism. We derive an original two-party generalized separability
criteria, and from this describe a novel physical understanding of
entanglement. We find that entanglement may be considered as fundamentally a
local effect, and therefore as a separable computational resource from
nonlocality. We show how entanglement differs from correlation physically, and
explore the implications of this new conception of entanglement for the notion
of classicality. We find that this understanding of entanglement extends
naturally to multipartite cases.

into an analytic solution of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. This allows
for the analytical description of the dynamics of a two level system with
damping. This method shows that damping turns the linear Schr\""{o}dinger
equation of a two-level system into a nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation. As
applications, it is shown that damping has a relatively mild influence on
self-induced transparency but destroys dynamical localization.

the path integral formalism. In particular, we obtain the path integral kernel
for the linearly damped harmonic oscillator and a particle in a uniform
gravitational field with linearly or quadratically damped motion. In each case,
we study the evolution of Gaussian wavepackets and discuss the characteristic
features that help us distinguish between different types of damping. For
quadratic damping, we show that the action and equation of motion of such a
system has a connection with the zero dimensional version of a currently
popular scalar field theory. Furthermore we demonstrate that the equation of
motion (for quadratic damping) can be identified as a geodesic equation in a
fictitious two-dimensional space.
