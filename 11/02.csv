variability ever assembled. We characterize the long term photometric
variations of 49 CTTs with sufficient data to allow a robust statistical
analysis and propose an empirical classification scheme. Several patterns of
long term photometric variability are identified. The most common pattern,
exhibited by a group of 15 stars which includes T Tau itself, consists of low
level variability (Delta(V)<=0.4mag) with no significant changes occurring from
season to season over many years. A related subgroup of 22 stars exhibits a
similar stable long term variability pattern, though with larger amplitudes (up
to Delta(V)~1.6 mag). Besides these representative groups, we identify three
smaller groups of 3-5 stars each which have distinctive photometric properties.
The long term variability of most CTTs is fairly stable and merely reflects
shorter term variability due to cold and hot surface spots. Only a small
fraction of CTTs undergo significant brightness changes on the long term
(months, years), which probably arise from slowly varying circumstellar
extinction.

asymmetry of spiral galaxies. The resulting model adds the force of a scalar
potential of the host galaxy and of neighboring galaxies to the Newtonian
rotation velocity equation. The RC is partitioned radially into regions. The
form of the equation for each parameter of each region is the same with
differing proportionality constants. Integer values of each equation are
determined empirically for each galaxy. Among the sample galaxies, the global
properties of galaxies of B band luminosity, of position, and of orientation
determine the RC and RC asymmetry. The Source of the scalar field acts as a
monopole at distances of a few kpc from the centre of spiral galaxies. The
scalar potential field causes Newtonian mechanics to considerably underestimate
the mass in galaxies, which is the ``missing mass problem''. The SPM is
consistent with RC and RC asymmetry observations of the sample spiral galaxies.

$\gamma$ and $\gamma^\ast$ are calculated for two cosmological models:
Einstein-de Sitter and an $\Omega_{m_0}=0.3$, $\Omega_{\Lambda_0}=0.7$ standard

dynamical state as well as the mass of the cluster. The modelling of the cosmic
ray physics includes adiabatic CR transport processes, injection by supernovae
and cosmological structure formation shocks, as well as CR thermalization by
Coulomb interaction and catastrophic losses by hadronic interactions. While the
relative pressure contained in CRs within the virial radius is of the order of
2 per cent in our non-radiative simulations, their contribution rises to 32 per
cent in our simulations with dissipative gas physics including radiative
cooling, star formation, and supernova feedback. Interestingly, in the
radiative simulations the relative CR pressure reaches high values of the order
of equipartition with the thermal gas in each cluster galaxy due to the fast
thermal cooling of gas which diminishes the thermal pressure support relative
to that in CRs. This also leads to a lower effective adiabatic index of the
composite gas that increases the compressibility of the intra-cluster medium.
This effect slightly increases the central density, thermal pressure and the
gas fraction. While the X-ray luminosity in low mass cool core clusters is
boosted by up to 40 per cent, the integrated Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect appears
to be remarkably robust and the total flux decrement only slightly reduced by
typically 2 per cent. The resolved Sunyaev-Zel'dovich maps, however, show a
larger variation with an increased central flux decrement. [abridged]

so efficient that it is difficult to reconcile the low observed cosmic

nucleosynthesis. In this paper we find, by modeling a red giant with a fully
three-dimensional hydrodynamic code and a full nucleosynthetic network, that
mixing arises in the supposedly stable and radiative zone between the
hydrogen-burning shell and the base of the convective envelope. This mixing is
due to Rayleigh-Taylor instability within a zone just above the

show that relativistic beaming of jet emission can indeed account for the high

with an approximative conformally flat treatment of general relativity to
systematically investigate the influence of the nuclear equation of state
(EoS), the neutron star masses, and the NS spin states prior to merging. We
employ the two non-zero temperature EoSs of Shen et al. (1998a,b) and Lattimer
& Swesty (1991). In addition, we use the cold EoS of Akmal et al. (1998) with a
simple ideal-gas-like extension according to Shibata & Taniguchi (2006), and an
ideal-gas EoS with parameters fitted to the supernuclear part of the Shen-EoS.
We estimate the mass sitting in a dilute high-angular momentum ``torus'' around
the future black hole (BH). The dynamics and outcome of the models is found to
depend strongly on the EoS and on the binary parameters. Larger torus masses
are found for asymmetric systems (up to ~0.3 M_sun for a mass ratio of 0.55),
for large initial NSs, and for a NS spin state which corresponds to a larger
total angular momentum. We find that the postmerger remnant collapses either
immediately or after a short time when employing the soft EoS of Lattimer&
Swesty, whereas no sign of post-merging collapse is found within tens of
dynamical timescales for all other EoSs used. The typical temperatures in the
torus are found to be about 3-10 MeV depending on the strength of the shear
motion at the collision interface between the NSs and thus depending on the
initial NS spins. About 10^{-3}-10^{-2} M_sun of NS matter become
gravitationally unbound during or right after the merging process. This matter
consists of a hot/high-entropy component from the collision interface and (only
in case of asymmetric systems) of a cool/low-entropy component from the spiral
arm tips. (abridged)

of metal-rich gas initiated by AGN activity to a certain fraction of our model
galaxies. The gas is added to the model ICM, where the evolution of the
metallicity distribution is calculated by the hydrodynamic simulations. For the
parameters describing the AGN content of clusters and their outflow properties,
we use the observationally most favorable values. We find that AGNs have the
potential to contribute significantly to the metal content of the ICM or even
explain the complete abundance, which is typically ~0.5 Z_sun in core regions.
Furthermore, the metals end up being inhomogeneously distributed, in accordance

reflection, presumably due to illumination of the optically-thick accretion
disk by the Comptonization spectrum. The two blackbody components, which the
soft-state data require, presumably arise from both the disk and the
neutron-star surface. The Comptonization probably takes place in a hot inner
flow irradiated by some of the blackbody photons. The spectral transitions are
shown to be associated with variations in the bolometric luminosity, most
likely proportional to the accretion rate. Indipendentely from the spectral

the dominant millimeter source in the cluster center is resolved into a pair of
protostars (L1641-N-MM1 and MM3), each driving a collimated outflow, and a more
extended, clumpy core. Low-velocity CO line-wing emission is widely spread over
much of the cluster area. We detect and map the distribution of several other

tentatively identify a velocity gradient over L1641-N-MM1 in CH3CN and OCS,
oriented roughly perpendicular to the outflow direction, perhaps indicative of
a circumstellar disk. An analysis of the energy and momentum load of the CO
outflows, along with the notion that apparently a large volume fraction is
affected by the multiple outflow activity, suggests that outflows from a
population of low-mass stars might have a significant impact on clustered (and
potentially high-mass) star formation.

exponentially decaying star-formation rate punctuated by bursts, to obtain
median-likelihood estimates for the light-weighted age, metallicity, stellar
mass and extinction for the galaxies. The ages lie in the range 4-10 Gyr,
peaking near 6 Gyr, with metallicities in the range -0.4<[Z/H]<0.4, peaking at
[Z/H] ~ 0.2. Only a few per cent of the spectra are better fit allowing for a
burst in addition to continuous star-formation. The total stellar masses of all
the galaxies are confined to a very narrow range. Our results broadly agree
with those of previous groups using an independent population synthesis code.
We find, however, that our choice in priors results in ages 1-2 Gyr smaller,
decreasing the peak star formation epoch from z=2.3 to z=1.3. We develop a
metal evolution model incorporating stochastic star-formation quenching
motivated by recent attempts to solve the `anti-hierarchical' formation problem
of ellipticals. Two scenarios emerge, a closed box with an effective stellar
yield of 0.26, and an accreting box with an effective stellar yield of 0.10.
Both scenarios require an IMF weighted towards massive stars and characteristic
star-formation quenching times of about 100 Myr, the expected lifetime of
luminous QSOs. The models predict an anti-correlation between the age and mean
metallicity similar to that observed.

due to the sloshing of the core, induced by the perturbation of the
gravitational potential associated with a past merger. The hydrodynamic
processes related to this perturbation have presumably produced a tail of lower
entropy, higher pressure and metal rich ICM, which extends behind the cold
front for about 500 kpc. The unique characteristics of A3558 are probably due

distinguishing feature of the theory is that its accuracy is controlled by a

to Fermi energy. The theory is therefore quantitatively accurate for a narrow
Feshbach resonance. In the case of a narrow s-wave resonance, our analysis
leads to a quantitative description of the crossover between a weakly-paired
BCS superconductor of overlapping Cooper pairs and a strongly-paired molecular
Bose-Einstein condensate of diatomic molecules. In the case of pairing via a
p-wave resonance, that we show is always narrow for a sufficiently low density,
we predict a detuning-temperature phase diagram, that in the course of a
BCS-BEC crossover can exhibit a host of thermodynamically-distinct phases
separated by quantum and classical phase transitions. For an intermediate
strength of the dipolar anisotropy, the system exhibits a p_x + i p_y paired
superfluidity that undergoes a topological phase transition between a
weakly-coupled gapless ground state at large positive detuning and a
strongly-paired fully-gapped molecular superfluid for a negative detuning. In
two dimensions the former state is characterized by a Pfaffian ground state
exhibiting topological order and non-Abelian vortex excitations familiar from

that Ru should have a mixed valence of Ru3+ and Ru4+ for LSMRO with low level
of Ru substitution, and an additional mixed valence of Ru4+ and Ru5+ with
higher Ru substitution. It is found that all measured physical properties
undergo pronounced anomalies due to the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase
transition, and the observed transport properties of LSMRO can be reasonably
understood from the viewpoint of polaronic transport. The Curie temperatures TC
determined from the magnetization measurements are consistently higher than
those of the metal-insulator transitions TMI determined from the transport
measurements. By replacing Mn with Ru, both TC and TMI decrease concurrently
and the studied materials are driven toward the insulating phase with larger
value of x. It is also found that the entropy change during the phase
transition is reduced with more Ru substitution. These observations indicate
that the existence of Ru has the effect of weakening the ferromagnetism and

The comparison of the present results with literature data obtained in several

The physics of carrier cooling is explored and experimental data of other
authors are discussed with a view to assessing the potential of state-of-the

based on the thermalisation in these nanostructures and assuming all other
aspects as ideal, gives 54% efficiency at 2500suns as compared to 54% for no

calculated the asymptotic survival probability $P(t)$ of a (sub)diffusive

dimension. These are among the few known results for reactions involving
species characterized by different anomalous exponents. Our results were
obtained by bounding, above and below, the exact survival probability by two
other probabilities that are asymptotically identical (except when
$\gamma^\prime=1$ and $0<\gamma<2/3$). Using this approach, we were not able to
estimate the time of validity of the asymptotic result, nor the way in which
the survival probability approaches this regime. Toward this goal, here we
present a detailed comparison of the asymptotic results with numerical
simulations. In some parameter ranges the asymptotic theory describes the
simulation results very well even for relatively short times. However, in other
regimes more time is required for the simulation results to approach asymptotic
behavior, and we arrive at situations where we are not able to reach asymptotia

of freedom, two notions of emergent semiclassical WKB time emerge; these are
furthermore equivalent to two notions of emergent classical
`Leibniz--Mach--Barbour' time. I futhermore study the semiclassical approach,
in a geometric phase formalism, extended to include linear constraints, and
with particular care to make explicit those approximations and assumptions
used. I propose a new iterative scheme for this in the cosmologically-motivated
case with one heavy degree of freedom. I find that the usual semiclassical
quantum cosmology emergence of time comes hand in hand with the emergence of
other qualitatively significant terms, including back-reactions on the heavy
subsystem and second time derivatives. I illustrate my analysis by taking it
further for relational particle models with linearly-coupled harmonic
oscillator potentials. As these examples are exactly soluble by means outside
the semiclassical approach, they are additionally useful for testing the
justifiability of some of the approximations and assumptions habitually made in
the semiclassical approach to quantum cosmology. Finally, I contrast the

(PQH) which involved an unbroken gauge group $SU(2)_Z$ whose coupling $\alpha_Z
\equiv g_Z^2/4 \pi\sim O(1)$ at a scale $\Lambda_Z \sim 3 \times 10^{-3} eV$
starting from a value within the range of the Standard Model (SM) couplings at
a high energy scale $\sim 10^{16} GeV$. In that model, the universe is assumed
to be presently trapped in a false vacuum with an energy density $\sim
\Lambda_Z^4$. In this paper, we present a scenario in which $SU(2)_Z$ is
unified with the SM through several steps: $E_6 \to SU(2)_Z \otimes SU(6) \to
SU(2)_Z \otimes SU(3)_c \otimes SU(3)_L \otimes U(1) \to SU(2)_Z \otimes
SU(3)_c \otimes SU(2)_L \otimes U(1)_Y$. This unification provides a rationale
for why the value of the $SU(2)_Z$ coupling is within the range of the SM
couplings at high energies. The particle content and the route of symmetry
breaking in this model is very different from the usual $E_6$ unification
encountered in the literature. Several implications, in addition to the dark
energy, include the existence of heavy mirror particles which could be searched
for at future colliders such as the LHC.

Two methods of the derivation of the axial anomaly are presented: 1) by
splitting of coordinates in the expression for the axial current and 2) by
calculation of triangle diagrams, where the anomaly arises from the surface
terms in momentum space. It is demonstrated, that the equivalent formulation of
the anomaly can be given, as a sum rule for the structure function in
dispersion representation of three point function of AVV interaction. It is
argued, that such integral representation of the anomaly has some advantages in
the case of description of the anomaly by contribution of hadronic states in

examples of the physical application of the axial anomaly are given.

significantly simplifies the calculation. The one loop contribution gives the
effective action to all orders in alpha' in the limit of a constant

construction to the case of the whole space: we prove that if a certain
nonlinear function of the initial data is small enough, in a Koch-Tataru type
space, then there is a global solution to the Navier-Stokes equations. We
provide an example of initial data satisfying that nonlinear smallness
condition, but whose norm is arbitrarily large in $ C^{-1}$. Then we prove a
stability result on the nonlinear smallness assumption. More precisely we show
that the new smallness assumption also holds for linear superpositions of
translated and dilated iterates of the initial data, in the spirit of a

shows correlations similar to a simple hadron gas. In case of the quark
molecular dynamics, we find that initially the $C_{BS}$ correlation is that of
a weakly interacting QGP but changes in the process of hadronization also to
the value for a hadron gas. Therefore, we conclude that the hadronization
process itself makes the initial baryon strangeness correlation unobservable.
To make an experimental study of this observable more feasible, we also
investigate how a restriction to only charged kaons and $\Lambda$'s (instead of
all baryons and all strange particles) influences the theoretical result on
$C_{BS}$. We find that a good approximation of the full result can be obtained

able to predict experimental optical data, including the positions, shifts and

mixing of 2 binary mixtures, each in the same host. We obtained excellent

prevalence of coherent flow structures that are dominated by downstream

to the increase of the Reynolds stresses in turbulent flow. In the present
study we introduce a convenient detector for these coherent states, calculate
the fraction of time the structures appear in the flow, and present a Markov

show vortical structures exceeds 24% for a Reynolds number of about Re=2200,
and it decreases to about 20% for Re=2500. The Markov model for the transition
between these states is in good agreement with the observed fraction of states,
and in reasonable agreement with the prediction for their persistence. It
provides insight into dominant qualitative changes of the flow when increasing

nervous system, we study functional neuromimetic models of visual processing
for static images. We will first present the retinal model which was introduced
by Van Rullen and Thorpe and which represents the multiscale contrast values of
the image using an orthonormal wavelet transform. These analog values activate
a set of spiking neurons which each fire once to produce an asynchronous wave
of spikes. According to this model, the image may be progressively
reconstructed from this spike wave thanks to regularities in the statistics of
the coefficients determined with natural images. Here, we study mathematically
how the quality of information transmission carried by this temporal
representation varies over time. In particular, we study how these regularities
can be used to optimize information transmission by using a form of temporal
cooperation of neurons to code analog values. The original model used wavelet
transforms that are close to orthogonal. However, the selectivity of realistic
neurons overlap, and we propose an extension of the previous model by adding a
spatial cooperation between filters. This model extends the previous scheme for
arbitrary--and possibly nonorthogonal--representations of features in the
images. In particular, we compared the performance of increasingly
over-complete representations in the retina. Results show that this algorithm
provides an efficient spike coding strategy for low-level visual processing

step, when the walker hops to other sites. As special cases of the quantum
walks driven by high-dimensional quantum coins generally studied by Brun,
Carteret, and Ambainis, we study the models obtained by choosing rotation as
the unitary transformation, whose matrix representations determine quantum
coins. We show that Wigner's $(2j+1)$-dimensional unitary representations of

of limit distribution is given by a superposition of $(2j+1)/2$ terms of scaled
Konno's density functions, and if $(2j+1)$ is odd, it is a superposition of $j$

proving that these effects can be effectively at work producing an emerging
classical world without recurring to any external entity that in some cases
cannot be properly defined. In a many-body system has been recently shown that
Gaussian decay of the coherence is the rule with a duration of recurrence more

electrons can propagate in the presence of two spin-1/2 magnetic impurities.
The electron may be scattered by each impurity via a contact-exchange
interaction and thus a spin-flip generally occurs at each scattering event.
Adopting a quantum waveguide theory approach, we derive the stationary states
of the system at all orders in the electron-impurity exchange coupling
constant. This allows us to investigate electron transmission for arbitrary
initial states of the two impurity spins. We show that for suitable electron
wave vectors, the triplet and singlet maximally entangled spin states of the
impurities can respectively largely inhibit the electron transport or make the
wire completely transparent for any electron spin state. In the latter case, a
resonance condition can always be found, representing an anomalous behaviour
compared to typical decoherence induced by magnetic impurities. We provide an
explanation for these phenomena in terms of the Hamiltonian symmetries.
Finally, a scheme to generate maximally entangled spin states of the two
impurities via electron scattering is proposed.

faithful quantum information transmission and processing in the presence of
noise. Initially encoding and decoding, implementing gates and quantum error
correction will be considered error free. Finally we will relax this non
realistic assumption, introducing the quantum fault-tolerant concept. The
existence of an error threshold permits to conclude that there is no physical
law preventing a quantum computer from being built. An error model based on the
depolarizing channel will be able to provide a simple estimation of the storage
or memory computation error threshold: < 5.2 10-5. The encoding is made by
means of the [[7,1,3]] Calderbank-Shor-Steane quantum code and the Shor's
fault-tolerant method to measure the stabilizer's generators is used.

liquid-nitrogen quenching of rhodium sample from room temperature to 77K in the
time-resolved Mossbauer spectroscopy. Recently, we have demonstrated the
anomalous emission of three entangled gammas of the E3 Mossbauer transition
generated by bremsstrahlung irradiation. In this work, we further report the
high-speed decay of excited state. We conjecture that cooling shrinkage,
gravitational redshift and crystal lattice collimate entangled gammas in a
linear cavity. This opens up a new approach towards gamma lasing, if the
stimulated emission occurs at this obtained low excitation density.

  Gesellschaft, Dortmund, 2006. Forthcoming in Physics and Philosophy","Physics and Philosophy 3 (2006)",,,"quant-ph",,"  Bohmian mechanics is an alternative interpretation of quantum mechanics. We
outline the main characteristics of its non-relativistic formulation. Most
notably it does provide a simple solution to the infamous measurement problem
of quantum mechanics. Presumably the most common objection against Bohmian
mechanics is based on its non-locality and its apparent conflict with
relativity and quantum field theory. However, several models for a quantum
field theoretical generalization do exist. We give a non-technical account of
some of these models.
