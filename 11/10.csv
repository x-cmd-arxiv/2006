known type Ia supernova.'' Both supernovae exhibited high ionization SN
1991T-like pre-maximum spectra, yet low peak luminosities like SN 1991bg. The
spectra reveal that SN 2005hk, like SN 2002cx, exhibited expansion velocities
that were roughly half those of typical type Ia supernovae. The R and I light
curves of both supernovae were also peculiar in not displaying the secondary
maximum observed for normal type Ia supernovae. Our YJH photometry of SN 2005hk
reveals the same peculiarity in the near-infrared. By combining our optical and
near-infrared photometry of SN 2005hk with published ultraviolet light curves
obtained with the Swift satellite, we are able to construct a bolometric light
curve from ~10 days before to ~60 days after B maximum. The shape and unusually
low peak luminosity of this light curve, plus the low expansion velocities and
absence of a secondary maximum at red and near-infrared wavelengths, are all in
reasonable agreement with model calculations of a 3D deflagration which
produces ~0.25 M_sun of 56Ni.

strong differences in the size distributions as seen in the two filters point
to a colour-dependence at these sizes, perhaps to be expected in this regime

composition rather than by gravity. The best fit slopes of the cumulative size
distributions (CSDs) in both filters tend towards lower values for smaller
asteroids, consistent with the results of previous studies. In addition to this
trend, the size distributions seen in the two filters are distinctly different,
with steeper slopes in r' than in g'. Breaking our sample up according to
semimajor axis, the difference between the filters in the inner belt is found
to be somewhat less pronounced than in the middle and outer belt, but the CSD
of those asteroids seen in the r' filter is consistently and significantly

simulations designed to study turbulent convection in the stellar interiors,
and compare them to stellar mixing-length theory (MLT). Simulations in 2D are
significantly different from 3D, both in terms of flow morphology and velocity
amplitude. Convective mixing regions are better predicted using a [dynamic
boundary condition] based on the bulk Richardson number than by purely local,
static criteria like Schwarzschild or Ledoux. MLT gives a good description of
the velocity scale and temperature gradient for a mixing length of $\sim 1.1
H_p$ for shell convection, however there are other important effects that it
does not capture near boundaries. Convective ""overshooting"" is best described
as an elastic response by the convective boundary, rather than ballistic
penetration of the stable layers by turbulent eddies. We find that the rate at
which material entrainment proceeds at the boundaries is consistent with
analogous laboratory experiments as well as simulation and observation of
terrestrial atmospheric mixing. In particular, the normalized entrainment rate
E=$u_E/\sigma_H$, is well described by a power law dependence on the bulk
Richardson number $Ri_B = \Delta b L/\sigma_H^2$ for the conditions studied,
$20\lesssim Ri_B \lesssim 420$. We find $E = A Ri_B^{-n}$, with best fit

inhomogeneities from ongoing entrainment events at the convective boundaries.
Comparable fluctuations (with amplitudes greater than ~1%) are absent in the

to 17 MeV immediately following the main peak, perhaps revealing a
highly-extended corona driven by the hyper-Eddington luminosities. The spectral
evolution and pulse evolution during the tail are presented, demonstrating

  or counteralignment","12 pages, 7 figures",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We revisit the case of magneto-rotational evolution of neutron stars (NSs)
with accounting for changes of the angle \chi between spin and magnetic axes.
This element of the evolution of NSs is very important for age estimates and
population modeling, but usually it is neglected. In the framework of two
models of energy losses we demonstrate that unless NSs are born with the
inclination angle \chi_0 very close (within 1 degree) to the position of
maximal losses, pulsars with short initial periods quickly reach regions of
small energy losses (aligned rotators in the case of magneto-dipole losses and
orthogonal rotators -- in the case of current losses) without significant
spin-down. This means that either most of known NSs should be born with
relatively long periods close to presently observed values, or the initial
inclination angles should be large (close to 90) for the magnetodipole model
and very small (close to 0) for the current losses model, or that both models
cannot be applied for the whole evolutionary track of a typical NS. In
particular, magnetar candidates should be born with periods close to the
observed ones within the scope of both models of energy losses. We discuss how
these considerations can influence population synthesis models and age
estimates for different types of isolated NSs. Focusing on the model of current
losses we illustrate our conclusion with evolutionary track reconstructions on
the P--\sin \chi plane. We conclude, that most probably both existing models of
energy losses -- magneto-dipole and longitudinal current -- require serious
modifications, on the other hand, estimates obtained under the standard
assumption of \sin \chi=1=const does not have solid theoretical ground and
should be taken with care.

With the goal of studying the effect of clumpiness on the sub-millimeter and

radiative torques within clumpy models of cores and molecular clouds. Our
models were based upon a highly inhomogeneous simulation of compressible
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The P-I relations for our models reproduce
those seen in observations. We show that the degree of polarization observed is
extremely sensitive to the upper grain size cut-off, and is less sensitive to
changes in the radiative anisotropy. Furthermore, despite a variety of dust
temperatures along a single line of sight through our core and amongst dust
grains of different sizes, the assumption of isothermality amongst the aligned
grains does not introduce a significant error. Our calculations indicate that
sub-mm polarization vectors can be reasonably good tracers for the underlying

either in WIM or WNM in ionization and thermal equilibrium with the

materials we use amorphous and crystalline silicates with various composition

the shape of the 20 mu silicate feature and to compare this with observations.
By using realistic particle shapes we are, for the first time, able to derive
the magnesium fraction in interstellar silicates. We find that the interstellar
silicates are highly magnesium rich (Mg/(Fe+Mg)>0.9) and that the stoichiometry
lies between pyroxene and olivine type silicates. This composition is not

dust particles indicating that these are, in general, not unprocessed remnants

that crystalline silicates in cometary and circumstellar grains are almost

ellipticity as the light distribution and manage to reproduce the quasar image
positions and fluxes. We also model the system with two mass components, disk
and halo. Again, we manage to reproduce the quasar image positions and fluxes.
However, all models predict at least a third visible image close to the disk
that is not seen in our images. We speculate that this is most likely due to
extinction by the disk. We also measure the rotational velocity of the galaxy
at 2.7 disk scale radius to be v_c=130 +/- 20 km/s from the [OII] emission
lines. When adding the rotational velocity constraint to the models, we find
that the contribution to the rotational velocity of the disk is likely to be
equal to or larger than the contribution of the halo at this radius. The

of interferometers to SGWs directly in the gauge of the local observer, the
result is used to analyze the cross correlation between the two LIGO
interferometers in their advanced configuration for a potential detection of
relic SGWs and to release a lower bound for the integration time of such a
detection. By using a new, frequency-dependent, overlap reduction function, a
comparison with previous low-frequency approximations is therefore discussed.
This is the first time that such a cross-correlation is computed in all the

ratio is very important to understand if a scalar component of GWs is present
at high frequency. With the new overlap reduction function, an order of

advanced projects further improve their sensitivity.

X-ray Imager (SXI) on board of GOES-12. This instrument allows us to follow in
detail the full lifetime of coronal loops. The observed light curves suggest
three somewhat distinct evolutionary phases: rise, main, and decay. The
durations and characteristic timescales of these phases are much longer than a
cooling time and indicate that the loop-averaged heating rate increases slowly,
reaches a maintenance level, and then decreases slowly. This suggests that a
single heating mechanism operates for the entire lifetime of the loop. For
monolithic loops, the loop-averaged heating rate is the intrinsic energy
release rate of the heating mechanism. For loops that are bundles of
impulsively heated strands, it is an indication of the frequency of occurrence
of individual heating events, or nanoflares. We show that the timescale of the
loop-averaged heating rate is proportional to the timescale of the observed
intensity variation. The ratios of the radiative to conductive cooling times in
the loops are somewhat less than 1, putting them intermediate between the
values measured previously for hotter and cooler loops. Our results provide
further support for the existence of a trend suggesting that all loops are
heated by the same mechanism, or that different mechanisms have fundamental
similarities (e.g., are all impulsive or are all steady with similar rates of
heating).

therefore sensitive to the physical conditions whereas the CO (J=1-0) line is a
tracer of the total molecular gas mass. In order to be able to compare the
properties of molecular gas in nearby and distant galaxies, we have observed C
and CO submillimeter lines (including the 12CO(6-5) and 12CO(7-6) lines) in a
sample of nearby galaxies using the CSO. We have obtained a complete view of
the CO cooling curve (also called CO spectral energy distribution) by combining
the submillimeter CSO data with previous observations found in the literature.
We made use of Large Velocity Gradient (LVG) models to analyse the observed CO
cooling curve, predict CO line intensities from J=1-0 to J=15-14 in the studied
galaxies, and derive the physical properties of the warm and dense molecular
gas : the kinetic temperature (TK); the gas density (n(H2)); the
N(12CO)/$\Delta v$. The predictions for the line intensities and for the total
CO cooling power, obtained from LVG modelling have been compared with
predictions from Photo Dissociation Regions (PDR) models. We show how the CO
SED varies according to the galaxy star forming activity. For active nuclei,
the peak is located near the 12CO(6-5) or 12CO(7-6) rotational lines, while,
for normal nuclei, most of the energy is carried by the 12CO(4-3) and 12CO(5-4)
lines. Whatever the spectral type of the nucleus, the observed C cooling rate
is lower than the observed CO cooling rate (by a factor of around 4). The CO
cooling curve of nearby starburst galaxies (e.g. NGC 253) has a quite similar
shape to the CO cooling curve of distant galaxies. Therefore, the CO cooling
curves are useful diagnostics for the star forming activity in distant objects.

work the stability of the method is related to the difference between the
lowest (bosonic-type) eigenvalue of the FMC diffusion operator and the exact
fermi energy. It is shown that within a FMC framework the lowest eigenvalue of
the new diffusion operator is no longer the bosonic ground-state eigenvalue as
in standard exact Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) schemes but a modified value
which is strictly greater. Accordingly, FMC can be viewed as an exact DMC
method built from a correlated diffusion process having a reduced Bose-Fermi
gap. As a consequence, the FMC method is more stable than any transient method
(or nodal release-type approaches). We illustrate the various ideas presented
in this work with calculations performed on a very simple model having only
nine states but a full sign problem. Already for this toy model it is clearly
seen that FMC calculations are inherently uncontrolled.

so as to extend the well-established equilibrium framework to open
nonequilibrium systems. We first derive a microscopic expression of
nonequilibrium entropy for an assembly of identical bosons/fermions interacting
via a two-body potential. This is performed by starting from the Dyson equation
on the Keldysh contour and following closely the procedure of Ivanov, Knoll and
Voskresensky [Nucl. Phys. A {\bf 672} (2000) 313]. The obtained expression is
identical in form with an exact expression of equilibrium entropy and obeys an
equation of motion which satisfies the $H$-theorem in a limiting case. Thus,
entropy can be defined unambiguously in nonequilibrium systems so as to embrace
equilibrium statistical mechanics. This expression, however, differs from the
one obtained by Ivanov {\em et al}., and we show explicitly that their ``memory
corrections'' are not necessary. Based on our expression of nonequilibrium
entropy, we then propose the following principle of maximum entropy for
nonequilibrium steady states: ``The state which is realized most probably among
possible steady states without time evolution is the one that makes entropy
maximum as a function of mechanical variables, such as the total particle
number, energy, momentum, energy flux, etc.'' During the course of the study,
we also develop a compact real-time perturbation expansion in terms of the

the principle of maximum entropy proposed for nonequilibrium steady states in a

applied chemical potential and temperature gradients. Our approach involves
quantum Langevin equations and nonequilibrium Green's functions. In the linear
response limit we are able to solve the model exactly and obtain expressions
for various transport coefficients. Standard linear response relations are
shown to be valid. We also explicitly compute the heat dissipation and show
that for wires of length $N >> \ell$, where $\ell$ is a coherence length scale,
dissipation takes place uniformly along the wire. For $N << \ell$, when
transport is ballistic, dissipation is mostly at the contacts. In the
intermediate range between Ohmic and ballistic transport we find that the
chemical potential profile is linear in the bulk with sharp jumps at the
boundaries. These are explained using a simple model where the left and right
moving electrons behave as persistent random walkers.

stability of D-branes within boundary string field theory. We identify the
non-local open string background that implements shifts in the closed string
background and analyze the tachyonic sector off-shell. The renormalization
group flow reveals some characteristic properties, which are expected for a
curved background, like the absence of a stable space-filling brane. In
3-dimensions we describe tachyon condensation processes to lower-dimensional
branes, including a curved 2-dimensional brane. We argue that this 2-brane is
perturbatively stable. This is in agreement with the known maximally symmetric
WZW-branes and provides further support to the bulk-boundary factorization
approach to open-closed string correspondence.

each site, the mass at the site is split into two parts by choosing a random
proportion distributed according to some specified probability measure on
$[0,1]$ and dividing the mass in that proportion. One part then moves to each
of the two adjacent sites. This paper considers a continuous analogue of this
evolution, which may be described by means of a stochastic flow of kernels, the
theory of which was developed by Le Jan and Raimond. One of their results is
that such a flow is characterized by specifying its $N$ point motions, which
form a consistent family of Brownian motions. This means for each dimension $N$
we have a diffusion in ${\mathbf{R}}^N$, whose $N$ coordinates are all Brownian
motions. Any $M$ coordinates taken from the $N$-dimensional process are
distributed as the $M$-dimensional process in the family. Moreover, in this
setting, the only interactions between coordinates are local: when coordinates
differ in value they evolve independently of each other. In this paper we
explain how such multidimensional diffusions may be constructed and
characterized via martingale problems.

  ""Representation Theory and Complex Analysis"", Venice, June 2004",,,,"math.QA hep-th math.AG",,"  The global geometric Langlands correspondence relates Hecke eigensheaves on
the moduli stack of G-bundles on a smooth projective algebraic curve X and
holomorphic G'-bundles with connection on X, where G' is the Langlands dual
group of G. This correspondence is relatively well understood when the
connection has no singularities, i.e., is unramified. But what should happen if
the connection has singularities, or ramification, at finitely many points of
X? In this case we expect to attach to it a category of Hecke eigensheaves on a
suitable moduli stack of G-bundles on X with parabolic (or level) structures at
the ramification points. In this paper I review an approach to constructing
these categories developed by D.Gaitsgory and myself. It uses representations
of affine Kac-Moody algebras of critical level and localization functors from
these representations to D-modules on the moduli spaces of bundles with
parabolic (or level) structures. As explained in hep-th/0512172, these
D-modules may be viewed as sheaves of conformal blocks naturally arising in the
framework of Conformal Field Theory.

recently developed nonlinear theories: geometric theory for incompressible
flows [10] and the bifurcation and stability theory for nonlinear dynamical

the Rayleigh-Benard problem bifurcates from the basic state to an attractor A_R

all physically sound boundary conditions, regardless of the multiplicity of the
eigenvalue R_c for the linear problem. In this article, in addition to a
classification of the bifurcated attractor A_R, the structure and its
transitions of the solutions in the physical space is classified, leading to
the existence and stability of two different flows structures: pure rolls and
rolls separated by a cross the channel flow. It appears that the structure with
rolls separated by a cross channel flow has not been carefully examined

separately without noise. In the presence of only one of the forces, no
resonance behaviour is observed, however, hysteresis happens there. Then the
influence of the high-frequency force in the presence of a low-frequency, i.e.
biharmonic forcing, is studied. Vibrational resonance is found to occur when
the amplitude of the high-frequency force is varied. The resonance curve
resembles a stochastic resonance-like curve. It is maximum at the value of $g$
at which the orbit lies in one well during one half of the drive cycle of the
low-frequency force and in the other for the remaining half cycle. Vibrational
resonance is characterized using the response amplitude and mean residence
time. We show the occurrence of stochastic resonance behaviour in the

rotating neutron stars. The results include predictions for the maximum mass of

density, as well the properties of neutron stars with mass of order 1.4
$M_\odot$. The cooling mechanism allowed by the QMC EoS is explored and the
parameters relevant to slow rotation, namely the moment of inertia and the
period of rotation investigated. The results of the calculation, which are
found to be in good agreement with available observational data, are compared
with the predictions of more traditional EoS. The QMC EoS provides cold neutron
star models with maximum mass 1.9--2.1 M$_\odot$, with central density less
than 6 times nuclear saturation density ($n_{0}= 0.16 {\rm fm}^{-3}$) and
offers a consistent description of the stellar mass up to this density limit.
In contrast with other models, QMC predicts no hyperon contribution at
densities lower than $3n_0$, for matter in $\beta$-equilibrium. At higher
densities, $\Xi^{-,0}$ and $\Lambda$ hyperons are present.

due to the fact that we do not see the real image of the object, but a
holographic projection of it. We found that the projection of a point particle
is a de Broglie-type wave. This indicates that holography could be the origin
of the wave nature of a particle. We have also noted that one cannot stabilize
the noise (or fuzzieness) in terms of the integration grid-points of the

unbiased calculation of neural filters (receptive fields) from responses to
natural scenes or other complex signals with strong multipoint correlations. In
the cat primary visual cortex we compare responses to natural inputs with those
to noise inputs matched for luminance and contrast. We find that neural filters
adaptively change with the input ensemble so as to increase the information
carried by the neural response about the filtered stimulus. Adaptation affects
the spatial frequency composition of the filter, enhancing sensitivity to
under-represented frequencies in agreement with optimal encoding arguments.
Adaptation occurs over 40 s to many minutes, longer than most previously

This allows us to devise an algorithm to reconstruct the topology of

test the quality of prediction of both the magnitude and directionality of
conformational variance. Normal modes from four simple elastic network model

diverse, ultrahigh resolution crystal structures. While all five potentials
provide good predictions of the magnitude of flexibility, the methods that
consider all atoms have a clear edge at prediction of directionality, and the
CHARMM potential produces the best agreement. The low-frequency modes from
different potentials are similar, but those computed from the CHARMM potential
show the greatest difference from the elastic network models. This was
illustrated by computing the dynamic correlation matrices from different
potentials for a PDZ domain structure. Comparison of normal mode results with
anisotropic temperature factors opens the possibility of using ultrahigh
resolution crystallographic data as a quantitative measure of molecular
flexibility. The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the costs and benefits
of using normal mode potentials of varying complexity. Comparison of the

gates between an open and a closed configuration is intrinsically related to
the movement of gating charge within the cell membrane. At the beginning of an
action potential the transient gating current is opposite to the direction of
the current of sodium ions through the membrane. Therefore, the excitability is
expected to become reduced due to the influence of a gating current. Our
stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley like modeling takes into account both the channel
noise -- i.e. the fluctuations of the number of open ion channels -- and the
capacitance fluctuations that result from the dynamics of the gating charge. We
investigate the spiking dynamics of membrane patches of variable size and
analyze the statistics of the spontaneous spiking. As a main result, we find
that the gating currents yield a drastic reduction of the spontaneous spiking
rate for sufficiently large ion channel clusters. Consequently, this
demonstrates a prominent mechanism for channel noise reduction.

After
years of theoretical efforts, this formalism is now largely mastered so that
the accuracy of theory-experiment comparisons is determined by the level of
precision and pertinence of the description of experimental conditions. Due to
an imperfect knowledge of the optical properties of real mirrors used in the
experiment, the effect of imperfect reflection remains a source of uncertainty
in theory-experiment comparisons. For the same reason, the temperature
dependence of the Casimir force between dissipative mirrors remains a matter of
debate. We also emphasize that real mirrors do not obey exactly the assumption
of specular reflection, which is used in nearly all calculations of material
and temperature corrections. This difficulty may be solved by using a more
general scattering formalism accounting for non-specular reflection with
wavevectors and field polarizations mixed. This general formalism has already
been fruitfully used for evaluating the effect of roughness on the Casimir
force as well as the lateral Casimir force appearing between corrugated
surfaces. The commonly used `proximity force approximation' turns out to lead
to inaccuracies in the description of these two effects.

depolarizing channel, but the degree of depolarization depends on the axis.
When d is not a prime power, some of our results still hold, particularly in
the case of channels with one symmetry axis. We describe the convex structure
of this class of channels and the subclass of entanglement breaking channels.
We find new bound entangled states for d = 3.
  For these channels, we show that the multiplicativity conjecture for maximal
output p-norm holds for p=2. We also find channels with behavior not exhibited

for the additivity of minimal output entropy.

entangled thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD) crystals in Baton Rouge, Louisiana
(USA) and Givarlais (France) at 8,182 km between entangled samples. Samples
consisted of doped lithium fluoride TLD's that were simultaneously irradiated
in pairs together at one location by Bremsstrahlung radiation generated by a
Varian CLINAC unit. One of the paired TLD crystals was then mailed to Baton
Rouge and its entangled counterpart remained in Givarlais. The crystal in Baton
Rouge (master) was then subjected to thermal stimulation which elicited a
measurable light emission response in the counterpart (slave) under a
photomultiplier in Givarlais. Highly correlated passive light emissions were
observed in the nonheated slave TLD while the master TLD was ramped up in
temperature and then allowed to cool to ambient temperature. Maximum
correlations in the slave TLD light emissions were observed at the turn around
temperature which is the point where the master TLD temperature is allowed to
decrease. The experimenter in Girvalais was thus able to determine with high
accuracy the point in time at which the master TLD heating oven was turned off
(turn around point) without any communication between the experimenters during
the heating-cooling phase of the experiment. The implications of these observed
results are of great significance for quantum communication technology.

we may perform on the systems: ``operational theories.'' I discuss appropriate
general frameworks for such theories, in which convexity plays a key role. Such
frameworks are appropriate for investigating what things look like from an
``inside view,'' i.e. for describing perspectival information that one
subsystem of the world can have about another. Understanding how such views can
combine, and whether an overall ``geometric'' picture (``outside view'')
coordinating them all can be had, even if this picture is very different in
nature from the structure of the perspectives within it, is the key to
understanding whether we may be able to achieve a unified, ``objective''
physical view in which quantum mechanics is the appropriate description for
certain perspectives, or whether quantum mechanics is truly telling us we must
go beyond this ``geometric'' conception of physics. The nature of information,
its flow and processing, as seen from various operational persepectives, is
likely to be key to understanding whether and how such coordination and
unification can be achieved.

resonator supporting a single mode coupled to a structured continuum of modes
(reservoir) is theoretically investigated, and the issue of threshold condition
for lasing in presence of an inverted medium is comprehensively addressed.
Specific analytical results are given for a single-mode microcavity resonantly
coupled to a coupled resonator optical waveguide (CROW), which supports a band
of continuous modes acting as decay channels. For weak coupling, the usual
exponential Weisskopf-Wigner (Markovian) decay of the field in the bare
resonator is found, and the threshold for lasing increases linearly with the
coupling strength. As the coupling between the microcavity and the structured
reservoir increases, the field decay in the passive cavity shows non
exponential features, and correspondingly the threshold for lasing ceases to
increase, reaching a maximum and then starting to decrease as the coupling
strength is further increased. A singular behavior for the ""laser phase
transition"", which is a clear signature of strong non-Markovian dynamics, is
found at critical values of the coupling between the microcavity and the
reservoir.
