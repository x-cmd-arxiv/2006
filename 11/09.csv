the strong variability focusing on its aperiodic variability on short (<1s)
time scales. In the power density spectra, we found a feature which is seen in
many transient systems, but until now was not detected in GRS 1915+105 due to
its elusiveness. As this feature has been associated to the collimation and
emission of superluminal relativistic jets visible in the radio band, its
presence on the prototypical galactic jet source strengthens this connection.
Since its discovery in 1992, GRS 1915+105 was considered a peculiar source. Our
results suggest that its general behaviour is similar to that of other
black-hole binaries, but its state-transitions are much faster and difficult to
analyze.

on NLTE models of accrection disks in AGN computed as described by Hubeny et

T_max. The cause of this discrepancy does not appear to be dust reddening or
galaxy contamination but may relate to the accretion rate, as the offset
objects are accreting above ~30 % of the Eddington limit. The derived disk
temperature depends primarily on line width, with little or no dependence on

Abell 63, which is known to contain the eclipsing close-binary nucleus UU Sge.
Abell 63 provides an important test case in investigating the role of
close-binary central stars on the evolution of planetary nebulae.
  Longslit observations were obtained using the Manchester echelle spectrometer
combined with the 2.1-m San Pedro Martir Telescope. The spectra reveal that the
central bright rim of Abell 63 has a tube-like structure. A deep image shows
collimated lobes extending from the nebula, which are shown to be high-velocity
outflows. The kinematic ages of the nebular rim and the extended lobes are
calculated to be 8400+/-500 years and 12900+/-2800 years, respectively, which
suggests that the lobes were formed at an earlier stage than the nebular rim.
This is consistent with expectations that disk-generated jets form immediately
after the common envelope phase.
  A morphological-kinematical model of the central nebula is presented and the
best-fit model is found to have the same inclination as the orbital plane of
the central binary system; this is the first proof that a close-binary system
directly affects the shaping of its nebula. A Hubble-type flow is
well-established in the morphological-kinematical modelling of the observed
line profiles and imagery.
  Two possible formation models for the elongated lobes of Abell 63 are
considered (1) a low-density, pressure-driven jet excavates a cavity in the
remnant AGB envelope; (2) high-density bullets form the lobes in a single
ballistic ejection event.

Ly alpha emitters at redshift 8.8.
  Methods: We performed a narrow band imaging programme using ISAAC at the ESO
VLT. Seven fields, covering a total area of 31sq. arcmin and for which optical
and broad band infra-red images have been obtained in the GOODS survey, were
imaged to a limiting flux (respectively luminosity) of ~ 1.3 x 10^{-17}

approaching recent estimates of the luminosity function at z ~ 6. Our results
do suggest, however, that detections or substantial constraints could be

however, the statistics are generally low thus preventing a good estimate of

understood. Here, we test the hypothesis for high-mass star formation proposed
in our earlier paper (Peretto et al. 2006). In order to confirm the physical
validity of this hypothesis, we carried out IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer
observations of NGC 2264-C and performed SPH numerical simulations of the
collapse of a Jeans-unstable, prolate dense clump. Our Plateau de Bure
observations reveal the presence of a new compact source (C-MM13) located only
\~ 10000 AU away, but separated by ~ 1.1 km/s in (projected) velocity, from the
most massive Class 0 object (C-MM3) lying at the very center of NGC 2264-C.
Detailed comparison with our numerical SPH simulations supports the view that
NGC 2264-C is an elongated cluster-forming clump in the process of collapsing
and fragmenting along its long axis, leading to a strong dynamical interaction
and possible protostar merger in the central region of the clump. The present
study also sets several quantitative constraints on the initial conditions of
large-scale collapse in NGC 2264-C. Our hydrodynamic simulations indicate that
the observed velocity pattern characterizes an early phase of protocluster
collapse which survives for an only short period of time (i.e., < 10^5 yr). To
provide a good match to the observations the simulations require an initial
ratio of turbulent to gravitational energy of only ~ 5 %, which strongly
suggests that the NGC 2264-C clump is structured primarily by gravity rather

giant evolution near the tip of the giant branch. When theoretical cumulative
luminosity functions are shifted to align the tip in I-band and normalized at a
luminosity level slightly brighter than the red giant bump, virtually all
dependence on age and composition (heavy elements and helium abundance) is
eliminated. While significant comparisons with observations require large
samples of giant stars, such samples are available for some of the most massive
Milky Way globular clusters. We present comparisons with the clusters NGC 2808
and M5, and find that NGC 2808 has a deficiency of bright giants (with a
probability of less than about 3% that a more extreme distribution of giant
stars would have happened by chance). We discuss the possibilities that
underestimated neutrino losses or strong mass loss could be responsible for the
deficit of giants. While we cannot rule out the neutrino hypothesis, it cannot
explain the apparent agreement between the M5 observations and models. On the
other hand, strong mass loss provides a potential link between the giant star
observations and NGC 2808's unusually blue horizontal branch. If the mass loss
hypothesis is true, there is likely a significant population of He white dwarfs
that could be uncovered with slightly deeper UV observations of the cluster.

result the polarizations of emission and absorption lines depend on the 3D

then compared to line indices from stars in the chemically homogeneous globular
cluster M55, in addition to standard stars and synthetic spectra. The
uncertainties in the derived metallicities are of the order of 0.2 dex. Our
study confirms the large variations in iron abundances found on the giant
branch in earlier studies (-2.2 <[Fe/H]< -0.7 dex). In addition, we studied the
alpha-element and CN/CH abundances. Stars of different metallicity groups not
only show distinct ages, but also different behaviours in their relative
abundances. The alpha abundances increase smoothly with increasing metallicity
resulting in a flat [alpha/Fe] ratio over the whole observed metallicity range.
The combined CN+CH abundance increases smoothly with increasing iron abundance.
The most metal-rich stars are CN-enriched. In a CN vs. CH plot, though, the
individual abundances divide into CN- and CH-rich branches. The large abundance
variations observed in our sample of (unevolved) subgiant branch stars most
probably have their origin in the pre-enriched material rather than in internal
mixing effects. Together with the age spread of the different sub-populations,
our findings favour the formation of Omega Centauri within a more massive
progenitor.

evidence of the melting event of the dust particles in the protoplanetary disk.
One of the most plausible scenarios is that the chondrule precursor dust
particles are heated and melt in the high-velocity gas flow (shock-wave heating
model). We developed the non-linear, time-dependent, and three-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulation code for analyzing the dynamics of molten droplets
exposed to the gas flow. We confirmed that our simulation results showed a good
agreement in a linear regime with the linear solution analytically derived by
Sekiya et al. (2003). We found that the non-linear terms in the hydrodynamical
equations neglected by Sekiya et al. (2003) can cause the cavitation by
producing negative pressure in the droplets. We discussed that the
fragmentation through the cavitation is a new mechanism to determine the upper
limit of chondrule sizes. We also succeeded to reproduce the fragmentation of
droplets when the gas ram pressure is stronger than the effect of the surface
tension. Finally, we compared the deformation of droplets in the shock-wave
heating with the measured data of chondrules and suggested the importance of
other effects to deform droplets, for example, the rotation of droplets. We
believe that our new code is a very powerful tool to investigate the
hydrodynamics of molten droplets in the framework of the shock-wave heating
model and has many potentials to be applied to various problems.

to that of the newly discovered protostar in the core L1014, indicating a
possible protostellar nature for this source. This needs to be confirmed with

a weak radio source, possibly a protostar, was discovered at the edge of the

tidal tails the kinematic samples are strongly contaminated by unbound stars
from the tails. We also study another source of possible contamination by
adding stars from the Milky Way. We demonstrate that most of the unbound stars
can be removed by the method of interloper rejection proposed by den Hartog &
Katgert. We model the cleaned-up kinematic samples using solutions of the Jeans
equation with constant mass-to-light ratio and velocity anisotropy parameter.
We show that the Jeans analysis, when applied to cleaned samples, allows us to
reproduce the mass and mass-to-light ratio of the dwarf with accuracy typically
better than 25 percent. The analysis was applied to the new data for the Fornax
dSph galaxy. We show that after careful removal of interlopers the velocity
dispersion profile of Fornax can be reproduced by a model in which mass traces
light with a mass-to-light ratio of 11 solar units and isotropic orbits. We
demonstrate that most of the contamination in the kinematic sample of Fornax
probably originates from the Milky Way. (Abridged)

the observation that many non equilibrium systems exhibit long-range

general modifies the spectrum of these fluctuations and leads to the appearance
of a net force between these bodies. The mechanism is illustrated by means of a
simple example: a reaction diffusion equation with random noises.

large open sheets that intersect along the faces of the cubic Brillouin zone.
Close to these intersections, long-wavelength interband magnetic spin
fluctuations can scatter electrons from one sheet to the other. The current
relaxation rate due to such interband scattering events is not reduced by
vertex corrections as is that for scattering from intraband ferromagnetic
fluctuations. Consequently, current relaxation proceeds in a manner similar to
that occurring in nearly antiferromagnetic metals, in which low-temperature
$T^{3/2}$ behavior is well known. It is argued that this type of
non-Fermi-liquid behavior can, for a metal with ferromagnetic fluctuations near
Fermi sheet intersections, persist over a much wider temperature range than it
does in nearly antiferromagnetic metals.

regime. Under proper conditions, the current develops plateaus at integer
multiples of ef when the frequency f of the surface-acoustic wave or the gate
voltage Vg of the point contact is varied. A pronounced 1.1 MHz beat period of
the current indicates that the interference of the surface-acoustic wave with
reflected waves matters. This is supported by the results obtained after a
second independent beam of surface-acoustic wave was added, traveling in
opposite direction. We have found that two sub-intervals can be distinguished
within the 1.1 MHz modulation period, where two different sets of plateaus
dominate the acoustoelectric-current versus gate-voltage characteristics. In
some cases, both types of quantized steps appeared simultaneously, though at
different current values, as if they were superposed on each other. Their
presence could result from two independent quantization mechanisms for the
acoustoelectric current. We point out that short potential barriers determining
the properties of our nominally long constrictions could lead to an additional
quantization mechanism, independent from those described in the standard model

0.02) with and without application of magnetic field. We have found a
ferroelectric behavior at zero magnetic field for x=0.02. At any doping level,
the onset field of the ferroelectricity always coincides with that of the
noncollinear magnetic structure while the transition field dramatically
decreases to zero field with Al doping. The results imply the further
possibility of producing the ferroelectricity by modifying the frustrated spin
structure in terms of site-doping and external magnetic field.

transport problems. When the physical properties of the medium where the
transport process takes place are stationary and constant at each spatial
location, anomalous transport has been successfully analyzed within the
Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) model. In this paper, within a Monte Carlo
approach to CTRW, we focus on the particle transport through two regions
characterized by different physical properties, in presence of an external
driving action constituted by an additional advective field, modeled within
both the Galilei invariant and Galilei variant schemes. Particular attention is
paid to the interplay between the distributions of space and time across the
discontinuity. The resident concentration and the flux of the particles are
finally evaluated and it is shown that at the interface between the two regions
the flux is continuous as required by mass conservation, while the
concentration may reveal a neat discontinuity. This result could open the route
to the Monte Carlo investigation of the effectiveness of a physical
discontinuity acting as a filter on particle concentration.

  accepted to ISIT 2007",,,,"cs.PF cs.IT math.IT",,"  The decision tree is one of the most fundamental programming abstractions. A
commonly used type of decision tree is the alphabetic binary tree, which uses
(without loss of generality) ``less than'' versus ''greater than or equal to''
tests in order to determine one of $n$ outcome events. The process of finding
an optimal alphabetic binary tree for a known probability distribution on
outcome events usually has the underlying assumption that the cost (time) per
decision is uniform and thus independent of the outcome of the decision. This
assumption, however, is incorrect in the case of software to be optimized for a
given microprocessor, e.g., in compiling switch statements or in fine-tuning
program bottlenecks. The operation of the microprocessor generally means that
the cost for the more likely decision outcome can or will be less -- often far
less -- than the less likely decision outcome. Here we formulate a variety of
$O(n^3)$-time $O(n^2)$-space dynamic programming algorithms to solve such
optimal binary decision tree problems, optimizing for the behavior of
processors with predictive branch capabilities, both static and dynamic. In the
static case, we use existing results to arrive at entropy-based performance
bounds. Solutions to this formulation are often faster in practice than
``optimal'' decision trees as formulated in the literature, and, for small
problems, are easily worth the extra complexity in finding the better solution.
This can be applied in fast implementation of decoding Huffman codes.

emission rate in the JIMWLK evolution. In the mean field approximation obtained
by ignoring fluctuations, the model exhibits the hallmarks of the BK equation,

sensitive to the opacity of the quark-gluon plasma and the time dependence of
its formation and evolution. We solve the system of coupled rate equations that
describe the competition between the fragmentation of $c$- and $b$-quarks and
the QGP-induced dissociation of the $D$- and $B$-mesons to evaluate the
quenching of heavy hadrons in nucleus-nucleus collisions. In contrast to
previous results on heavy quark modification, this approach predicts
suppression of $B$-mesons comparable to that of $D$-mesons at transverse

the large attenuation of non-photonic electrons in central Au+Au reactions at

limits to $\sin^2 2\theta_{13}$ in order to accomplish the unambiguous
determination of $\theta_{23}$ and $\delta$. We have performed two different
analysis. In the first, at a baseline of 3000 km, we simulate a measurement of
the channels $\nu_e\to\nu_\mu$, $\nu_e\to\nu_\tau$ and
$\bar{\nu}_\mu\to\bar{\nu}_\mu$, combined with their respective conjugate ones,
with a muon energy of 50 GeV and a running time of five years. In the second,
we merge the simulated data obtained at L=3000 km with the measurement of
$\nu_e\to\nu_\mu$ channel at 7250 km, the so called 'magic baseline'. In both
cases, we have studied the impact of varying the $\nu_\tau$ detector
efficiency-mass product, $(\epsilon_{\nu_\tau}\times M_\tau)$, at 3000 km,
keeping unchanged the $\nu_\mu$ detector mass and its efficiency. At L=3000 km,
we found the existance of degenerate zones, that corresponds to values of
$\theta_{13}$, which are equal or almost equal to the true ones. These zones
are extremely difficult to discard, even when we increase the number of events.
However, in the second scenario, this difficulty is overcomed, demostrating the
relevance of the 'magic baseline'. From this scenario, the best limits of
$\sin^2 2\theta_{13}$, reached at $3\sigma$, for $\sin^2 2\theta_{23}=0.95$,
0.975 and 0.99 are: 0.008, 0.015 and 0.045, respectively, obtained at

properties of DAMA, such as its pole structure and Regge asymptotics, and leads
to a generalized dual amplitude A(s,t,Q^2). This amplitude can be checked in
the known kinematical limits, i.e. it should reduce to onshell hadronic
scattering amplitude for Q^2=0 and can be related to the nuclear structure
function for t=0. In such a way we complete a unified ""two-dimensionally dual""
picture of strong interaction. By comparing the structure function F_2,
resulting from M-DAMA, with phenomenological parameterizations, we fix the
Q^2-dependence in M-DAMA. In all studied regions, i.e. large and low x limits
as well as for the resonance region, the results of M-DAMA are in qualitative
agreement with the experiment. The new feature of the M-DAMA is the possible

  Being transformed through a full time derivative under $N=4, d=1$
supersymmetry, this auxiliary component $B$ may be dualized into a fourth
scalar field giving rise to a four dimensional $N=4, d=1$ sigma-model. We
analyzed the geometry in the bosonic sector and find that it is not a

comes from relating a heuristic texture synthesis algorithm popular in computer
vision to general nonparametric bootstrapping of stationary random fields. We
give a formal resampling scheme for the heuristic texture algorithm and prove
that it produces a consistent estimate of the joint distribution of pixels in a
window of certain size under mixing and regularity conditions on the random
field. The joint distribution of pixels is the quantity of interest here
because theories of human perception of texture suggest that two textures with
the same joint distribution of pixel values in a suitably chosen window will
appear similar to a human. Thus we provide theoretical justification for an
algorithm that has already been very successful in practice, and suggest an
explanation for its perceptually good results.

$H_1,...,H_s$. A classical approach to dealing with the multiplicity problem is
to restrict attention to procedures that control the familywise error rate
($\mathit{FWER}$), the probability of even one false rejection. But if $s$ is
large, control of the $\mathit{FWER}$ is so stringent that the ability of a
procedure that controls the $\mathit{FWER}$ to detect false null hypotheses is
limited. It is therefore desirable to consider other measures of error control.
This article considers two generalizations of the $\mathit{FWER}$. The first is
the $k-\mathit{FWER}$, in which one is willing to tolerate $k$ or more false
rejections for some fixed $k\geq 1$. The second is based on the false discovery
proportion ($\mathit{FDP}$), defined to be the number of false rejections
divided by the total number of rejections (and defined to be 0 if there are no
rejections). Benjamini and Hochberg [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 57 (1995)
289--300] proposed control of the false discovery rate ($\mathit{FDR}$), by
which they meant that, for fixed $\alpha$, $E(\mathit{FDP})\leq\alpha$. Here,
we consider control of the $\mathit{FDP}$ in the sense that, for fixed $\gamma$
and $\alpha$, $P\{\mathit{FDP}>\gamma\}\leq \alpha$. Beginning with any
nondecreasing sequence of constants and $p$-values for the individual tests, we
derive stepup procedures that control each of these two measures of error
control without imposing any assumptions on the dependence structure of the
$p$-values. We use our results to point out a few interesting connections with
some closely related stepdown procedures. We then compare and contrast two
$\mathit{FDP}$-controlling procedures obtained using our results with the
stepup procedure for control of the $\mathit{FDR}$ of Benjamini and Yekutieli
[Ann. Statist. 29 (2001) 1165--1188].

several easy relations one can establish between the Euler characteristics of
the surfaces, their orientability, the total degree, and the local degrees at

necessary relations have been khown to be also sufficient for the existence of
the covering except when the base surface is the sphere (and when it is the
projective plane, but this case reduces to the case of the sphere). If the base
surface is the sphere, many exceptions are known to occur and the problem is
widely open. Generalizing methods of Baranski, we prove in this paper that the
necessary relations are actually sufficient in a specific but rather
interesting situation. Namely under the assumption that the base surface is the
sphere, that there are three branching points, that one of these branching
points has only two preimages with one being a double point, and either that
the covering surface is the sphere and that the degree is odd, or that the
covering surface has genus at least one, with a single specific exception. For
the case of the covering surface the sphere we also show that for each even

explicitly solve some examples of second and third order unilateral

proposed in this work can be summarized in following three steps: translating
the quaternionic polynomial in the eigenvalue problem for its companion matrix,
finding its eigenvectors, and, finally, giving the quaternionic solution of the
unilateral polynomial in terms of the components of such eigenvectors. A brief
discussion on bilateral quaternionic quadratic equations is also presented.

of the same asymptotic order as the mixed normal error term. The proposed
methodology, ``ANOVA for diffusions and It\^{o} processes,'' can be used to
measure the statistical quality of a parametric model and, nonparametrically,
the appropriateness of a one-regressor model in general. On the other hand, it
also helps quantify and characterize the trading (hedging) error in the case of
financial applications.

covariance functions across space-time. In the present study we use
quasi-arithmetic functionals to make inferences about the permissibility of
averages of functions that are not, in general, permissible covariance
functions. This is the case, e.g., of the geometric and harmonic averages, for
which we obtain permissibility criteria. Also, some important inequalities
involving covariance functions and preference relations as well as algebraic
properties can be derived by means of the proposed approach. In particular, we
show that quasi-arithmetic covariances allow for ordering and preference
relations, for a Jensen-type inequality and for a minimal and maximal element
of their class. The general results shown in this paper are then applied to
study of spatial and spatiotemporal random fields. In particular, we discuss
the representation and smoothness properties of a weakly stationary random
field with a quasi-arithmetic covariance function. Also, we show that the
generator of the quasi-arithmetic means can be used as a link function in order
to build a space-time nonseparable structure starting from the spatial and
temporal margins, a procedure that is technically sound for those working with
copulas. Several examples of new families of stationary covariances obtainable
with this procedure are shown. Finally, we use quasi-arithmetic functionals to
generalise existing results concerning the construction of nonstationary
spatial covariances and discuss the applicability and limits of this

establish microscopic matter and transition properties such as the number of

order of magnitude higher statistics than currently achievable, as well as a
detailed scan of colliding species and energies are then mandatory to achieve
sufficient discrimination power in theoretical interpretations. This increased

experimental knowledge of different fluctuation observables relevant to nuclear
multifragmentation. The possible connection between the presence of a
fluctuation peak and the occurrence of a phase transition or a critical
phenomenon is critically analyzed. Many different phenomena can lead both to
the creation and to the suppression of a fluctuation peak. In particular, the
role of constraints due to conservation laws and to data sorting is shown to be
essential. From the experimental point of view, a comparison of the available
fragmentation data reveals that there is a good agreement between different
data sets of basic fluctuation observables, if the fragmenting source is of
comparable size. This compatibility suggests that the fragmentation process is
largely independent of the reaction mechanism (central versus peripheral
collisions, symmetric versus asymmetric systems, light ions versus heavy ion
induced reactions). Configurational energy fluctuations, that may give
important information on the heat capacity of the fragmenting system at the
freeze out stage, are not fully compatible among different data sets and
require further analysis to properly account for Coulomb effects and secondary
decays. Some basic theoretical questions, concerning the interplay between the
dynamics of the collision and the fragmentation process, and the cluster
definition in dense and hot media, are still open and are addressed at the end
of the paper. A comparison with realistic models and/or a quantitative analysis
of the fluctuation properties will be needed to clarify in the next future the
nature of the transition observed from compound nucleus evaporation to
multi-fragment production.

descriptive and completely superficial - there is no indication that bounded

remarkable suggestion has been made that there exists a behavioural distinction
between bound and unbound states of systems under gravitational influence. This
notion is critically evaluated here. At the very basic level, a severe problem

period is characterized by the Omori law, which describes the decay in the rate
of aftershocks of a given size with time t by a power law with exponent close
to 1. A shock followed by such a power law decay in the rate is here called
Omori process. Studying several aftercrash time series, we show that the Omori
law holds not only after significant market crashes, but also after
``intermediate shocks''. Moreover, we find self-similar features in the
volatility. Specifically, within the aftercrash period there are smaller shocks
that themselves constitute Omori processes on smaller scales, similar to the
Omori process after the large crash. We call these smaller shocks subcrashes,
which are followed by their own aftershocks. We also find similar Omori
processes after intermediate crashes in time regimes without a large market
crash. By appropriate detrending we remove the influence of the crashes and
subcrashes from the data, and find that this procedure significantly reduces
the memory in the records. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that
the memory in volatility is related to Omori processes present on different

emerged in evolutionary selection of the fittest survivors. Survivability of

previous evolution, it presents the exact law of unanticipated universal

law implies their rapid hereditary, thus genetic, adaptation which is navigated
by operating system of non-coding DNA. Such adaptation to drastic environmental
changes was a must for survival, thus evolved, in otherwise lethal major mass
extinctions. Navigator genome allows for rapid, artificial included, biological

  Application to Error Catastrophe","22 pages, 2 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.75.061909",,"q-bio.PE cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  An equation describing the evolution of phenotypic distribution is derived
using methods developed in statistical physics. The equation is solved by using
the singular perturbation method, and assuming that the number of bases in the
genetic sequence is large. Applying the equation to the mutation-selection
model by Eigen provides the critical mutation rate for the error catastrophe.
Phenotypic fluctuation of clones (individuals sharing the same gene) is
introduced into this evolution equation. With this formalism, it is found that
the critical mutation rate is sometimes increased by the phenotypic
fluctuations, i.e., noise can enhance robustness of a fitted state to mutation.
Our formalism is systematic and general, while approximations to derive more
tractable evolution equations are also discussed.

axes by controlling the stress level in the newly formed wood layers.
Angiosperms and gymnosperms evolved into two distinct mechanisms: the former
produce a wood with large tension pre-stress on the upper side of the tilted
axis, while the latter produce a wood with large compression pre-stress on the
lower side. In both cases, the difference between this stress level and that of
the opposite side, in light tension, generates the bending of the axis.
However, light values of compression were sometimes measured in the opposite
side of angiosperms. By analysing old data on chestnut and mani and new data on
poplar, this study shows that these values were not measurement artefacts. This
reveals that generating light compression stress in opposite wood contributes
to improve the performance of the re-orientation mechanism.
