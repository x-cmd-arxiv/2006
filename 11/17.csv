reinforce these temperature gradients, is found to be an important process in
the rate of growth of vortices in the disk. Factors which strengthen the
baroclinic feedback include fast radiative cooling, high thermal diffusion, and
large radial temperature gradients in the background temperature. When the
baroclinic feedback is sufficiently strong, anticyclonic vortices form from
initial random perturbations and maintain their strength for the duration of
the simulation, for over 600 orbital periods.
  Based on both simulations and a simple vortex model, we find that the local
angular momentum transport due to a single vortex may be inward or outward,
depending its orientation. The global angular momentum transport is highly
variable in time, and is sometimes negative and sometimes positive. This result
is for an anelastic gas model, and does not include shocks that could affect

a coupled set of equations for vorticity and temperature in two dimensions

formation is unambiguously shown to be caused by baroclinicity because (1)
these simulations have zero initial perturbation vorticity and a nonzero
initial temperature distribution; and (2) turning off the baroclinic term halts
vortex formation, as shown by an immediate drop in kinetic energy and
vorticity. Vortex strength increases with: larger background temperature
gradients; warmer background temperatures; larger initial temperature
perturbations; higher Reynolds number; and higher resolution. In the
simulations presented here vortices form when the background temperatures are
$\sim 200K$ and vary radially as $r^{-0.25}$, the initial vorticity
perturbations are zero, the initial temperature perturbations are 5% of the

of 74 simulations showed that as resolution and Reynolds number increase,
vortices can form with smaller initial temperature perturbations, lower

properties occurring in certain regions. We generalize the hardness-intensity

the accretion states both of X-ray binaries and of AGN. Using a sample of

to have a high radio:optical flux ratio when it has a high total luminosity or
a large contribution from X-rays. Thus, it is necessary to take into account
both the optical and the X-ray properties of quasars in order to understand

their laws, coming from general relativity and the laws of thermodynamics. The
analogy is achieved by identifying a suitable set of observables, precisely:
\emph{(a)} $E=M$ (being $E$ the thermodynamic free energy and $M$ the mass of
the BH), \emph{(b)} $T=\alpha \kappa $ (with $T$ the absolute temperature,
$\kappa $ the so-called surface gravity on event horizon and $% \alpha $ a

goal of this work is to provide the contribution to the black hole entropy,

the CMB with the foreground large-scale structure (e.g. galaxies/quasars), have
proven to be an interesting probe of dark energy. We show that magnification
bias, which is the inevitable modulation of the foreground number counts by
gravitational lensing, alters both the shape and amplitude of the observed ISW
signal. This is true especially at high redshifts because (1) the intrinsic
galaxy-temperature signal diminishes greatly back in the matter dominated era,
(2) the lensing efficiency increases with redshift and (3) the number count
slope generally steepens with redshift in a magnitude limited sample. At z >~
2, the magnification-temperature correlation dominates over the intrinsic
galaxy-temperature correlation and causes the observed ISW signal to increase
with z, despite dark energy subdominance -- a result of the fact that
magnification probes structures between the observer and the sources. Ignoring
magnification bias can then lead to erroneous conclusions about dark energy.
While the lensing modulation opens up an interesting high z window for ISW
measurements, high z measurements are not expected to add much new information
to low z ones if dark energy is the cosmological constant. This is because
lensing introduces significant covariance across redshifts. The most compelling
reason to pursue high z ISW measurements is to look for a potential surprise
such as early dark energy domination or the signature of modified gravity. We
conclude with a discussion of existing measurements, the highest z of which is
at the margin of being sensitive to magnification bias. We also develop a
formalism which might be of general interest: to predict biases in estimating
parameters when certain physical effects are ignored in interpreting data.

twelve nebulae have parallax errors less than 20 percent. The parallax for
PHL932 is found here to be smaller than was measured by Hipparcos, and this

the existence of a bipolar nebula several times larger than its
previously-known equatorial dust torus. The outer nebula of HD168625 has a full
extent of about 80 arcsec or 0.85 pc, and one of the lobes has a well-defined
polar ring. The nebula is a near twin of the triple-ring system around SN1987A.
Because of these polar rings, and accounting for stellar/progenitor luminosity,
HD168625 is an even closer twin of SN1987A than the B supergiant Sher 25 in
NGC3603. HD168625's nebula was probably ejected during a giant LBV eruption and
not during a red supergiant phase, so its similarity to the nebula around
SN1987A may open new possibilities for the creation of SN1987A's rings. Namely,
the hypothesis that Sk-69 202 suffered an LBV-like eruption would avert the
complete surrender of single star models for its bipolar nebula by offering an
alternative to an unlikely binary merger scenario. It also hints that LBVs are
the likely progenitors of some type II supernovae, and that HD168625's nebula
is a good example of a pre-explosion environment.

an rms scatter of 0.6-0.7"" in each coordinate, and empirically determined

are well separated from stars in UV/optical color-color space, with the
relative colors suggesting a marginally detected population of reddened objects
due to line of sight absorption or due to dust associated with the quasar. The
resulting rest-frame spectral energy distributions (SEDs) cover ~350-9000A,
where the overall median SED peaks near the Ly-a emission line, as found in
other UV quasar studies. The large sample size allows us to construct median
SEDs in small bins of redshift and luminosity, and we find the median SED
becomes harder at UV wavelengths for quasars with lower continuum luminosity.

revealed the existence of a cluster of stars each of which appears to orbit the
central black hole in $SgrA^*$. For the stars labelled as S2 and S14, we have
studied the emitted spectrum of gravitational wave and compare it with the
sensitivity threshold of space-based interferometers like Lisa and Astrod.
Furthermore, following recent observations, we have considered the possibility
that $SgrA^*$ is actually a binary system of massive black holes and calculated
the emission spectrum as a function of the system parameters. The diffraction
pattern of gravitational waves emitted by a binary system by a cluster of stars
has been also analyzed. We remark that this is only a preliminary-theoretical
work than can acquire more interest in view of the next-coming gravitational

band, where several smaller flares can be seen, on top of a decaying light
curve that exhibits an apparent break around 220 seconds post trigger. This
temporal break is roughly coincident with a spectral break. The latter can be
related to the extrapolated evolution of the break energy in the prompt
gamma-ray emission, and is possibly the manifestation of the peak flux break
frequency of the internal shock passing through the observing band. A possible

large effective radius (~ 7.5 kpc). Both the morphological analysis and the
F450W - F702W colour image suggest that the host galaxy of GRB 011121 is either
a disk-system with a rather small bulge, or one hosting a central,
dust-enshrouded starburst. Hence, we modeled the integrated spectral energy
distribution of this galaxy by combining stellar population and radiative
transfer models, assuming properties representative of nearby starburst or
normal star-forming, Sbc-like galaxies. A range of plausible fitting solutions
indicates that the host galaxy of GRB 011121 has a stellar mass of 3.1 - 6.9
x10^9 Msun, stellar populations with a maximum age ranging from 0.4 to 2 Gyr,
and a metallicity ranging from 1 to 29 per cent of the solar value. Starburst
models suggest this galaxy to be nearly as opaque as local starbursts (with an
A_V = 0.27 - 0.76 mag). Alternatively, normal star-forming Sbc-like models
suggest a high central opacity whereas A_V = 0.12$ -- 0.57 mag along the line
of sight. For this subluminous galaxy (with L_B/Lstar_B = 0.26), we determine a
model-dependent SFR of 2.4 - 9.4 Msun/yr. The SFR per unit luminosity (9.2 -
36.1 Msun/yr/(L_B/Lstar_B)) is high compared to those of most GRB host
galaxies, but consistent with those of most of the hosts at similar low
redshift. Our results suggest that the host galaxy of GRB 011121 is a rather
large disk-system in a relatively early phase of its star formation history.

are found in the form of stellar tidal bridges and tails along the orbits of
some dwarf galaxies and globular clusters. In this study, we investigate the
influence of mass-loss from star clusters or dwarf galaxies on the rate of
their orbit decay due to the effect of dynamical friction. Using a series of
numerical N-body simulations, we show that stars, which become unbound from

contribute to the mass responsible for the dynamical friction. As a
rule-by-thumb, the magnitude of dynamical friction at any instance can be
approximated by the bound mass plus half of the mass which has already become

lines, which has been interpreted as manifestations of accretion. Recently,
evidence has accumulated that this star might have a variable radial velocity.
Aims. We intended to investigate in more detail the possible variability in
radial velocity using a set of 68 high-resolution spectra taken at the VLT
(UVES), the AAT (UCLES) and the CTIO (echelle). Methods. Using standard
cross-correlation techniques, we determined the radial velocity of RU Lup. We
analysed these results with Phasedispersion minimization and the Lomb-Scargle
periodogram and searched for possible periodicities in the obtained radial
velocities. We also analysed changes in the absorption line shapes and the
photometric variability of RU Lup. Results. Our analysis indicated that RU Lup
exhibits variations in radial velocity with a periodicity of 3.71 days and an
amplitude of 2.17 km/s. These variations can be explained by the presence of
large spots, or groups of spots, on the surface of RU Lup. We also considered a
low-mass companion and stellar pulsations as alternative sources for these
variations but found these to be unlikely.

for fluid dynamics based on the lattice Bhatnager--Gross--Krook method (LBGK).
  The LBGK scheme can be recognised as a discrete dynamical system generated by
free-flight and entropic involution. In this framework the stability and
accuracy analysis are more natural. We find the necessary and sufficient
conditions for second-order accurate fluid dynamics modelling. In particular,
it is proven that in order to guarantee second-order accuracy the distribution
should belong to a distinguished surface -- the invariant film (up to
second-order in the time step). This surface is the trajectory of the
(quasi)equilibrium distribution surface under free-flight.
  The main instability mechanisms are identified. The simplest recipes for
stabilisation add no artificial dissipation (up to second-order) and provide
second-order accuracy of the method. Two other prescriptions add some
artificial dissipation locally and prevent the system from loss of positivity
and local blow-up. Demonstration of the proposed stable LBGK schemes are
provided by the numerical simulation of a 1D shock tube and the unsteady
2D-flow around a square-cylinder up to Reynolds number $\mathcal{O}(10000)$.

the effective two-state or ``spin 1/2'' picture. A range of parameters is
determined where the picture holds to good accuracy as the energy levels
undergo gate manipulations. Some general points are presented concerning the
relations between device parameters and ``good'' quantum mechanical state

for adiabatic behavior, and permits the introduction of a random noise to
simulate the effects of decoherence. A formula is derived and tested relating
the random noise to the decoherence rate. Sensitivity to device and operating
parameters for the logical gates NOT and CNOT are examined, with particular
attention to values of the tunnel parameter beta slightly above one. It appears

minority spin condensate having paired spins in the opposite direction. We have
developed a novel mechanical spin density detector to measure the spin

unique magnetic fountain effect occurring only in the A$_1$ phase (occurring
between two transition temperatures, T$_{c1}$ and T$_{c2}$). Unexpectedly, the
spin relaxation rate increases rapidly as the temperature is decreased towards

evolves into a semiconductor. The semimetal-semiconductor transition is
discussed quantitatively. The results should make a theoretical ground for
better understanding of transport phenomena in low-dimensional semimetals. They
can also provide useful information while studying low-dimensional

microstructured artificial material, and demonstrate that it is equivalent to
an integral-differential system. We prove that this complex system can be
reduced to a standard integral equation and solved using standard methods. To
illustrate the application of the proposed method, we homogenize several

the evolution of a tone discriminator by exploiting the physics of liquid

be achieved and controlled in local regions to essentially construct a
programmable array of coupled micro-scale quasiperiodic oscillators. Lastly we
show an example where evolutionary algorithms could be used to control density

temperatures and fields the material forms a quantum paramagnet with a 1 meV
singlet triplet gap and a magnon bandwidth of 1.7 meV. The singlet state
involves multiple spin pairs some of which have negative ground state bond
energies. Increasing the field at low temperatures induces three dimensional
long range antiferromagnetic order at 7.5 Tesla through a continuous phase
transition that can be described as magnon Bose-Einstein condensation. The
phase transition to a fully polarized ferromagnetic state occurs at 37 Tesla.
The ordered antiferromagnetic phase is surrounded by a renormalized classical
regime. The crossover to this phase from the quantum paramagnet is marked by a
distinct anomaly in the magnetic susceptibility which coincides with closure of
the finite temperature singlet-triplet pseudo gap. The phase boundary between
the quantum paramagnet and the Bose-Einstein condensate features a finite
temperature minimum at $T=0.2$ K, which may be associated with coupling to
nuclear spin or lattice degrees of freedom close to quantum criticality.

this model to show that the hypothesis works quite successfully in the presence

where the PMNS matrix is identical to the CKM matrix at the seesaw scale, with

eliminates spurious singularities of the perturbative power series and enhances

vacuum energy (cosmological constant) dominate in the flat Universe. Thus the
direct dark matter search, consisting of detecting the recoiling nucleus, is
central to particle physics and cosmology. Modern particle theories naturally
provide viable cold dark matter candidates with masses in the GeV-TeV region.
Supersymmetry provides the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), theories in
extra dimensions the lightest Kaluza-Klein particle (LKP) etc. In such theories
the expected rates are much lower than the present experimental goals. So one
should exploit characteristic signatures of the reaction, such as the
modulation effect and, in directional experiments, the correlation of the event
rates with the sun's motion.
  In standard non directional experiments the modulation is small, less than
two per cent and the location of the maximum depends on the unknown particle's
mass.
  In directional experiments, in addition to the forward-backward asymmetry due
to the sun's motion, one expects a larger modulation, which depends on the
direction of observation. We study such effects both in the case of a light and
a heavy target. Furthermore, since it now appears that the planned experiments
will be partly directional, in the sense that they can only detect the line of
the recoiling nucleus, but not the sense of direction on it, we study which of
the above mentioned interesting features, if any, will persist in these less
ambitious experiments.

Such models can be surprisingly hard to solve by branch-and-cut algorithms if
the order of the subsets of the partition is irrelevant, since this kind of
symmetry unnecessarily blows up the search tree. We present a general tool,
called orbitopal fixing, for enhancing the capabilities of branch-and-cut
algorithms in solving such symmetric integer programming models. We devise a
linear time algorithm that, applied at each node of the search tree, removes
redundant parts of the tree produced by the above mentioned symmetry. The
method relies on certain polyhedra, called orbitopes, which have been
introduced bei Kaibel and Pfetsch (Math. Programm. A, 114 (2008), 1-36). It
does, however, not explicitly add inequalities to the model. Instead, it uses
certain fixing rules for variables. We demonstrate the computational power of
orbitopal fixing at the example of a graph partitioning problem.

law related to the extended charged particle's own vector potential. Our
approach is based on the Lagrangian formalism of canonical momentum writing
Newton's second law in terms of the vector potential and a development in terms
of obtaining retarded potentials, that allow an intuitive physical
interpretation of its main terms. This framework provides a clear physical
insight on the physics of inertia. It is shown that the electron mass has a
complete electromagnetic origin and the covariant equation obtained solves the
""4/3 mass paradox"". This provides a deeper insight into the significance of the
main terms of the equation of motion. In particular a force term is obtained
from the approach based on the continuity equation for momentum that represents
a drag force the charged particle feels when in motion relatively to its own
vector potential field lines. Thus, the time derivative of the particle's
vector potential leads to the acceleration inertia reaction force and is
equivalent to the Schott term responsible for the source of the radiation
field. We also show that the velocity dependent term of the particle's vector
potential is connected with the relativistic increase of mass with velocity and
generates a stress force that is the source of electric field lines
deformation. This understanding broadens the possibility to manipulate inertial
mass and potentially suggests some mechanisms for possible applications to
electromagnetic propulsion and the development of advanced space propulsion

beam characteristics have been performed by using bare and cadmium covered gold
foils and wires. The in-phantom neutron flux distribution was measured for a
flux mapping inside the phantom. The gamma-ray dose was determined by using
TLD-700 thermoluminescence dosimeters. The thermal and fast neutron fluxes and
the gamma-ray dose were calculated by using the MCNP code, and they were
compared with experimental data. The thermal neutron flux and Cd ratio which
can be obtained at this facility are 1.49E9 n/cm2s and 152, respectively. The
maximum neutron flux inside the phantom was measured to be 2.79E9 n/cm2s at a
depth of 3 mm in the phantom. The two-dimensional in-phantom neutron flux
distribution was determined, and the significant neutron irradiation was
observed within 20 mm from the phantom surface. The gamma-ray dose rate for the
free beam condition is expected to be about 80 cGy/hr. These experimental
results are reasonably well supported by the calculated values of the facility

  WKB Approach",,,"10.1007/s10955-007-9312-2",,"q-bio.PE",,"  The extinction of a single species due to demographic stochasticity is
analyzed. The discrete nature of the individual agents and the Poissonian noise
related to the birth-death processes result in local extinction of a metastable
population, as the system hits the absorbing state. The Fokker-Planck
formulation of that problem fails to capture the statistics of large deviations
from the metastable state, while approximations appropriate close to the
absorbing state become, in general, invalid as the population becomes large. To
connect these two regimes, a master equation based on a real space WKB method
is presented, and is shown to yield an excellent approximation for the decay
rate and the extreme events statistics all the way down to the absorbing state.
The details of the underlying microscopic process, smeared out in a mean field
treatment, are shown to be crucial for an exact determination of the extinction
exponent. This general scheme is shown to reproduce the known results in the
field, to yield new corollaries and to fit quite precisely the numerical
solutions. Moreover it allows for systematic improvement via a series expansion
where the small parameter is the inverse of the number of individuals in the
metastable state.

number of rips in the force-ramp unfolding of the Azoarcus ribozymes is between
two and four. Force-quench refolding of the P4-P6 subdomain of the Tetrahymena
ribozyme occurs through a compact intermediate. Subsequent formation of
tertiary contacts between helices P5b-P6a and P5a/P5c-P4 leads to the native
state. The force-quench refolding pathways agree with ensemble experiments. In
the dominant unfolding route, the N-terminal a helix of GFP unravels first,
followed by disruption of the N terminus b strand. There is a third
intermediate that involves disruption of three other strands. In accord with
experiments, the force-quench refolding pathway of GFP is hierarchic, with the
rate-limiting step being the closure of the barrel.

hidden in each enzymatic cycle. In order to properly interpret experimental
data for back/forward step ratios, mean conditional step-to-step dwell times,
etc., a first-passage analysis has been developed that takes account of hidden
substeps in $N$-state sequential models. The explicit, general results differ
significantly from previous treatments that identify the observed steps with
complete mechanochemical cycles; e.g., the mean dwell times $\tau_+$ and
$\tau_-$ prior to forward and back steps, respectively, are normally {\it
unequal} although the dwell times $\tau_{++}$ and $\tau_{--}$ between {\it
successive} forward and back steps are equal. Illustrative (N=2)-state examples
display a wide range of behavior. The formulation extends to the case of two or
more detectable transitions in a multistate cycle with hidden substeps.

docking on a public grid infrastructure. Protein-ligand docking is about
computing the binding energy of a protein target to a library of potential
drugs using a scoring algorithm. Previous deployments were either limited to
one cluster, to grids of clusters in the tightly protected environment of a
pharmaceutical laboratory or to pervasive grids. The first large scale docking
experiment ran on the EGEE grid production service from 11 July 2005 to 19
August 2005 against targets relevant to research on malaria and saw over 41
million compounds docked for the equivalent of 80 years of CPU time. Up to
1,700 computers were simultaneously used in 15 countries around the world.
Issues related to the deployment and the monitoring of the in silico docking
experiment as well as experience with grid operation and services are reported
in the paper. The main problem encountered for such a large scale deployment
was the grid infrastructure stability. Although the overall success rate was
above 80%, a lot of monitoring and supervision was still required at the
application level to resubmit the jobs that failed. But the experiment
demonstrated how grid infrastructures have a tremendous capacity to mobilize
very large CPU resources for well targeted goals during a significant period of

processes of organisms. Unfortunately body mass cannot be easily measured for
many species, because of the logistical difficulties involved in actually
catching and weighing them. This is particularly true for sea turtles which are
large vertebrates that spend most of their life at sea. Here we developed a
general linear model to predict body mass from 17 morphometric measurements
obtained from 49 leatherback turtles nesting in Awala Yalimapo beach, French
Guiana, South America. A stepwise backward analysis removing independent
parameters with P > 0.001 indicated that body mass can be estimated with 93%
accuracy by Body Mass (kg) = - 709.146 + 3.391MedianBodyCirc (cm) + 2.664SCCL
(cm), where SCCL is the standard curvilinear carapace length and MedianBodyCirc
is body circumference at half of SCCL. A sensibility test showed that this
parsimonious model is robust, as estimated body mass may change by 0.7-1.3% for
1-2 cm changes in SCCL, by 0.9-1.7% for 1-2 cm changes in circumference.
Leatherback turtles from French Guiana were larger and heavier than in all
other nesting sites studied so far, suggesting either that gravid leatherbacks
feed during the nesting season in French Guiana, and/or that this species may
exhibits site-specific growth strategies. Further studies are required to test
these hypotheses, including implementation of similar simple models for other
nesting populations, in order to better understand the life history of this
endangered species.

French Guiana. In total 23 turtles were fitted with Argos satellite
transmitters and 16 individuals (including 6 concurrently satellite-tracked)
were equipped with an electronic time-depth recorder for single inter-nesting
intervals, i.e. between two consecutive ovi-positions. The leatherbacks
dispersed over the continental shelf, ranging from the coastal zone to the
shelf break and moved over 546.2 $\pm$ 154.1 km (mean $\pm$ SD) in waters of
French Guiana and neighbouring Surinam. They mostly performed shallow (9.4
$\pm$ 9.2 m) and short (4.4 $\pm$ 3.4 min) dives with a slight diurnal pattern.
They dived deeper as they moved away from the coast suggesting that they were
predominantly following the seabed. Inter-nesting intervals could be divided
into two phases: during the first 75% of the time turtles spent at sea, they
dived on average 47 min h-1 before showing a lower and more variable diving
effort as they came back to the shore. The extended movements of leatherbacks
and the fine analysis of dive shapes suggest that in French Guiana leatherbacks
may feed during the inter-nesting interval, probably to compensate for the
energy costs associated with reproduction. This results in this endangered
species being exposed to high risks of interactions with local fisheries
throughout the continental shelf.

multiplication, we obtain three different types of lower bounds; Type S, Type R
and Type L. If the parameter is a real number, the Type S bound is useful. If
the parameter is complex, the Type R and L bounds are useful. As an
application, we will consider estimation of polynomials of the complex
amplitude of the quantum Gaussian state. For the case where the amplitude lies
in the real axis, a uniformly optimum estimator for the square of the amplitude
will be derived using the Type S bound. It will be shown that there is no
unbiased estimator uniformly optimum as a polynomial of annihilation and/or
creation operators for the cube of the amplitude. For the case where the
amplitude does not necessarily lie in the real axis, uniformly optimum
estimators for holomorphic, antiholomorphic and real-valued polynomials of the
amplitude will be derived. Those estimators for the holomorphic and real-valued
cases attains the Type R bound, and those for the antiholomorphic and

interested in the philosphical and foundational issues surrounding quantum
mechanics for a simple reason: one can cast its central concerns in terms of a
long-familiar question: How does the quantum world differ from the classical
one? Moreover, deployment of the concepts of information and computation in
novel contexts hints at new (or better) means of understanding quantum
mechanics, and perhaps even invites re-assessment of traditional material
conceptions of the basic nature of the physical world. In this paper I review
some of these philosophical aspects of quantum information theory, begining
with an elementary survey of the theory, seeking to highlight some of the
principles and heuristics involved. We move on to a discussion of the nature
and definition of quantum information and deploy the findings in discussing the
puzzles surrounding teleportation. The final two sections discuss,
respectively, what one might learn from the development of quantum computation
(both about the nature of quantum systems and about the nature of computation)
and consider the impact of quantum information theory on the traditional
foundational questions of quantum mechanics (treating of the views of
