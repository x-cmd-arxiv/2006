Non-parametric fits are used to derive the mean properties of the sample and to

entropy at 0.2r500 matches well the results of Ponman et al. (2003). However,
compared to cool clusters, the groups in our sample reveal larger entropy at
inner radii and a substantially flatter slope in the entropy in the outskirts,
compared to both the prediction of pure gravitational heating and to
observations of clusters. This difference corresponds to the systematically
flatter group surface brightness profiles, reported previously. The scaled
pressure profiles can be well approximated with a Sersic model with n=4. We
find that groups exhibit a systematically larger dispersion in pressure,
compared to clusters of galaxies, while the dispersion in entropy is similar.

colour-magnitude diagram reaches ~7 magnitudes below the red giant branch tip
with 90% completeness, and allows the detection of various morphological
features which can be used to derive detailed constraints on the age and
metallicity of the constituent stellar population. We find that the
colour-magnitude diagram is best described by a population with a large age
range (>= 10 Gyr) and a relatively high mean metallicity [M/H]= -0.4. The
spread in metallicity is constrained to be <=0.5 dex. The star formation rate
in this region has declined over time, with the bulk of the stellar mass having
formed >6 Gyr ago. Nonetheless, a non-negligible mass fraction (approximately
10%) of the population has formed in the last 2 Gyr. We discuss the nature of
the G1 Clump in light of these new stellar population constraints and argue
that the combination of stellar content and physical size make it unlikely that
the structure is the remnant of an accreted dwarf galaxy. Instead, the strong
similarity between the stellar content of the G1 Clump and that of the M31
outer disk suggests the substructure is a fragment of the outer disk, perhaps
torn off from the main body during a past accretion/merger event; this
interpretation is consistent with extant kinematical data. If this
interpretation is correct, our analysis of the stellar content provides further
evidence that the outskirts of large disk galaxies have been in place for a
significant time.

emission from the secondary products in hadronic interactions generated by
cosmic rays (CRs), in addition to the contribution of $\pi^0$ decay via the
decay mode $\pi^0 \to 2\gamma$. For that purpose we employ the Monte Carlo
particle collision code DPMJET3.04 to determine the multiplicity spectra of
various secondary particles with $\gamma$'s as the final decay state, that
result from inelastic collisions between cosmic-ray protons and Helium nuclei
and the interstellar medium with standard composition. We thus derive an
easy-to-use $\gamma$-ray production matrix for cosmic ray up to about 10 PeV,
that can be used to interpret the $\gamma$-ray spectra of diffuse galactic
emission and supernova remnants (SNR).
  We apply the $\gamma$-ray production matrix to the GeV excess in diffuse
galactic $\gamma$-rays that was seen with EGRET. Although the non-$\pi^0$
contributions to the total emission have a different spectrum than the
$\pi^0$-decay component, they are insufficient to explain the GeV excess.
  We also test the hypothesis that the TeV-band $\gamma$-ray emission of the
shell-type SNR RX J1713-3946, that was observed with HESS, is caused by
shock-accelerated hadronic cosmic rays. This scenario implies a very high
efficacy of particle acceleration, so the particle spectrum is expected to
continuously harden toward high energies on account of cosmic-ray modification
of the shock. Using the $\chi^2$ statistic we find that a continuously
softening spectrum is strongly preferred, in contrast to expectations. A
hardening spectrum has about 1% probability to explain the HESS data, but then
only if a hard cut-off at 50-100 TeV is imposed on the particle spectrum.

order to characterize the movement of gas within and from this system. Light
curves are constructed, using a total of 1647 continuum level measurements.
These results support the semidetached status of this interacting binary star.
Radial velocities, residual intensities, full width half maxima (FWHM), line
asymmetries, and equivalent widths of UV absorption lines for aluminum,
magnesium, iron, and silicon in a range of ionization states are determined and
analyzed. For selected epochs, we were able to isolate gas stream and
photospheric contributions by an examination of the differences between
spectral line shapes. We observed variations in line shape and strength, with
orbital phase and epoch, indicating the presence of stable gas streams and
circumstellar gas, and periods of increased mass-transfer activity associated
with transient gas streams. The 1989 data indicates moderate activity. This
epoch was examined most closely since it provides the greatest phase coverage.
Spectral line profiles in 1978 and 1984 have the strongest gas-flow absorption
components, indicating that these are the epochs of the greatest activity. The
dense phase coverage in September 1989 allows us to measure the mass loss rate
from Algol B into Algol A which is of order ~10E-14 solar masses per year.
Since the highest gas-flow velocities are in the 100 kilometer per second
range, well below escape velocity, we conclude that systemic mass loss due to
gas flow is small for the Algol system.

they are significantly higher and also both E=6.4 and E=6.9 keV iron lines are
detected. We attribute the excess iron line emission to the Ultra-Luminous
X-ray source in its high state. In general the iron K-shell luminosity of M82
is dominated by the diffuse component. The total X-ray luminosity of the
diffuse hard X-ray emission (corrected for emission by unresolved low
luminosity compact objects) is L_X ~ 4.4 x 10^39 erg/s in the E=2-8 keV energy

The 6.7 keV iron line luminosity is consistent with that expected from the
previously unobserved metal-enriched merged supernova ejecta that is thought to
drive the larger-scale galactic superwind. The iron line luminosity implies a
thermal pressure within the starburst region of P/k ~ 2 x 10^7 K/cm^3, which is
consistent with independent observational estimates of the starburst region

Inter-Planetary Network (IPN), for which the position is constrained by at
least one annulus on the celestial sphere. For each burst, I have checked
whether its IPN 3-sigma error region coincides with the apparent disk of one of
316 galaxies found within 20 Mpc. I find a single match of a GRB with M74,
which could, however, be due to a chance coincidence. I estimate the IPN
efficiency as a function of fluence and derive the galaxy sample completeness.
I find that assuming there is a cut-off in the observed energy distribution of
SGR flares at <10^47 erg, the fraction of SGRs among short GRBs is <16% (95%

the observed Galactic rate. Comparison of the Galactic rate with the inferred
extragalactic rate implies a steepening of the flare energy distribution at

M33's nucleus (corresponding to ~ 4 - 6 visual scale lengths or ~ 9 - 13 kpc in
deprojected radius). The color-magnitude diagrams reveal a mixed stellar
population whose youngest constituents have ages no greater than ~ 100 Myr and
whose oldest members have ages of at least several Gyr. The presence of stars
as massive as 3 - 5 Msun is consistent with global star formation thresholds in
disk galaxies but could argue for a threshold in M33 that is on the low end of
observational and theoretical expectations. The metallicity gradient as
inferred by comparing the observed red giant branch (RGB) to the Galactic
globular clusters is consistent with M33's inner disk gradient traced by
several other studies. The surface density of RGB stars drops off exponentially
with a radial scale length of 4.7' +/- 0.1'. The scale length increases with
age in a manner similar to the vertical scale height of several nearby
late-type spirals. Based on the metallicity gradient, density gradient, and
mixed nature of the stellar populations, we conclude these fields are dominated
by a disk population although we cannot rule out the presence of a small halo
component.

the acceleration in the early phase as compared with that of the original
plane-parallel flow. Second, we obtain semi-analytic solutions for a mildly
relativistic flow in which the rest mass energy density is not negligible in

Determination of lithium abundances in low-mass stars represents an alternative
and robust way to infer stellar ages. Aims: We measured lithium in a sample of
low mass members of the young (4-5 Myr) sigma Ori cluster with the main goal of
investigating its star formation history. Methods: Using the FLAMES
multi-object spectrograph on VLT/UT2, we obtained spectra of 98 candidate

the presence of Halpha emission, and to measure the strength of the Li 670.8 nm

membership list with membership classifications in the literature based on
radial velocities and proper motions. The metallicity sensitive m_1 index was
used to derive individual and age-independent metallicities for the members of

present metallicities for 169 members of the red giant branch in the Draco

spirals and disks) in the active galaxies. This result supports the association
of the dusty structures with the material which feeds the supermassive black
hole (hereafter SMBH). Among the inactive galaxies there is instead an excess
of nuclear stellar disks. As the active and inactive galaxies can be considered
two phases of the ""same"" galaxy, the above findings and dust morphologies
suggest an evolutionary scenario in which external material (gas and dust) is
captured to the nuclear region where it settles and ends up feeding the active
nucleus and replenishing the stellar disk - which is hidden by the dust in the
active galaxies - with new stars. This evolutionary scenario is supported by
recent gas kinematics of the inner few hundred parsecs of NGC1097, which shows
streaming motions (with velocities ~ 50 km/s) towards the nucleus along spiral
arms. The implied large scale mass accretion rate is much larger than the one
derived in previous studies for the nuclear accretion disk, but is just enough
to accumulate one million solar masses over a few million years in the nuclear
region, thus consistent with the recent finding of a young circumnuclear
starburst of one million solar masses within 9 parsecs from the nucleus in this
galaxy.

Both sets of tracks predict the mean age to increase and the mean metallicity
to decrease with radius. Allowing age and metallicity to be free parameters and
assuming star formation began ~ 14 Gyr ago, we find that the mean age of all
stars and stellar remnants increases from ~ 6 Gyr to ~ 8 Gyr and the mean
global metallicity decreases from ~ -0.7 to ~ -0.9. The fraction of stars
formed by 4.5 Gyr ago increases from ~ 65% to ~ 80%. The mean star formation

turbulence becomes nonlocal in the sense that low frequency modes cause
decorrelation of interacting high frequency modes from the inertial interval.
It is shown that the obtained nonlocal spectrum of the inertial range of
incompressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence represents an anisotropic
analogue of Kraichnan's nonlocal spectrum of hydrodynamic turbulence. Based on
the analysis performed in the framework of the weak coupling approximation,
which represents one of the equivalent formulations of the direct interaction

properties on the the environment up to a redshift z~1, on the basis of a deep

  Methods: We have developed a new method which combines galaxy angular
positions and photometric redshifts to estimate the local galaxy
number-density. This allows both the detection of overdensities in the galaxy
distribution and the study of the properties of the galaxy population as a
function of the environmental density.
  Results: We detect two moderate overdensities at z~0.7 and z~1 previously
identified spectroscopically. We find that the fraction of red galaxies within
each structure increases with volume density, extending to z~1 previous
results. We measure ``red sequence'' slopes consistent with the values found in
X-ray selected clusters, supporting the notion that the mass-metallicity
relation hold constant up to z~1.
  Conclusions: Our method based on photometric redshifts allows to extend
structure detection and density estimates up to the limits of photometric
surveys, i.e.considerably deeper than spectroscopic surveys. Since X-ray
cluster detection at high redshift is presently limited to massive relaxed
structures, galaxy volume density based on photometric redshift appears as a
valuable tool in the study of galaxy evolution.

by the effects of electron-phonon coupling. We analyze the separate
contributions of curvature and confinement. Confinement plays a major role in
modifying SWNT phonons and is often more relevant than curvature. Due to their
one-dimensional character, metallic tubes are expected to undergo Peierls
distortions (PD) at T=0K. At finite temperature, PD are no longer present, but
phonons with atomic displacements similar to those of the PD are affected by
strong Kohn anomalies (KA). We investigate by Density Functional Theory (DFT)
KA and PD in metallic SWNTs with diameters up to 3 nm, in the electronic
temperature range from 4K to 3000 K. We then derive a set of simple formulas
accounting for all the DFT results. Finally, we prove that the static approach,
commonly used for the evaluation of phonon frequencies in solids, fails because
of the SWNTs reduced dimensionality. The correct description of KA in metallic
SWNTs can be obtained only by using a dynamical approach, beyond the adiabatic
Born-Oppenheimer approximation, by taking into account non-adiabatic
contributions. Dynamic effects induce significant changes in the occurrence and
shape of Kohn anomalies. We show that the SWNT Raman G peak can only be
interpreted considering the combined dynamic, curvature and confinement
effects. We assign the G+ and G- peaks of metallic SWNTs to TO

state, is a zero band-gap semiconductor, which becomes a metal if the Fermi
energy is tuned applying a gate-voltage Vg. Graphene electrons near the Fermi
energy have twodimensional massless dispersions, described by Dirac cones. Here
we show that a change in Vg induces a stiffening of the Raman G peak (i.e. the
zone-center E2g optical phonon), which cannot be described within BO. Indeed,
the E2g vibrations cause rigid oscillations of the Dirac-cones in the
reciprocal space. If the electrons followed adiabatically the Dirac-cone
oscillations, no change in the phonon frequency would be observed. Instead,
since the electron-momentum relaxation near the Fermi level is much slower than
the phonon motion, the electrons do not follow the Dirac-cone displacements.
This invalidates BO and results in the observed phonon stiffening. This
spectacular failure of BO is quite significant since BO has been the

of self-propelled particles. In the model, particles move on a plane with a
velocity of constant magnitude; they locally interact with their neighbors by
choosing at each time step a velocity direction equal to the average direction
of their neighbors. Thus, in the limit of vanishing velocities the model
becomes analogous to a Monte-Carlo realization of the classical XY ferromagnet.
We show by large-scale numerical simulations that, unlike in the equilibrium XY
model, a long-range ordered phase characterized by non-vanishing net flow
$\phi$ emerges in this system in a phase space domain bordered by a critical
line along which the fluctuations of the order parameter diverge. The
corresponding phase diagram as a function of two parameters, the amplitude of
noise $\eta$ and the average density of the particles $\varrho$ is calculated
and is found to have the form $\eta_c(\varrho)\sim \varrho^{1/2}$. We also find
that $\phi$ scales as a function of the external bias $h$ (field or ``wind'')
according to a power law $\phi\sim h^{0.9}$. In the ordered phase the system
shows long-range correlated fluctuations and $1/f$ noise.

resonance (NMR) experiments for k-(ET)2X family of organic charge transfer
salts by using the phenomenological spin fluctuation model of Moriya, and
Millis, Monien and Pines (M-MMP). For temperatures above T_NMR ~ 50 K, the
model gives a good quantitative description of the data for the paramagnetic
metallic phase of several k-(ET)2X materials, with an antiferromagnetic
correlation length which increases with decreasing temperature; growing to
several lattice constants by T_NMR. It is shown that the fact that the
dimensionless Korringa ratio is much larger than unity is inconsistent with a
broad class of theoretical models (such as dynamical mean-field theory) which
neglect spatial correlations and/or vertex corrections. For materials close to
the Mott insulating phase, 1/T1, Ks, and K all decrease significantly with
decreasing temperature below T_NMR. This cannot be described by the M-MMP model
and the most natural explanation is that a pseudogap opens up in the density of
states below T_NMR, as in, for example, the cuprates. We show that the NMR
measurements reported for k-(ET)2Cu2(CN)3 are qualitatively inconsistent with
this material having a ground state with long range magnetic order. A pseudogap
in the metallic state of organic superconductors is an important prediction of
the resonating valence bond theory of superconductivity. We propose specific
new experiments on organic superconductors to elucidate the nature, origin, and
momentum dependence of the pseudogap and its relationship to superconductivity.

code-spectrum approach, it is shown that a linear code with a good joint
spectrum can be used to establish limit-approaching lossless JSCC schemes for
correlated general sources and general MACs, where the joint spectrum is a
generalization of the input-output weight distribution. Some properties of
linear codes with good joint spectra are investigated. A formula on the
""distance"" property of linear codes with good joint spectra is derived, based
on which, it is further proved that, the rate of any systematic codes with good
joint spectra cannot be larger than the reciprocal of the corresponding
alphabet cardinality, and any sparse generator matrices cannot yield linear
codes with good joint spectra. The problem of designing arbitrary rate coding
schemes is also discussed. A novel idea called ""generalized puncturing"" is
proposed, which makes it possible that one good low-rate linear code is enough
for the design of coding schemes with multiple rates. Finally, various coding
problems of MACs are reviewed in a unified framework established by the
code-spectrum approach, under which, criteria and candidates of good linear

the coherence of their flavor content defined by N --> l+\Phi is destroyed,
modifying the efficiency of the inverse decays. We point out, however, that it
is not enough that the flavor-sensitive processes are fast on the cosmic

($\nu \bar{\nu}$) emission is the unique process to distinguish the Majorana
neutrino from the Dirac neutrino. The small energy difference between atomic
levels makes it easier to measure small neutrino masses as indicated by
neutrino oscillation experiments. The crucial point is how to enhance the rate
of pair emission without enhancing the radiative decay. We have in mind two
particular cases; (1) laser irradiated pair emission from metastable atoms, and
(2) microwave irradiated emission from circular Rydberg states. A new mechanism
of the parametric amplification to enhance the neutrino pair emission is
pointed out when Rydberg atoms are irradiated by microwave, while the radiative

Goldstone dynamics, which is known to generate a brane energy momentum tensor
of a particular structure necessary for the above regularization to be
successful. We study these compactifications in both a non-supersymmetric and a
supersymmetric setting. We see that in the non-supersymmetric case, there is a
restriction to the admissible warpings and furthermore to the quantum numbers
of the bulk gauge field and the brane scalar field. On the contrary, in the
supersymmetric case, the warping can be arbitrary.

as the boundary of its domain is deformed in a prescribed fashion. The flow is
taken to be initially steady, and the boundary deformation is assumed to be
slow compared to the fluid motion. The Eulerian flow is found to remain
approximately steady throughout the evolution. At leading order, the velocity
field depends instantaneously on the shape of the domain boundary, and it is
determined by the steadiness and vorticity-preservation conditions. This is
made explicit by reformulating the problem in terms of an area-preserving
diffeomorphism $\gL$ which transports the vorticity. The first-order correction
to the velocity field is linear in the boundary velocity, and we show how it
can be computed from the time-derivative of $\gL$.
  The evolution of the Lagrangian position of fluid particles is also examined.
Thanks to vorticity conservation, this position can be specified by an
angle-like coordinate along vorticity contours. An evolution equation for this
angle is derived, and the net change in angle resulting from a cyclic
deformation of the domain boundary is calculated. This includes a geometric
contribution which can be expressed as the integral of a certain curvature over
the interior of the circuit that is traced by the parameters defining the
deforming boundary.
  A perturbation approach using Lie series is developed for the computation of
both the Eulerian flow and geometric angle for small deformations of the
boundary. Explicit results are presented for the evolution of nearly
axisymmetric flows in slightly deformed discs.

amalgamated free product acting on the Bass-Serre tree). If G is a word
hyperbolic group which is delta hyperbolic with respect to a symmetric
generating set S, then there is a positive constant C depending only on delta
and on |S| such that every element of G either has a power which is conjugate
to its inverse, or else the stable commutator length is at least equal to C. By
Bavard's theorem, these lower bounds on stable commutator length imply the
existence of quasimorphisms with uniform control on the defects; however, we
show how to construct such quasimorphisms directly.
  We also prove various separation theorems, constructing homogeneous
quasimorphisms (again with uniform estimates) which are positive on some
prescribed element while vanishing on some family of independent elements whose
translation lengths are uniformly bounded.
  Finally, we prove that the first accumulation point for stable commutator
length in a torsion-free word hyperbolic group is contained between 1/12 and

but extreme phenomena such as large earthquakes, financial market crashes, and
material rupture. A promising line of research involves the early detection of
precursory log-periodic oscillations to help forecast extreme events in
collective phenomena where discrete scale invariance plays an important role.
Here I investigate two distinct approaches towards the general problem of how
to detect log-periodic oscillations in arbitrary time series without prior
knowledge of the location of the moveable singularity. I first show that the
problem has a definite solution in Fourier space, however the technique
involved requires an unrealistically large signal to noise ratio. I then show
that the quadrature signal obtained via analytic continuation onto the
imaginary axis, using the Hilbert transform, necessarily retains the
log-periodicities found in the original signal. This finding allows the
development of a new method of detecting log-periodic oscillations that relies
on calculation of the instantaneous phase of the analytic signal. I illustrate
the method by applying it to the well documented stock market crash of 1987.
Finally, I discuss the relevance of these findings for parametric rather than
nonparametric estimation of critical times.

Myr noise cycles to the 99% confidence level, while failing to recognize a
third such so called 99% significant noise period, of 0.55 Myr at 5.3 var%.
Thus at least one claimed period (of 1.0 Myr) is a simple modulation of a
relatively stronger noise cycle (of 0.55 Myr) overlooked by ibid. All so called
99% significant periods reach mere 5 to 6% var levels which can be hardly
distinguished from noise: those periods fidelity is at staggering 1 to 2 orders
of magnitude below the usual signal to noise separation marker at 12.0.
Remarkably, at least ten noise periods got boosted to 95% confidence level, and
some five noise periods to near 95% confidence level, as well. Even the zero
padding of just 4% of data, as done by ibid., significantly suppresses (hence
unreported) the strongest 99% significant period, of 7.28 Myr at 7.5 var%.
Therefore, the periods claimed are due to strong noise reflection of some
intermediary. As hand waving cyclic cataclysm claims start to frequent
scientific journals, revision of editorial policies is called for on spectral
analyses of inherently gapped long records, and of records composed mostly of
natural data of significantly inconsistent reliability.

slope averaged over the time of activity of the scientist is roughly
independent of time and is a fairly age-independent measure of his scientific
impact. In physics and chemistry, well-cited active scientists have

The complete analysis of possible topological structures in a neighborhood of

An algorithmic approach to analyze system behavior with parameter changes is

analysis, labeled ""genotype-based association"", in which the two test results
from assuming dominant and recessive model are combined in one optimal output.
This method differs both from the allele-based association which artificially
doubles the sample size, and the direct chi-square test on 3-by-2 contingency
table which may overestimate the degree of freedom. We conclude that the
comparative advantage (or disadvantage) of the genotype-based test over the
allele-based test mainly depends on two parameters, the allele frequency
difference delta and the Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium coefficient difference
delta_epsilon. Six different situations, called ""phases"", characterized by the
two X^2 test statistics in allele-based and genotype-based test, are well
separated in the phase diagram parameterized by delta and delta_epsilon. For
two major groups of phases, a single parameter theta = tan^-1
(delta/delta_epsilon) is able to achieves an almost perfect phase separation.
We also applied the analytic result to several types of disease models. It is
shown that for dominant and additive models, genotype-based tests are favored
over allele-based tests.

cause a violation of the independent sample assumption in case-control
association studies. To avoid the correlation between samples, a common
practice is to take only one affected sample per pedigree in association
analysis. Although several methods exist in handling correlated samples, they
are still not widely used in part because these are not easily implemented, or
because they are not widely known. We advocate the effective sample size method
as a simple and accessible approach for case-control association analysis with
correlated samples. This method modifies the chi-square test statistic,
p-value, and 95% confidence interval of the odds-ratio by replacing the
apparent number of allele or genotype counts with the effective ones in the
standard formula, without the need for specialized computer programs. We
present a simple formula for calculating effective sample size for many types
of relative pairs and relative sets. For allele frequency estimation, the
effective sample size method captures the variance inflation exactly. For
genotype frequency, simulations showed that effective sample size provides a
satisfactory approximation. A gene which is previously identified as a type 1
diabetes susceptibility locus, the interferon-induced helicase gene (IFIH1), is
shown to be significantly associated with rheumatoid arthritis when the
effective sample size method is applied. This significant association is not
established if only one affected sib per pedigree were used in the association
analysis. Relationship between the effective sample size method and other
methods -- the generalized estimation equation, variance of eigenvalues for
correlation matrices, and genomic controls -- are discussed.

consider the geometrical setting of D-dimensional half-spaces which allows us
to exploit a connection to the one-dimensional case. Intriguingly, we find a
difference in the scaling properties depending on whether the system is bosonic
- where an area-law is first proven to hold - or fermionic, extending previous
findings for cubic regions. For bosonic systems with nearest neighbor
interaction we prove the conjectured area-law by computing the logarithmic
negativity analytically. We identify a length scale associated with
entanglement, different from the correlation length. For fermions we determine
the logarithmic correction to the area-law, which depends on the topology of
the Fermi surface. We find that Lifshitz quantum phase transitions are
accompanied with a non-analyticity in the prefactor of the leading order term.

to completely eliminate decoherence and also provide conditions under which it
can be done so. A novel construction employing an auxiliary system, the bait,
which is instrumental to decoupling the system from the environment is
presented. Our approach to decoherence control in contrast to other approaches
in the literature involves the bilinear input affine model of quantum control
system which lends itself to various techniques from classical control theory,
but with non-trivial modifications to the quantum regime. The elegance of this
approach yields interesting results on open loop decouplability and Decoherence
Free Subspaces(DFS). Additionally, the feedback control of decoherence may be
related to disturbance decoupling for classical input affine systems, which
entails careful application of the methods by avoiding all the quantum
mechanical pitfalls. In the process of calculating a suitable feedback the
system has to be restructured due to its tensorial nature of interaction with
the environment, which is unique to quantum systems. The results are
qualitatively different and superior to the ones obtained via master equations.
Finally, a methodology to synthesize feedback parameters itself is given, that
technology permitting, could be implemented for practical 2-qubit systems to
perform decoherence free Quantum Computing.
