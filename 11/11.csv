undersampled. However, precision photometry with undersampled imagers requires
a detailed understanding of the sensitivity variations on a scale much smaller
than a pixel. To address this, a near-infrared spot projection system has been
developed to precisely characterize near-infrared focal plane arrays and to
study the effect of sub-pixel non uniformity on precision photometry.
Measurements of large format near-infrared detectors demonstrate the power of
this system for understanding sub-pixel response.

the maximum of the outburst. IGR J17497-2821 is found in a typical Low Hard
State (LHS) of X-ray binaries (XRB), well represented by an absorbed
Comptonized spectrum with an iron edge at about 7 keV. The high value of the
absorption (~4 e22 cm-2) suggests that the source is located at a large
distance, either close to the Galactic center or beyond. The timing analysis
shows no particular features, while the shape of the power density spectra is
also typical of LHS of XRBs, with ~36% RMS variability. No radio counterpart is
found down to a limit of 0.21 mJy at 4.80 GHz and 8.64 GHz. Although the
position of IGR J17497-2821 in the radio to X-ray flux diagram is well below
the correlation usually observed in the LHS of black holes, the comparison of
its X-ray properties with those of other sources leads us to suggest that it is
a black hole candidate.

March and August 2004. The long-term variability of the Compton-thick
absorption and emission line complexes will be used to probe the properties of
the circumstellar matter. A detailed timing and spectral analysis of the three
observations is performed, along with the reanalysis of the XMM-Newton
observation performed in February 2003. The results are compared with
predictions from numerical radiative transfer simulations to derive the
parameters of the circumstellar matter. Despite the large flux dynamic range
observed (almost a factor 3 between observations performed a few months apart),
the source remained bright (suggesting it is a persistent source) and
Compton-thick (NH >1.2x10^24 cm-2). Large Equivalent Width (EW) emission lines
from Fe Kalpha, Fe Kbeta and Ni Kalpha were present in all spectra. The
addition of a Fe Kalpha Compton Shoulder improves the fits, especially in the
2004 observations. Sporadic occurrences of rapid X-ray flux risings were
observed in three of the four observations. The Fe Kalpha light curve followed
the continuum almost instantaneously, suggesting that the emission lines are
produced by illumination of small-scale optically-thick matter around the
high-energy continuum source. Using the iron line EW and Compton Shoulder as
diagnostic of the geometry of the matter, we suggest that the obscuring matter

inner few parsec of galactic centres are predicted to sink into the central
parsec due to dynamical friction on low mass stars, forming a high
concentration cusp (Morris 1993). Same physical region may also contain very
high density molecular clouds and accretion discs that are needed to fuel SMBH
activity. Here we estimate gas capture rates onto the cusp of stellar remnants,
and the resulting X-ray luminosity, as a function of the accretion disc mass.
At low disc masses, most compact objects are too dim to be observable, whereas
in the high disc case most of them are accreting at their Eddington rates. We
find that for low accretion disc masses, compact remnant cusps may be more
luminous than the central SMBHs. This ``diffuse'' emission may be of importance
for local moderately bright AGN, especially Low Luminosity AGN. We also briefly
discuss how this expected emission can be used to put constraints on the black

reflected features remain constant. Here we propose a simple explanation to
this. In all likelihood, the emission of a moderately optically thick magnetic
flare atop an accretion disc is anisotropic. A constant energy release rate in
a flare will appear to produce a variable X-ray flux as the flare rotates with
the accretion disc anchoring the magnetic tube. The reflector, on the other
hand, receives a constant X-ray flux from the flare. Since the reflected
emission is azimuthally symmetric, the observer will see a roughly constant
reflected flux (neglecting relativistic effects). The model does not produce
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) if magnetic flux tubes are sheared out faster
than they complete one orbit.

0558-504 obtained with RXTE during a 1-year monitoring campaign. This source,
which is one of the very few radio-loud NLS1 galaxies, shows strong X-ray flux
variability on time scales of weeks-months accompanied by spectral variability.
The main goal of this study is to investigate the spectral variability with
model-independent methods and time-resolved spectroscopy in order to shed light
on the origin of the X-rays. The main results can be summarized as follows: 1)
The flux typically changes by a factor of 1.5-2 on time scales of 10-30 days,
with few extreme events where the flux increases by a factor of ~4 in 3 days.
2) We do not observe any large amplitude, flux related spectral variations.
During the flux variations, the spectrum varies mainly in normalization and not
in shape. We do observe some small amplitude spectral variations, which do not
correlate with flux, although there is a hint of spectral hardening as the
source brightens. 3) There is no evidence for reprocessing features such as the
Fe Kalpha line or a Compton hump. We argue that PKS 0558-504 is a peculiar
object that appears to be different from most of the radio-quiet and radio-loud
AGN. If a jet is responsible for the bulk of the X-rays, it must operate in an
unusual way. If instead a corona is responsible for the X-rays, the system
might be a large-scale analog of the Galactic black holes in the transient
intermediate state.

spectra are modelled in the 0.3--5 keV band by a steep power law with \Gamma =
2.3\pm 0.1, and the upper limit on intrinsic absorption is 8.7 x 10^{20}
cm^{-2}. The spectral slopes are consistent with power law indices commonly
observed in NLS1s, and it appears that we observe the central engine X-rays
directly. Including two recent Swift ToO snapshots, a factor of ~5 variability
was observed among the five X-ray observations reported here. In contrast, the
UV photometry obtained by the XMM-Newton OM and Swift UVOT, and the HST

steeper than observed from other quasars of the same optical luminosity. The

derive reliable orbital elements, including a small non-zero eccentricity, and
to improve the accuracy of the absolute dimensions of the system. High
resolution IUE spectra were also analyzed to study the formation of the
ultraviolet lines and continuum. Synthetic spectra of the iron curtain using
our new shellspec program enabled us to derive a characteristic disk
temperature of 7000K. We have demonstrated that the UV emission lines seen

The difference spectra produced by subtracting the synthetic spectra of the
stars resulted in an image of the disk, which virtually disappeared once the

the associated features of the primordial power spectrum around the horizon
have a significant effect on improving the likelihood. The strong features are

Zenoness: whether there exists a zeno-computation from a given marking, i.e.,
an infinite computation which takes only a finite amount of time. We show
decidability of zenoness for TPNs, thus solving an open problem from [Escrig et

computations from a given marking is also decidable. On the other hand,
universal zenoness, i.e., the question if all infinite computations from a
given marking are zeno, is undecidable. (ii) Token liveness: whether a token is
alive in a marking, i.e., whether there is a computation from the marking which
eventually consumes the token. We show decidability of the problem by reducing
it to the coverability problem, which is decidable for TPNs. (iii) Boundedness:
whether the size of the reachable markings is bounded. We consider two versions
of the problem; namely semantic boundedness where only live tokens are taken
into consideration in the markings, and syntactic boundedness where also dead
tokens are considered. We show undecidability of semantic boundedness, while we

chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. We discuss the running gauge coupling at
finite temperature for QCD. For scales smaller than the corresponding
temperature, the coupling is governed by a fixed point of the 3-dimensional
theory. Chiral symmetry breaking is approached if the running coupling drives
the quark sector to criticality. We analyze the phase boundary in the plane of
temperature and number of flavors. For small flavor-numbers, we find good
agreement with lattice results. For flavor numbers near the critical flavor
number, we find that the scaling of the critical temperature is determined by
the zero-temperature IR critical exponent of the running coupling.

atmospheric neutrino mixing is maximal, and theta_{13} = 0; moreover, the type

developments in modern physics, that it is part of human nature to substitute
religious faith in places where there is no knowledge. Therefore, an increase
in knowledge would lead to a decrease in the necessity of faith. Further, it is
argued that, ideally speaking, a full knowledge of the laws of nature would
make obsolete any sort of religious faith and would ultimately allow a complete
control of nature by man. Since referring to nature, such views must be founded
in the natural sciences of which physics is the most fundamental. Therefore,
the question whether such views are compatible with the current state of
natural sciences is ultimately decided in physics. Indeed, it is likely that
these simplistic views have their origin in the world view generated by the
successes of Newtonian physics from the middle of the 17th century until the
beginning of the 20th century which viewed the physical world as a type of
mechanical clock in which the motion of the gears affect each other in a
precise and predictable way. In particular, the paper points out that the above
views are no longer supported by current physics and that abstracted world
views cannot be considered as part of natural sciences, but only as belief
systems.

advantages with respect to both sphere-plane and parallel-plane geometries. In
the second experiment, the Casimir force in the parallel-plane configuration is

is in a pure state, or in a mixed state. We apply two strategies to settle this
problem: the unambiguous discrimination and the maximum confidence
discrimination. We also proved that the optimal versions of both strategies are
equivalent. The efficiency of the discrimination is also analyzed. This scheme
also provides a method to estimate purity of quantum states, and Schmidt
numbers of composed systems.
