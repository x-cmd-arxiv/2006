  Cosmic Downsizing of AGN Host Galaxies","Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/520789",,"astro-ph",,"  Using the Gemini Near-InfraRed Spectrograph (GNIRS), we have assembled a
complete sample of 20 K-selected galaxies at 2.0<z<2.7 with high quality
near-infrared spectra. As described in a previous paper, 9 of these 20 galaxies
have strongly suppressed star formation and no detected emission lines. The
present paper concerns the 11 galaxies with detected Halpha emission, and
studies the origin of the line emission using the GNIRS spectra and follow-up
observations with SINFONI on the VLT. Based on their [NII]/Halpha ratios, the
spatial extent of the line emission and several other diagnostics, we infer
that four of the eleven emission-line galaxies host narrow line active galactic
nuclei (AGNs). The AGN host galaxies have stellar populations ranging from
evolved to star-forming. Combining our sample with a UV-selected galaxy sample
at the same redshift that spans a broader range in stellar mass, we find that
black-hole accretion is more effective at the high-mass end of the galaxy
distribution (~2.9x10^11 Msun) at z~2.3. Furthermore, by comparing our results
with SDSS data, we show that the AGN activity in massive galaxies has decreased
significantly between z~2.3 and z~0. AGNs with similar normalized accretion
rates as those detected in our K-selected galaxies reside in less massive
galaxies (~4.0x10^10 Msun) at low redshift. This is direct evidence for
downsizing of AGN host galaxies. Finally, we speculate that the typical stellar
mass-scale of the actively accreting AGN host galaxies, both at low and at high
redshift, might be similar to the mass-scale at which star-forming galaxies
seem to transform into red, passive systems.

relativistic outflows in order to explain the origin of the generic
phenomenology observed in the non-thermal emission of both blazars and
gamma-ray bursts. We focus on the influence of the magnetic field on the
collision dynamics, and we further investigate how the properties of the
observed radiation depend on the strength of the initial magnetic field and on
the initial internal energy density of the flow. The collisions of magnetized
shells and the radiation resulting from these collisions are calculated using
the 1D relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code MRGENESIS. The interaction of the
shells with the external medium prior to their collision is also determined
using an exact solver for the corresponding 1D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
Riemann problem. Our simulations show that two magnetization parameters - the
ratio of magnetic energy density and thermal energy density, \alpha_B, and the
ratio of magnetic energy density and mass-energy density, \sigma - play an
important role in the pre-collision phase, while the dynamics of the collision
and the properties of the light curves depend mostly on the magnetization
parameter \sigma. The interaction of the shells with the external medium
changes the flow properties at their edges prior to the collision. For
sufficiently dense shells moving at large Lorentz factors (\simgt 25) these
properties depend only on the magnetization parameter \sigma. Internal shocks
in GRBs may reach maximum efficiencies of conversion of kinetic into thermal
energy between 6% and 10%, while in case of blazars, the maximum efficiencies
are \sim 2%.

+ O5-8 V) and an O8 supergiant. It is also a well known non-thermal radio
emitter. We observed the radio emission of HD 167971 with the Very Large Array

with VLA archive observations we constructed a radio lightcurve covering a
20-yr time-range. We searched for, but failed to find, the 3.3-day
spectroscopic period of the binary in the radio data. This could be due to the
absence of intrinsic synchrotron radiation at the colliding-wind region between
the two components of the eclipsing binary, or due to the large amount of
free-free absorption that blocks the synchrotron radiation. We are able to
explain many of the observed characteristics of the radio data if the
non-thermal emission is produced in a colliding-wind region between the
supergiant and the combined winds of the binary. Furthermore, if the system is
gravitationally bound, the orbital motion occurs over a period of ~ 20 years,
or longer, as suggested by the long-term variability in the radio data. We
argue that the variability is due to the free-free absorption that changes with
orbital phase or may also in part be due to changes in separation, should the
orbit be eccentric.

agreement with what is expected for the early evolution of local massive
spheroidal galaxies. From continuum and line flux, velocity, and dispersion
maps, we measure the kinematics, star-formation rates, gas densities, and
extinction for individual subcomponents. The star formation intensity is
similar to low-redshift ``maximal starbursts'', while the line fluxes and the
dynamics of the emission line gas provide direct evidence for a
starburst-driven wind with physical properties very similar to local
superwinds. We also find circumstantial evidence for ""self-regulated"" star
formation within J1. The relative velocity of the bluer companion J2 yields a
dynamical mass estimate for J1 within about 20 kpc, M_dyn \sim 1\times 10^{11}
M_sun. The relative metallicity of J2 is 0.4 dex lower than in J1n/s,
suggesting different star formation histories. SED fitting of the continuum
peak J1c confirms and substantiates previous suggestions that this component is
a z=0.25 interloper. When removing J1c, the stellar continuum and H-alpha line
emission appear well aligned spatially in two individual components J1n and
J1s, and coincide with two kinematically distinct regions in the velocity map,
which might well indicate a merging system. This highlights the close
similarity between SMGs and ULIRGs, which are often merger-driven maximal
starbursts, and suggests that the intrinsic mechanisms of star-formation and
related feedback are similar to low-redshift strongly star-forming systems.

probing outflowing material of the host galaxy, which could arise from former

mostly wasted on expanding the progenitor. Products of the failed deflagration
quickly reach the stellar surface, polluting and strongly disturbing it. These

asymmetries: on the side of the brightest radio jet and hotspot (i) the
redshift of the kinematically quiescent nebula is highest, (ii) Ly-alpha is
brighter relative to the other lines and continuum, (iii) the radio spectrum is
flattest and (iv) the radio structure has its highest polarization. These
asymmetries are not found to be correlated with either the radio arm length
asymmetry or the brightness asymmetry of the UV-optical emitting material. The
correlation between the radio brightness asymmetry and the radial velocity of
the quiescent gas also appears to be present in powerful radio galaxies with
0<z<1.

orientation, with the quiescent nebulae in infall: this is the first study to
distinguish between the rotation, infall, outflow and chaotic motion scenarios

leads to spin relaxation. The system is strongly inhomogeneous because of
exponential variation of hopping times. However, at very small couplings an
electron diffuses over a distance exceeding the characteristic scale of the
inhomogeneity during the time of spin relaxation, so one can introduce an
averaged spin relaxation rate. At larger values of coupling the system is
effectively divided into two subsystems: the one where relaxation is very fast
and another one where relaxation is rather slow. In this case, spin decays due
to escape of the electrons from one subsystem to another. As a result, the spin
dynamics is non-exponential and hardly depends on spin-orbit coupling.

crystal octylcyanobiphenyl (8CB) confined to aligned colloidal aerosil gels.
The aligned gels introduce orientational fields that promote long-range nematic
order while imposing positional random fields that couple to the smectic
density wave and disrupt the formation of an ordered smectic phase. At low
densities of aerosil, the low-temperature scattering intensity is consistent
with the presence of a topologically ordered XY Bragg glass phase that is
predicted to form in response to such anisotropic quenched disorder. The
observed features of the phase include an algebraic decay of the smectic
correlations, which is truncated at large length scales due to the imperfect
nematic order, and a power-law exponent that agrees closely with the universal
value predicted for the XY Bragg glass. At higher aerosil densities, deviations
from the XY Bragg glass form are apparent. At high temperature, the scattering
intensity displays pre-transitional dynamic fluctuations associated with the
destroyed nematic to smectic-A transition. The fluctuations obey quasi-critical
behavior over an extended range of reduced temperature. The effective critical
exponents for the correlation lengths and smectic susceptibility differ
systematically from those of pure 8CB, indicating that coupling of the nematic
order to the gel suppresses its role in the smectic critical behavior.

in KLT-3 and KLT-7 that a pretransitional region exists between two
characteristic temperatures Td and Tp (<Td). The average symmetry of the region
is tetragonal with a weak lattice-deformation but non-polar in average. The
temperature interval between Td and Tp is consistent with the interval on which
neutron diffuse scatterings have been previously reported. These facts strongly
suggest that polar micro-regions (PMRs) nucleate around Td and grow toward Tp.
Below Tp, a larger deformation and a field-induced SH intensity start to
develop, while no significant SHG appear in zero-field cooling process. The
temperature dependence of the SH intensity below Tp coincides well with that of
the tetragonality determined from the lattice deformation. The
Landau-Devonshire phenomenological approach suggests that the ferroelectric
phase transition at Tp is of first order and that it approaches the second
order transition with the decrease of Li concentration. A marked increase of
neutron diffraction intensities below Tp indicates that PMRs are transformed to
ferroelectric micro-domains at Tp, and the micro-domains change to macroscopic
ones under the electric field below Tp.

consider the associated loop-erased walk as a sequence of directed edges, with
an edge from $i$ to $j$ if the loop erased walk makes a step from $i$ to $j$.
We introduce a coloring of these edges by painting edges with a fixed color as
long as the walk does not loop back on itself, then switching to a new color
whenever a loop is erased, with each new color distinct from all previous
colors. The pattern of colors along the edges of the loop-erased walk then
displays stretches of consecutive steps of the walk left untouched by the
loop-erasure process. Assuming that the underlying sequence generating the
loop-erased walk is a sequence of independent random variables, each uniform on
$[N]:=\{1, 2, ..., N\}$, we condition the walk to start at $N$ and stop the
walk when it first reaches the subset $[k]$, for some $1 \leq k \leq N-1$. We
relate the distribution of the random length of this loop-erased walk to the
distribution of the length of the first loop of the walk, via Cayley's
enumerations of trees, and via Wilson's algorithm. For fixed $N$ and $k$, and
$i = 1,2, ...$, let $B_i$ denote the event that the loop-erased walk from $N$
to $[k]$ has $i +1$ or more edges, and the $i^{th}$ and $(i+1)^{th}$ of these
edges are colored differently. We show that given that the loop-erased random
walk has $j$ edges for some $1\leq j \leq N-k$, the events $B_i$ for $1 \leq i
\leq j-1$ are independent, with the probability of $B_i$ equal to $1/(k+i+1)$.
This determines the distribution of the sequence of random lengths of
differently colored segments of the loop-erased walk, and yields asymptotic
descriptions of these random lengths as $N \to \infty$.

interactions on evolutionary time scales. However, valid and realistic methods
to test for codivergence are not fully developed. One of the systems where
possible codivergence has been of interest involves the large subfamily of
temperate grasses (Pooideae) and their endophytic fungi (epichloae). These
widespread symbioses often help protect host plants from herbivory and
stresses, and affect species diversity and food web structures. Here we
introduce the MRCALink (most-recent-common-ancestor link) method and use it to
investigate the possibility of grass-epichlo\""e codivergence. MRCALink applied
to ultrametric $H$ and $P$ trees identifies all corresponding nodes for
pairwise comparisons of MRCA ages. The result is compared to the space of
random $H$ and $P$ tree pairs estimated by a Monte Carlo method. Compared to
tree reconciliation the method is less dependent on tree topologies (which
often can be misleading), and it crucially improves on phylogeny-independent
methods such as {\tt ParaFit} or the Mantel test by eliminating an extreme (but
previously unrecognized) distortion of node-pair sampling. Analysis of 26 grass
species-epichlo\""e species symbioses did not reject random association of $H$
and $P$ MRCA ages. However, when five obvious host jumps were removed the
analysis significantly rejected random association and supported
grass-endophyte codivergence. Interestingly, early cladogenesis events in the
Pooideae corresponded to early cladogenesis events in epichloae, suggesting
concomitant origins of this grass subfamily and its remarkable group of
symbionts. We also applied our method to the well-known gopher-louse data set.

$L$ depends weakly on $k_{12}$ when $k_{12} < k_{12}^*$ but increases rapidly
