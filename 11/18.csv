the galaxies - is affected by processes ranging from quantum fluctuations in
the very early universe to radiative emission from newly-formed stars. This
gives the intergalactic medium a dual role as a powerful probe both of
fundamental physics and of astrophysics. The heading of fundamental physics
includes conditions in the very early universe and basic cosmological
parameters. The astrophysics refers to chapters of the long cosmic history of
stars and galaxies that are being revealed through the effects of stellar
feedback on the cosmic gas. This review describes the physics of the
intergalactic medium, focusing on recent theoretical and observational
developments in understanding early cosmic history. In particular, radiation
from the earliest generation of stars is thought to have transformed the
universe, turning the surrounding atoms into free electrons and ions. Knowing
exactly when and how the reionization process happened is a primary goal of
cosmologists, because this would tell us when the early stars and black holes
formed and in what kinds of galaxies.
  Cosmic reionization is beginning to be understood with the help of
theoretical models and computer simulations. A wide variety of instruments
currently under design will probe the first sources of light during an epoch in
cosmic history that has been largely unexplored so far. The new observations
and the challenges for theoretical models and numerical simulations will
motivate intense work in this field over the coming decade. (abridged)

emissions as observed by XMM-Newton in Nov. 2003 and compare it with that of an
Apr. 2003 observation. We discover the existence of an electron bremsstrahlung
component in the aurorae, which accounts for essentially all the X-ray flux
above 2 keV: its presence had been predicted but never detected for lack of
sensitivity of previous X-ray missions. This bremsstrahlung component varied
significantly in strength and spectral shape over the 3.5 days covered by the
Nov. 2003 observation, displaying substantial hardening of the spectrum with
increasing flux. This variability may be linked to the strong solar activity
taking place at the time, and may be induced by changes in the acceleration
mechanisms inside Jupiter's magnetosphere. As in Apr. 2003, the auroral spectra
below 2 keV are best fitted by a superposition of line emission most likely
originating from ion charge exchange, with OVII playing the dominant role. We
still cannot resolve conclusively the ion species responsible for the lowest
energy lines (around 0.3 keV), so the question of the origin of the ions
(magnetospheric or solar wind) is still open. It is conceivable that both
scenarios play a role in what is certainly a very complex planetary structure.
High resolution spectra of the whole planet obtained with the XMM-Newton RGS in
the range 0.5-1 keV clearly separate emission lines (mostly of Fe) originating
at low latitudes on Jupiter from the auroral lines due to O. These are shown to
possess very broad wings which imply velocities of ~5000 km/s. Such speeds are
consistent with the energies at which precipitating and charge exchanging O
ions are expected to be accelerated in Jupiter's magnetosphere. Overall we find
good agreement between our measurements and the predictions of recent models.

observe the primordial CMB anisotropies, Planck will also have the capability
to detect galaxy clusters via their SZ imprint. In this paper constraints on
cosmological parameters derivable from the Planck cluster candidate sample are
examined for the first time as a function of cluster sample selection and
purity obtained from realistic simulations of the microwave sky at the Planck
observing frequency bands, observation process modelling and a cluster
extraction pipeline. In particular, we employ a multi-frequency matched
filtering (MFMF) method to recover clusters from mock simulations of Planck
observations. Obtainable cosmological constraints under realistic assumptions
of priors and knowledge about cluster redshifts are discussed. Just relying on
cluster redshift abundances without making use of recovered cluster fluxes, it
is shown that from the Planck cluster catalogue cosmological constraints
comparable to the ones derived from recent primordial CMB power spectrum
measurements can be achieved. For example, for a concordance $\Lambda$CDM model
and a redshift binning of $\Delta z = 0.1$, the $1\sigma$ uncertainties on the
values of $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ are $\Delta \Omega_m \approx 0.031$ and
$\Delta \sigma_8 \approx 0.014$ respectively. Furthermore, we find that the
constraint of the matter density depends strongly on the prior which can be
imposed on the Hubble parameter by other observational means.

galactic centers or massive black holes. In such a potential orbit precession
is commonly retrograde, i.e. direction of the orbit precession is opposite to
the orbital motion. It is assumed that stellar systems consist of nearly radial
orbits. We show that if there is a loss cone at low angular momentum (e.g., due
to consumption of stars by a black hole), an instability similar to loss-cone
instability in plasma may occur. The gravitational loss-cone instability is
expected to enhance black hole feeding rates. For spherical systems, the
instability is possible for the number of spherical harmonics $l \ge 3$. If
there is some amount of counter-rotating stars in flattened systems, they
generally exhibit the instability independently of azimuthal number $m$. The
results are compared with those obtained recently by Tremaine for distribution
functions monotonically increasing with angular momentum.
  The analysis is based on simple characteristic equations describing small
perturbations in a disk or a sphere of stellar orbits highly elongated in
radius. These characteristic equations are derived from the linearized Vlasov
equations (combining the collisionless Boltzmann kinetic equation and the
Poisson equation), using the action-angle variables. We use two techniques for
analyzing the characteristic equations: the first one is based on preliminary
finding of neutral modes, and the second one employs a counterpart of the
plasma Penrose-Nyquist criterion for disk and spherical gravitational systems.

influence of a circumbinary disk is investigated for systems above the upper
edge of the period gap at orbital periods greater than 2.75hr. For a fractional
mass input rate into the disk, corresponding to 3e-4 of the mass transfer rate,
the model systems exhibit a bounce at orbital periods greater than 2.75hr. The
simulations reveal that (1) some systems can exist as dwarf nova type systems
throughout their lifetime, (2) dwarf nova type systems can evolve into
nova-like systems as their mass transfer rate increases with increasing
circumbinary disk mass, and (3) nova-like systems can evolve back into dwarf
nova systems during their postbounce evolution to longer orbital periods. Among
these subclasses, nova-like cataclysmic variables would be the best candidates
to search for circumbinary disks at wavelengths greater than 10 micron. The
theoretical orbital period distribution of our population synthesis model is in
reasonable accord with the combined population of dwarf novae and nova-like
systems above the period gap, suggesting the possibility that systems with
unevolved donors need not detach and evolve below the period gap as in the
disrupted magnetic braking model. The resulting population furthermore reveals
the possible presence of systems with small mass ratios (a property of systems
exhibiting superhump phenomena at long orbital periods) and a preference of
O/Ne/Mg white dwarfs in dwarf nova systems in comparison to nova-like systems.
The importance of observational bias in accounting for the differing
populations is examined, and it is shown that an understanding of these effects
is necessary in order to confront the theoretical distributions with the
observed ones in a meaningful manner. (abridged)

interpret the kinematical data and HST photometry using oblate axisymmetric
two-integral f(E,Lz) dynamical models based on the Jeans equations. This yields
good fits, provided that the seeing and observational characteristics are
carefully modeled. The fits yield for each galaxy the dynamical M/L and a
measure of the galaxy rotation rate. Paper II addresses the implied M/L
evolution. Here we study the rotation-rate evolution by comparison to a sample
of local elliptical galaxies of similar present-day luminosity. The brightest
galaxies in the sample all rotate too slowly to account for their flattening,
as is also observed at z=0. But the average rotation rate is higher at z=0.5
than locally. This may be due to a higher fraction of misclassified S0 galaxies
(although this effect is insufficient to explain the observed strong evolution
of the cluster S0 fraction with redshift). Alternatively, dry mergers between
early-type galaxies may have decreased the average rotation rate over time. It
is unclear whether such mergers are numerous enough in clusters to explain the
observed trend quantitatively. Disk-disk mergers may affect the comparison
through the so-called progenitor bias, but this cannot explain the direction of
the observed rotation-rate evolution. Additional samples are needed to
constrain possible environmental dependencies and cosmic variance in galaxy
rotation rates. Either way, studies of the internal stellar dynamics of distant
galaxies provide a valuable new approach for exploring galaxy evolution.

the highest-redshift sample known. Combined with previous SN Ia datasets, we
measured H(z) at discrete, uncorrelated epochs, reducing the uncertainty of
H(z>1) from 50% to under 20%, strengthening the evidence for a cosmic jerk--the
transition from deceleration in the past to acceleration in the present. The
unique leverage of the HST high-redshift SNe Ia provides the first meaningful

rules out rapidly evolving dark energy (dw/dz >>1). The defining property of

evolution is Delta log(M/L) / Delta z = -0.457 +/- 0.046(random) +/-
0.078(systematic), consistent with passive evolution following high-redshift
formation. This agrees with the FP results for this sample by van Dokkum & van
der Marel. This confirms that FP evolution tracks M/L evolution, which is an
important verification of the assumptions that underly FP studies. However,
while we find more FP evolution for galaxies of low sigma_eff (or low mass),
the dynamical M/L evolution instead shows little trend with sigma_eff. We argue
that this difference can be plausibly attributed to a combination of two
effects: (a) evolution in structural galaxy properties other than M/L; and (b)
the neglect of rotational support in studies of FP evolution. The results leave
the question open whether the low-mass galaxies in the sample have younger
population ages than the high-mass galaxies. This highlights the general
importance in the study of population ages for complementing dynamical
measurements with broad-band colors or spectroscopic population diagnostics.

both the red and blue ends of the spectrum may have been inadequately corrected

analysis, we demonstrate the likelihood of a large systematic error in the
reported data and discuss possible causes. This systematic error is at least as
large as the errors associated with nearly all attempts to calculate the
primordial helium abundance from such observations. Our Orion analysis suggests
that the problem does not lie in the theoretical models. We demonstrate a
correlation between equivalent width and apparent helium abundance of lines
from extragalactic sources that is most likely due to underlying stellar

The proper-motion survey covers a 6 times larger sky area than the prior
targeted searches for cluster members in IC 2391. A total of 66 stars are
considered bona fide cluster members down to a mass equivalent to 0.5M_sun. A
quarter of them have been newly identified with many in the F2-K5 spectral
range, which is crucial for a main-sequence fit. We find a mean [Fe/H] value of
+0.06+/-0.06, when a solar abundance of log epsilon (Fe)=7.45 is adopted. The
main sequence fitting yields a distance modulus that is 0.19 mag larger than
that derived from Hipparcos parallaxes; thus this offset nearly has the size of
a similar offset found for the Pleiades. The Li abundance pattern is similar to
the earlier findings and is typical for a 40 Myr old open cluster.

the inner wind geometry of accreting T Tauri stars. In this line blueshifted
absorption below the continuum results from simple scattering of stellar

physical conditions and recourse to multi-level radiative transfer. We present
theoretical line profiles for scattering in two possible wind geometries, a
disk wind and a wind emerging radially from the star, and compare them to
observed He I 10830 profiles from a survey of classical T Tauri stars. The
comparison indicates that subcontinuum blueshifted absorption is characteristic
of disk winds in ~30% of the stars and of stellar winds in ~40%. We further
conclude that for many stars the emission profile of helium likely arises in
stellar winds, increasing the fraction of accreting stars inferred to have
accretion-powered stellar winds to ~60%. Stars with the highest disk accretion
rates are more likely to have stellar wind than disk wind signatures and less
likely to have redshifted absorption from magnetospheric funnel flows. This
suggests the possibility that when accretion rates are high, disks can extend
closer to the star, magnetospheric accretion zones can be reduced in size and
conditions arise that favor radially outflowing stellar winds.

new technique to extract luminosity-weighted age and [Fe/H] values for

populations based on these parameters. One population is old ($\tau >$ 11 Gyrs)
with a distinct mass-metallicity relation. The second population is slightly
younger ($\tau \approx$ 9 Gyrs) with lower metallicities and lower stellar
masses. We find detectable correlations between age and galaxy mass in both
populations such that older galaxies are more massive and have higher mean
metallicities, confirming previous work with line indices for the same type of
galaxies in other clusters (Kelson et al 2006, Thomas et al 2005). Our results
imply shorter durations for higher mass galaxies, in contradiction to the
predictions of classic galactic wind models. Since we also find a clear
mass-metallicity relation for these galaxies, then we conclude that star
formation was more efficient for higher mass galaxies, a scenario described
under the inverse wind models (Matteucci 1994). With respect to cluster
environmental effects, we find there is a significant correlation between
galaxy mean age and distance from the cluster center, such that older galaxies
inhabit the core. This relationship would nominally support hierarchical
scenarios of galaxy formation (younger age in lower density regions); however,
environmental effects probably have larger signature in the sample and
present-day galaxies are remnants from an epoch of quenching of initial star
formation, which would result in the same age gradients.

Chem. {\bf 91}, 6417 (1987)) that in monolayers, the size of the domains
results from balancing the line tension, which favors the formation of a large
single circular domain, against the electrostatic cost of assembling the
dipolar moments of the lipids. In this paper, we present an exact analytical
expression for the electric potential, ion distribution and electrostatic free
energy for different problems consisting of three different slabs with
different dielectric constants and Debye lengths, with a circular homogeneous
dipolar density in the middle slab. From these solutions, we extend the
calculation of domain sizes for monolayers to include the effects of finite
ionic strength, dielectric discontinuities (or image charges) and the
polarizability of the dipoles and further generalize the calculations to
account for domains in lipid bilayers. In monolayers, the size of the domains
is dependent on the different dielectric constants but independent of ionic
strength. In asymmetric bilayers, where the inner and outer leaflets have
different dipolar densities, domains show a strong size dependence with ionic
strength, with molecular-sized domains that grow to macroscopic phase
separation with increasing ionic strength. We discuss the implications of the
results for experiments and briefly consider their relation to other two

carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) (armchair, zigzag and chiral) are obtained. We use
modified helical and rotational symmetries to describe the structure of SWNTs
and Tersoff potential to minimize the energy of these tubes. It emerges that in
general, two bond lengths are required for obtaining minimum energy structure,
in contrast to one bond length commonly used. The difference in bond lengths
depends on chirality and radius of achiral tubes. Significantly, even a small
deviation from zigzag or armchair character leads to interesting behavior of
bond lengths. A reduction in diameter is responsible for difference in the bond
lengths of achiral nanotubes. We also calculate the bond lengths under
hydrostatic pressure. The behavior of bond lengths for armchair single-wall
nanotubes when calculated under pressure shows that the larger bond length
decreases faster with pressure in comparison to the shorter bond length. At
some critical pressure (depending upon the radius of the tube), the two bond
lengths become equal to each other, reversing their difference above this
critical pressure. We suggest that this behavior can be exploited to
experimentally determine the chirality and radius of the carbon nanotubes, for
example by observing the presence and disappearance of modes typical of two
different bond lengths. This change occurs only within a few GPa of pressure.

Correction (FEC) codes rely on the unrestricted buffering time at the receiver.
In real-time streaming, the extremely short playback buffering time makes FEC
inefficient for protecting a single path communication against long link
failures. It has been shown that one alternative path added to a single path
route makes packet level FEC applicable even when the buffering time is
limited. Further path diversity, however, increases the number of underlying
links increasing the total link failure rate, requiring from the sender
possibly more FEC packets. We introduce a scalar coefficient for rating a
multi-path routing topology of any complexity. It is called Redundancy Overall
Requirement (ROR) and is proportional to the total number of adaptive FEC
packets required for protection of the communication. With the capillary
routing algorithm, introduced in this paper we build thousands of multi-path
routing patterns. By computing their ROR coefficients, we show that contrary to
the expectations the overall requirement in FEC codes is reduced when the
further diversity of dual-path routing is achieved by the capillary routing
algorithm.

  Codes","18 pages, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  Two broad classes of graphical modeling problems for codes can be identified
in the literature: constructive and extractive problems. The former class of
problems concern the construction of a graphical model in order to define a new
code. The latter class of problems concern the extraction of a graphical model
for a (fixed) given code. The design of a new low-density parity-check code for
some given criteria (e.g. target block length and code rate) is an example of a
constructive problem. The determination of a graphical model for a classical
linear block code which implies a decoding algorithm with desired performance
and complexity characteristics is an example of an extractive problem. This
work focuses on extractive graphical model problems and aims to lay out some of
the foundations of the theory of such problems for linear codes.
  The primary focus of this work is a study of the space of all graphical
models for a (fixed) given code. The tradeoff between cyclic topology and
complexity in this space is characterized via the introduction of a new bound:
the tree-inducing cut-set bound. The proposed bound provides a more precise
characterization of this tradeoff than that which can be obtained using
existing tools (e.g. the Cut-Set Bound) and can be viewed as a generalization
of the square-root bound for tail-biting trellises to graphical models with
arbitrary cyclic topologies. Searching the space of graphical models for a
given code is then enabled by introducing a set of basic graphical model
transformation operations which are shown to span this space. Finally,
heuristics for extracting novel graphical models for linear block codes using
these transformations are investigated.

assignment strategies of algebraic soft-decision decoding with infinite cost
are first studied over erasure channels and the binary symmetric channel. The
corresponding decoding radii are calculated in closed forms and tight bounds on
the error probability are derived. The multiplicity assignment strategy and the
corresponding performance analysis are then generalized to characterize the
decoding region of algebraic softdecision decoding over a mixed error and
bit-level erasure channel. The bit-level decoding region of the proposed
multiplicity assignment strategy is shown to be significantly larger than that
of conventional Berlekamp-Massey decoding. As an application, a bit-level
generalized minimum distance decoding algorithm is proposed. The proposed
decoding compares favorably with many other Reed-Solomon soft-decision decoding
algorithms over various channels. Moreover, owing to the simplicity of the
proposed bit-level generalized minimum distance decoding, its performance can
be tightly bounded using order statistics.

processes are known to become large and negative at high energies, due to the
appearance of Sudakov-like logarithms. At the same order in perturbation
theory, weak boson emission diagrams contribute. Since the W and Z bosons are
massive, the O(alpha) virtual weak radiative corrections and the contributions
from weak boson emission are separately finite. Thus, unlike in QED or QCD
calculations, there is no technical reason for including gauge boson emission
diagrams in calculations of electroweak radiative corrections. In most
calculations of the O(alpha) electroweak radiative corrections, weak boson
emission diagrams are therefore not taken into account. Another reason for not
including these diagrams is that they lead to final states which differ from
that of the original process. However, in experiment, one usually considers
partially inclusive final states. Weak boson emission diagrams thus should be
included in calculations of electroweak radiative corrections. In this paper, I
examine the role of weak boson emission in those processes at the Fermilab
Tevatron and the CERN LHC for which the one-loop electroweak radiative
corrections are known to become large at high energies (inclusive jet, isolated
photon, Z+1 jet, Drell-Yan, di-boson, t-bar t, and single top production). In
general, I find that the cross section for weak boson emission is substantial
at high energies and that weak boson emission and the O(alpha) virtual weak
radiative corrections partially cancel.

bundle and define the notion of a connection and its curvature on a principal
bundle. Then we will introduce some ideas from topology such as homotopy,
topological degree and characteristic classes. Finally, we will apply these
notions to the bundle setup corresponding to monopoles and instantons. We will
end with some remarks on index theorems and their applications and some hints

to show that, additionally to the spacelike isometry in which the T-Duality

This allows to prove that for nontrivial string coupling, the low energy
bosonic string backgrounds which are additionally self-T-dual along an isometry
direction generated by a constant norm Killing vector are uniquely described by
a two-parametric class, including only three nonsingular cases: the charged
black string, the exact gravitational wave propagating along the extremal black
string, and the flat space with a linear dilaton. Besides, for constant string
coupling, the only self-T-dual lower energy string background under the same
assumptions corresponds to the Coussaert-Henneaux spacetime. Thus, we identify
minimum criteria that yield a classification of these quoted examples and only
these. All these T-dual fixed points describe exact backgrounds of string

for data based evaluation of parametric models. The loss function is defined as
generalized quadratic distance between the true density and the proposed model.
These distances are characterized by a simple quadratic form structure that is
adaptable through the choice of a nonnegative definite kernel and a bandwidth
parameter. Using asymptotic results for the quadratic distances we build a
quick-to-compute approximation for the risk function. Its derivation is
analogous to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), but unlike AIC, the
quadratic risk is a global comparison tool. The method does not require
resampling, a great advantage when point estimators are expensive to compute.
The method is illustrated using the problem of selecting the number of
components in a mixture model, where it is shown that, by using an appropriate
kernel, the method is computationally straightforward in arbitrarily high data
dimensions. In this same context it is shown that the method has some clear
advantages over AIC and BIC.

$O_{t}(R)=O(R)$, and if each chain of $t$-linked overrings of $R$ is finite,
then each chain of overrings of $R$ is finite. This yields that the $t$-linked
approach is more efficient than the Gilmer's treatment in \cite{G1}. We also
examine the finiteness conditions in some Noetherian-like settings such as Mori
domain, quasicoherent Mori domain, Krull domain etc. We establish a connection
between $O_{t}(R)$ and the set of all strongly divisorial ideals of $R$ and we
conclude by a characterization of domains $R$ that are $t$-linked under all
their overrings.

organization and its dynamics with the help of mathematical models. In the
ideal case emergent properties on the tissue scale can be derived from the
cellular scale. However, this has been achieved in rare examples only, in
particular, when involving high-speed migration of cells. One major difficulty
is the lack of a suitable multiscale simulation platform, which embeds
reaction-diffusion of soluble substances, fast cell migration and mechanics,
and, being of great importance in several tissue types, cell flow homeostasis.
In this paper a step into this direction is presented by developing an
agent-based mathematical model specifically designed to incorporate these
features with special emphasis on high speed cell migration. Cells are
represented as elastic spheres migrating on a substrate in lattice-free space.
Their movement is regulated and guided by chemoattractants that can be derived
from the substrate. The diffusion of chemoattractants is considered to be
slower than cell migration and, thus, to be far from equilibrium. Tissue
homeostasis is not achieved by the balance of growth and death but by a flow
equilibrium of cells migrating in and out of the tissue under consideration. In
this sense the number and the distribution of the cells in the tissue is a
result of the model and not part of the assumptions. For purpose of
demonstration of the model properties and functioning, the model is applied to
a prominent example of tissue in a cellular flow equilibrium, the secondary
lymphoid tissue. The experimental data on cell speed distributions in these
tissues can be reproduced using reasonable mechanical parameters for the
simulated cell migration in dense tissue.

backbone for the formation of follicular dendritic cell networks. These are
important for germinal center reactions. In the context of organogenesis
molecular requirements for the formation of follicles have been identified. The
present study complements this work with a simulation of the dynamics of the
primary lymphoid follicle formation. In contrast to other problems of pattern
formation, here, the homeostasis of the cell population is not governed by a
growth-death balance but by a flow equilibrium of migrating cells. The influx
of cells into secondary lymphoid tissue was extensively studied while less
information is available about the efflux of lymphocytes from secondary
lymphoid tissues. This study formulates the minimal requirements for cell
efflux that guarantee a flow equilibrium and, thus, a stable primary lymphoid
follicle. The model predicts that in addition to already identified mechanisms
a negative regulation of the generation of follicular dendritic cells is
required. Furthermore, a comparison with data concerning the microanatomy of
secondary lymphoid tissues yields the conclusion that dynamical changes during
the formation of FDC networks of the lymphatic endothelium are necessary to
understand the genesis and maintenance of follicles.

folding is often described as a two-state process that lacks detectable
intermediates. This observation has often been rationalized on the basis of a
nucleation mechanism for protein folding whose basic premise is the idea that
after completion of a specific set of contacts forming the so-called folding
nucleus the native state is achieved promptly. Here we propose a methodology to
identify folding nuclei in small lattice polymers and apply it to the study of
protein molecules with chain length N=48. To investigate the extent to which
protein topology is a robust determinant of the nucleation mechanism we compare
the nucleation scenario of a native-centric model with that of a sequence
specific model sharing the same native fold. To evaluate the impact of the
sequence's finner details in the nucleation mechanism we consider the folding
of two non- homologous sequences. We conclude that in a sequence-specific model
the folding nucleus is, to some extent, formed by the most stable contacts in
the protein and that the less stable linkages in the folding nucleus are solely
determined by the fold's topology. We have also found that independently of
protein sequence the folding nucleus performs the same `topological' function.
This unifying feature of the nucleation mechanism results from the residues
forming the folding nucleus being distributed along the protein chain in a
similar and well-defined manner that is determined by the fold's topological
features.
