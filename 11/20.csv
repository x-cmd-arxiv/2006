the large scale structure of the universe provide very tight constraints on the
effective parameters that describe cosmological inflation. Indeed, within a
constrained class of LambdaCDM models, the simple lambda phi^4 chaotic
inflation model already appears to be ruled out by cosmological data. In this
paper, we compute constraints on inflationary parameters within a more general
framework that includes other physically motivated parameters such as a nonzero
neutrino mass. We find that a strong degeneracy between the tensor-to-scalar
ratio r and the neutrino mass prevents lambda phi^4 from being excluded by
present data. Reversing the argument, if lambda phi^4 is the correct model of
inflation, it predicts a sum of neutrino masses at 0.3-0.5 eV, a range
compatible with present experimental limits and within the reach of the next
generation of neutrino mass measurements. We also discuss the associated
constraints on the dark matter density, the dark energy equation of state, and
spatial curvature, and show that the allowed regions are significantly altered.
Importantly, we find an allowed range of 0.094 < Omega_c h^2 < 0.136 for the
dark matter density, a factor of two larger than that reported in previous
studies. This expanded parameter space may have implications for constraints on
SUSY dark matter models.

formation in galaxies. To gauge its universality, we measure and compare the
ICMFs in irregular and spiral galaxies. Our sample of irregular galaxies is
based on 13 nearby galaxies selected from a volume-limited sample from the
fifth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The extinctions,
ages, and masses were determined by comparing their u'g'i'z' magnitudes to
those generated from starburst models. Completeness corrections were performed
using Monte Carlo simulations in which artificial clusters were inserted into
each galaxy. We analyzed three nearby spiral galaxies with SDSS data in exactly
the same way to derive their ICMF based on a similar number of young, massive
clusters as the irregular galaxy ICMF. We find that the ICMFs of irregular and
spiral galaxies for masses >3x10^4 M_sun are statistically indistinguishable.
For clusters more massive than 3x10^4 M_sun, the ICMF of the irregular galaxies
is reasonably well fit by a power law dN(M)/dM ~ M^-a_M with a_M = 1.88 +/-
0.09. Similar results were obtained for the ICMF of the spiral galaxy sample

theories of star cluster formation: the shape of the ICMF appears to be
independent of metallicity and galactic shear rate.

spatially decompose the observed dust emission into components associated with
different phases of the gas. An inversion technique is applied. For the
decomposition, we use the IRAS 60 and 100 micron bands, the DIRBE 140 and 240
micron bands, as well as Archeops 850 and 2096 micron wavelengths. In addition,
we apply the decomposition to all five WMAP bands. We obtain longitude and
latitude profiles for each wavelength and for each gas component in carefully
selected Galactic radius bins.We also derive emissivity coefficients for dust
in atomic, molecular and ionized gas in each of the bins.The HI emissivity
appears to decrease with increasing Galactic radius indicating that dust
associated with atomic gas is heated by the ambient interstellar radiation
field (ISRF). By contrast, we find evidence that dust mixed with molecular
clouds is significantly heated by O/B stars still embedded in their progenitor
clouds. By assuming a modified black-body with emissivity law lambda^(-1.5), we
also derive the radial distribution of temperature for each phase of the gas.
All of the WMAP bands except W appear to be dominated by emission from
something other than normal dust, most likely a mixture of thermal
bremstrahlung from diffuse ionized gas, synchrotron emission and spinning dust.
Furthermore, we find indications of an emissivity excess at long wavelengths
(lambda > 850 micron) in the outer Galaxy (R > 8.9 kpc). This suggests either
the existence of a very cold dust component in the outer Galaxy or a
temperature dependence of the spectral emissivity index. Finally, it is shown
that ~ 80% of the total FIR luminosity is produced by dust associated with
atomic hydrogen, in agreement with earlier findings by Sodroski et al. (1997).

the fraction of blue early-types increases. Late-types show wider dispersions
in all physical parameters compared to early types at the same luminosity.
Concentration indices of early-types are well-correlated with velocity
dispersion, but are insensitive to luminosity and color for bright galaxies.
The slope of the Faber-Jackson relation continuously changes from 4.6 +- 0.4 to
2.7+- 0.2 when luminosity changes from M_r = -22 to -20. The size of early-
types is well-correlated with stellar velocity dispersion (for >100 km/s). We
find that passive spirals are well-separated from star-forming late-types at EW

of galaxies manifest different behaviors across the absolute magnitude of about
M_* +- 1. The morphology fraction as a function of luminosity depends less
sensitively on large scale structure than the luminosity function (LF) does,

  Branch","Paper presented at IAU-GA, Prague, August 2006",,"10.1017/S1743921307000567",,"astro-ph",,"  Low-mass stars, ~1-2 solar masses, near the Main Sequence are efficient at
producing 3He, which they mix into the convective envelope on the giant branch
and distribute into the Galaxy by way of envelope loss. This process is so
efficient that it is difficult to reconcile the observed cosmic abundance of
3He with the predictions of Big Bang nucleosynthesis. In this paper we find, by
modeling a red giant with a fully three-dimensional hydrodynamic code and a
full nucleosynthetic network, that mixing arises in the supposedly stable and
radiative zone between the hydrogen-burning shell and the base of the
convective envelope. This mixing is due to Rayleigh-Taylor instability within a
zone just above the hydrogen-burning shell. In this zone the burning of the 3He
left behind by the retreating convective envelope is predominantly by the
reaction 3He + 3He -> 4He + 2p, a reaction which, untypically for stellar
nuclear reactions, {\it lowers} the mean molecular weight, leading to a local
minimum. This local minimum leads to Rayleigh-Taylor instability, and turbulent
motion is generated which will continue ultimately up into the normal
convective envelope. Consequently material from the envelope is dragged down
sufficiently close to the burning shell that the 3He in it is progressively
destroyed. Thus we are able to remove the threat that 3He production in
low-mass stars poses to the Big Bang nucleosynthesis of 3He. Some slow mixing
mechanism has long been suspected, that connects the convective envelope of a
red giant to the burning shell. It appears to be necessary to account for
progressive changes in the 12C/13C and 14N/12C ratios on the First Giant
Branch. We suggest that these phenomena are also due to the
Rayleigh-Taylor-unstable character of the 3He-burning region.

than M_r=-18.0 in the SDSS on environment, as measured by local density using
an adaptive smoothing kernel. We find that variations of galaxy properties with
environment are almost entirely due to the dependence of morphology and
luminosity on environment. Because galaxy properties depend not only on
luminosity but also on morphology, it is clear that galaxy properties cannot be
determined solely by dark halo mass. When morphology and luminosity are fixed,
other physical properties, such as color, color-gradient, concentration, size,
velocity dispersion, and star formation rate, are nearly independent of local
density. The only feature is the sharp decrease of late type fraction above the
critical luminosity of about M_r=-21.3 in the morphology versus luminosity
relation. Weak residual dependences on environment include that of the color of
late-types (bluer at lower density) and of the L-sigma relation of early-types
(larger dispersion at higher density for bright galaxies). The early-type
fraction is a monotonically increasing function of local density and
luminosity. The morphology-density- luminosity relation should be a key
constraint on galaxy formation models. We demonstrate that the dependence on
environment of the morphology of galaxie originates from variations in density
on effective Gaussian smoothing scales much smaller than 12 h^{-1}Mpc. We find
that galaxy morphology varies both with density measured on an effective
Gaussian smoothing scale of 4.7 h^{-1} Mpc and on distance to the nearest
bright galaxy (particularly, for about 0.2 h^{-1}Mpc). We propose a mechanism
that the morphology of galaxies in galaxy systems is transformed by the tidal
force.

formation of NGC 275, the late-type spiral galaxy in Arp 140, which is
interacting with NGC 274, an early-type system. The atomic gas (HI)
observations reveal a tidal tail from NGC 275 which extends many optical radii
beyond the interacting pair. The HI morphology implies a prograde encounter
between the galaxy pair approximately 1.5 x 10**8 years ago. The Halpha
emission from NGC 275 indicates clumpy irregular star-formation, clumpiness
which is mirrored by the underlying mass distribution as traced by the Ks-band
emission. The molecular gas distribution is striking in its anti-correlation
with the {HII regions. Despite the evolved nature of NGC 275's interaction and
its barred potential, neither the molecular gas nor the star formation are
centrally concentrated. We suggest that this structure results from stochastic
star formation leading to preferential consumption of the gas in certain
regions of the galaxy. In contrast to the often assumed picture of interacting
galaxies, NGC 275, which appears to be close to merger, does not display
enhanced or centrally concentrated star formation. If the eventual merger is to
lead to a significant burst of star formation it must be preceded by a
significant conversion of atomic to molecular gas as at the current rate of
star formation all the molecular gas will be exhausted by the time the merger
is complete.

  of solar models with helioseismic inversions","5 pages, 2 figures",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20066327",,"astro-ph",,"  Recent solar photospheric abundance analyses have led to a significant
reduction of the metal abundances compared to the previous determinations. The
solar models computed with standard opacities and diffusion processes using
these new abundances give poor agreement with helioseismic inversions for the
sound-speed profile, the surface helium abundance, and the convective zone
depth.
  We attempt to obtain a good agreement between helioseismic inversions and
solar models which present the ""old"" mixture in the interior and new chemical
composition in the convective zone. To reach this result, we assume an
undermetallic accretion at the beginning of the main sequence.
  We compute solar models with the Toulouse-Geneva Evolution Code, in which we
simulate an undermetallic accretion in the early stages of the main sequence,
in order to obtain new mixture in the outer convective zone. We compare the
sound-speed profile, the convective zone depth, and the surface helium
abundance with those deduced from helioseismology.
  The model with accretion but without any mixing process inside is in better
agreement with helioseismology than the solar model with the new abundances
throughout. There is, however, a spike under the convective zone which reaches
3.4%. Furthermore, the convective zone depth and the surface helium abundance
are too low. Introducing undershooting below the convective zone allows us to
recover the good convective zone radius and the addition of rotation-induced
mixing and tachocline allows us to reconcile the surface helium abundance. But
in any case the agreement of the sound-speed profile with helioseismic
inference is worse than obtained with the old abundances.

alpha forest assume that HeII and HI absorption features have the same line
widths. We omit this assumption to investigate possible effects of thermal line
broadening on the inferred HeII/HI ratio eta and to explore the potential of
intergalactic HeII observations to constrain the thermal state of the IGM.
Deriving a simple relation between the column density and the temperature of an
absorber we develop a procedure to fit the parameters of a power law
temperature-density relation and eta simultaneously. In an alternative approach
the temperature of an absorber, eta, and the redshift scale of eta variations
are estimated simultaneously. Tests with artificial data show that
well-constrained results can be obtained only if the signal-to-noise ratio in
the HeII forest is S/N > 20. Thus, it is impossible to give an estimate of the
temperature-density relation with the HeII data available at present (S/N ~5).
However, we find that only 45% of the lines in our sample favor turbulent line
widths. Furthermore, the inferred eta values are on average about 0.05 dex
larger if a thermal component is taken into account, and their distribution is
46% narrower in comparison to a purely turbulent fit. Therefore, variations of
eta on a 10% level may be related to the presence of thermal line broadening.
The apparent correlation between the strength of the HI absorption and the eta
value, which has been found in former studies, essentially disappears if
thermal broadening is taken into account. In the redshift range 2.58 < z < 2.74
towards the quasars HE2347-4342 and HS1700+6416 we obtain eta ~ 100. (abridged)

6.4 keV, consistent with transmission through the absorber. The most striking
result of our spectral analysis is the detection of a dominant X-ray reflection

reflection-dominated hard X-ray spectrum is confirmed by the strong Compton
hump seen in a previous BeppoSAX observation and could be the sign that most of
the primary X-rays are radiated from a compact corona (or e.g. base of the jet)
within a few gravitational radii from the black hole. We also detect a
relatively strong absorption line at 6.81 keV which, if interpreted as Fe xxv
resonant absorption intrinsic to the source, implies an outflow with velocity
of about 5000 km/s. In the soft energy band, the high-resolution RGS and the
CCD-resolution data show the presence of both photo-ionized gas and thermal

  METHODS: We have exploited the high resolution and sensitivity of Chandra's
ACIS-S to investigate the peculiar morphology and spectral characteristics of
hot gas in the group around IC1262. XMM-Newton data are only partially usable
due to very heavy high background contamination, but they are useful to confirm
and strengthen the results from Chandra.
  RESULTS: The Chandra data show a quite dramatic view of the \object{IC1262}
system: a sharp discontinuity east of the central galaxy, with steep drops and
a relatively narrow feature over 100 kpc long, plus an arc/loop to the N, are
all indicative of a turmoil in the high energy component. Their morphologies
could suggest them to be tracers of shocked material caused either by peculiar
motions in the system or by a recent merger process, but the spectral
characteristics indicate that the structure is cooler than its surroundings.
The lack of evidence of significant structures in the velocity distribution of
the group members and the estimated scale of the phenomenon make the
interpretation of its physical nature challenging. We review a few possible
interpretations, in light of similar phenomena observed in clusters and groups.
The ram pressure stripping of a bright spiral galaxy, now near the center of
the group, is a promising interpretation for most of the features observed. The
relation with the radio activity requires a better sampling of the radio
parameters that can only be achieved with deeper and higher resolution
observations.

of variable sources in crowded stellar fields and, as such, constitutes a
crucial part of the data reduction pipeline in surveys for microlensing events

permits the accurate differencing of images by determining convolution kernels
which, when applied to reference images of particularly good quality, provide
excellent matches to the point-spread functions (PSF) in other images of the
time series to be analysed. The convolution kernels are built as linear
combinations of a set of basis functions, conventionally bivariate Gaussians
modulated by polynomials. The kernel parameters must be supplied by the user
and should ideally be matched to the PSF, pixel-sampling, and S/N of the data
to be analysed. We have studied the outcome of the reduction as a function of
the kernel parameters using our implementation of OIS within the TRIPP package.
  From the analysis of noise-free PSF simulations as well as test images from
the ISIS OIS package, we derive qualitative and quantitative relations between
the kernel parameters and the success of the subtraction as a function of the
PSF sizes and sampling in reference and data images and compare the results to
those of implementations in the literature. On this basis, we provide
recommended parameters for data sets with different S/N and sampling.

configuration consisting in (1) an outer standard accretion disc (SAD) down to
a transition radius $r_{tr}$, (2) an inner magnetized jet emitting disc (JED)
below $r_{tr}$ driving (3) a self-collimated non relativistic MHD jet
surrounding, when conditions for pair creation are met, (4) a ultra
relativistic pair beam. Large values of $r_{tr}$ correspond to Hard states
while small values correspond to Soft states. In between these extremes, in the
high intermediate state, $r_{tr}$ can reach values that switch on a pair
cascade process giving birth to ultra-relativistic pair blobs that explain the
superluminal events. In this model the accretion rate but also the disc
magnetization $\mu$ play important roles, the latter being necessarily in the
range 0.1-1 for the MHD jet to exist. Then, with simple assumptions on $\mu$,
we propose an explanation for the hysteresis behavior observed in microquasars

between extraction of information and disturbance of the state of the quantum
system. A quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement minimizes this disturbance
by using a particular system - detector interaction which preserves the
eigenstates of a suitable operator of the quantum system. This leads to an
ideal projective measurement. We present experiments in which we perform two
consecutive measurements on a quantum two -level system, a superconducting flux
qubit, by probing the hysteretic behaviour of a coupled nonlinear resonator.
The large correlation between the results of the two measurements demonstrates
the QND nature of the readout method. The fact that a QND measurement is
possible for superconducting qubits strengthens the notion that these
fabricated mesoscopic systems are to be regarded as fundamental quantum
objects. Our results are also relevant for quantum information processing,
where projective measurements are used for protocols like state preparation and

multi-component \textit{e-ph}power loss formula, which takes into account the
asymmetric coupling and links the total \textit{e-ph} energy loss rate to the
density response matrix of the total electron system. We write the density
response matrix within mean field approximation, which leads to coexistence of\
symmetric energy loss rate $F_{S}(T)$ and asymmetric energy loss rate
$F_{A}(T)$ with total energy loss rate $ F(T)=F_{S}(T)+F_{A}(T)$ at temperature
$T$. The symmetric component F_{S}(T) $ is equivalent to the conventional
single-sub-system energy loss rate in the literature, and in the
Bloch-Gr\""{u}neisen limit we reproduce a set of well-known power laws
$F_{S}(T)\propto T^{n_{S}}$, where the prefactor and power $n_{S}$ depend on
electron system dimensionality and electron mean free path. For $F_{A}(T)$ we
produce a new set of power laws F_{A}(T)\propto T^{n_{A}}$. Screening strongly
reduces the symmetric coupling, but the asymmetric coupling is unscreened,
provided that the inter-sub-system Coulomb interactions are strong. The lack of
screening enhances $F_{A}(T)$ and the total energy loss rate $F(T)$.
Especially, in the strong screening limit we find $F_{A}(T)\gg F_{S}(T)$. A
canonical example of strongly asymmetric \textit{e-ph} matrix elements is the
deformation potential coupling in many-valley semiconductors.

learning environment (ILE). Moreover, in technology enhanced learning (TEL),
the design process requires input from many diverse areas of expertise. As
such, anyone undertaking tool development is required to directly address the
design challenge from multiple perspectives. We provide a motivation and
rationale for design approaches for learning technologies that draws upon
Simon's seminal proposition of Design Science (Simon, 1969). We then review the
application of Design Experiments (Brown, 1992) and Design Patterns (Alexander
et al., 1977) and argue that a patterns approach has the potential to address
many of the critical challenges faced by learning technologists.

collectors should be able to reclaim all dead objects, i.e. objects that will
not be used in future. However, garbage collectors collect only those dead

reachable from program variables are not reclaimed.
  In this paper we describe our experiments to measure the effectiveness of
garbage collection in MIT/GNU Scheme. We compute the drag time of objects, i.e.
the time for which an object remains in heap memory after its last use. The
number of dead objects and the drag time together indicate opportunities for
improving garbage collection. Our experiments reveal that up to 26% of dead
objects remain in memory. The average drag time is up to 37% of execution time.
Overall, we observe memory saving potential ranging from 9% to 65%.

grouping, duplicate elimination and other set operations. Query optimizers
traditionally deal with sort orders by using the notion of interesting orders.
The number of interesting orders is unfortunately factorial in the number of
participating attributes. Optimizer implementations use heuristics to prune the
number of interesting orders, but the quality of the heuristics is unclear.
Increasingly complex decision support queries and increasing use of covering
indices, which provide multiple alternative sort orders for relations, motivate
us to better address the problem of optimization with interesting orders.
  We show that even a simplified version of optimization with sort orders is
NP-hard and provide principled heuristics for choosing interesting orders. We
have implemented the proposed techniques in a Volcano-style cost-based
optimizer, and our performance study shows significant improvements in
estimated cost. We also executed our plans on a widely used commercial database
system, and on PostgreSQL, and found that actual execution times for our plans
were significantly better than for plans generated by those systems in several
cases.

  Order Optimality of Separation","submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  We investigate the optimal performance of dense sensor networks by studying
the joint source-channel coding problem. The overall goal of the sensor network
is to take measurements from an underlying random process, code and transmit
those measurement samples to a collector node in a cooperative multiple access
channel with potential feedback, and reconstruct the entire random process at
the collector node. We provide lower and upper bounds for the minimum
achievable expected distortion when the underlying random process is Gaussian.
When the Gaussian random process satisfies some general conditions, we evaluate
the lower and upper bounds explicitly, and show that they are of the same order
for a wide range of power constraints. Thus, for these random processes, under
these power constraints, we express the minimum achievable expected distortion
as a function of the power constraint. Further, we show that the achievability
scheme that achieves the lower bound on the distortion is a separation-based
scheme that is composed of multi-terminal rate-distortion coding and
amplify-and-forward channel coding. Therefore, we conclude that separation is
order-optimal for the dense Gaussian sensor network scenario under
consideration, when the underlying random process satisfies some general
conditions.

in which it is no longer an extensive quantity (it does not scale with system's
size). To accomplish this, the methods introduced by Oppenheim [1] to
characterize non-extensivity are used, suitably generalized to the case of
gravitating systems subject to an external pressure. In particular when, far
from the system's Schwarzschild limit, both area scaling for conventional
entropy and inverse radius law for the temperature set in (i.e. the same
properties of the corresponding black hole thermodynamical quantities), the
entropy profile is found to behave like 1/r, being r the area radius inside the
system. In such circumstances thus entropy heavily resides in internal layers,
in opposition to what happens when area scaling is gained while approaching the
Schwarzschild mass, in which case conventional entropy lies at the surface of
the system. The information content of these systems, even if it globally
scales like the area, is then stored in the whole volume, instead of packed on
the boundary.

anomalous magnetic moment. The nonlinear potential and interactions yield
different contributions to the total energy, and these components of the energy
lead to different energy-speed relation. The magnitude of these components can
be detected by elaborate experiments. The weird properties of the nonlinear
spinors might be closely related with the elementary particles and their
interactions, so some deeper investigations on them are significant.

appealing concepts, introduced in \cite{rindler}, is to consider a rotating
reference frame co-moving with the gyroscope, and relate the precession of the
gyroscope to the angular velocity of the reference frame. A recent paper
\cite{herrera}, however, applies this principle to three different co-moving
rotating reference frames and arrives at three different Thomas rotation
angles. The reason for this apparent paradox is that the principle of
\cite{rindler} is used for a situation to which it does not apply. In this
paper we rigorously examine the theoretical background and limitations of
applicability of the principle of \cite{rindler}. Along the way we also
establish some general properties of {\it rotating reference frames}, which may

different regions of the complex plane but present series coefficients
proportional to each other. These solutions for the GSWE afford solutions to a

procedure, called Whittaker-Ince limit, provides solutions in series of powers

  and submitted to GAFD",,,,"math-ph math.MP",,"  Geophysical research has focused on flows, such as ocean currents, as two
dimensional. Two dimensional point or blob vortex models have the advantage of
having a Hamiltonian, whereas 3D vortex filament or tube systems do not
necessarily have one, although they do have action functionals. On the other
hand, certain classes of 3D vortex models called nearly parallel vortex
filament models do have a Hamiltonian and are more accurate descriptions of
geophysical and atmospheric flows than purely 2D models, especially at smaller
scales. In these ``quasi-2D'' models we replace 2D point vortices with vortex
filaments that are very straight and nearly parallel but have Brownian
variations along their lengths due to local self-induction. When very straight,
quasi-2D filaments are expected to have virtually the same planar density
distributions as 2D models. An open problem is when quasi-2D model statistics
behave differently than those of the related 2D system and how this difference
is manifested. In this paper we study the nearly parallel vortex filament model
of Klein, Majda, Damodaran in statistical equilibrium. We are able to obtain a
free-energy functional for the system in a non-extensive thermodynamic limit
that is a function of the mean square vortex position $R^2$ and solve
\emph{explicitly} for $R^2$. Such an explicit formula has never been obtained
for a non-2D model. We compare the results of our formula to a 2-D formula of
\cite{Lim:2005} and show qualitatively different behavior even when we disallow
vortex braiding. We further confirm our results using Path Integral Monte Carlo
(Ceperley (1995)) \emph{without} permutations and that the Klein, Majda,
Damodaran model's asymptotic assumptions \emph{are valid} for parameters where
these deviations occur.

  pages, 10 figures",,,,"math-ph hep-th math.MP",,"  The subject of this thesis is a novel construction method for interacting
relativistic quantum field theories on two-dimensional Minkowski space. The
input in this construction is not a classical Lagrangian, but rather a
prescribed factorizing S-matrix, i.e. the inverse scattering problem for such
quantum field theories is studied.
  For a large class of factorizing S-matrices, certain associated quantum
fields, which are localized in wedge-shaped regions of Minkowski space, are
constructed explicitely. With the help of these fields, the local observable
content of the corresponding model is defined and analyzed by employing methods
from the algebraic framework of quantum field theory.
  The abstract problem in this analysis amounts to the question under which
conditions an algebra of wedge-localized observables can be used to generate a
net of local observable algebras with the right physical properties. The answer
given here uses the so-called modular nuclearity condition, which is shown to
imply the existence of local observables and the Reeh-Schlieder property.
  In the analysis of the concrete models, this condition is proven for a large
family of S-matrices, including the scattering operators of the Sinh-Gordon
model and the scaling Ising model as special examples. The so constructed
models are then investigated with respect to their scattering properties. They
are shown to solve the inverse scattering problem for the considered
S-matrices, and a proof of asymptotic completeness is given.

$\delta$-homogeneous spaces in the case of Riemannian manifolds. Every such

turn, every simply connected Riemannian $\delta$-homogeneous manifold is a
direct metric product of an Euclidean space and compact simply connected
indecomposable homogeneous manifolds; all factors in this product are itself
$\delta$-homogeneous. We find different characterizations of
$\delta$-homogeneous Riemannian spaces, which imply that any such space is
geodesic orbit (g.o.) and every normal homogeneous Riemannian manifold is
$\delta$-homogeneous. The g.o. property and the $\delta$-homogeneity property
are inherited by closed totally geodesic submanifolds. Then we find all
possible candidates for compact simply connected indecomposable Riemannian
$\delta$-homogeneous non-normal manifolds of positive Euler characteristic and
a priori inequalities for parameters of the corresponding family of Riemannian
$\delta$-homogeneous metrics on them (necessarily two-parametric). We prove
that there are only two families of possible candidates: non-normal

$l\geq 2$, investigated earlier by W. Ziller, H. Tamaru, D.V. Alekseevsky and

This paper
investigates how the norm of products $\Pi_n=X_1 X_2 ... X_n$ behaves as $n$
approaches infinity. In addition, for positive $X_i$ it studies the asymptotic
behavior of the norm of $Y_n=X_1 \circ X_2 \circ ...\circ X_n$, where $\circ$
denotes the symmetric product of two positive operators: $A \circ
B=:A^{1/2}BA^{1/2}$.
  It is proved that if the expectation of $X_i$ is 1, then the norm of the
symmetric product $Y_{n}$ is between $c_1 n^{1/2}$ and $c_2 n$ for certain
constant $c_1$ and $c_2$. That is, the growth in the norm is at most linear.
  For the norm of the usual product $Pi_n$, it is proved that the limit of
$n^{-1}\log Norm(Pi_n)$ exists and equals $\log \sqrt{E(X_i^{\ast}X_{i})}.$ In
other words, the growth in the norm of the product is exponential and the rate
equals the logarithm of the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of operator X.
  Finally, if $\pi $ is a cyclic representation of the algebra generated by
$X_i$, and if $\xi$ is a cyclic vector, then $n^{-1}\log Norm(\pi (\Pi_{n})
\xi)=\log \sqrt{E(X_{i}^{\ast}X_{i})}$ for all $n.$ In other words, the growth
in the length of the cyclic vector is exponential and the rate coincides with
the rate in the growth of the norm of the product.
  These results are significantly different from analogous results for
commuting random variables and generalize results for random matrices derived
by Kesten and Furstenberg.

  Bertrand and P. D\`ebes), Sem. et Congres, Vol. 13 (2006), 165--230",,,"math.NT",,"  The genus of projective curves discretely separates decidedly different two
variable algebraic relations. So, we can focus on the connected moduli M_g of
genus g curves. Yet, modern applications require a data variable (function) on
such curves. The resulting spaces are versions, depending on our need from this
data variable, of Hurwitz spaces. A Nielsen class is a set defined by r \ge 3
conjugacy classes C in the data variable monodromy G. It gives a striking genus
analog.
  Using Frattini covers of G, every Nielsen class produces a projective system
of related Nielsen classes for any prime p dividing |G|. A nonempty (infinite)
projective system of braid orbits in these Nielsen classes is an infinite (G,C)
component (tree) branch. These correspond to projective systems of irreducible
(dim r-3) components from {H(G_{p,k}(G),C)}_{k=0}^{\infty}, the (G,C,p) Modular
Tower (MT). The classical modular curve towers {Y_1(p^{k+1})}_{k=0}^\infty
(simplest case: G is dihedral, r=4, C are involution classes) are an avatar.
  The (weak) Main Conjecture says, if G is p-perfect, there are no rational
points at high levels of a component branch. When r=4, MT levels (minus their
cusps) are upper half plane quotients covering the j-line. Our topics.
  * Identifying component branches on a MT from g-p', p and Weigel cusp
branches using the MT generalization of spin structures.
  * Listing cusp branch properties that imply the (weak) Main Conjecture and
extracting the small list of towers that could possibly fail the conjecture. *
Formulating a (strong) Main Conjecture for higher rank MTs (with examples):

  Mathematische Schriften"", volume 381",,,,"math.AT",,"  In this work, we study topological properties of surface bundles, with an
emphasis on surface bundles with a spin structure. We develop a criterion to
decide whether a given manifold bundle has a spin structure and specialize it
to surface bundles. We study examples of surface bundles, in particular sphere
and torus bundles and surface bundles induced by actions of finite groups on
Riemann surfaces. The examples are used to show that the obstruction cohomology
class against the existence of a spin structure is nonzero. We develop a
connection between the Atiyah-Singer index theorem for families of elliptic
operators and the modern homotopy theory of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces
due to Tillmann, Madsen and Weiss. This theory and the index theorem is applied
to prove that the tautological classes of spin surface bundles satisfy certain
divisibility relations. The result is that the divisibility improves, compared
with the non-spin-case, by a certain power of 2. The explicit computations for
sphere bundles are used in the proof of the divisibility result. In the last
chapter, we use actions of certain finite groups to construct explicit torsion
elements in the homotopy groups of the mapping class and compute their order,
which relies on methods from algebraic $K$-theory and on the Madsen-Weiss
theorem.

The average fission barrier corresponding to the least-energy path in the
two-dimensional potential energy landscape as function of quadrupole and
octupole degrees of freedom is modified by the influence of the transverse
collective vibrations along the nuclear path to fission. The set of transverse
vibrational states built in the fission valley corresponding to a successively
increasing nuclear elongation produces the new energy barrier which is compared
with the least-energy barrier. These collective states are given as the
eigensolutions of the GCM purely vibrational Hamiltonian. In addition, the
influence of the collective inertia on the fission properties is displayed, and
it turns out to be the decisive condition for the possible transitions between
different fission valleys.

fidelity between the initial and time-reversed or ""echo"" signal). In
particular, we show that for partial reversals (e.g., when of only a part of
the total Hamiltonian changes sign) fidelity will exhibit a Gaussian dependence

details of the reversal procedure or the specifics of the coupling to the
environment. This puzzling behavior was observed in several NMR experiments.
