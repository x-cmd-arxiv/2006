systems, and develop a toy model which incorporates a universal initial power
law mass function, selected formation histories, selected disruption laws, and
a convolution with common artifacts and selection effects found in
observational data. The model confirms that the observed correlation between
the brightest young cluster in a galaxy and the total number of young clusters
can be understood as a statistical size-of-sample effect, rather than a
difference in the physical process responsible for the formation of the
clusters. A comparison is made between different cluster disruption laws and it
is shown that the break in the dN/d\tau diagram used to determine the
parameters in the Boutloukos & Lamers model may be produced by incompleteness
near the breakpoint. A model of the Antennae galaxies is developed and compared
with the observational data. An important component of our model is the use of
a ""two-stage"" disruption process, with a very high ""infant mortality"" rate for
the clusters with ages less than \approx10^8 yrs (i.e., roughly 80%-90% are
lost each factor of ten in time, \tau, independent of mass), and two-body
relaxation, which becomes the dominant disruption mechanism at older ages,
preferentially removing the lower mass clusters. Hence, in our model, stars
from the dissolved clusters form the field population. We note that a 90%
infant mortality rate for each factor of ten in \tau (i.e., dN/d\tau\propto
\tau^{-1}) is consistent with all measured young cluster populations, including
those in the Antennae, Small Magellanic Cloud, and the Milky Way.

this period, the flux increases by a factor of about 3, while the spectral
shape is quite unchanged, at least up to 150 keV. The high energy data allows
us to detect the presence of a high energy cut-off, generally related to
thermal mechanisms, and to estimate the plasma parameters in the framework of
the Comptonization models. We found an electron temperature of 60-70 keV, an
optical depth around 2.5, with a rather low reflection factor (0.2-0.4). In the
last observation, we detected a high energy excess above 200 keV with respect
to thermal Comptonization while at lower energy, the spectrum is practically
identical to the previous one, taken just 2 days before. This suggests that the
low and high energy components have a different origin.

The luminosity and the extreme equivalent width of Halpha+[NII] measured for
these sources, together with their very compact appearance, has raised the
question about the origin of these intense starbursts in the cluster
environment. We propose the compact starburst in Abell 539 resulted from the
compression of the interstellar gas of a dwarf galaxy when entering the cluster
core; while the starburst galaxy in Abell 634 is likely to be the result of a
galaxy-galaxy interaction, illustrating the preprocessing of galaxies during
their infall towards the central regions of clusters. The contribution of these
compact star-forming dwarf galaxies to the star formation history of galaxy
clusters is discussed, as well as a possible link with the recently discovered
early-type ultra-compact dwarf galaxies. We note that these extreme objects
will be rarely detected in normal magnitude-limited optical or NIR surveys,
mainly due to their low stellar masses (of the order of 10^6 solar masses),
whereas they will easily show up in dedicated Halpha surveys given the high
equivalent width of their emission lines.

radiation dominates in the optical. With matched beams, the jet is generally
narrower in the optical than in the radio, suggesting a stratified flow. We
examine a simple two-component model comprising a highly relativistic spine and
lower-velocity sheath. This configuration is broadly consistent with
polarization angle differences seen in the optical and radio data. The base of
the jet is relatively brighter in the ultraviolet and X-ray than at lower

the jet brightens downstream. Further out, the X-ray intensity rises again and

carbon-rich AGB stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud. SiC dust is seen in most
of the carbon-rich stars but it is weak compared to LMC stars. The SiC feature
is strong only for stars with significant dust excess, opposite to what is
observed for Galactic stars. We argue that in the SMC, SiC forms at lower
temperature than graphite dust, whereas the reverse situation occurs in the
Galaxy where SiC condenses at higher temperatures and forms first. Dust input
into the interstellar medium by AGB stars consists mostly of carbonaceous dust,
with little SiC or silicate dust. Only the two coolest stars show a 30-micron
band due to MgS dust. We suggest that this is due to the fact that, in the SMC,
mass-losing AGB stars generally have low circumstellar (dust) optical depth and
therefore effective heating of dust by the central star does not allow
temperatures below the 650 K necessary for MgS to exist as a solid. Gas phase
C$_2$H$_2$ bands are stronger in the SMC than in the LMC or Galaxy. This is
attributed to an increasing C/O ratio at low metallicity. We present a
colour-colour diagram based on Spitzer IRAC and MIPS colours to discriminate
between O- and C-rich stars. We show that AGB stars in the SMC become carbon
stars early in the thermal-pulsing AGB evolution, and remain optically visible
for $\sim 6 \times 10^5$ yr. For the LMC, this lifetime is $\sim 3 \times 10^5$
yr. The superwind phase traced with Spitzer lasts for $\sim 10^4$ yr. Spitzer

has the highest temporal frequency resolution for any AGN PSD measured to date.
Applying a broken power-law model yields break frequencies which increase in
temporal frequency with photon energy. Obtaining a good fit when assuming
energy-independent break frequencies requires the presence of a Lorentzian at
4.6+/-0.4 * 10^-4 Hz whose strength increases with photon energy, a behavior
seen in black hole X-ray binaries. The cross-spectral properties are measured;
temporal frequency-dependent soft-to-hard time lags are detected in this object

accreting black hole systems. The results are discussed in the context of
several variability models, including those based on inwardly-propagating

GRB host galaxies, consistent with the incidence of intergalactic CIV_{15} near
classical damped Lya absorbers toward quasar sightlines. Including the two
CIV_{15} absorbers previously known toward GRB 021004, we further demonstrate
that the presence of H^0, C^+, and Si^+ together with the absence of excited

expectation that the circumburst medium is fully ionized by the afterglow
radiation field. We examine possible scenarios for the survival of the C^{3+}

effectively shield the ionizing radiation and allow C^{3+} to survive at r<10
pc from the afterglow. We conclude that the lack of CSM-originated CIV_{15}

DLAs are large, with radii >9h^-1 kpc, and assuming no attenuation by dust,
leads to the conclusion that the SFR per unit area of MgII-selected DLAs falls
an order of magnitude below the predictions of the Schmidt law, which relates
the SFR to the HI column density at z~0. The contribution of both DLA and CaII
absorbers to the total observed star formation rate density in the redshift

with the conclusions of Hopkins et al. that DLA absorbers can account for the

low Mach number flow shocks inside halos, and the softer adiabatic index of
CRs, which disfavours them when a composite of thermal gas and CRs is
adiabatically compressed. Within cool core regions, the CR pressure reaches
equipartition with the thermal pressure leading to an enhanced compressibility
of the central intra-cluster medium, an effect that increases the central

  11 pages, 12 figures",,,,"astro-ph",,"  High-resolution radio observations have revealed that non-thermal radio
emission in WR stars arises where the stellar wind of the WR star collides with
that of a binary companion. These colliding-wind binary (CWB) systems offer an
important laboratory for investigating the underlying physics of particle
acceleration. Hydrodynamic models of the binary stellar winds and the
wind-collision region (WCR) that account for the evolution of the electron
energy spectrum, largely due to inverse Compton cooling, are now available.
Radiometry and imaging obtained with the VLA, MERLIN, EVN and VLBA provide
essential constraints to these models. Models of the radio emission from WR146
and WR147 are shown, though these very wide systems do not have defined orbits
and hence lack a number of important model parameters. Multi-epoch VLBI imaging
of the archetype WR+O star binary WR140 through a part of its 7.9-year orbit
has been used to define the orbit inclination, distance and the luminosity of
the companion star to enable the best constraints for any radio emitting CWB
system. Models of the spatial distribution of relativistic electrons and ions,
and the magnetic energy density are used to model the radio emission, and also
to predict the high energy emission at X-ray and gamma-ray energies. It is
clear that high-energy facilities e.g. GLAST and VERITAS, will be important for
constraining particle acceleration parameters such as the spectral index of the
energy spectrum and the acceleration efficiency of both ions and electrons, and
in turn, identify unique models for the radio spectra. This will be especially
important in future attempts to model the spectra of WR140 throughout its
complete orbit. A WCR origin for the synchrotron emission in O-stars, the
progenitors of WR stars, is illustrated by observations of Cyg OB2 No. 9.

allowed by the data). Instead of these indirect reconstruction schemes, we
discuss a technique to determine the potential directly from the data by
expressing it in terms of a binned scalar field. We apply this technique to a
recent SN dataset, and compare the results with model-dependent approaches. In
a similar fashion to direct estimates of the dark energy equation of state, we

sensitive to only 18% of the total AGB population. We detect objects with
infrared fluxes consistent with them being mass-losing AGB stars, and derive a
present day total mass-loss rate from the AGB stars of 0.7-2.4 x 10^(-3) solar
masses per year. The distribution of mass-loss rates and bolometric
luminosities of AGBs and red supergiants are very similar to those in the LMC

in excellent agreement with our WLM data.

96.7 ks. One of the two X-ray sources has no near-infrared counterpart and is
extended by ~5 arcsec, or ~0.3 pc, at a distance of ~11.4 kpc, which is
spatially aligned with the cometary radio continuum emission associated with
the UC HII region. The X-ray spectrum of the emission, when fit with a thermal
model, indicates a heavily absorbed plasma with extinction of
\~5x10^{23}/cm^{2}, temperature of ~7 keV, and X-ray luminosity in the 3.0-8.0

resemble the extended hard emission found in UC HII regions in Sagittarius B2,

spectrum in the 3-12 keV band was obtained with the XIS. We found that the
spectrum consists of a thermal plasma, a hard power-law tail, and two Gaussian
lines. The plasma component (kT~2.2 keV) is established from the presence of
CaXIX and FeXXV K alpha lines as well as the absence of FeXXVI K alpha line.
The two Gaussian lines represent the K alpha and beta lines from iron at lower
ionization stages. Both the line centers and the intensity ratio of these two
lines are consistent with the neutral iron. The hard power-law tail (index~0.7)
was found to have no pronounced iron K edge feature. In comparison with the
published Chandra spectra, we conclude that the thermal component is from the
ensemble of point-like sources plus thermal diffuse emission concentrated at
the cluster center, while the Gaussian and the hard tail components are from
the non-thermal diffuse emission extended in a larger scale. In the
band-limited XIS images, the distribution of the 7.5-10.0 keV emission
resembles that of the 6.4 keV emission. This strongly suggests that the
power-law emission is related to the 6.4 and 7.1 keV lines in the underlying
physics. We discuss two ideas to explain both the hard continuum and the lines:
(1) X-ray photoionization that produces fluorescence lines and the Thomson
scattering continuum and (2) non-thermal electron impact ionization of iron
atoms and bremsstrahlung continuum. But whichever scenario is adopted, the
photon or particle flux from the Arches cluster is too low to account for the
observed line and continuum intensity.

dwarf irregular galaxies. Therefore these systems appear different from any
dwarfs of the Local Group. They should be favoured hosts for starburst, whereas
we find a faint star formation region in only one object. We have obtained
21-cm data and Hubble Space Telescope photometry in V and I bands, and have
constructed Colour Magnitude Diagrams (CMDs) to investigate their stellar
populations and to set a constraint on their age. From the comparison of the
observed and model CMDs we infer that all three galaxies are at least older
than 2 Gyr (possibly even as old as 10 Gyr) and remain gas-rich because their
star formation rates (SFRs) have been very low (< 10^{-3} M_{sun}/yr)
throughout. In such systems, star formation (SF) appears to have been sporadic
and local, though one object (HIPASS J1321--31) has a peculiar red plume in its
CMD suggesting that many of its stars were formed in a ""miniburst"" 300 - 500

to damp out high-frequency components of the error fast, but converges poorly

differently coarsed grids to reduce both the short- and long-period errors.
This leads to the so-called multigrid (MG) methods. For the grid of $N$ spatial
points, the number of iterations required to solve a non-LTE transfer problem
is of the order of O(N). This fact could be of great importance for problems
with fine structure and for multi-dimensional models. The efficiency of the
so-called standard MG iteration in comparison to Jacobi iteration is shown. The
formalism of density matrix is applied to the demonstrative example of 1D,

that: (i) cooling of massive NSs is enhanced by neutrino emission more powerful
than the emission due to Cooper pairing of neutrons; (ii) mild neutron
superfluidity, if available, might be present only in inner cores of massive
NSs. In the latter case SXTs would exhibit dichotomy, i.e. very similar SXTs
may evolve to very different thermal states.

seconds respectively. These periods are thought possibly to represent the
orbital periods of close pairs of white dwarfs. In this paper we present
optical light curves taken with the high-speed CCD camera ULTRACAM on the 4.2m
WHT in May 2003 and August 2005 and with the VLT in November 2005. The optical
and X-ray light curves of HM Cnc have been reported as being in anti-phase, but
we find that in fact the X-rays peak around 0.2 cycles after the maximum of the
optical light, as seen also in V407 Vul. The X-ray/optical phase shifts are
well explained under the accreting models of the systems if most of the optical
modulation comes from the heated faces of the mass donors and if the X-ray
emitting spots are positioned in advance of the mass donors, as is expected
given the angular momentum of the accreting material. Some optical emission may
also come from the vicinity of the X-ray spot, and we further show that this
can explain the non-sinusoidal lightcurves of HM Cnc. The only significant
difference between the two stars is that V407 Vul is observed to have the
spectrum of a G star. The variation in position on the sky of a blend of a
variable and a constant star can be used as a measure of their separation, and
is sensitive to values well below the limit set by seeing. We apply ""pulsation
astrometry"" to deduce that the G star is separated from the variable by about
0.027'' and hence plays no role in the variability of V407 Vul. We show that
light travel time variations could influence the period change in V407 Vul if
it forms a triple system with the G star.

  figures, in Spanish",,,,"hep-th math-ph math.MP",,"  Two main themes populate this Thesis's pages: transgression forms as
Lagrangians for gauge theories and the Abelian semigroup expansion of Lie
algebras.
  A transgression form is a function of two gauge connections whose main
property is its full invariance under gauge transformations. From this form a
Lagrangian is built, and equations of motion, boundary conditions and
associated Noether currents are derived. A subspace separation method, based on
the extended Cartan homotopy formula, is proposed, which allows to (i) split
the Lagrangian in 'bulk' and 'boundary' contributions and (ii) separate the
bulk term in sublagrangians corresponding to the subspaces of the gauge
algebra.
  Use is made of Abelian semigroups to develop an expansion method for Lie
(super)algebras, based on the work by de Azcarraga, Izquierdo, Picon and
Varela. The main idea consists in considering the direct product between an
Abelian semigroup S and a Lie (super)algebra g. General conditions under which
smaller algebras can be extracted from S \otimes g are given. It is shown how
to recover the known expansion cases in this new context. Several d=11
superalgebras are obtained as examples of the application of the method.
General theorems that allow to find an invariant tensor for the expanded
algebra from an invariant tensor for the original algebra are formulated.
  Finally, a d=11 gauge theory for the M Algebra is considered by using the
ideas developed in the Thesis. The dynamical properties of this theory are
briefly analyzed.

the fact that CL(1,3) is a semi-simple algebra and therefore stable. It is

theory of physics at the interface of GR and QM might be to depart from working
in space-time and instead to work in space-time-momentum.

Recently Gaussian quadrature with respect to discrete measures corresponding to
finite sums have found some new interest. In this paper we apply these ideas to
infinite sums in general and give an explicit construction for the weights and
abscissae of GAUSSIAN SUMMATION formulas. The abscissae of the Gaussian
summation have a very interesting asymptotic distribution function with a
(cusp) singularity. We apply the Gaussian summation technique to two problems
which have been discussed in the literature. We find that the Gaussian
summation has an extremely rapid convergence rate for the Hardy-Littlewood sum
for a large range of parameters. For functions which are smooth but have a
large scale, a, the error of Gaussian Summation shows exponential convergence
as a function of summation points. The Gaussian summation achieves a given
accuracy with a number of points proportional to the sqrt of the large scale
whereas other summation schemes require at least a number of function
evaluations proportional to the scale.

thoroughly, little work has been done about the comparison of unequal figures.
We are used to compare only similar figures but would it be meaningful to
compare non similar ones? In this paper we attempt to build a context where it
is possible to compare even non similar figures. Adopting Klein's view for the
Euclidean Geometry, we defined a relation ""<="" as: S<=T whenever there is a
rigid motion f so that f(S) is a subset of T. This relation is not an order
because there are figures (subsets of the plane) so that S<=T, T<=S and S, T
not geometrically equal. Our goal is to avoid this paradox and to track down
non-trivial classes of figures where the relation ""<="" becomes, at least, a
partial order. Such a class will be called a good class of figures. A
reasonable question is whether the figures forming a good class have certain
properties and whether the algebra of these figures is also a good class.
Therefore we classified the figures into those that cause the paradox mentioned
above and those that never cause it. The last ones are called good figures.
Although simple, the definition of the good figure was difficult to handle,
therefore we introduced a more technical, but intrinsic and handy definition,
that of the strongly good figure. With these tools we constructed a new
context, where we expanded our perspective about the geometric comparison not
only in the Euclidean but also in the Hyperbolic and in the Elliptic Geometry.
Eventually, there are still some open and quite challenging issues, which we
present them at the last part of the paper.

shortfall and maximal loss. We introduce a measure of portfolio sensitivity and
test the various risk measures by considering simulated portfolios of varying
sizes N and for different lengths T of the time series. We find that the effect
of noise is very strong in all the investigated cases, asymptotically it only
depends on the ratio N/T, and diverges at a critical value of N/T, that depends
on the risk measure in question. This divergence is the manifestation of a
phase transition, analogous to the algorithmic phase transitions recently
discovered in a number of hard computational problems. The transition is
accompanied by a number of critical phenomena, including the divergent sample
to sample fluctuations of portfolio weights. While the optimization under
variance and mean absolute deviation is always feasible below the critical
value of N/T, expected shortfall and maximal loss display a probabilistic
feasibility problem, in that they can become unbounded from below already for
small values of the ratio N/T, and then no solution exists to the optimization
problem under these risk measures. Although powerful filtering techniques exist
for the mitigation of the above instability in the case of variance, our
findings point to the necessity of developing similar filtering procedures
adapted to the other risk measures where they are much less developed or
nonexistent. Another important message of this study is that the requirement of
robustness (noise-tolerance) should be given special attention when considering
the theoretical and practical criteria to be imposed on a risk measure.

solution of point charges with mean-field electrostatic forces. Even for very
dilute solutions, however, it predicts absurdly large ion concentrations
(exceeding close packing) for surface potentials of only a few tenths of a
volt, which are often exceeded, e.g. in microfluidic pumps and electrochemical
sensors. Since the 1950s, several modifications of the PB equation have been
proposed to account for the finite size of ions in equilibrium, but in this
two-part series, we consider steric effects on diffuse charge dynamics (in the
absence of electro-osmotic flow). In this first part, we review the literature
and analyze two simple models for the charging of a thin double layer, which
must form a condensed layer of close-packed ions near the surface at high
voltage. A surprising prediction is that the differential capacitance typically
varies non-monotonically with the applied voltage, and thus so does the
response time of an electrolytic system. In PB theory, the capacitance blows up
exponentially with voltage, but steric effects actually cause it to decrease
above a threshold voltage where ions become crowded near the surface. Other
nonlinear effects in PB theory are also strongly suppressed by steric effects:
The net salt adsorption by the double layers in response to the applied voltage
is greatly reduced, and so is the tangential ""surface conduction"" in the
diffuse layer, to the point that it can often be neglected compared to bulk
conduction (small Dukhin number).

larger than the signal development time, we noticed experimentally a
significant deviation from the relationship of time-over-threshold and the

ecosystems like seagrass meadows. Despite some existing insights on the
mechanisms underlying decline, efficient tools to quantitatively predict the
response of benthic communities to fish farm effluents have not yet been
developed. We explored relationships of fish farm organic and nutrient input
rates to the sediments with population dynamics of the key seagrass species
(Posidonia oceanica) in deep meadows growing around four Mediterranean Sea
bream and Sea bass fish farms. We performed 2 annual shoot censuses on
permanent plots at increasing distance from cages. Before each census we
measured sedimentation rates adjacent to the plots using benthic sediment
traps. High shoot mortality rates were recorded near the cages, up to 20 times
greater than at control sites. Recruitment rates remained similar to
undisturbed meadows and could not compensate mortality, leading to rapid
seagrass decline within the first 100 meters from cages. Seagrass mortality
increased with total (R2= 0.47, p< 0.0002), organic matter (R2= 0.36, p=
0.001), nitrogen (R2= 0.34, p= 0.002) and phosphorus (R2= 0.58, p< 3 x 10-5)
sedimentation rates. P. oceanica decline accelerated above a phosphorus loading
threshold of 50 mg m-2 day-1. Benthic sedimentation rates seem a powerful
predictor of seagrass mortality from fish farming, integrating local
hydrodynamics, waste effluents variability and several environmental
mechanisms, fuelled by organic inputs and leading to seagrass loss. Coupling
direct measurements of benthic sedimentation rates with dynamics of key species
is proposed as an efficient way to predict and minimize fish farm impacts to
benthic communities.

basepair), protein mediated DNA loops. Superhelical stress in the DNA of living
cells is a critical factor determining the energetics of loop formation, and we
explicitly account for it in our calculations. The repressor protein itself is
regarded as a rigid coupler; its geometry enters the problem through the
boundary conditions it applies on the DNA. We show that a theory with these
ingredients is sufficient to explain certain features observed in modulation of
in vivo gene activity as a function of the distance between operator sites for
the lac repressor. We also use our theory to make quantitative predictions for

must originate partly from the differentiation in the gill epithelia of
ionocytes which are the site of ion pumping, as suggested by the location of
Na(+),K(+)-ATPase. Only the gills were immunostained and a lack of specific
staining was noted in the lamina and the branchiostegites. Therefore,
osmoregulation through Na(+)active uptake is likely achieved in embryos at the
gill level; all the newly formed gills in embryos function in ion regulation;
other parts of the branchial chamber such as the branchiostegites and lamina do
not appear to be involved in osmoregulation.

both analytically and numerically for slab and walls made of aluminium and

measurements of the temperature dependence of the Casimir force. By numerical
calculation it is shown that temperature effects are dramatically larger for
dielectrics, suggesting that a dielectric such as teflon FEP whose properties
vary little within a moderate temperature range, should be considered for
experimental purposes. We finally discuss the subtle but fundamental matter of
the various Green's two-point function approaches present in the literature and
show how they are different formulations describing the same phenomenon.

based on single qubit unitary operations allows to introduce {\it

characterize ground state properties, including the quantification of
single-site entanglement and the determination of quantum critical points. The
formalism allows to identify the existence and location of factorization
points, and a purely quantum {\it ``transition of entanglement''} that occurs
at the approach of factorization. This kind of quantum transition is
characterized by a diverging ratio of excitation energies associated to
single-qubit unitary operations.

$\epsilon$-randomizing maps, $n+2\log(1/\epsilon)+c$ bits required to
$\epsilon$-randomize an arbitrary $n$-qubit state by improving a scheme of
Ambainis and Smith \cite{AS04} based on small bias spaces \cite{NN90, AGHP92}.
We show by a probabilistic argument that in fact the great majority of random
schemes using slightly more than this many bits of key are also
$\epsilon$-randomizing. We provide the first known non-trivial lower bound for
$\epsilon$-randomizing maps, and develop several conditions on them which we
hope may be useful in proving stronger lower bounds in the future.

Butterfly. In this network, there are two flow paths, s_1 to t_1 and s_2 to
t_2, which share a single bottleneck channel of capacity one. So, if we
consider conventional flow (of liquid, for instance), then the total amount of
flow must be at most one in total, say 1/2 for each path. However, if we
consider information flow, then we can send two bits (one for each path) at the
same time by exploiting two side links, which are of no use for the liquid-type
flow, and encoding/decoding operations at each node. This is known as network
coding and has been quite popular since its introduction by Ahlswede, Cai, Li
and Yeung in 2000. In QIP 2006, Hayashi et al showed that quantum network
coding is possible for Butterfly, namely we can send two qubits simultaneously
with keeping their fidelity strictly greater than 1/2.
  In this paper, we show that the result can be extended to a large class of
general graphs by using a completely different approach. The underlying
technique is a new cloning method called entanglement-free cloning which does
not produce any entanglement at all. This seems interesting on its own and to
show its possibility is an even more important purpose of this paper. Combining
this new cloning with approximation of general quantum states by a small number
of fixed ones, we can design a quantum network coding protocol which
``simulates'' its classical counterpart for the same graph.
