observed 5 times from 1996 to 2001 with durations ranging from a day to four
days. The intrinsic continuum, is absorbed at low energies by a complex system:
a cold patchy absorber plus a warm uniform screen photoionized by the central
continuum. We find that this dual absorber is the main driver of the observed
variability, up to a factor of eight, at 3 keV. In particular the covering
fraction of the cold absorber changes on time scales of the order of a day,
supporting its association with the Broad Line Region. The column density of
the warm gas varies on a longer time scale (months to year). Some of the small
amplitude spectral variability above 10 keV can be explained with an intrinsic
variation (\Delta\Gamma~0.2).The flux below 1 keV remains constant confirming
an extended origin. Its spectrum is reproduced by a combination of a thermal
component and a power law with the same slope as the intrinsic continuum but
with an intensity a few per cent. A Compton reflection component is
significantly detected in 1996 (averaged value of \Omega/2\pi ~0.4), with
intensity decreasing on time scale of year, and it desappears in 2000 and 2001.
The long time scale of variations argues for an association with an optically
thick torus at a distance of few light years. An iron line was detected in all
spectra. Its energy is consistent with fluorescence by cold iron. We find that
the line is variable. Its behaviour is reproduced by a variable component
proportional to the level of the reflection flux plus a constant component. The
flux of the latter is consistent with the extended line emission observed by
Chandra. We conclude that the first component is likely arising from the torus
and the second is produced in the extended Narrow Line Region.

strongly influenced by the radiation coming from the solar disk, Doppler
dimming or brightening effects may arise, depending on which lines are observed

energy levels and non local thermodynamic equilibrium lead to non-trivial
spectral line profiles, and this calls for complex numerical modelling of the
radiative transfer in order to understand the observations. We present such a
tool, which solves the radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium for H, He
I, He II, and Ca II, in moving prominences where radial plasma motions are
taking place. It is found that for isothermal, isobaric prominence models, the
He II resonance lines are very sensitive to the Doppler effect and show a
strong Doppler dimming. The Ca II lines are not very sensitive to the Doppler
effect for the prominence models considered here. We illustrate how the code
makes it possible to retrieve the plasma thermodynamic parameters by comparing
computed and observed line profiles of hydrogen and helium resonance lines in a

view to new understanding of the size of accretion discs in active galactic

sparsely sampled data covering small ranges of time. Here we combine data from
two large scale monitoring programmes to obtain Fourier power spectra of light
curves covering nearly three orders of magnitude in frequency in blue and red
passbands. If the variations are interpreted as due to gravitational
microlensing, then timescale measurements in the observer's frame imply a
minimum mass for the microlensing bodies of around $0.4 M_{\odot}$. On the
assumption that the variations are intrinsic to the quasars, a correction must
be made for time dilation. In this case the power spectrum shows a break
corresponding to a timescale of about 11 years. This timescale is used to
measure the size of the accretion disc, which is found to be about $10^{-2}$ pc
or 10 light days, in agreement with limits set by self-gravitation and
coincident with the broad line region of the active galactic nucleus. It is
suggested that the broad line region may be associated with the break up of the

introduced by the scattering on a resonant transition with a given optical
depth $\tau_X$ and polarisation coefficient $E_1$. The latter parameter,
accounting for how anisotropic the scattering is, depends on the exchange of
angular momentum in the transition and enables, {\it a priori}, to distinguish
among different possible resonances. We use this formalism in two different
scenarios: cosmological recombination and cosmological reionisation. In the
context of cosmological recombination, we compute predictions in frequency and
multipole space for the change in the TE and EE power spectra introduced by
scattering on the $H_{\alpha}$ and $P_{\alpha}$ lines of Hydrogen. This
constitutes a fundamental test for the standard model of recombination, and the
sensitivity it requires is comparable to that needed in measuring the
primordial CMB B-mode polarisation component. In the context of reionisation,
we study the scattering off metals and ions produced by the first stars, and
find that polarisation anisotropies, apart from providing a consistency test
for intensity measurements, give some insight on how reionisation evolved:
since they keep memory of how anisotropic the line scattering is, they should
be able to discern the OI 63.2$\mu$m transition from other possible transitions

ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) through the microwave background
radiation. These neutrinos could be a powerful tool both to resolve the mystery
of the UHECR sources and to test fundamental physics at the $\sim$100 TeV
scale. The optical technique is not cost effective at these energies and newer
techniques such as radio and acoustic detection are necessary. Accelerator
experiments have confirmed the production of both types of signals from
high-energy showers in various media, and quantitative measurements have
confirmed theoretical descriptions of the signal strength, frequency content

the acoustic method could contribute with an entirely independent signal
production and detection mechanism and may be more effective at the highest

cm/s/s. Thus, the flattening of the velocity dispersion profile occurs for a
value of the internal acceleration of gravity fully consistent with a_0=1.2e-8
cm/s/s observed in galaxies. This new result for NGC 7099 brings to 4 the
clusters with velocity dispersion profile probing acceleration below a_0. All
four have been found to have a flat dispersion profile at large radii where the
acceleration is below a_0, mimicking qualitatively and quantitatively
elliptical galaxies. Whether this indicates a failure of Newtonian dynamics in
the low acceleration limit or some more conventional dynamical effect (e.g.,
tidal heating) is still unclear. However, the similarities emerging between
very different globular clusters, as well as between globular clusters and
elliptical galaxies seem to favor the first of these two possibilities.

multiplicity simulations of field brown dwarfs in the vicinity of the Sun.
These simulations are based on the solar metallicity brown dwarf evolutionary
models and incorporate empirical luminosity and absolute magnitude scales,
measured multiplicity statistics and observed spectral templates in the
construction and classification of composite binary spectra. In addition to
providing predictions on the number and surface density distributions of L and
T dwarfs for volume-limited and magnitude-limited samples, these simulations
successfully reproduce the observed binary fraction distribution assuming an
intrinsic (resolved) binary fraction of 11(+6)(-3)% (95% confidence interval),
consistent with prior determinations. However, the true binary fraction may be
as high as 40% if, as suggested by Liu et al., a significant fraction of L/T
transition objects (~66%) are tightly-bound, unresolved multiples. The
simulations presented here demonstrate that the binary excess amongst L/T
transition objects arises primarily from the flattening of the luminosity scale
over these spectral types and is not inherently the result of selection effects
incurred in current magnitude-limited imaging samples. Indeed, the existence of
a binary excess can be seen as further evidence that brown dwarfs traverse the
L/T transition rapidly, possibly driven by a nonequilibrium submergence of
photospheric condensates.

Previous studies of 4u0115+63 have led to the suggestion that it undergoes

coverage of the observations, the variability time scales are uncertain. Our
objective is to investigate the long-term behaviour of 4u 0115+63 to confirm
its quasi-cyclic nature and to explain its correlated optical/IR and X-ray
variability. We have performed optical/IR photometric observations and optical
spectroscopic observations of 4u 0115+63 over the last decade with
unprecedented coverage. We have focused on the Halpha line variability and the
long-term changes of the photometric magnitudes and colours and investigated
these changes in correlation with the X-ray activity of the source. results The
optical and infrared emission is characterised by cyclic changes with a period
of ~ 5 years. This long-term variability is attributed to the state of the
circumstellar disc around the Be star companion. Each cycle involves a low
state when the disc is very weak or absent and the associated low amplitude
variability is orbitally modulated and a high state when a perturbed disc
precesses, giving rise to fast and large amplitude photometric changes. X-ray
outbursts in 4u 0115+63 come in pairs, i.e., two in every cycle. However,
sometimes the second outburst is missing. Our results can be explained within
the framework of the decretion disc model. The neutron star acts as the
perturbing body, truncating and distorting the disc. The first outburst would
occur before the disc is strongly perturbed. The second outburst leads to the
dispersal of the disc and marks the end of the perturbed phase.

but rather that the orbits of older field stars are focused by the collapsing

leads to an enhancement of the density of field stars in the vicinity of the
centre of the young star cluster. And due to the time-dependent potential of
the forming cluster some of these stars can get bound gravitationally to the
cluster. These stars exhibit similar kinematical properties as the newly formed
stars and can not be distinguished from them on the basis of radial-velocity or
proper-motion surveys. Such contaminations may lead to a wrong apparent
star-formation history of a young cluster. In the case of the ONC the
theoretical number of gravitationally bound older low-mass field stars agrees

0.04 mag. After the early superhump phase, common superhumps with an amplitude
of 0.3 mag and a period of 0.064466(16) d developed. The change rate of
superhump periods was positive through the superoutburst. The superhump period
excess is 3% and we derive a mass ratio of 0.13. This is twice as large as that
of WZ Sge, suggesting that the mechanism of early superhumps in BC UMa is not
the 2:1 resonance which was proposed in WZ Sge.
  We have modelled early superhump light curves including irradiation effects
of the accretion disk and secondary star by the white dwarf and accretion disk.
The observed early superhumps can be reproduced when two-armed spirals appear
on the accretion disk.
  We have found the long term data taken from AAVSO, VSOLJ and VSNET shows BC
UMa has normal outbursts with a maximum magnitude of V~13 and two types of
superoutbursts: one has a short duration (around 10 days) and faint maximum
magnitude (V~12.5), the other has a long duration (around 20 days) and bright
maximum (V~11-11.5). BC UMa is the first example of dwarf novae showing the two
types of superoutbursts. The supercycle of BC UMa is between 600 days and 1000

0.2 arcsec. Using the new Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope and its Littrow
spectrograph, we scan a significant part of a sunspot penumbra. Spectra of the
non-magnetic line Fe I 7090.4 A allows us to measure Doppler shifts without
magnetic contamination. The observed line profiles are asymmetric. The Doppler
shift depends on the part of the line used for measuring, indicating that the
velocity structure of penumbrae remains unresolved even with our angular
resolution. The observed line profiles are properly reproduced if two
components with velocities between zero and several km/s co-exist in the
resolution elements. Using Doppler shifts at fixed line depths, we find a local
correlation between upflows and bright structures, and downflows and dark
structures. This association is not specific of the outer penumbra but it also
occurs in the inner penumbra. The existence of such correlation was originally
reported by Beckers & Schroter (1969), and it is suggestive of energy transport
by convection in penumbrae.

expected to form high density cusps in the inner parsec of our Galaxy. These

we build a simple but detailed time-dependent model of such emission. We find
that at least several X-ray sources of this nature should be detectable with
Chandra at any one time. Turning this issue around, we also ask a question of
what current observational constraints might be telling us about the total
number of compact remnants. A cusp with ~ 40 thousand black holes over-predicts
the number of discrete sources and the total X-ray luminosity of the inner
parsec, and is hence ruled out. Future observations of the distribution and
orbits of the cold ionised gas in the inner parsec of Sgr A* will put tighter

the dense flow region. We find that the relative normal velocity of colliding
particles is smaller than that expected from random collisions, and the
discrepancies in the dissipation and the normal stress can be adjusted by
introducing the idea of the collisional temperature, from which we conclude
that the velocity correlation neglected in the kinetic theory is responsible
for the discrepancies. Our analysis of the distributions of the pre-collisional
velocity suggests that the correlation grows through multiple inelastic
collisions during the time scale of the inverse of the shear rate. As for the
shear stress, the discrepancy is also found in the dense region, but it depends
strongly on the particle inelasticity.

independent valuation up to a privately known slot and zero thereafter. For

maximizing mechanisms and show that these mechanisms can be computed with a

Consequently, the traditional approach of baselining requirements results in an

contrast, systems constructed on the basis of Capabilities are more
change-tolerant; Capabilities are functional abstractions that are neither as
amorphous as user needs nor as rigid as system requirements. Alternatively,
Capabilities are aggregates that capture desired functionality from the users'
needs, and are designed to exhibit desirable software engineering
characteristics of high cohesion, low coupling and optimum abstraction levels.
To formulate these functional abstractions we develop and investigate two
algorithms for Capability identification: Synthesis and Decomposition. The
synthesis algorithm aggregates detailed rudimentary elements of the system to
form Capabilities. In contrast, the decomposition algorithm determines
Capabilities by recursively partitioning the overall mission of the system into
more detailed entities. Empirical analysis on a small computer based library
system reveals that neither approach is sufficient by itself. However, a
composite algorithm based on a complementary approach reconciling the two polar
perspectives results in a more feasible set of Capabilities. In particular, the
composite algorithm formulates Capabilities using the cohesion and coupling
measures as defined by the decomposition algorithm and the abstraction level as
determined by the synthesis algorithm.

for optimization that ""couples"" the time-varying characteristic of channels
with the requirements of the underlying applications into one consideration. In
particular, the extent to which opportunistic optimization is possible is not
just a function of how fast the channel characteristics vary, but also a
function of the elasticity of the underlying applications for delayed capacity
allocation. (ii) Second, building upon our theoretical framework and results,
we study subcarrier allocation and scheduling in orthogonal frequency division

mechanisms in order to reduce queue oscillations and stabilize the queue
length. These AQM are mostly improvements of the Random Early Detection (RED)
model. Unfortunately, these enhancements do not react in a similar manner for
various network conditions and are strongly sensitive to their initial setting
parameters. Although this paper proposes a solution to overcome the
difficulties of setting these parameters by using a Kohonen neural network
model, another goal of this study is to investigate whether cognitive
intelligence could be placed in the core network to solve such stability
problem. In our context, we use results from the neural network area to
demonstrate that our proposal, named Kohonen-RED (KRED), enables a stable queue
length without complex parameters setting and passive measurements.

  Multi-carrier Networks",,,,,"cs.NA cs.CE cs.NI cs.PF",,"  Multiuser resource allocation has recently been recognized as an effective
methodology for enhancing the power and spectrum efficiency in OFDM (orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing) systems. It is, however, not directly
applicable to current packet-switched networks, because (i) most existing
packet-scheduling schemes are based on a single-server model and do not serve
multiple users at the same time; and (ii) the conventional separate design of
MAC (medium access control) packet scheduling and PHY (physical) resource
allocation yields inefficient resource utilization. In this paper, we propose a
cross-layer resource allocation algorithm based on a novel multi-server
scheduling framework to achieve overall high system power efficiency in
packet-switched OFDM networks. Our contribution is four fold: (i) we propose
and analyze a MPGPS (multi-server packetized general processor sharing) service
discipline that serves multiple users at the same time and facilitates
multiuser resource allocation; (ii) we present a MPGPS-based joint MAC-PHY
resource allocation scheme that incorporates packet scheduling, subcarrier
allocation, and power allocation in an integrated framework; (iii) by
investigating the fundamental tradeoff between multiuser-diversity and queueing
performance, we present an A-MPGPS (adaptive MPGPS) service discipline that
strikes balance between power efficiency and queueing performance; and (iv) we
extend MPGPS to an O-MPGPS (opportunistic MPGPS) service discipline to further
enhance the resource utilization efficiency.

independent of the fifth coordinate authorizes the extra dimension to be either
spacelike or timelike. As a consequence of this, the time coordinate and the
extra coordinate are interchangeable, which in turn allows the conception of
different scenarios in 4D from a single solution in 5D. In this paper, we make
a thorough investigation of all possible 4D scenarios, associated with this
interchange, for the well-known Kramer-Gross-Perry-Davidson-Owen set of
solutions. We show that there are {\it three} families of solutions with very
distinct geometrical and physical properties. They correspond to different sets
of values of the parameters which characterize the solutions in 5D. The
solutions of physical interest are identified on the basis of physical
requirements on the induced-matter in 4D. We find that only one family
satisfies these requirements; the other two violate the positivity of
mass-energy density. The ""physical"" solutions possess a lightlike singularity
which coincides with the horizon. The Schwarzschild black string solution as
well as the zero moment dipole solution of Gross and Perry are obtained in
different limits. These are analyzed in the context of Lake's geometrical
approach. We demonstrate that the parameters of the solutions in 5D are not
free, as previously considered. Instead, they are totally determined by
measurements in 4D. Namely, by the surface gravitational potential of the
astrophysical phenomena, like the Sun or other stars, modeled in Kaluza-Klein
theory. This is an important result which may help in observations for an
experimental/observational test of the theory.

the tunneling effect of the H.S Dilaton black hole. We investigate the behavior

emission rate at the event horizon. Our result shows that their emission rates
are also consistent with the unitary theory. Moreover, comparing with the case

of the kind of particles. And it is probably caused by the underlying

invariant series for the strong-deflection bending angle that extends beyond
the standard logarithmic deflection term used in the literature. In the
process, we discovered an improvement to the standard logarithmic deflection
term. Our perturbation framework is also used to derive as a consistency check,
the recently found weak deflection bending angle series. We also reformulate
the latter series in terms of a more natural invariant perturbation parameter,
one that smoothly transitions between the weak and strong deflection series. We
then compare our invariant strong deflection bending-angle series with the
numerically integrated exact formal bending angle expression, and find less
than 1% discrepancy for light rays as far out as twice the critical impact

Since the properties of constituent gluons are still a matter of research, we
allow for them to be either massless, or massive with a mass around 0.7 GeV.
Both pictures are actually used in the literature. When the gluons are
massless, the corresponding local potential is shown to be compatible with a
Cornell form, that is a linear confinement plus a short-range Coulomb part,
with standard values for the flux tube energy density and for the strong
coupling constant. When the gluons are massive, the confining potential is a
saturating one, commonly used to simulate string-breaking effects. These
results fill a gap between lattice QCD and phenomenological models: The picture
of the scalar glueball as a bound state of two constituent gluons interacting
via a phenomenological potential is shown to emerge from pure gauge lattice QCD
computations. Moreover, we show that the allowed potential shape is constrained
by the mass of the constituent gluons.

sources may have unique observational consequences. In particular, the decay of
secondary mesons created in the interaction of energetic protons with photons
or nucleons gives rise to high-energy gamma rays and neutrinos with potentially
observable fluxes. Recently, there has been considerable interest in the
parameterization of the energy spectra of these secondaries. Less attention has
been paid to the angular distributions, which may have an important effect on
observational quantities and are required to address collisions between protons
with different energies and an arbitrary scattering angle. In this work, we
study the complete particle distributions of secondary mesons created in
proton-proton collisions. We present parameterizations of the energy and
rapidity distributions of secondary pions and kaons that reproduce results
generated with the event generator PYTHIA to within ~10% in the bulk of the
parameter space. The parameterizations are based on incident proton energies
from 1 TeV to 1 PeV and are suited for extrapolation to higher energies. We
present several applications of these parameterizations. Energy spectra and
angular distributions of stable decay products (electrons, neutrinos and gamma
rays) follow readily. We give an example of the gamma-ray spectrum that results
from the decay of pi0 mesons created in a proton-proton collision. We show that
there is a strong correlation between the energy of secondary mesons and the
degree of collimation around the direction of the colliding protons. This
effect may have important implications for the detection possibility of
neutrinos created in the interaction of a developing GRB with its surroundings.

associated to the graviton zero mode, the radion, and the longitudinal

model, for negative and positive brane tension respectively. In our models, we
find that the two kinds of DGP ghosts are tightly correlated with each other,

a promising laboratory for understanding the origins and physical meaning of
braneworld ghosts, and perhaps for eliminating them altogether.

NC spacetime should be a theory of gravity. In particular, we show that NC
electromagnetism is realized through the Darboux theorem as a diffeomorphism
symmetry G which is spontaneously broken to symplectomorphism H due to a
background symplectic two-form $B_{\mu\nu}=(1/\theta)_{\mu\nu}$, giving rise to
NC spacetime. This leads to a natural speculation that the emergent gravity
from NC electromagnetism corresponds to a nonlinear realization G/H of the
diffeomorphism group, more generally its NC deformation. We also find some
evidences that the emergent gravity contains the structure of generalized
complex geometry and NC gravity. To illuminate the emergent gravity, we
illustrate how self-dual NC electromagnetism nicely fits with the twistor space
describing curved self-dual spacetime. We also discuss derivative corrections
of Seiberg-Witten map which give rise to higher order gravity.

trade playing a central role as one of the elemental channels of interaction

distribution at different moments in time to discover a sudden transition circa
1960 from a regime where the distribution was always represented by a steady
characteristic function to a new state where the distribution dilates as time
goes on. This suggests that the rule that was governing the statistical
behavior of bilateral trade imbalances until the 60's abruptly changed to a new
form persistent in the last decades. In the new regime, the figures for the
different years collapse into a universal master curve when rescaled by the
corresponding global gross domestic product value. This coupling points to an
increased interdependence of world economies and its onset corresponds in time
with the starting of the last globalization wave.

problem is related to the phenomenon of irreversibility which is known not to
follow from any fundamental theory; e.g., the law of exponential decay does not
follow from the Schr\""odinger equation in senso stricto. The approximations
that lead to irreversibility are related to some form of ''forgetting'', or
coarse graining. Some approaches to the question, why these approximations can
be justified, are reviewed. The paper also discusses dynamical reduction
schemes and it is suggested, that the corresponding non-linear modifications of
the Schr\""odinger equation -- which lead to non-conservation of energy -- are
actually ''effective'' Schr\""odinger equations for open systems (in analogy
with the ''effective'' Lagrangians in QFT). Thus these modifications should be

competing secreted antibodies. Within the tested mechanisms, only clonal
competition for T cell help or a refractory time for the interaction of
centrocytes with follicular dendritic cells are found to enable affinity
maturation while generating the experimentally observed germinal center
characteristics and tolerating large variations in the initial antigen density.

  Biol",,,,"q-bio.GN",,"  Despite tremendous advances in the field of genomics, the amount and function
of the large non-coding part of the genome in higher organisms remains poorly
understood. Here we report an observation, made for 37 fully sequenced
eukaryotic genomes, which indicates that eukaryotes require a certain minimum
amount of non-coding DNA (ncDNA). This minimum increases quadratically with the
amount of DNA located in exons. Based on a simple model of the growth of
regulatory networks, we derive a theoretical prediction of the required
quantity of ncDNA and find it to be in excellent agreement with the data. The
amount of additional ncDNA (in basepairs) which eukaryotes require obeys Ndef =
1/2 (Nc / Np) (Nc - Np), where Nc is the amount of exonic DNA, and Np is a
constant of about 10Mb. This value Ndef corresponds to a few percent of the
genome in Homo sapiens and other mammals, and up to half the genome in simpler
eukaryotes. Thus our findings confirm that eukaryotic life depends on a
substantial fraction of ncDNA and also make a prediction of the size of this
fraction, which matches the data closely.

several cryptographic protocols have been proposed and experimentally
implemented using bosonic modes with Gaussian statistics. Such protocols have
shown the possibility of reaching very high secret-key rates, even in the
presence of strong losses in the quantum communication channel. Despite this
robustness to loss, their security can be affected by more general attacks
where extra Gaussian noise is introduced by the eavesdropper. In this general
scenario we show a ""hardware solution"" for enhancing the security thresholds of
these protocols. This is possible by extending them to a two-way quantum
communication where subsequent uses of the quantum channel are suitably
combined. In the resulting two-way schemes, one of the honest parties assists
the secret encoding of the other with the chance of a non-trivial superadditive
enhancement of the security thresholds. Such results enable the extension of
quantum cryptography to more complex quantum communications.

change, in which two input states with different amounts of entanglement
undergoes a local decoherence and the state with the larger entanglement

We are also interested in a special case where the state with the larger
entanglement evolves to a separable state while the other output state is still
entangled, which we call selective entanglement breaking. For three-level or
larger systems, it is easy to find examples of the state ordering change and
the selective entanglement breaking, but for two-level systems it is not
trivial whether such situations exist. We present a new strategy to construct
examples of two-qubit states exhibiting the selective entanglement breaking
regardless of entanglement measure. We also give a more striking example of the
selective entanglement breaking in which the less entangled input state has
only an infinitesimal amount of entanglement.

picture; here we extend these definitions to the Heisenberg and interaction
pictures. We show that in order to avoid consistency problems, the full time
derivatives in the definitions for heat flux and power (work flux) should be
replaced by partial time derivatives. We also present an alternative approach
to the partitioning of the energy flux which differs from that of Alicki in
that the instantaneous interaction energy with the external field is not
included directly. We then proceed to generalize Alicki's definition of power
by replacing the original system and its external driving field with a larger,
bipartite system, governed by a time-independent Hamiltonian. Using the
definition of heat flux and the generalized definition of power, we derive the
first law of thermodynamics in differential form, both for the full bipartite
system and the partially traced subsystems. Although the second law (Clausius
formulation) is satisfied for the full bipartite system, we find that in
general there is no rigorous formulation of the second law for the partially
traced subsystem unless certain additional requirements are met. Once these
requirements are satisfied, however, both the Carnot and the Clausius
formulations of the second law are satisfied. We illustrate this thermodynamic
analysis on both the simple Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM) and an extended
dissipative Jaynes-Cummings model (ED-JCM), which is a model for a quantum

Amplification of the selected cavity mode occurs even in this simple model, as
seen by a positive steady state power. However, initial field coherence is
lost, as seen by the decaying off-diagonal field density matrix elements, and
by the Husimi-Kano Q function. We show that after an initial transient time the
field's entropy rises linearly during the operation of the engine, which we
attribute to the dissipative nature of the evolution and not to matter-field
entanglement. We show that the second law of thermodynamics is satisfied in two
formulations (Clausius, Carnot) and that the efficiency of the ED-JCM heat
engine agrees with that defined intuitively by Scovil and Schulz-DuBois.
