is accompanied by an exceptionally luminous afterglow that had a V-band
magnitude <11.1 at 80s after the prompt emission. From the start of the Swift
observations the afterglow decayed as a power law with a slope of
\alpha_X=1.66+/-0.01 in the X-ray and \alpha_{opt}=1.64+/-0.01 in the
UV/optical, up to the point that it was no longer detected above background in
the optical or X-ray bands. The brightness of this GRB and the similarity in
the decay rate of the X-ray, optical and gamma-ray emission from 100s after the
trigger distinguish this burst from others and present a challenge to the
fireball model. The lack of a cooling or jet break in the afterglow up to
\~10^5s constrains any model that can produce the large luminosity observed in
GRB061007, which we found to require either an excessively large kinetic energy
or highly collimated outflow. Analysis of the multi-wavelength spectral and
high-resolution temporal data taken with Swift suggest an early time jet-break
to be a more plausible scenario. This must have occurred within 80s of the
prompt emission, which places an upper limit on the jet opening angle of
\theta_j=0.8deg. Such a highly collimated outflow resolves the energy budget
problem presented in a spherical emission model, reducing the isotropic
equivalent energy of this burst to E_{\gamma}^{corr}=10^{50} ergs; consistent
with other GRBs.

reflection component into the observed Chandra band, and/or redshifting of a
soft excess out of the observed Chandra band. Using the results for Gamma_X, we
show that the alpha_{ox}-z relationship is unlikely to be a spurious result

filters allows not only the selection of these objects, but also to infer the
line flux and the equivalent width of the emission line with some assumptions.
The narrow-band filter technique provides homogeneous samples of galaxies in
small comoving volumes in the sky. We present an analysis of the selection of
emission-line galaxies using narrow-band filters. Different methods of
observation are considered: broad-band -- narrow-band filters and two
broad-band and one narrow-band filters.
  We study also the effect of several lines entering simultaneously inside the
filters (this is the case of Halpha). In each case the equations to obtain the
equivalent width and line flux from the photometry are obtained. Candidates to
emission-line objects are selected by their color excess in a magnitude-color
diagram. For different narrow-band filters, we compute the mean colors of stars
and galaxies, showing that, apart from galaxies, some types of stars could be
selected with certain filter sets. We show how to compute the standard
deviation of the colors of the objects even in the usual case when there are
not enough objects to determine the standard deviation from the data. We
present also helpful equations to compute the narrow-band and the broad-band
exposure times in order to obtain minimum dispersion in the ratio of fluxes of
both bands with minimum total exposure time.

be faint, slow rotators with high star formation efficiency, compared with the

also contribute to the generation of LGRBs from low metallicity progenitors

increases for all systems with look-back time. Under the hypothesis of our LGRB
model, our results support the claim that LGRBs could be unbiased tracers of

the cosmic dark ages are generated by irregularities in the gas-density
distribution and can then be used to determine the statistical properties of
density fluctuations in the early Universe. We first derive the most general
expansion of brightness-temperature fluctuations up to second order in terms of
all the possible sources of spatial fluctuations. We then focus on the
three-point statistics and compute the angular bispectrum of
brightness-temperature fluctuations generated prior to the epoch of hydrogen
reionization. For simplicity, we neglect redshift-space distortions. We find
that low-frequency radio experiments with arcmin angular resolution can easily
detect non-Gaussianity produced by non-linear gravity with high signal-to-noise
ratio. The bispectrum thus provides a unique test of the gravitational
instability scenario for structure formation, and can be used to measure the
cosmological parameters. Detecting the signature of primordial non-Gaussianity
produced during or right after an inflationary period is more challenging but
still possible. An ideal experiment limited by cosmic variance only and with an
angular resolution of a few arcsec has the potential to detect primordial
non-Gaussianity with a non-linearity parameter of f_NL ~ 1. Additional sources
of error as weak lensing and an imperfect foreground subtraction could severely
hamper the detection of primordial non-Gaussianity which will benefit from the
use of optimal estimators combined with tomographic techniques.

spectrum also shows both emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
and absorption at 13.7 micron from C2H2, a juxtaposition seen in only two other
sources, AFGL 2688 and IRAS 13416-6243, both post-asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
objects. As in these sources, the PAH spectrum has the unusual trait that the
peak emission in the 7-9 micron complex lies beyond 8.0 micron. In addition,
the 8.6 micron feature has an intensity as strong as the C-C modes which
normally peak between 7.7 and 7.9 micron. The relative flux of the feature at
11.3 micron to that at 8 micron suggests that the PAHs in MSX SMC 029 either
have a low ionization fraction or are largely unprocessed. The 13-16 micron
wavelength region shows strong absorption features similar to those observed in
the post-AGB objects AFGL 618 and SMP LMC 11. This broad absorption may arise
from the same molecules which have been identified in those sources: C2H2,

currently fragmentary, clue to the nature of their progenitors. Here we present
optical observations of nine short GRBs obtained with Gemini, Magellan, and the

bursts, and host galaxies for two additional bursts with known optical
afterglow positions, and five with X-ray positions (<6'' radius). In eight of
the nine cases we find that the most probable host galaxies are faint,
R~23-26.5 mag, and are therefore starkly different from the first few short GRB
hosts with R~17-22 mag and z<0.5. Indeed, we measure spectroscopic redshifts of
z~0.4-1.1 for the four brightest hosts. A comparison to large field galaxy
samples, as well as the hosts of long GRBs and previous short GRBs, indicates
that the fainter hosts likely reside at z>1. Our most conservative limit is
that at least half of the five hosts without a known redshift reside at z>0.7
(97% confidence level), suggesting that about 1/3-2/3 of all short GRBs
originate at higher redshifts than previously determined. This has two
important implications: (i) We constrain the acceptable age distributions to a
wide lognormal (sigma>1) with tau~4-8 Gyr, or to a power law, P(tau)~tau^n,
with -1<n<0; and (ii) the inferred isotropic energies,

matter gravitational potential in such a precise way, leaving no ""messy""
fingerprints of the merging events and ""gastrophysical"" feedbacks expected in
the history of a galaxy in a concordance Universe. This correlation of gravity
with baryonic mass can be interpreted from several non-standard angles,
especially as a modification of gravity called TeVeS, in which no galactic dark
matter is needed. In this theory, the baryon-gravity relation is captured by
the dieletric-like function mu of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND),
controlling the transition from 1/r^2 attraction in the strong gravity regime
to 1/r attraction in the weak regime. Here, we study this mu-function in
detail. We investigate the observational constraints upon it from fitting
galaxy rotation curves, unveiling the degeneracy between the stellar
mass-to-light ratio and the mu-function as well as the importance of the
sharpness of transition from the strong to weak gravity regimes. We also
numerically address the effects of non-spherical baryon geometry in the
framework of non-linear TeVeS, and exhaustively examine how the mu-function
connects with the free function of that theory. In that regard, we exhibit the
subtle effects and wide implications of renormalizing the gravitational
constant. We finally present a discontinuity-free transition between
quasi-static galaxies and the evolving Universe for the free function of TeVeS,
inevitably leading to a return to 1/r^2 attraction at very low accelerations in

model of the Milky Way and computing its lensing properties. The model is
composed of a spherical Hernquist bulge, a Miyamoto-Nagai disc and an
isothermal halo. As a strong lens, a spiral galaxy like the Milky Way can give
rise to four different imaging geometries. They are (i) three images on one
side of the galaxy centre (`disc triplets'), (ii) three images with one close
to the centre (`core triplets'), (iii) five images and (iv) seven images.
Neglecting magnification bias, we show that the core triplets, disc triplets
and fivefold imaging are roughly equally likely. Even though our models contain
edge-on discs, their image multiplicities are not dominated by disc triplets.
The halo has a small effect on the caustic structure, the time delays and
brightnesses of the images. The Milky Way model has a maximum disc (i.e., the
halo is not dynamically important in the inner parts). Strong lensing by nearly
edge-on disc galaxies breaks the degeneracy between the relative contribution
of the disc and halo to the overall rotation curve. If a spiral galaxy has a

cooling. As the most significant heating mechanism at work closest to the AGN,
shock heating probably plays a critical role in the feedback mechanism. Third,
results are presented from a survey of AGN heating rates in nearby giant

intermittent AGN outbursts are energetically capable of preventing the hot

gravitational lens system, which we have dubbed the ""8 o'clock arc"" due to its

Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4 (SDSS DR4); followup observations on the
Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) 3.5m telescope at Apache Point
Observatory confirmed the lensing nature of this system and led to the
identification of the arc's spectrum as that of an LBG. The arc has a spectrum
and a redshift remarkably similar to those of the previous record-holder for
brightest LBG (MS 1512-cB58, a.k.a ""cB58""), but, with an estimated total
magnitude of (g,r,i) = (20.0,19.2,19.0) and surface brightness of
(mu_g,mu_r,mu_i) = (23.3, 22.5, 22.3) mag/arcsec^2, the 8 o'clock arc is thrice
as bright. The 8 o'clock arc, which consists of three lensed images of the LBG,
is 162deg (9.6arcsec) long and has a length-to-width ratio of 6:1. A fourth
image of the LBG -- a counter-image -- can also be identified in the ARC 3.5m
g-band images. A simple lens model for the system assuming a singular
isothermal ellipsoid potential yields an Einstein radius of 2.91+/-0.14 arcsec,
a total mass for the lensing LRG (within the (10.6+/-0.5)/h kpc enclosed by the
lensed images) of 1.04x10^12/h Msun, and a magnification factor for the LBG of
12.3(+15/-3.6). The LBG itself is intrinsically quite luminous (approximately

that the two coherent motions produced by 1) the Keplerian motion and 2)
star-disk collisions, numerous in the inner region of AGN accretion disks, are
both basic to the formation of a robust, coherent dynamo and consequently the
generation of large scale magnetic fields. They are frequent enough to account
for an integrated dynamo gain, e^{10^{9}} at 100 gravitational radii of a
central black hole, many orders of magnitude greater than required to amplify
any seed field no matter how small. The existence of extra-galactic, coherent,
large scale magnetic fields whose energies greatly exceed all but massive black
hole energies is recognized. In paper II (Pariev, Colgate, and Finn 2006) we
argue that in order to produce a dynamo that can access the free energy of
black hole formation and produce all the magnetic flux in a coherent fashion
the existence of these two coherent motions in a conducting fluid is required.
The differential winding of Keplerian motion is obvious, but the disk structure
depends upon the model of ""alpha"", the transport coefficient of angular
momentum chosen. The counter rotation of driven plumes in a rotating frame is
less well known, but fortunately the magnetic effect is independent of the disk
model. Both motions are discussed in this paper, paper I. The description of
the two motions are preliminary to two theoretical derivations and one

by first addressing the physics relevant to strongly-magnetized plasmas and
calculating the equation of state and polarization-dependent opacities. We then
obtain the atmosphere structure and spectrum by solving the radiative transfer
equations in hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium. In contrast to hydrogen
opacities at the relevant temperatures, mid-Z element opacities are dominated
by numerous bound-bound and bound-free transitions. Consequently, temperature
profiles are closer to grey profiles, and photosphere densities are lower than
in the hydrogen case. Mid-Z element atmosphere spectra are significantly softer
than hydrogen atmosphere spectra and show numerous absorption lines and edges.
The atmosphere spectra depend strongly on surface composition and magnetic
field but weakly on surface gravity. Absorption lines are primarily broadened
by motional Stark effects and the (unknown) surface magnetic field
distribution. Given the multiple absorption features observed from several
isolated neutron stars, it is possible to determine, with existing X-ray data,
the surface composition, magnetic field, temperature, and gravitational
redshift; we present qualitative comparisons between our model spectra and the

showing that none of the X-ray afterglow lightcurves in our sample satisfies
the relation between the spectral and temporal indices that is predicted for

tight empirical relation between the peak energy of the spectrum and the
collimation-corrected energy of the prompt emission (the Ghirlanda relation).
We find that there are no temporal breaks within the predicted time intervals

a bond-charge extended Hubbard model exactly solvable in one dimension which
displays various QPTs, with two (qubit) as well as more (qudit) on-site degrees
of freedom involved. The analysis is carried out by means of appropriate
measures of bipartite/multipartite quantum correlations. It is found that all
transitions ascribed to two-point correlations are characterized by an
entanglement range which diverges at the transition points. The exponent
coincides with that of the correlation length at the transitions. We introduce
the correlation ratio, namely, the ratio of quantum mutual information and
single-site entanglement. We show that at T=0, it captures the relative role of
two-point and multipartite quantum correlations at transition points,
generalizing to qudit systems the entanglement ratio. Moreover, a finite value
of quantum mutual information between infinitely distant sites is seen to
quantify the presence of off-diagonal long-range order induced by multipartite
entanglement.

There is a critical thickness decreasing with the force constant. Thinner

relaxation upon clustering particularly under tensile stress. At sufficiently
large misfits the barrier for 2D multilayer nucleation is significantly smaller
than the barrier for subsequent single-layer nucleation. The effects are found

structural relaxation occurs mostly along a very small number of

significantly lowered as the system undergoes the glass transition. This
observation supports that structural relaxation and marginal modes share common
properties. In particular theoretical results [2, 3] show that these modes
extend at least on some length scale $l^*\sim (\phi_c-\phi)^{-1/2}$ where
$\phi_c$ corresponds to the maximum packing fraction, i.e. the jamming

proportional to the square of the gauge coupling constant. In the topologically
massive electrodynamics the field strength locally determines the gauge
potential up to a closed 1-form via the (anti-)self-duality equation. We
introduce a transformation of the gauge potential using the dual field strength
which can be identified with an abelian gauge transformation. Then we present
the map from the AdS space to the pseudo-sphere including the topological mass.
This is the lorentzian analog of the Hopf map. This map yields a global
decomposition of the AdS space as a trivial circle bundle over the upper
portion of the pseudo-sphere which is the Hyperboloid model for the Lobachevski
geometry. This leads to a reduction of the abelian field equation onto the

systems, we consider the problem checking whether all convex combinations of k
matrices in R^{n x n} are stable. In particular, we are interested whether
there exist algorithms which can solve this problem in time polynomial in n and
k. We show that if $k= \lceil n^d \rceil$ for any fixed real d>0, then the
problem is NP-hard, meaning that no polynomial-time algorithm in n exists
provided that P is not NP, a widely believed conjecture in computer science. On
the other hand, when k is a constant independent of n, then it is known that
the problem may be solved in polynomial time in n. Using these results and the
method of measurable switching rules, we prove our main statement: verifying
the absolute asymptotic stability of a continuous-time switched linear system
with more than n^d matrices A_i in R^{n x n} satisfying 0 >= A_i + A_i^{T} is
NP-hard.

both at the macroscopic and pore scales in a transparent array of capillary
channels using an optical technique allowing for simultaneous local and global
concentration mappings. Two solutions of different polymer concentrations (500
and 1000 ppm) have been used at different P\'eclet numbers. At the macroscopic
scale, the displacement front displays a diffusive spreading: for $Pe \leq 10$,
the dispersivity $l\_d$ is constant with $Pe$ and increases with the polymer
concentration; for $Pe > 10$, $l\_d$ increases as $Pe^{1.35}$ and is similar
for the two concentrations. At the local scale, a time lag between the
saturations of channels parallel and perpendicular to the mean flow has been
observed and studied as a function of the flow rate. These local measurements
suggest that the change of dispersion regime is related to variations of the
degree of mixing at the junctions. For $Pe \leq 10$, complete mixing leads to
pure geometrical dispersion enhanced for shear thinning fluids; for $Pe >10$
weaker mixing results in higher correlation lengths along flow paths parallel
to the mean flow and in a combination of geometrical and Taylor dispersion.

They retain three power law relationships, such as the power laws of degree
distribution, clustering spectrum, and degree-degree correlation corresponding
to scale-free connectivity, hierarchical modularity, and disassortativity,
respectively. After making comparisons of these properties between model
networks and biological networks, we confirmed that our model has inference
potential for evolutionary processes of biological networks.

Riemann surface, and show how the Fermi's Golden Rule, valid in perturbative
regime for not to large time, appears in this context. The knowledge of
analytic structure of the GF in frequency representation opens opportunities
for obtaining formulas for the GF in time representation alternative to the
standard one using the spectral density.

speed, low dark count single photon detectors (or low noise homodyne detectors)
are required. However, in practice, a fast detector is usually noisy. Here, we
propose a ""dual detectors"" method to improve the performance of a practical QKD
system with realistic detectors: the legitimate receiver randomly uses either a
fast (but noisy) detector or a quiet (but slow) detector to measure the
incoming quantum signals. The measurement results from the quiet detector can
be used to bound eavesdropper's information, while the measurement results from
the fast detector are used to generate secure key. We apply this idea to
various QKD protocols. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements
in both BB84 protocol with ideal single photon source and Gaussian-modulated
coherent states (GMCS) protocol; while for decoy-state BB84 protocol with weak
coherent source, the improvement is moderate. We also discuss various practical
issues in implementing the ""dual detectors"" scheme.

  the occasion of 70th birthday of Professor Giancarlo Ghirardi",,"10.1088/1751-8113/40/12/S21",,"quant-ph",,"  Three postulates are discussed: first that well-defined properties cannot be
assigned to an isolated system, secondly that quantum unitary evolution is
atemporal, and thirdly that some physical processes are never reversed. It is
argued that these give useful insight into quantum behaviour. The first
postulate emphasizes the fundamental role in physics of interactions and
correlations, as opposed to internal properties of systems. Statements about
physical interactions can only be framed in a context of further interactions.
This undermines the possibility of objectivity in physics. However, quantum
mechanics retains objectivity through the combination of the second and third
postulates. A rule is given for determining the circumstances in which physical
evolution is non-unitary. This rule appeals to the absence of spacetime loops
in the future evolution of a set of interacting systems. A single universe
undergoing non-unitary evolution is a viable interpretation.

machinery of basic group theory, especially that of the group of permutations.
It is done with the purpose to obtain precise definitions of effective distinct
particles, and of the limitations involved. Namely, certain restrictions allow
one to distinguish identical particles in the general case of N of them, and of
J clusters of effectively distinct particles, where N and J are arbitrary
integers (but 1<J<(N+1)). Mutually orthogonal, single-particle distinguishing
projectors (events or ptoperties), J of them, are the backbone of the
construction. The general results are exemplified by local quantum mechanics,
and by the case of nucleons. The former example suits laboratory experiments,
and a critical view of it is presented.
