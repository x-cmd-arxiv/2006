particular, arises automatically in recently considered theories of neutrino
dark energy. If such a field comprises the present dark matter, the matter

of the total dark matter, such acoustic oscillations may imprint themselves in

the optical and ultraviolet properties of TMC members, and to do correlative
studies between the X-ray and OM light curves. In particular, we aim to
determine whether accretion plays a significant role in the optical/ultraviolet
and X-ray emissions. The Neupert effect in stellar flares is also investigated.
Coordinates, average count rates and magnitudes were extracted from OM images,
together with light curves with low time resolution (a few kiloseconds). For a
few sources, OM FAST mode data were also available, and we extracted OM light
curves with high time resolution. The OM data were correlated with Two Micron
All Sky Survey (2MASS) data and with the XEST catalogue in the X-rays. The XEST
OM catalogue contains 2,148 entries of which 1,893 have 2MASS counterparts.
However, only 98 entries have X-ray counterparts, of which 51 of them are known
TMC members and 12 additional are TMC candidates. The OM data indicate that
accreting stars are statistically brighter in the U band than non-accreting
stars after correction for extinction, and have U-band excesses, most likely
due to accretion. The OM emission of accreting stars is variable, probably due
to accretion spots, but it does not correlate with the X-ray light curve,
suggesting that accretion does not contribute significantly to the X-ray
emission of most accreting stars. In some cases, flares were detected in both
X-ray and OM light curves and followed a Neupert effect pattern, in which the
optical/ultraviolet emission precedes the X-ray emission of a flare, whereas
the X-ray flux is proportional to the integral of the optical flux.

  A&A",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Magnetars are a sizable subclass of the neutron star census. Their very high
magnetic field strengths are thought to be a consequence of rapid (millisecond)
rotation at birth in a successful core-collapse supernova. In their first tens
of seconds of existence, magnetars transition from hot, extended
``proto-''magnetars to the cooled and magnetically-dominated objects we
identify $\sim10^4$ years later as Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters (SGRs) and
Anamolous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs). Millisecond proto-magnetar winds during this
cooling phase likewise transition from non-relativistic and thermally-driven to
magneto-centrifugally-driven, and finally to relativistic and Poynting-flux
dominated. Here we review the basic considerations associated with that
transition. In particular, we discuss the spindown of millisecond
proto-magnetars throughout the Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling epoch. Because of their
large reservoir of rotational energy, their association with supernovae, and
the fact that their winds are expected to become highly relativistic in the
seconds after their birth, proto-magnetars have been suggested as the central
engine of long-duration gamma ray bursts. We discuss some of the issues and
outstanding questions in assessing them as such.

membership of Leo I out to 1.3 King tidal radii. By measuring accurate radial
velocities with a median measurement error of 4.6 km/s we find a mean systemic
velocity of 284.2 km/s with a global velocity dispersion of 9.9 km/s. The
dispersion profile is consistent with being flat out to the last data point. We
show that a marginally-significant rise in the radial dispersion profile at a
radius of 3' is not associated with any real localized kinematical
substructure. Given its large distance from the Galaxy, tides are not likely to
have affected the velocity dispersion, a statement we support from a
quantitative kinematical analysis, as we observationally reject the occurrence
of a significant apparent rotational signal or an asymmetric velocity
distribution. Mass determinations adopting both isotropic stellar velocity
dispersions and more general models yield a M/L ratio of 24, which is
consistent with the presence of a significant dark halo with a mass of about
3x10^7 M_sun, in which the luminous component is embedded. This suggests that
Leo I exhibits dark matter properties similar to those of other dSphs in the
Local Group. Our data allowed us also to determine metallicities for 58 of the

7.19e-09 ergs-s$^{-1}$-cm$^{-2}$ in the 3-25 keV energy range and observed
until it decreased by about a factor of 10. The photon index of the power law
component, which is dominant during the entire outburst, decreases from
$\sim$1.76 to 1.6. However, towards the end of the observations the photon
index is found to increase, indicating a softening of the spectra. The presence
of an ultrasoft thermal component, during the bright phases of the burst, is
clear from the fits to the data. The temperature associated with this thermal
component is 0.4 keV. We believe that this thermal component could be due to
the presence of an accretion disk. Assuming a distance of 8.5 kpc,

composition of their ejecta. We consider the impact of uncertainties in the
relevant nuclear reaction rates. Fast rotating stars reach the critical
velocity at the beginning of their evolution and remain near the critical limit
during the rest of the main sequence and part of the He-burning phase. As a
consequence they lose large amounts of material through a mechanical wind which
probably leads to the formation of a slow outflowing disk. The material in this
slow wind is enriched in H-burning products and presents abundance patterns
similar to the chemical anomalies observed in globular cluster stars. In
particular, the C, N, O, Na and Li variations are well reproduced by our model.

anticorrelation. We discuss how the long-lived low-mass stars currently

interesting to get as much information as possible from the measured
lightcurves. From high resolution images we know that the recorded quasar
images are often blends and that the corresponding time series are not pure
shifted replicas of the source variability. In this paper we will develop an
algorithm to unscramble this kind of blended data.
  The proposed method is based on a simple idea. We use one of the photometric
curves, which is supposedly a simple shifted replica of the source curve, to
build different artificial combined curves. Then we compare these artificial
curves with the blended curves. Proper solutions for a full set of time delays
are then obtained by varying free input parameters and estimating statistical
distances between the artificial and blended curves.

For numerically generated data sets the time delay systems were recovered for a
wide range of setups. Application of the new algorithm to the classical double

ultrarelativistic flow with internal dissipation of energy as predicted by the
magnetic reconnection model. Previous study of the radiative transfer in the
photospheric region has shown that gradual dissipation of energy results in a
hot photosphere. There, inverse Compton scattering of the thermal radiation
advected with the flow leads to powerful photospheric emission with spectral
properties close to those of the observed prompt GRB emission. Here, we build
on that study by calculating the spectra for a large range of the
characteristics of the flow. An accurate fitting formula is given that provides
the photospheric spectral energy distribution in the ~10 keV to ~10 MeV energy
range (in the central engine frame) as a function of the basic physical
parameters of the flow. It facilitates the direct comparison of the model
predictions with observations, including the variability properties of the
lightcurves. We verify that the model naturally accounts for the observed
clustering in peak energies of the E*f(E) spectrum. In this model, the Amati
relation indicates a tendency for the most luminous bursts to have more energy
per baryon. If this tendency also holds for individual GRB pulses, the model
predicts the observed narrowing of the width of pulses with increasing photon
energy.

which states that a chain in a polymer melt adopts `ideal' random-walk-like
conformations. Here we revisit theoretically and numerically this pivotal
assumption and demonstrate that there are noticeable deviations from ideality.
The deviations come from the interplay of chain connectivity and the
incompressibility of the melt, leading to an effective repulsion between chain
segments of all sizes $s$. The amplitude of this repulsion increases with
decreasing $s$ where chain segments become more and more swollen. We illustrate
this swelling by an analysis of the form factor $F(q)$, i.e. the scattered
intensity at wavevector $q$ resulting from intramolecular interferences of a
chain. A `Kratky plot' of $q^2F(q)$ {\em vs.} $q$ does not exhibit the plateau
for intermediate wavevectors characteristic of ideal chains. One rather finds a
conspicuous depression of the plateau, $\delta(F^{-1}(q)) = |q|^3/32\rho$,
which increases with $q$ and only depends on the monomer density $\rho$.

boundary conditions (b.c.) on infinite parallel plates is revisited in the
local quantum field theory (lqft) framework introduced by B.Kay. The model
displays a number of more realistic features than the ones he treated. In
addition to local observables, as the energy density, we propose to consider
intensive variables, such as the energy per unit area $\epsilon$, as
fundamental observables. Adopting this view, lqft rejects Dirichlet (the same
result may be proved for Neumann or mixed) b.c., and accepts periodic b.c.: in
the former case $\epsilon$ diverges, in the latter it is finite, as is shown by
an expression for the local energy density obtained from lqft through the use
of the Poisson summation formula. Another way to see this uses methods from the
Euler summation formula: in the proof of regularization independence of the
energy per unit area, a regularization-dependent surface term arises upon use
of Dirichlet b.c. but not periodic b.c.. For the conformally invariant scalar
quantum field, this surface term is absent, due to the condition of zero trace
of the energy momentum tensor, as remarked by B.De Witt. The latter property
does not hold in tha application to the dark energy problem in Cosmology, in
which we argue that periodic b.c. might play a distinguished role.

exactly N nodal intervals by zeros of its N-th eigenfunction. Courant showed
that one half of Sturm's theorem for the strings applies to the theory of
membranes: N-th eigenfunction cannot have more than N domains. He also gave an
example of a eigenfunction high in the spectrum with a minimal number of nodal
domains, thus excluding the existence of a non-trivial lower bound. An analogue
of Sturm's result for discretizations of the interval was discussed by
Gantmacher and Krein. The discretization of an interval is a graph of a simple
form, a chain-graph. But what can be said about more complicated graphs? It has
been known since the early 90s that the nodal count for a generic eigenfunction
of the Schrodinger operator on quantum trees (where each edge is identified
with an interval of the real line and some matching conditions are enforced on
the vertices) is exact too: zeros of the N-th eigenfunction divide the tree
into exactly N subtrees. We discuss two extensions of this result in two
directions. One deals with the same continuous Schrodinger operator but on
general graphs (i.e. non-trees) and another deals with discrete Schrodinger
operator on combinatorial graphs (both trees and non-trees). The result that we
derive applies to both types of graphs: the number of nodal domains of the N-th
eigenfunction is bounded below by N-L, where L is the number of links that
distinguish the graph from a tree (defined as the dimension of the cycle space
or the rank of the fundamental group of the graph). We also show that if it the
genericity condition is dropped, the nodal count can fall arbitrarily far below
the number of the corresponding eigenfunction.

constructing a continuous path between representation matrices where one end of
the path is the mentioned direct sum; another end is the classical form of

dense; (2) if an operator is a norm limit of divisible operators, it is
actually a norm limit of unitary conjugates of a single divisible operator.
  This is related to our ongoing work on unitary orbits by the following
theorem, which is new even for B(ell^2): if an element of a von Neumann algebra

holds by comparing two estimators of the limiting extreme value distribution,
one obtained from the tail copula process and the other obtained by first
estimating the spectral measure which is then used as a building block for the
limiting extreme value distribution. We derive the limiting distribution of the
test statistic from the aforementioned weighted approximation. This limiting
distribution contains unknown functional parameters. Therefore, we show that a

have this property. To get practically attractive designs, we suggest the
following strategy. One part of the design points is used to allow one to carry
out a lack of fit test with good power for practically interesting
alternatives. The rest of the design points are determined in such a way that
the whole design is optimal for inference on the unknown parameter in case the
lack of fit test does not reject the linear regression model. To solve this

introducing cell-cell interaction based on the well known statistical model

can simulate movement of cell in a simple and correct physical way. These
characters of CPM and LGCA have been combined in a reaction-diffusion frame to
simulate the dynamic of avascular cancer growth on a more physical basis.The
cellular automaton is evolved on a square lattice on which in the diffusion
step tumor cells (C) and necrotic cells (N) propagate in two dimensions and in
the reaction step every cell can proliferate, be quiescent or die due to the
apoptosis and the necrosis depending on its environment. The transition
probabilities in the reaction step have been calculated by the Glauber
algorithm and depend on the KCC, KNC, and KNN (cancer-cancer, necrotic-cancer,
and necrotic-necrotic couplings respectively). It is shown the main feature of
the cancer growth depends on the choice of magnitude of couplings and the
advantage of this method compared to other methods is due to the fact that it
needs only three parameters KCC, KNC and KNN which are based on the well known
physical ground i.e. the Potts model.

quantum states. We first present reduction theorems for optimal unambiguous
discrimination of two generic density matrices. We show that this problem can
be reduced to that of two density matrices that have the same rank $r$ in a
2$r$-dimensional Hilbert space. These reduction theorems also allow us to
reduce USD problems to simpler ones for which the solution might be known. As
an application, we consider the unambiguous comparison of $n$ linearly
independent pure states with a simple symmetry. Moreover, lower bounds on the
optimal failure probability have been derived. For two mixed states they are
given in terms of the fidelity. Here we give tighter bounds as well as
necessary and sufficient conditions for two mixed states to reach these bounds.
We also construct the corresponding optimal measurement. With this result, we
provide analytical solutions for unambiguously discriminating a class of
generic mixed states. This goes beyond known results which are all reducible to
some pure state case. We however show that examples exist where the bounds
cannot be reached. Next, we derive properties on the rank and the spectrum of
an optimal USD measurement. This finally leads to a second class of exact
solutions. Indeed we present the optimal failure probability as well as the
optimal measurement for unambiguously discriminating any pair of geometrically
uniform mixed states in four dimensions. This class of problems includes for
example the discrimination of both the basis and the bit value mixed states in
the BB84 QKD protocol with coherent states.
