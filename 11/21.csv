electromagnetic processes or the hadronic process of pion production, followed
by decay. We investigate astrophysical contexts where a third process (A*) may
dominate, namely the photo-disintegration of highly boosted nuclei followed by
daughter de-excitation. Starbust regions such as Cygnus OB2 appear to be
promising sites for TeV gamma-ray emission via this mechanism. A unique feature
of the A* process is a sharp energy minimum ~ 10 TeV/(T/eV) for gamma-ray
emission from a thermal region of temperature T. We also check that a diffuse
gamma-ray component resulting from the interaction of a possible extreme-energy
cosmic-ray nuclei with background radiation is well below the observed EGRET
data. The A* mechanism described herein offers an important contribution to
gamma-ray astronomy in the era of intense observational activity.

result can be explained by a physical scenario for AGN accretion evolution: AGN
activity is initially triggered by galaxy merging, leading to a high accretion
rate and an optically dominant phase (via thin disk accretion). As the
accretion rate drops in time, the AGN gradually enters an X-ray dominant
low-accretion phase (via a radiative inefficient accretion flow). In this
picture, optical- and X-ray-selected AGN are the same population of
supermassive black holes observed at different epochs. Within the context of
this scenario, the majority of AGN in poor groups are in the high-accretion
optically dominant phase, while the AGN population in rich clusters is mostly
in the low-accretion X-ray dominant phase.

provide mass ratios and ultimately masses, independent of assumptions, needed

Three other sub-arcsecond visual binaries were also serendipitously identified

up to 0.2--0.25 dex for Kr. To reduce the uncertainties in the Kr ionization
balance stemming from the approximate atomic data, we have modeled ten bright
PNe in our sample, selected because they exhibit emission lines from multiple
Kr ions in their optical and near-infrared spectra. We have empirically
adjusted the uncertain Kr atomic data until the observed line intensities of
the various Kr ions are adequately reproduced by our models. Using the adjusted

difference is observed among the globular clusters associated with the Milky

basis of their observed colors, appear to be super metal-poor. It is speculated
that many of these apparently faint and metal-poor clusters in NGC 5128 are

found that large clusters with FWHM > 10 pc are typically less luminous in NGC

structure of thousands of COSMOS galaxies, we present ZEST, the Zurich
Estimator of Structural Types. To classify galaxy structure, ZEST uses: (i)
Five non-parametric diagnostics: asymmetry, concentration, Gini coefficient,
2nd-order moment of the brightest 20% of galaxy pixels, and ellipticity; and
(ii) The exponent n of single--Sersic fits to the 2D surface brightness
distributions. To fully exploit the wealth of information while reducing the
redundancy present in these diagnostics, ZEST performs a principal component
(PC) Analysis. We use a sample of ~56,000 I<24 COSMOS galaxies to show that the
first three PCs fully describe the key aspects of the galaxy structure, i.e.,
to calibrate a three-dimensional classification grid of axis PC_1, PC_2, and
PC_3. We demonstrate the robustness of the ZEST grid on the z=0 sample of Frei
et al. (1996). The ZEST classification breaks most of the degeneracy between
different galaxy populations that affects morphological classifications based
on only some of the diagnostics included in ZEST. As a first application, we
present the evolution since z~1 of the Luminosity Functions of COSMOS galaxies
of early, disk and irregular galaxies and, for disk galaxies, of different
bulge-to-disk ratios. Overall, we find that the LF up to a redshift z=1 is
consistent with a pure-luminosity evolution (of about 0.95 magnitudes at z
\~0.7). We highlight however two trends, that are in general agreement with a
down-sizing scenario for galaxy formation: (1.) A deficit of a factor of about
two at z~0.7 of MB>-20.5 structurally--classified early--type galaxies; and
(2.) An excess of a factor of about three, at a similar redshift, of irregular
galaxies.

sites of non-thermal high-energy photon production. This is motivated by the
detection of non-thermal spectra in the radio band, as well as by correlation
studies of yet unidentified EGRET gamma-ray sources with source populations
appearing in star formation regions. This work re-considers the basic radiative
processes and its properties that lead to high energy photon production in
long-period massive star systems. We show that Klein-Nishina effects as well as
the anisotropic nature of the inverse Compton scattering, the dominating
leptonic emission process, likely yield spectral and variability signatures in
the gamma-ray domain at or above the sensitivity of current or upcoming gamma
ray instruments like GLAST-LAT. In addition to all relevant radiative losses,
we include propagation (such as convection in the stellar wind) as well as
photon absorption effects, which a priori can not be neglected. The
calculations are applied to WR140 and WR147, and predictions for their
detectability in the gamma-ray regime are provided. Physically similar specimen
of their kind like WR146, WR137, WR138, WR112 and WR125 may be regarded as
candidate sources at GeV energies for near-future gamma-ray experiments.
Finally, we discuss several aspects relevant for eventually identifying this
source class as a gamma-ray emitting population. Thereby we utilize our
findings on the expected radiative behavior of typical colliding wind binaries
in the gamma-ray regime as well as its expected spatial distribution on the
gamma-ray sky.

brightness temperature exceeds a threshold value, usually estimated to be
10^{12} K, appears to be in contradiction with observation because: (i) the
threshold is substantially exceeded by several intra-day variable radio
sources, but the inverse Compton emission is not observed, (ii) powerful,
extra-galactic radio sources of known angular size do not appear to congregate
close to the predicted maximum brightness temperature. We re-examine the
parameter space available to synchrotron sources using a population of
monoenergetic electrons, in order to see whether the revised threshold
temperature is consistent with the data. The electron distribution and the
population of each generation of scattered photons are computed using spatially
averaged equations. We confirm our previous finding that intrinsic brightness
temperatures T_{\rm B}~10^{14} K can occur without catastrophic cooling. We
show that substantially higher temperatures cannot be achieved either in
transitory solutions or in solutions that balance losses with a powerful
acceleration mechanism. Depending on the observing frequency, we find strong
cooling can set in at a range of threshold temperatures and the imposition of
the additional constraint of equipartition between particle and magnetic field
energy is not warranted by the data. Postulating a monoenergetic electron
distribution, which approximates one that is truncated below a certain Lorentz

between the variable optical continuum and a stationary radio feature in the
jet. The ejection of radio components happens during, or after, the dip in the
X-ray light curve. Moreover, during the X-ray dip the flux variability is
significantly reduced while the hardness ratio and its variance becomes harder.
These findings strengthen the idea of similarity between active galactic nuclei
(AGN) and microquasars, pointing towards a common physical mechanism acting in
the disk-jet system. Other similarities are also discussed on the basis of
comparision between 3C 390.3 and the microquasars GRS 1915+105 and Cyg X-1. If
the analogy (based on linear mass scaling) between the ejection rates of the

habitable zones (at ~ 1AU) in extrasolar planetary systems, due to tidal
interactions with their satellite and host star with wide varieties of
satellite-to-planet mass ratio and initial obliquity, through numerical
calculations and analytical arguments. The obliquity, the angle between
planetary spin axis and its orbit normal, of a terrestrial planet is one of the
key factors in determining the planetary surface environments. A recent
scenario of terrestrial planet accretion implies that giant impacts of
Mars-sized bodies determine the planetary spin and form satellites. With
isotropic giant impacts, tilted spins are more likely to be produced than
straight ones and satellites with various mass are formed. However, most of
previous studies have focused on a particular case of the Earth-Moon systems or
the two-body planar problem. We numerically integrated the evolution of
planetary spin and a satellite orbit with various satellite mass and initial
obliquity. We found that in the case of initially tiled spins, the satellite's
orbit migrates outward until the orbit reaches the critical radius ~ 10-20
planetary radii, but then the migration is reversed to inward one with
large-amplitude oscillation. The satellite eventually falls onto the planetary
surface or it is captured at the synchronous state at several planetary radii.
With the results of numerical integration and analytical arguments, we
identified the parameter regions of qualitatively different evolution.

two previously published datasets. We use cosmological simulations of disk
galaxy formation to motivate our assumptions on the shape of the velocity
distribution, allowing for a significantly more precise measurement of the
escape velocity compared to previous studies. We find that the escape velocity
lies within the range $498\kms < \ve < 608 \kms$ (90 per cent confidence), with
a median likelihood of $544\kms$. The fact that $\ve^2$ is significantly
greater than $2\vc^2$ (where $\vc=220\kms$ is the local circular velocity)
implies that there must be a significant amount of mass exterior to the Solar
circle, i.e. this convincingly demonstrates the presence of a dark halo in the
Galaxy. For a simple isothermal halo, one can calculate that the minimum radial
extent is $\sim58$ kpc. We use our constraints on $\ve$ to determine the mass
of the Milky Way halo for three halo profiles. For example, an adiabatically
contracted NFW halo model results in a virial mass of
$1.42^{+1.14}_{-0.54}\times10^{12}M_\odot$ and virial radius of
$305^{+66}_{-45}$ kpc (90 per cent confidence). For this model the circular
velocity at the virial radius is $142^{+31}_{-21}\kms$. Although our halo

with a small gap below Tc that closes at Tc. Near the antinode, the spectra are
broad with a large energy gap of ~40meV above and below Tc. The spectral shape
and gap magnitude around the antinode are almost constant across Tc, which
indicates that the pseudogap state coexists with the superconducting state
below Tc, and it dominates the character of the spectra around the antinode. We
speculate that the pseudogap state competes with the superconductivity by
diminishing spectral weight in the antinodal regions, where the magnitude of

persist up to the critical point, setting up a discontinuous Fermi surface
change across a continuous quantum transition. We study square lattice
antiferromagnets undergoing a continuous transition from a Neel state to a

cause the area enclosed by each Fermi surface pocket to jump by a factor of 2

electronic spectrum across this transition is described by a critical theory of
a localized impurity coupled to a 2+1 dimensional conformal field theory. This
critical theory also controls the more complex Fermi surface crossover at fixed
density, which likely involves intermediate phases with exotic fractionalized
excitations. We suggest that such theories control the electronic spectrum in

disorder have been developed over the past ten years. Our goal was to directly
compare these theories with precise experiments. We first developed and then
applied coherent x-ray speckle metrology to a series of thin multilayer
perpendicular magnetic materials. To directly observe the effects of disorder,
we deliberately introduced increasing degrees of disorder into our films. We
used coherent x-rays to generate highly speckled magnetic scattering patterns.
The apparently random arrangement of the speckles is due to the exact
configuration of the magnetic domains in the sample. In effect, each speckle
pattern acts as a unique fingerprint for the magnetic domain configuration.
Small changes in the domain structure change the speckles, and comparison of
the different speckle patterns provides a quantitative determination of how
much the domain structure has changed. How is the magnetic domain configuration
at one point on the major hysteresis loop related to the configurations at the
same point on the loop during subsequent cycles? The microscopic return-point
memory(RPM) is partial and imperfect in the disordered samples, and completely
absent when the disorder was not present. We found the complementary-point
memory(CPM) is also partial and imperfect in the disordered samples and
completely absent when the disorder was not present. We found that the RPM is
always a little larger than the CPM. We also studied the correlations between
the domains within a single ascending or descending loop. We developed new
theoretical models that do fit our experiments.

satisfaction problem (in particular, k-SAT) can be viewed as a stochastic
process traversing successive adjacent states in an ``energy landscape''
defined by the problem instance on the n-dimensional Boolean hypercube. We
investigate analytically the worst-case topography of such landscapes in the
context of satisfiable k-SAT via a random ensemble of satisfiable ``k-regular''
linear equations modulo 2.
  We show that for each fixed k=3,4,..., the typical k-SAT energy landscape
induced by an instance drawn from the ensemble has a set of 2^{\Omega(n)} local
energy minima, each separated by an unconditional \Omega(n) energy barrier from
each of the O(1) ground states, that is, solution states with zero energy. The
main technical aspect of the analysis is that a random k-regular 0/1 matrix
constitutes a strong boundary expander with almost full GF(2)-linear rank, a
property which also enables us to prove a 2^{\Omega(n)} lower bound for the
expected number of steps required by the focused random walk heuristic to solve
typical instances drawn from the ensemble. These results paint a grim picture
of the worst-case topography of k-SAT for local search, and constitute
apparently the first rigorous analysis of the growth of energy barriers in a
random ensemble of k-SAT landscapes as the number of variables n is increased.

analyzed from the viewpoint of blind source separation (BSS); they correspond
respectively to acceptable and spurious solutions of the BSS problem. The
contribution of this work is twofold. First, a Taylor development is used to
show that the \textit{exact} output entropy cost function has a non-mixing
minimum when this output is proportional to \textit{any} of the non-Gaussian
sources, and not only when the output is proportional to the lowest entropic
source. Second, in order to prove that mixing entropy minima exist when the
source densities are strongly multimodal, an entropy approximator is proposed.
The latter has the major advantage that an error bound can be provided. Even if
this approximator (and the associated bound) is used here in the BSS context,
it can be applied for estimating the entropy of any random variable with
multimodal density.

this is accomplished by a symmetry transformation that multiplies the metric
tensor by minus one. In both realizations of the symmetry the requirement of
the invariance of the gravitational action under the symmetry selects out the
dimensions given by D = 2(2n+1), n=0,1,2,... and forbids a bulk cosmological

promising for quantization when compared to the usual scale symmetry. The

make a possible brane cosmological constant zero in a simple way by using the

geography which utilises the QL symmetry to suppress the proton decay rate and
to motivate the flavor differences in the quark and leptonic sectors is
considered. The 5D quartification model is outlined and contrasted with 4D

  added",,,,"hep-ph hep-ex",,"  The HyperCP collaboration has observed three events for the decay $\Sigma^+
\to p \mu^+ \mu^-$. The three events may be interpreted as a new narrow-width
CP-odd scalar $a$ with the mass $214.3 \pm 0.5$ MeV. Here $a$ decays dominantly
into di-muon ($\mu^+\mu^-$). As the consequence of tiny mass difference between
$m_a$ and 2$m_\mu$ ($2 m_{\mu} \approx$ 211.3 MeV), di-muon will be boosted to
almost the same direction at colliders. Such kind of di-muon events have been
overlooked in the past experiments. Provided that the precision data preferred
light SM-like Higgs boson $h$ decays dominantly into $a a$ other than into
$b\bar b$, in order to be consistent with null Higgs boson search at LEP, the
$h\to aa \to 4\mu$ ($2\mu^+ 2\mu^-$) will be the unique Higgs boson signature
which has not been noticed before. The SM-like Higgs boson may hide itself from
the usual analysis of LEP and Tevatron experiments, which should be reanalyzed
in the light of new theoretical and experimental developments. In this paper,
we also investigate this unique Higgs boson signature at colliders and conclude
that the SM-like Higgs boson could be discovered with rather low integrated
luminosity, provided that the $h\to 4\mu$ reconstruction efficiency is not
extremely low. It is not impossible that such kind of unique Higgs boson $4\mu$
events are now lurking in the existing LEP and/or Tevatron data.

so they do not interact with the ordinary particles, exept the Higgs boson in
the standard model. The Spergel-Steinhardt condition for self-interacting dark
matter gives a bound on the mass of the candidates to be a few MeVs. Besides
the scalar candidates, which exist in both non-SUSY and SUSY 3-3-1 models with
right-handed neutrinos, the spin $\fr 1 2$ candidate exists in a variant 3-3-1
version with exotic neutral lepton. In contrast to the singlet models, where an
extra symmetry must be imposed to account the stability of the dark matter,
here the decay of the candidates is automatically forbidden in all orders of
perturbative expansion. This is because of the following feature: these scalars
are singlets, i.e., in bottom of the Higgs triplet. Therefore, the standard
model fermions and the standard gauge bosons cannot couple with them.

the strong Coulomb interaction of positive N-terminal tails with ss RNA in the

unassembled chain of ss RNA (which we call ""antenna"") and slide on it towards
the assembly site. We show that at excess of capsid proteins such
one-dimensional diffusion accelerates self-assembly more than ten times. On the
other hand at excess of ss RNA, antenna slows self-assembly down. Several
experiments are proposed to verify the role of ss RNA antenna.

force. This force can be repulsive, since this energy density can be negative.

  Physical Review A",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.75.032325",,"quant-ph",,"  The equivalence of stabilizer states under local transformations is of
fundamental interest in understanding properties and uses of entanglement. Two
stabilizer states are equivalent under the usual stochastic local operations
and classical communication criterion if and only if they are equivalent under
local unitary (LU) operations. More surprisingly, under certain conditions, two
LU equivalent stabilizer states are also equivalent under local Clifford (LC)
operations, as was shown by Van den Nest et al. [Phys. Rev. \textbf{A71},
062323]. Here, we broaden the class of stabilizer states for which LU
equivalence implies LC equivalence ($LU\Leftrightarrow LC$) to include all
stabilizer states represented by graphs with neither cycles of length 3 nor 4.
To compare our result with Van den Nest et al.'s, we show that any stabilizer
state of distance $\delta=2$ is beyond their criterion. We then further prove
that $LU\Leftrightarrow LC$ holds for a more general class of stabilizer states
of $\delta=2$. We also explicitly construct graphs representing $\delta>2$
stabilizer states which are beyond their criterion: we identify all 58 graphs
with up to 11 vertices and construct graphs with $2^m-1$ ($m\geq 4$) vertices
using quantum error correcting codes which have non-Clifford transversal gates.

controllability of finite-dimensional open quantum systems whose dynamics are
represented by Kraus maps. For any pair of states (pure or mixed) on the
Hilbert space of the system, we explicitly show how to construct a Kraus map
that transforms one state into another. Moreover, we prove by construction the
existence of a Kraus map that transforms all initial states into a predefined
target state (such a process may be used, for example, in quantum information
dilution). Thus, in sharp contrast to unitary control, Kraus-map dynamics
allows for the design of controls which are robust to variations in the initial
state of the system. The general formalism is illustrated with examples of
state-to-state Kraus transformations in a two-level system. In particular, we
construct a family of non-unitary Kraus maps, which transform one pure state
into another. The problem of dynamic state controllability of open quantum
systems (i.e., controllability of state-to-state transformations, given a set
of available dynamical resources such as coherent controls, incoherent
interactions with the environment, and measurements) is also discussed.
