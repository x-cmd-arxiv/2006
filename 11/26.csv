Earth's rotation is proposed. The purpose of developing the new approach is to
provide a self-consistent and simple description of the Earth's rotation in a
way that can be estimated directly from observations without using intermediate
quantities.
  METHODS: Instead of estimating the time series of pole coordinates, the
UT1--TAI angles, their rates, and the daily offsets of nutation, it is proposed
to estimate coefficients of the expansion of a small perturbational rotation
vector into basis functions. The resulting transformation from the terrestrial
coordinate system to the celestial coordinate system is formulated as a product
of an a priori matrix of a finite rotation and an empirical vector of a
residual perturbational rotation. In the framework of this approach, the
specific choice of the a priori matrix is irrelevant, provided the angles of
the residual rotation are small enough to neglect their squares. The
coefficients of the expansion into the B-spline and Fourier bases, together
with estimates of other nuisance parameters, are evaluated directly from
observations of time delay or time range in a single least square solution.
  RESULTS: This approach was successfully implemented in a computer program for
processing VLBI observations. The dataset from 1984 through 2006 was analyzed.
The new procedure adequately represents the Earth's rotation, including slowly
varying changes in UT1--TAI and polar motion, the forced nutations, the free
core nutation, and the high frequency variations of polar motion and UT1.

first, to present results of estimation of the Earth orientation parameters in
the form of time series based on a simplified model of variations of the
Earth's rotation for a short period of time, and then to process this time
series of adjustments by applying smoothing, re-sampling and other numerical
algorithms. Although this approach saves computational time, it suffers from
self-inconsistency: total Earth orientation parameters depend on a subjective
choice of the apriori Earth orientation model, cross-correlations between
points of time series are lost, and results of an operational analysis per se
have a limited use for end users. An alternative approach of direct estimation
of the coefficients of expansion of Euler angle perturbations into basis
functions is developed. These coefficients describe the Earth's rotation over
entire period of observations and are evaluated simultaneously with station
positions, source coordinates and other parameters in a single LSQ solution. In
the framework of this approach considerably larger errors in apriori EOP model
are tolerated. This approach gives a significant conceptual simplification of

Compared with previous works, there are three aspects improved in this work:
first, the direction-independent ""boost factor"" for diffuse $\gamma$-rays from
dark matter annihilation (DMA) is naturally reproduced by taking the DM
substructures into account; second, there is no need for renormalization of the
diffuse $\gamma$-ray background produced by CRs; last but not the least, in
this work our new propagation model can give consistent results of both diffuse
$\gamma$-rays and antiprotons, by directly adding the signals from DMA to the

possible scenarios at present, and can be tested or optimized by the

  formatting changes",,,,"cs.NI cs.DC",,"  In unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, the overlay topology (or
connectivity graph) among peers is a crucial component in addition to the
peer/data organization and search. Topological characteristics have profound
impact on the efficiency of search on such unstructured P2P networks as well as
other networks. It has been well-known that search on small-world topologies of
N nodes can be as efficient as O(ln N), while scale-free (power-law) topologies
offer even better search efficiencies like as good as O(lnln N) for a range of
degree distribution exponents. However, generation and maintenance of such
scale-free topologies are hard to realize in a distributed and potentially
uncooperative environments as in the P2P networks. A key limitation of
scale-free topologies is the high load (i.e. high degree) on very few number of
hub nodes. In a typical unstructured P2P network, peers are not willing to
maintain high degrees/loads as they may not want to store large number of
entries for construction of the overlay topology. So, to achieve fairness and
practicality among all peers, hard cutoffs on the number of entries are imposed
by the individual peers, which limits scale-freeness of the overall topology.
Thus, efficiency of the flooding search reduces as the size of the hard cutoff
does. We investigate construction of scale-free topologies with hard cutoffs
(i.e. there are not any major hubs) and effect of these hard cutoffs on the
search efficiency. Interestingly, we observe that the efficiency of normalized
flooding and random walk search algorithms increases as the hard cutoff
decreases.

cylindrical coordinates of the 3-dimensional space of positive constant
curvature, spherical model, have been obtained. It is shown that all basis
Schrodinger's and Dirac's wave functions are finite, single-valued, and
continuous everywhere in spherical space model S_{3}. The used coordinates
(\rho, \phi,z) are simply referred to Eiler's angle variables (\alpha, \beta,
\gamma), parameters on the unitary group SU(2), which permits to express the
constructed wave solutions \Psi(\rho, phi,z) in terms of Wigner's functions
$D_{mm'}^{j}(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$. Specification of the analysis to the case
of elliptic, SO(3.R) group space, model has been done. In so doing, the results
substantially depend upon the spin of the particle. In scalar case, the part of
the Schrodinger wave solutions must be excluded by continuity considerations,
remaining functions are continuous everywhere in the elliptical 3-space. The
latter is in agrement with the known statement: the Wigner functions
D_{mm'}^{j}(\alpha, \beta, \gamma) at j =0,1,2,... make up a correct basis in
SO(3.R) group space. For the fermion case, it is shown that no Dirac solutions,
continuous everywhere in elliptical space, do exist. Description of the Dirac
particle in elliptical space of positive constant curvature cannot be correctly
in the sense of continuity adjusted with its topological structure.

namely, the classification problem for multidimensional Poisson brackets of

general case, a nondegenerate multidimensional Poisson bracket of hydrodynamic
type cannot be reduced to a constant form by a local change of coordinates.
Generally speaking, such a Poisson bracket is generated by a nontrivial special
infinite-dimensional Lie algebra. In this paper we obtain a classification of
all nonsingular nondegenerate multidimensional Poisson brackets of hydrodynamic
type for any number N of components and for any dimension n by
differential-geometric methods. A key role in the solution of this problem was
played by the theory of compatible metrics that had been earlier constructed by
the present author.

group is compactifiable. This result cannot be extended to the class of
Tychonoff topological monoids. At the same time, several natural constructions
lead to compactifiable semigroups and actions. We prove that the semigroup
C(K,K) of all continuous selfmaps on the Hilbert cube K is a universal second

Moreover, the Hilbert cube K under the action of C(K,K) is universal in the

are second countable. We strengthen some related results of Kocak & Strauss and

random walk dynamics and establish the necessary conditions for a network to be
topologically and dynamically fully correlated, with topological hubs that are
also highly active. Zipf's law is then shown to be a reflection of the match
between structure and dynamics in a fully correlated network, as well as a
consequence of the rich-get-richer evolution inherent in scale-free networks.
