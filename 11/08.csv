group and cluster galaxies (BCGs) together with control samples of non-BCGs
matched in stellar mass, redshift, and color. We investigate how the systematic
properties of BCGs depend on stellar mass and on their privileged location near
the cluster center. The groups and clusters that we study are drawn from the C4
catalogue of Miller et al. (2005) but we have developed improved algorithms for
identifying the BCG and for measuring the cluster velocity dispersion. Since
the SDSS photometric pipeline tends to underestimate the luminosities of large
galaxies in dense environments, we have developed a correction for this effect
which can be readily applied to the published catalog data. We find that BCGs
are larger and have higher velocity dispersions than non-BCGs of the same
stellar mass, which implies that BCGs contain a larger fraction of dark matter.
In contrast to non-BCGs, the dynamical mass-to-light ratio of BCGs does not
vary as a function of galaxy luminosity. Hence BCGs lie on a different
fundamental plane than ordinary elliptical galaxies. BCGs also follow a steeper
Faber-Jackson relation than non-BCGs, as suggested by models in which BCGs
assemble via dissipationless mergers along preferentially radial orbits. We
find tentative evidence that this steepening is stronger in more massive
clusters. BCGs have similar mean stellar ages and metallicities to non-BCGs of
the same mass, but they have somewhat higher alpha/Fe ratios, indicating that
star formation may have occurred over a shorter timescale in the BCGs. Finally,
we find that BCGs are more likely to host radio-loud active galactic nuclei
than other galaxies of the same mass, but are less likely to host an optical
AGN. The differences we find are more pronounced for the less massive BCGs.

structure formerly identified as a chimney candidate, an opening to the
Galactic halo, is instead a superbubble in the process of fragmenting and
possibly evolving into a chimney. Data at high Galactic latitudes (b > 5
degrees) above the W3/W4 star forming region at 1420 and 408 MHz Stokes I
(total power) and 1420 MHz Stokes Q and U (linear polarization) reveal an
egg-shaped structure with morphological correlations between our data and the
H-alpha data of Dennison, Topasna, & Simonetti. Polarized intensity images show
depolarization extending from W4 up the walls of the superbubble, providing
strong evidence that the radio continuum is generated by thermal emission
coincident with the H-alpha emission regions. We conclude that the parts of the
HII region hitherto known as W4 and the newly revealed thermal emission are all
ionized by the open cluster OCl 352. Assuming a distance of 2.35 kpc, the ovoid
structure is 164 pc wide and extends 246 pc above the mid-plane of the Galaxy.
The shell's emission decreases in total-intensity and polarized intensity in
various locations, appearing to have a break at its top and another on one
side. Using a geometric analysis of the depolarization in the shell's walls, we
estimate that a magnetic field line-of-sight component of 3 to 5 uG exists in
the shell. We explore the connection between W4 and the Galactic halo,
considering whether sufficient radiation can escape from the fragmenting
superbubble to ionize the kpc-scale H-alpha loop discovered by Reynolds,
Sterling & Haffner.

performed with the Phoswich Detection System (PDS) instrument aboard the
BeppoSAX satellite. We establish that the most likely CXB intensity level at
its emission peak (26-28 keV) is ~40 keV/cm2/s/sr, a value consistent with that
derived from the best available CXB measurement obtained over 25 years ago with
the first High Energy Astronomical Observatory satellite mission (HEAO-1;
Gruber et al. 1999), whose intensity, lying well below the extrapolation of
some lower energy measurements performed with focusing telescopes, was
questioned in the recent years. We find that 90% of the acceptable solutions of
our best fit model to the PDS data give a 20-50 keV CXB flux lower than 6.5E-08
erg/cm2/s/sr, which is 12% higher than that quoted by Gruber et al. (1999) when
we use our best calibration scale. This scale gives a 20-50 keV flux of the
Crab Nebula of 9.22E-09 erg/cm2/s, which is in excellent agreement with the
most recent Crab Nebula measurements and 6% smaller than that assumed by Gruber
et al. (1999). In combination with the CXB synthesis models we infer that about
25% of the intensity at ~30 keV arises from extremely obscured, Compton thick
AGNs (absorbing column density N_H > 1.0E+24 H/cm2), while a much larger
population would be implied by the highest intensity estimates. We also infer a
mass density of supermassive BHs of ~3.0E+05 Msol/Mpc3. The summed contribution
of resolved sources (Moretti et al. 2003) in the 2-10 keV band exceeds our best
fit CXB intensity extrapolated to lower energies, but it is within our upper
limit, so that any significant contribution to the CXB from sources other than
AGNs, such as star forming galaxies and diffuse Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium
(WHIM), is expected to be mainly confined below a few keV.

system material provides a fundamental test of galactic chemical evolution
models, while the composition of the solar photosphere is a reference pattern
to understand stellar abundances. However, spectroscopic or meteoritic
abundance determinations are only possible for an incomplete sample of the 83
elements detected in the solar system. Therefore, only relative abundances are
experimentally determined, with respect to H or to Si for spectroscopic or
meteoritic measurements, respectively. For this reason, the available
compilations of solar abundances are obtained by combining spectroscopic and
meteoritic determinations, a procedure requiring the knowledge of the chemical
modification occurred in the solar photosphere. We provide a method to derive
the mass fractions of all the 83 elements (and their most abundant isotopes) in
the early solar system material and in the present-day solar surface.
Calculations are repeated by adopting the most widely adopted compilations of
solar abundances. Since for a given [Fe/H], the total metallicity depends on
solar (Z/X), a 30% reduction of Z is found when passing from the classical
Anders&Grevesse to the most recent Lodders compilation. Some implications are
discussed, as, in particular, an increase of about 700 Myr of the estimated age
of Globular Clusters. Within the experimental errors, the complete set of
relative solar abundances, as obtained by combining meteoritic and photospheric
measurements, are consistent with the variations implied by the quoted physical
processes. Few deviations can be easily attributed to the decay of long-lived
radioactive isotopes. The huge lithium depletion is only partially explained by
introducing a rotational-induced mixing in the tachocline.

better quantify the zero-point of the maximum magnitude versus decline rate
relation for supernovae Type Ia and to validate the insensitivity of Type Ia
luminosity to parent stellar population using the host galaxy Hubble type as a
surrogate. We detected a total of 45 planetary nebulae candidates in NGC 1316,
44 candidates in NGC 1380, and 94 candidates in NGC 4526. From these data, and
the empirical planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF), we derive distances
of 17.9 +0.8/-0.9 Mpc, 16.1 +0.8/-1.1 Mpc, and 13.6 +1.3/-1.2 Mpc respectively.
Our derived distance to NGC 4526 has a lower precision due to the likely
presence of Virgo intracluster planetary nebulae in the foreground of this
galaxy. In NGC 524 and NGC 1448 we detected no planetary nebulae candidates
down to the limiting magnitudes of our observations. We present a formalism for
setting realistic distance limits in these two cases, and derive robust lower
limits of 20.9 Mpc and 15.8 Mpc, respectively.
  After combining these results with other distances from the PNLF, Cepheid,
and Surface Brightness Fluctuations distance indicators, we calibrate the
optical and near-infrared relations for supernovae Type Ia and we find that the
Hubble constants derived from each of the three methods are broadly consistent,
implying that the properties of supernovae Type Ia do not vary drastically as a
function of stellar population. We determine a preliminary Hubble constant of
H_0 = 77 +/- 3 (random) +/- 5 (systematic) km/s/Mpc for the PNLF, though more
nearby galaxies with high-quality observations are clearly needed.

LMXBs. Unlike Galactic GCs, a large number of GCs with LMXBs have half-mass
relaxation times > 2.5 Gyr. We fit the dependence of the expected number of

that the number of LMXBs per GC is linearly proportional to GC mass and that
most GCs with high X-ray luminosities contain a single LMXB. The detailed
dependence of \lambda_t on GC properties appears essentially equivalent to a
dependence on the encounter rate \Gamma_h and the metallicity Z, \lambda_t
\propto \Gamma_h^{0.82\pm0.05} Z^{0.39\pm0.07}. Our analysis provides strong
evidence that dynamical formation and metallicity play the primary roles in
determining the presence of an LMXB in extragalactic GCs. The shallower than
linear dependence for our sample requires an explanation by theories of
dynamical binary formation. The abundance dependence is consistent with a
metallicity-dependent variation in the number o neutron stars and black holes
per unit mass GC, effects from irradiation induced winds or suppression of
magnetic braking in metal-poor stars.

allowed `freezing' quintessence sector III where the scalar field is currently
decelerating down its potential towards freezing and an allowed `thawing'

Swift-discovered long Gamma-Ray Burst GRB 060729 ($T_{90}$=115s). The afterglow
of this burst was exceptionally bright in X-rays as well as at UV/Optical
wavelengths showing an unusually long slow decay phase ($\alpha$=0.14\plm0.02)
suggesting a larger energy injection phase at early times than in other bursts.
The X-ray light curve displays a break at about 60 ks after the burst. The
X-ray decay slope after the break is $\alpha$=1.29\plm0.03. Up to 125 days
after the burst we do not detect a jet break, suggesting that the jet opening
angle is larger than 28 degrees. In the first 2 minutes after the burst (rest
frame) the X-ray spectrum of the burst changed dramatically from a hard X-ray
spectrum to a very soft one. We find that the X-ray spectra at this early phase
can all be fitted by an absorbed single power law model or alternatively by a
blackbody plus power law model. The power law fits show that the X-ray spectrum
becomes steeper while the absorption column density decreases. In Swift's
UV/Optical telescope the afterglow was clearly detected up to 9 days after the
burst in all 6 filters and even longer in some of the UV filters with the
latest detection in the UVW1 31 days after the burst. A break at about 50 ks is
clearly detected in all 6 UVOT filters from a shallow decay slope of about 0.3
and a steeper decay slope of 1.3. In addition to the \swift observations we

find a clear trend between the rest-frame optical sizes of these sources and
their luminosity-weighted stellar ages as inferred from their broad-band

being dusty and actively star forming generally show extended morphologies in

surface mass densities which exceed those of local galaxies by more than an

  Metal Rich Universe'', Cambridge University Press",,,,"astro-ph",,"  After a review of the many effects of metallicity on the evolution of
rotating and non-rotating stars, we discuss the consequences of a high
metallicity on massive star populations and on stellar nucleosynthesis. The
most striking effect of high metallicity is to enhance the amount of mass lost
by stellar winds. Typically at a metallicity $Z=0.001$ only 9% of the total
mass returned by non-rotating massive stars is ejected by winds (91% by
supernovae explosion), while at solar metallicity this fraction may amount to
more than 40%. High metallicity favors the formation of Wolf-Rayet stars and of
type Ib supernovae. It however disfavors the occurrence of type Ic supernovae.
We estimate empirical yields of carbon based on the observed population of WC
stars in the solar neighborhood, and obtain that WC stars eject between 0.2 and
0.4% of the mass initially locked into stars under the form of new synthesized
carbon. Models give values well in agreement with these empirical yields.
Chemical evolution models indicate that such carbon yields may have important
impacts on the abundance of carbon at high metallicity.

elemental pieces coupled together to form an elastically coherent structure.
Plasticity is introduced as the existence of different minima in the energy
landscape of the elemental constituents. Upon the application of an external
strain rate, the material shears through the appearance of elemental slip
events with quadrupolar symmetry. When the energy landscape of the elemental
constituents is kept fixed, the slip events distribute uniformly throughout the
sample, producing on average a uniform deformation. However, when the energy
landscape at different spatial positions can be rearranged dynamically to
account for structural relaxation, the system develops inhomogeneous
deformation in the form of shear bands at low shear rates, and stick-slip-like
motion at the shear bands for the lowest shear rates. The origin of strain
localization is traced back to a region of negative correlation between strain
rate and stress, which appears only if structural relaxation is present. The
model also reproduces other well known effects in the rheology of amorphous
materials, as a stress peak in a strain rate controlled experiment staring from
rest, and the increase of the maximum of this peak with sample age.

all requests of a client be served by the closest server in the tree. We
introduce and study two new policies. In the first policy, all requests from a
given client are still processed by the same server, but this server can be
located anywhere in the path from the client to the root. In the second policy,
the requests of a given client can be processed by multiple servers. One major
contribution of this paper is to assess the impact of these new policies on the
total replication cost. Another important goal is to assess the impact of
server heterogeneity, both from a theoretical and a practical perspective. In
this paper, we establish several new complexity results, and provide several

with zero implying that the eta meson is produced predominantly in the s-wave

combined with the hitherto determined isospin dependence of the total cross
section for the eta meson production in nucleon-nucleon collisions, reveal a
statistically significant indication that the excitation of the nucleon to the
S_{11}(1535) resonance, the process which intermediates the production of the

functions is investigated. It can be proven that the ghost Dyson-Schwinger
equation implies the Gribov-Zwanziger horizon condition. Its relation to the
Kugo-Ojima confinement scenario is elucidated. Positivity violation for gluons
is demonstrated, and the analytic structure of the gluon propagator is studied.
Quark confinement is related to an infrared divergence of the quark-gluon
vertex. It is shown that in the latter various components are non-vanishing due
to the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry. As a result an infrared finite
running coupling in the Yang-Mills sector is derived whereas the running
coupling related to the quark-gluon vertex is infrared divergent.
  In Coulomb gauge QCD already the one-gluon-exchange (over-)confines. This
leads to a vanishing quark propagator, and thus quarks are confined.
Nevertheless colour singlet quantities derived from the quark propagator are
well-defined. Especially the expression for the quark condensate proves that
chiral symmetry is dynamically broken. As expected the properties of mesons can
be directly calculated whereas the mass of coloured diquarks diverges, and thus
diquarks are confined. The latter nevertheless possess a well-defined size.
  In the third part the results obtained so far will be used to formulate a
covariant Faddeev approach to nucleons. The resulting amplitudes describe the
quark core of the nucleon. Besides the mass of this state also the
electromagnetic form factors are calculated. The results for charge radii and
magnetic moments as a function of the quark current mass provide some
indication what the missing pion cloud may contribute to the nucleons'
properties.

are important because the absolute Galois group Gal(\bar{Q}/Q) acts faithfully
on them. We argue that the relation between the dessins and Seiberg-Witten

Recent studies confirm that one-loop N = 8 supergravity amplitudes satisfy the

that for any number of external legs, at one loop N = 8 supergravity and N = 4

D dimensions. We describe how the unitarity method allows us to promote these

diverging, as classical General Relativity suggests? We argue that the stringy
version of ""creation from nothing"", sketched by Ooguri, Vafa, and Verlinde,
solves both of these problems at once. The argument, while very simple, hinges
on some of the deepest theorems in global differential geometry. These results
imply that when a spatially toral spacetime is created from nothing, the
earliest spatial sections are forced to be [quasi-classically] exactly locally
isotropic. This local isotropy, in turn, forces the inflaton into its
minimal-entropy state. The theory explains why the Arrow does not reverse in

with polynomial decay. The unknown function $f$ is recovered by a projection
method using the singular value decomposition of $A$. The bandwidth choice of
this projection regularization is governed by a data-driven procedure which is
based on the principle of risk hull minimization. We provide nonasymptotic
upper bounds for the mean square risk of this method and we show, in

improve the classical method of unbiased risk estimation.

high-p_T suppression on the emission angle \Delta\phi of the pions with respect
to event reaction plane for 7 bins in collision centrality. We show that the
yields of high-p_T pi^0's vary strongly with \Delta\phi, consistent with prior

pi^0's produced perpendicular to the reaction plane is suppressed by more than
a factor of 2. We analyze the combined centrality and \Delta\phi dependence of
the pi^0 suppression in different p_T bins using different possible
descriptions of parton energy loss dependence on jet path-length averages to
determine whether a single geometric picture can explain the observed

incoherent or coherent electric and magnetic fields, as measured for instance
by the low frequency receiver on-board the Solar Orbiter spacecraft. The
characterization utilizes the 36 auto/cross correlations of the 3+3 complex
Cartesian components of the electric and magnetic fields; hence, they are
second order in the field strengths and so have physical dimension energy
density. Although such 6x6 correlation matrices have been successfully employed
on previous space missions, they are not physical quantities; because they are
not manifestly space-time tensors. In this paper we propose a systematic
representation of the 36 degrees-of-freedom of partially coherent
electromagnetic fields as a set of manifestly covariant space-time tensors,
which we call the Canonical Electromagnetic Observables (CEO). As an example,
we apply this formalism to analyze real data from a chorus emission in the
mid-latitude magnetosphere, as registered by the STAFF-SA instrument on board
the Cluster-II spacecraft. We find that the CEO analysis increases the amount
of information that can be extracted from the STAFF-SA dataset; for instance,
the reactive energy flux density, which is one of the CEO parameters,
identifies the source region of electromagnetic emissions more directly than
the active energy (Poynting) flux density alone.

one can provide a rational explanation of the experimental processes affecting
the measurement of time when clocks are in motion. Contrary to special
relativity, aether theory does not assume that the time itself is affected by
motion; the reading displayed by the moving clocks results from two facts: 1/
Due to their movement through the aether, they tick at a slower rate than in
the aether frame. 2/ The usual synchronization procedures generate a
synchronism discrepancy effect. These facts give rise to an alteration of the
measurement of time which, as we shall show, exactly explains the experimental
results. In particular, they enable to solve an apparent paradox that special
relativity cannot explain (see chapter 4). When the measurement distortions are
corrected, the time proves to be the same in all co-ordinate systems moving
away from one another with rectilinear uniform motion. These considerations
strongly support the existence of a privileged aether frame. The consequences
concern special relativity (SR) as well as general relativity (GR) which is an
extension of SR. We should note that Einstein himself became conscious of the
necessity of the aether from 1916, in contrast with conventional relativity.
Yet the model of aether presented here differs from Einsein in that it assumes
the existence of an aether drift, in agreement with the discoveries of G.F.

wave-particle Hamiltonian models the effective nonlinear interaction of a
spectrum of M waves with N resonant out-of-equilibrium tail electrons. In order
to address its intrinsically nonlinear time-asymptotic behavior, a Monte Carlo
code was built to estimate its equilibrium statistical mechanics in both the
canonical and microcanonical ensembles. First the single wave model is
considered in the cold beam/plasma instability and in the O'Neil setting for
nonlinear Landau damping. O'Neil's threshold, that separates nonzero
time-asymptotic wave amplitude states from zero ones, is associated to a second
order phase transition. These two studies provide both a testbed for the Monte
Carlo canonical and microcanonical codes, with the comparison with exact
canonical results, and an opportunity to propose quantitative results to
longstanding issues in basic nonlinear plasma physics. Then the properly
speaking weak turbulence framework is considered through the case of a large
spectrum of waves. Focusing on the small coupling limit, as a benchmark for the
statistical mechanics of weak Langmuir turbulence, it is shown that Monte Carlo
microcanonical results fully agree with an exact microcanonical derivation. The
wave spectrum is predicted to collapse towards small wavelengths together with
the escape of initially resonant particles towards low bulk plasma thermal
speeds. This study reveals the fundamental discrepancy between the long-time
dynamics of single waves, that can support finite amplitude steady states, and
of wave spectra, that cannot.

measurement volume of about 1.5 cm^3. We show that the fundamental field
sensitivity of a scalar magnetometer is determined by the rate of alkali-metal
spin-exchange collisions even though the resonance linewidth can be made much
smaller than the spin-exchange rate by pumping most atoms into a stretched spin
state.

that on average changes in free concentrations exponentially decay with the
distance from the source of perturbation. We then study how this decay is
influenced by such factors as the topology of a network, binding strength, and
correlations between concentrations of neighboring nodes. An exact analytic
expression for the decay constant is obtained for the case of uniform

not only affects sequence diversity at single neutral loci but also the joint
allele distribution of several partially linked neutral loci. This distribution
can be studied using the ancestral recombination graph for samples of partially

extend recent work by Schweinsberg & Durrett 2005 and Etheridge, Pfaffelhuber &

firing rate with contrast and are modulated by attention. What is the cortical
circuit that underlies these computations? We examine how synchrony can be
modulated by the excitability of interneurons, in a model layer 4 network
displaying contrast-invariant orientation-tuning. We did not find parameter
settings for which the standard ring model (Somers et al, 1995), which contains
only cells with simple receptive fields (RF), behaved appropriately. Only when
interneurons with complex receptive fields were included, similar to those
found recently in cat primary visual cortex (Hirsch et al, 2003), did the
network behave appropriately. A critical feature in the model was that complex
interneurons projected to simple interneurons but the simple interneurons did
not project back to them. The network was switched from the non-attended state
to the attended state by increasing the depolarization of the complex
interneurons. In addition to contrast-invariant orientation tuning, the model
reproduced the following experimental results: (1) the gamma-frequency range
coherence between the estimated local field potential (eLFP) and spike trains
of excitatory cells was higher in the attended state than in the non-attended
state, but the firing rates of the excitatory cells did not vary between
states; (2) the gamma-frequency-range power in the eLFP increased with
contrast. The model predicts that there are two populations of inhibitory
cells, one with complex RF characteristics whose firing rate increases with
attention and the other with simple RF characteristics whose firing rate
decreases with attention.

against certain kinds of parametric noise, the very motivation of this
robustness being the geometric character of the transformation achieved in the
adiabatic limit. On the other hand, the effects of decoherence are expected to
become more and more relevant when the adiabatic limit is approached. Starting
from the system described by Florio et al. [Phys. Rev. A 73, 022327 (2006)],
here we discuss the behavior of non ideal holonomic gates at finite operational
time, i.e., far before the adiabatic limit is reached. We have considered
several models of parametric noise and studied the robustness of finite time
gates. The obtained results suggest that the finite time gates present some
effects of cancellation of the perturbations introduced by the noise which
mimic the geometrical cancellation effect of standard holonomic gates.
Nevertheless, a careful analysis of the results leads to the conclusion that
these effects are related to a dynamical instead of geometrical feature.

by simply completing the rest of the LOCC operations required by the underlying
teleportation protocol. We use this systematic approach to construct both new

of activation of BE states using other BE states. A surprising outcome is the
construction of noiseless quantum relay channels with no distillable
