  3. Comments Welcome",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Bekenstein's (2004) TeVeS theory has added an interesting twist to the search
for dark matter and dark energy, modifying the landscape of gravity-related
astronomy day by day. Built bottom-up rather than top-down as most gravity
theories, TeVeS-like theories are healthily rooted on empirical facts, hence
immediately passing sanity checks on galaxy rotation curves, solar system
constraints, even bullet cluster of galaxies and cosmology with the help of 2eV
neutrinos. Nonetheless, empirical checks are far from perfect and complete, and
groups of different expertises are rapidly increasing the number of falsifiable
properties of the theory. The theory has also been made much simpler and more
general thanks to the work of Zlosnik, Ferreira, Starkman (gr-qc/0606039,
astro-ph/0607411). Here I attempt a tutorial of how to compute lensing
convergence, time delays etc in TeVeS-like theories for non-spherical lenses. I
gave examples to illustrate a few common caveats of Dark-Matter-guided
intuitions.

High-resolution CO maps are paramount in order to track down the feeding of
active nuclei and quantitatively address the issue of how and for how long
nuclear activity can be sustained in galaxies. Going beyond CO mapping, the use
of more specific molecular tracers of dense gas can probe the feedback
influence of activity on the chemistry and energy balance/redistribution in the
interstellar medium of nearby galaxies, a prerequisite to interpret how
feedback may operate at higher redshift galaxies. In this context we present
the latest results issued from the NUclei of GAlaxies (NUGA) project, a
high-resolution (0.5''-1'') CO survey of low luminosity AGNs conducted with the
IRAM interferometer. The efficiency of gravity torques as a mechanism to
account for the feeding of low luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs) can be analyzed. We
discuss an evolutionary scenario in which gravity torques and viscosity act in
concert to produce recurrent episodes of activity during the typical lifetime
of any galaxy. We also present the results of an ongoing survey allying the
IRAM 30m telescope with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI), devoted to
probe the feedback of activity through the study of the excitation and
chemistry of the dense molecular gas in a sample of nearby AGNs and ULIRGs as

uniformly laminar or turbulent disks. This Letter explores how dust growth
occurs in a layered protoplanetary disk in which the magnetorotational
instability generates turbulence only in the surface layers of a disk. Two
cases are considered: a completely laminar dead zone and a dead zone in which
turbulence is ``stirred up'' from the MRI acting above. It is found that dust
is depleted from high altitudes in layered disks faster than in those cases of
a uniformly laminar or turblent disks. This is a result of the accelerated
growth of particles in the turbulent regions and their storage in the lower
levels where they escape energetic collisions which would result in disruption.
Thus the regions of a protoplanetary disk above a dead zone would become
rapidly depleted in small dust grains, whereas the outer regions, where the MRI
is active throughout, will maintain a small dust poplulation at all heights due
to the disruptive collisions and vertical mixing from turbulence. This
structure is similar to that which has been inferred for disks around TW Hydra,
GM Auriga, and CoKu Tau/4, which are depleted in dust close to the star, but
are optically thick at larger heliocentric distances.

lost a large amount of mass in the form of stellar wind during their evolution.
  There are two possible ways to probe the CSM of long GRB progenitors.
Firstly, the GRB afterglow consists of synchrotron radiation, emitted when the
GRB jet sweeps up the surrounding medium. Therefore, the lightcurve is directly
related to the density profile of the CSM. The density can either decrease with
the radius squared (as is the case for a freely expanding stellar wind) or be
constant (as we would expect for shocked wind or the interstellar medium).
Secondly, material between the GRB and the observer will absorb part of the
afterglow radiation, causing absorption lines in the afterglow spectrum. In
some cases, such absorption lines are blue-shifted relative to the source
indicating that the material is moving away from the progenitor star. This can
be explained in terms of wind interactions in the CSM. We can use the CSM of
these stars to investigate their prior evolutionary stage.

to compute the pixel-pixel noise covariances for maps of arbitrary resolution.
The analytic model is compared to numerical simulations using a realistic

GHz should be signal dominated on large scales. Destriping errors are the
dominant source of noise for the temperature and polarization power spectra at
multipoles ell < 10. A fast Monte-Carlo method for characterising noise,

a metric which is a conformal transform (parametrized by phi) of the Einstein
metric. The effective potential of the field phi is a sum of its
self-interaction term and an exponential term due to the conformal coupling.
Under certain conditions on the self-interaction and the coupling, this
effective potential has a minimum which depends on the local matter density, as
does its second derivative at the minimum. As a result, the scalar field
acquires a mass which increases with local matter density.
  The field phi mediates a fifth force which is suppressed in the laboratory
and in interactions between large bodies like planets, but which may be
detectable between small test masses in space.

chameleon-field cosmology, and examine some simple solutions with a view to

different. Recent work shows that the second moment of the H-beta emission line
(the line dispersion) is a better estimator of black hole mass than FWHM. To
test whether changing the width measure affects our results, we calculate line
dispersion-based black hole masses for our sample. We find that using the line
dispersion rather than the FWHM as a measure of the gas velocity shifts NLS1

opens the pathway for the study of significantly larger samples of CEMP stars

in the range 19 < i < 27 deg, which is much lower than that of the

to the interesting possibility of many low-inclination nova-likes actually
being SW Sex stars, but with a very different spectroscopic appearance as they
show significant absorption. The increasing blueshifted absorption with
decreasing inclination points to the existence of a mass outflow with
significant vertical motion. This six new additions to the SW Sex class
increase the presence of non-eclipsing systems to about one third of the whole

lowered their C, N, O and Fe abundance by a factor of ten and increased the

identical fit with subsolar metalicity. F06 find support for their supersolar
metal abundances from a cursory analysis of the UV data from the same Mrk 279

trough that are known to arise from gas unrelated to the outflow, which weakens
the support from the UV data. A detailed analysis of the Chandra LETGS X-ray

metallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.03 dex. However some alpha elements were found to be
enhanced. The star-to-star scatter was consistent with the expected measurement
uncertainty for all elements. The observed rms scatter is as follows: Na =

and evolution of the stellar progenitors of bright planetary nebulae in dwarf
irregular galaxies. On average, the oxygen abundance observed in the bright
planetary nebulae in these galaxies coincides with that measured in the
interstellar medium, indicating that, in general, the bright planetary nebulae
in dwarf irregulars descend primarily, though not exclusively, from stars
formed in the relatively recent past. We also find that the ratio of neon to
oxygen abundances in these bright planetary nebulae is identical to that
measured in the interstellar medium, indicating that neither abundance is
significantly altered as a result of the evolution of their stellar
progenitors. We do find two planetary nebulae, that in Sextans A and S33 in NGC
6822, where oxygen appears to have been dredged up, but these are the exception
rather than the rule. In fact, we find that even nitrogen is not always dredged
up, so it appears that the dredge-up of oxygen is uncommon for the abundance

instability strip in the lower temperature side of the Hertzsprung-Russel (HR)
diagram which goes along the sequences of the red giant branch (RGB) and the
asymptotic giant branch (AGB). For red giants of lower luminosities, pulsation
instability are found at high order overtones, the lower order modes from the
fundamental to the second overtone are stable. Towards higher luminosity and
lower effective temperature, instability moves to lower order modes, and the
amplitude growth rate of oscillations also grows. At the high luminosity end of
the strip, the fundamental and the first overtone become unstable, while all
the modes above the 4th order become stable. The excitation mechanism have been
sdudied in detail. It is found that turbulent pressure plays a key role for
excitating of red variables. The frozen convecttin approximation is
unavailaable for the low temperature stars with extended convective envelopes.
In any case, this approximation can explain neither the red edge of the Cepheid
instability strip, nor the blue edge of the pulsating red giant instability
strip. An analytic expression of a pulsation constant as a function of stellar
mass, luminosity and effective temperature is presented from this work.

that the same population(s) of soft X-ray sources causes the break in the

flux densities from the ChaMP and the ChaMP+CDFs number counts with and without
bright target sources. Adding the known unresolved CXRB to the ChaMP+CDF
resolved CXRB, we also estimate total CXRB flux densities. The fractions of the
resolved CXRB without target sources are 78^{+1}_{-1}% and 81^{+2}_{-2}% in the
0.5-2 keV and 2-8 keV bands, respectively, somewhat lower, though generally
consistent with earlier numbers since their large errors. These fractions
increase by ~1% when target sources are included.

anisotropy and inhomogeneity. A generalized Kolmogorov equation applying to
convection is derived and its various terms are computed using numerical
simulations of turbulent Boussinesq convection. The analysis of the isotropic
part of the equation shows that the third-order velocity structure function is
significantly affected by buoyancy forcing and large-scale inhomogeneities.
Anisotropic contributions to this equation are also shown to be comparable to
their isotropic counterpart at moderate to large scales. Implications of these

ideal source to extend the insights obtained on SgrA* toward higher luminosity

first flux measurements of M81* at wavelengths around 1 mm. We find that M81*

correlated. Like SgrA*, M81* appears to display the strongest flux density and
variability in the mm-to-submm regime. There remains still some ambiguity
concerning the exact location of the turnover frequency from optically thick to
optically thin emission. The observed variability time scales point to an upper
size limit of the emitting region of the order 25 Schwarzschild radii. The data
show that M81* is indeed a system with very similar physical properties to
SgrA* and an ideal bridge toward high luminosity AGN. The data obtained clearly

derived for the first time and for different chemical elements, respectively

indicating, as we suggest, different line formation depths in the atmosphere.
This allowed us to estimate for the first time the propagation velocity of a
pulsation wave in the outer stellar atmosphere of a roAp star to be slightly
lower than the sound speed. We confirm large pulsation amplitudes (150-400 m/s)
for REE lines and the Halpha core, while spectral lines of the other elements
(Mg, Si, Ca, and Fe-peak elements) have nearly constant velocities. We did not
find different pulsation amplitudes and phases for the lines of rare-earth
elements before and after the Balmer jump, which supports the hypothesis of REE
concentration in the upper atmosphere above the hydrogen line-forming layers.

with a generalization to N fields or with a semi-classical expansion) of the

two-point functions such as the response function and the usual two-point

amplitude which either follows the linear prediction (for the direct
steepest-descent scheme) or decays (for the 2PI effective action scheme). On
the other hand, the correlation function agrees with the standard one-loop
result in the quasi-linear regime and remains well-behaved in the highly
non-linear regime. This suggests that these large-N expansions could provide a
good framework to study the dynamics of gravitational clustering in the
non-linear regime. Moreover, the use of various expansion schemes allows one to
estimate their range of validity without the need of N-body simulations and
could provide a better accuracy in the weakly non-linear regime.

Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies harbour supermassive nuclear engines blocked
from direct view by an optically and geometrically thick torus. If the pressure
is sufficiently high, the torus should mostly be molecular. Although molecular
rings with diameters of a few hundred parsecs are common, the expected small
scale tori (< 10 pc) have been difficult to detect. Searches for absorption
lines of common molecules like CO and OH have mostly yielded non-detections.
Before concluding that tori are not molecular, radiative excitation effects, in
which coupling to the nonthermal continuum can suppress the opacity in the
lowest transitions, deserve some attention and influence our selection of the
most favourable transitions to observe. To explore these effects, we modified
the search strategy by looking for the higher excited rotational states of OH

high X-ray absorbing column. We present here the results of single dish

: the magnetic Bragg reflections detected below 3 K correspond to a canted
antiferromagnet where the magnetic moments are mainly oriented along the chain
axis. Surprisingly in the context of other compounds in this family of magnets,
the interchain coupling is antiferromagnetic. This state is shown to be very
fragile since a ferromagnetic interchain arrangement is recovered in a weak

between dipolar interaction, shown to be responsible for the antiferromagnetic

generally, this study underlines the need, in this kind of molecular compounds,

resistivity and the merging of the gaps has been observed at a much lower Tc
(11 K). In this paper we argue that, while at low level of disorder IBS is the
leading mechanism that suppresses superconductivity, at higher disorder the
experimental results can only be understood if the smearing of the density of

the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. To
ensure that each evaluation contributes to the localization of good candidates
for the role of global minimizer, a sequential choice of evaluation points is
usually carried out. In particular, when Kriging is used to interpolate past
evaluations, the uncertainty associated with the lack of information on the
function can be expressed and used to compute a number of criteria accounting
for the interest of an additional evaluation at any given point. This paper
introduces minimizer entropy as a new Kriging-based criterion for the
sequential choice of points at which the function should be evaluated. Based on
\emph{stepwise uncertainty reduction}, it accounts for the informational gain
on the minimizer expected from a new evaluation. The criterion is approximated
using conditional simulations of the Gaussian process model behind Kriging, and
then inserted into an algorithm similar in spirit to the \emph{Efficient Global
Optimization} (EGO) algorithm. An empirical comparison is carried out between
our criterion and \emph{expected improvement}, one of the reference criteria in
the literature. Experimental results indicate major evaluation savings over
EGO. Finally, the method, which we call IAGO (for Informational Approach to
Global Optimization) is extended to robust optimization problems, where both
the factors to be tuned and the function evaluations are corrupted by noise.

the presence of heavy Higgs bosons decays or restricts the location to a quite
small region of low \mu and M_2 values \lsim 200 GeV, a region denoted as the
`lower island'. In this region, wedgebox plots can be quite complicated and
change in pattern rather quickly as one moves around in the (\mu, M_2) plane.

produce a wedge-shape since only \widetilde{\chi}_2^0\widetilde{\chi}_3^0

the heavy partons. This decay occurs before nucleosynthesis for m < 10^{11} GeV
for electrically charged partons and m < TeV for electrically neutral partons.
This implies that heavy parton lifetimes as long as 10^{14} sec are allowed
even for heavy partons with m ~ TeV decaying to photons or hadrons with
significant branching fraction.

establishing the asymptotic Coulomb term from one gluon exchange approximation.
At the same time, a linear confinement term is introduced in agreement with QCD

simplification in the calculation, consequence of a precise and simplified
description of the kinetic term of the Hamiltonian. With this proposition we
perform the calculations of mass spectroscopy for charmonium and bottomonium

under certain conditions i) real R and specific CP-conserving values of the

does not necessarily imply breaking of CP-symmetry. We study in detail the case
of hierarchical heavy Majorana neutrino mass spectrum, presenting results for
three possible types of light neutrino mass spectrum: i) normal hierarchical,
ii) inverted hierarchical, and iii) quasi-degenerate. Results in the
alternative case of quasi-degenerate in mass heavy Majorana neutrinos, are also

between the baryon asymmetry of the Universe and i) the rephasing invariant
J_CP controling the magnitude of CP-violation in neutrino oscillations, or ii)
the effective Majorana mass in neutrinoless double beta decay, in the cases
when the only source of CP-violation is respectively the Dirac or the Majorana

can be equally well substituted into either the higher-dimensional equations of
motion or the higher-dimensional action, and that the resulting
lower-dimensional theories will be the same. This is certainly true for
Kaluza-Klein circle reductions and for DeWitt group-manifold reductions, where
group-invariance arguments guarantee the equivalence. In this paper we address
the question in the case of the non-trivial consistent Pauli coset reductions,
such as the S^7 and S^4 reductions of eleven-dimensional supergravity. These
always work at the level of the equations of motion. In some cases the
reduction ansatz can only be given at the level of field strengths, rather than
the gauge potentials which are the fundamental fields in the action, and so in
such cases there is certainly no question of being able to substitute instead
into the action. By examining explicit examples, we show that even in cases
where the ansatz can be given for the fundamental fields appearing in an
action, substituting it into the higher-dimensional action may not give the
correct lower-dimensional theory. This highlights the fact that much remains to
be understood about the way in which Pauli reductions work.

zeta coefficient $C_0(B, P_{1,T})$ is the regular value at $s=0$ of the zeta
function $\Tr(B P_{1,T}^{-s})$, where $B=P_++G$ is a pseudodifferential
boundary operator (in the Boutet de Monvel calculus) -- for example the
solution operator of a classical elliptic problem -- and $P_{1,T}$ is a
realization of an elliptic differential operator $P_1$, having a ray free of
eigenvalues.
  Relative formulas (e.g. for the difference between the constants with two
different choices of $P_{1,T}$) have been known for some time and are local. We
here determine $C_0(B, P_{1,T})$ itself, showing how it is put together of
local residue-type integrals (generalizing the noncommutative residue of
Wodzicki, Guillemin, Fedosov-Golse-Leichtnam-Schrohe) and global canonical
trace-type integrals (generalizing the canonical trace of Kontsevich and
Vishik, formed of Hadamard finite parts).
  Our formula generalizes that of Paycha and Scott, shown recently for
manifolds without boundary. It leads in particular to new definitions of
noncommutative residues of expressions involving $\log P_{1,T}$.
  Since the complex powers of $P_{1,T}$ lie far outside the Boutet de Monvel
calculus, the standard consideration of holomorphic families is not really
useful here; instead we have developed a resolvent parametric method, where
results from our calculus of parameter-dependent boundary operators can be
used.

main result is that the exponential growth of $F_n$ for $0<p\le 1$ (linear
case) or for $1/3\le p\le 1$ (non-linear case) is almost surely given by
$$\int_0^\infty \log x d\nu_\alpha (x), $$ where $\alpha$ is an explicit
function of $p$ depending on the case we consider, and $\nu_\alpha$ is an
explicit probability distribution on $\RR_+$ defined inductively on
Stern-Brocot intervals. In the non-linear case, the largest Lyapunov exponent
is not an analytic function of $p$, since we prove that it is equal to zero for
$0<p\le1/3$. We also give some results about the variations of the largest
Lyapunov exponent, and provide a formula for its derivative.

characterize them. We investigate school friendship networks from the Add

networks do not form a single connected component through mutual strong
nominations within a school, while under weaker conditions such
interconnectedness is present. We extract the networks of overlapping
communities at the schools (c-networks) and find that they are scale free and
disassortative in contrast to the direct friendship networks, which have an
exponential degree distribution and are assortative. Based on the network
analysis we study the ethnic preferences in friendship selection. The clique
percolation method we use reveals that when in minority, the students tend to
build more densely interconnected groups of friends. We also find an asymmetry
in the behavior of black minorities in a white majority as compared to that of
white minorities in a black majority.

that are based on theoretical arguments but supported only by experiments
having a fairly limited range. These modifications relate to a diffusion of
fluid volume that would be significant for flows with high density gradients.
So the viscous structure of shock waves in gases should provide an excellent
test case for this new model. In this paper we detail the shock structure
problem and propose exponents for the gas viscosity-temperature relation based
on empirical viscosity data that is independent of shock experiments. We then
simulate shocks in the range Mach 1.0-12.0 using the Navier-Stokes equations,
both with and without Brenner's modifications. Initial simulations showed
Brenner's modifications display unphysical behaviour when the coefficient of
volume diffusion exceeds the kinematic viscosity. Our subsequent analyses
attribute this behaviour to both an instability to temporal disturbances and a
spurious phase velocity-frequency relationship. On equating the volume
diffusivity to the kinematic viscosity, however, we find the results with
Brenner's modifications are significantly better than those of the standard
Navier-Stokes equations, and broadly similar to those from the family of
extended hydrodynamic models that includes the Burnett equations. Brenner's
modifications add only two terms to the Navier-Stokes equations, and the
numerical implementation is much simpler than conventional extended
hydrodynamic models, particularly in respect of boundary conditions. We
recommend further investigation and testing on a number of different benchmark
non-equilibrium flow cases.

the $\ket{+_{\pi\over 4}}:={1/\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0}+e^{i{\pi\over 4}}\ket{1})$
state, and the usual $\ket{+}:={1/ \sqrt{2}}(\ket{0}+\ket{1})$ state. We prove
the universality of this quantum computation model, and establish a
standardization procedure which permits all entanglement and state preparation
to be performed at the beginning of computation. This leads us to develop a
direct approach to fault-tolerance by simple transformations of the
entanglement graph and preparation operations, while error correction is
performed naturally via syndrome-extracting teleportations.

reservoir and a quantum Brownian particle leads to the formation of a dynamical
steady state which is characterized by an effective temperature above the
temperature of the environment. The average steady state energy of the system
has a higher value than expected from the environmental properties. The system
experiences repeatedly a non-Markovian behavior -- as a consequence the
corresponding effective decay for long evolution times is always on average
stronger than the Markovian one. We also highlight the consequences of the
scheme to the Zeno--anti-Zeno crossover which depends, in addition to the
periodicity $\tau$, also on the total evolution time of the system.

isothermal and isochoric processes for quantum thermodynamic cycles. Based on
these results the quantum versions of both the Carnot heat engine and the Otto
heat engine are defined without ambiguities. We also study the properties of
quantum Carnot and Otto heat engines in comparison with their classical
counterparts. Relations and mappings between these two quantum heat engines are
also investigated by considering their respective quantum thermodynamic
processes. In addition, we discuss the role of Maxwell's demon in quantum
thermodynamic cycles. We find that there is no violation of the second law,
even in the existence of such a demon, when the demon is included correctly as
part of the working substance of the heat engine.
