PMS emission objects with spectral type G, which we include in a separated

extremely energetic counterparts possessing ultrarelativistic energies, and the
ability to inject and accelerate electrons in both non-relativistic and

long-term evolution code that enables a continuous calculation through an

exceeding) a Hubble time. Starting with two sets of the three independent nova
parameters -- the white dwarf mass, the temperature of its isothermal core, and
the rate of mass transfer on to it -- we have followed the evolution of two
models, with initial masses of 1 and 0.65 solar masses, accretion rates
(constant throughout each calculation) of 1e-11 and 1e-9 solar-masses/yr, and
relatively high initial temperatures (as they are likely to be at the onset of
the outburst phase), through over 1000 and over 3000 cycles, respectively. The
results show that although on the short-term consecutive outbursts are almost
identical, on the long-term scale the characteristics change. This is mainly
due to the changing core temperature, which decreases very similarly to that of
a cooling white dwarf for a time, but at a slower rate thereafter. As the white
dwarf's mass continually decreases, since both models lose more mass than they
accrete, the central pressure decreases accordingly. The outbursts on the
massive white dwarf change gradually from fast to moderately fast, and the
other characteristics (velocity, abundance ratios, isotopic ratios) change,
too. Very slowly, a steady state is reached, where all characteristics, both in
quiescence and in outburst, remain almost constant. For the less massive white
dwarf accreting at a high rate, outbursts are similar throughout the evolution.

With the competition between charge, spin, and orbital degrees of freedom, it
is not surprising that the surface behavior may be profoundly different than
that of the bulk. Using a powerful combination of two surface probes, tunneling
and polarized x-ray interactions, this paper reviews our work on the nature of
the electronic and magnetic states at manganite surfaces and interfaces. The
general observation is that ferromagnetism is not the lowest energy state at
the surface or interface, which results in a suppression or even loss of
ferromagnetic order at the surface. Two cases will be discussed ranging from
the surface of the quasi-2D bilayer manganite
(La$_{2-2x}$Sr$_{1+2x}$Mn$_2$O$_7$) to the 3D Perovskite
(La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$)/SrTiO$_3$ interface. For the bilayer manganite,
that is, ferromagnetic and conducting in the bulk, these probes present clear
evidence for an intrinsic insulating non-ferromagnetic surface layer atop
adjacent subsurface layers that display the full bulk magnetization. This
abrupt intrinsic magnetic interface is attributed to the weak inter-bilayer
coupling native to these quasi-two-dimensional materials. This is in marked
contrast to the non-layered manganite system
(La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$), whose magnetization near the interface
is less than half the bulk value at low temperatures and decreases with
increasing temperature at a faster rate than the bulk.

machine to the sequence context is controllable, resulting in different
characteristic behaviours. The model can store and predict on-line sequences of
various types and length. Numerical simulations on the model have been carried
out to determine its properties.

relate two different semi-classical approximations of the Green function and
see how this indicates the bulk-boundary correspondence. From a key observation

geodesic approximation from the saddle point approximation. As an application,
we find saddles of the Green function and hence their corresponding geodesics.
The conclusion is that some of these geodesics do go inside the horizon. This
gives the possibility of resolving the singularity from the boundary theory.

serves both as an expository work and as a description of new research. At the
heart of the memoir, we introduce and study a poset $NC^{(k)}(W)$ for each
finite Coxeter group $W$ and for each positive integer $k$. When $k=1$, our
definition coincides with the generalized noncrossing partitions introduced by
Brady-Watt and Bessis. When $W$ is the symmetric group, we obtain the poset of
classical $k$-divisible noncrossing partitions, first studied by Edelman.
  Along the way, we include a comprehensive introduction to related background
material. Before defining our generalization $NC^{(k)}(W)$, we develop from
scratch the theory of algebraic noncrossing partitions $NC(W)$. This involves
studying a finite Coxeter group $W$ with respect to its generating set $T$ of
{\em all} reflections, instead of the usual Coxeter generating set $S$. This is
the first time that this material has appeared in one place.
  Finally, it turns out that our poset $NC^{(k)}(W)$ shares many enumerative
features in common with the ``generalized nonnesting partitions'' of
Athanasiadis and the ``generalized cluster complexes'' of Fomin and Reading. In
particular, there is a generalized ``Fuss-Catalan number'', with a nice closed
formula in terms of the invariant degrees of $W$, that plays an important role
in each case. We give a basic introduction to these topics, and we describe
several conjectures relating these three families of ``Fuss-Catalan objects''.

function and Fourier analysis. The estimators are shown to be uniformly

we apply our procedure to the analysis of breast cancer and HIV microarray data

globally hyperbolic spacetime $(X^{m+1}, g)$. The spherical cotangent bundle
$ST^*M$ is identified with the space $N$ of all null geodesics in $(X,g).$
Hence the set of null geodesics passing through a point $x\in X$ gives an
embedded $(m-1)$-sphere $S_x$ in $N=ST^*M$ called the sky of $x.$ Low observed
that if the link $(S_x, S_y)$ is nontrivial, then $x,y\in X$ are causally
related. This motivated the problem (communicated by Penrose) on the Arnold's
1998 problem list to apply link theory to the study of causality. The spheres
$S_x$ are isotopic to fibers of $(ST^*M)^{2m-1}\to M^m.$ They are nonzero
homologous and $lk(S_x,S_y)$ is undefined when $M$ is closed, while $alk(S_x,
S_y)$ is well defined. Moreover, $alk(S_x, S_y)\in Z$ if $M$ is not an
odd-dimensional rational homology sphere. We give a formula for the increment
of $\alk$ under passages through Arnold dangerous tangencies. If $(X,g)$ is
such that $alk$ takes values in $\Z$ and $g$ is conformal to $g'$ having all
the timelike sectional curvatures nonnegative, then $x, y\in X$ are causally
related if and only if $alk(S_x,S_y)\neq 0$. We show that $x,y$ in
nonrefocussing $(X, g)$ are causally unrelated iff $(S_x, S_y)$ can be deformed
to a pair of $S^{m-1}$-fibers of $ST^*M\to M$ by an isotopy through skies. Low

schemes for reflected Brownian motion on bounded Euclidean domains. For a class
of bounded domains $D$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that includes all bounded Lipschitz
domains and the von Koch snowflake domain, we show that the laws of both
discrete and continuous time simple random walks on $D\cap2^{-k}\mathbb{Z}^n$
moving at the rate $2^{-2k}$ with stationary initial distribution converge
weakly in the space $\mathbf{D}([0,1],\mathbb{R}^n)$, equipped with the
Skorokhod topology, to the law of the stationary reflected Brownian motion on
$D$. We further show that the following ``myopic conditioning'' algorithm
generates, in the limit, a reflected Brownian motion on any bounded domain $D$.
For every integer $k\geq1$, let $\{X^k_{j2^{-k}},j=0,1,2,...\}$ be a discrete
time Markov chain with one-step transition probabilities being the same as
those for the Brownian motion in $D$ conditioned not to exit $D$ before time
$2^{-k}$. We prove that the laws of $X^k$ converge to that of the reflected
Brownian motion on $D$. These approximation schemes give not only new ways of
constructing reflected Brownian motion but also implementable algorithms to
simulate reflected Brownian motion.

positivity constraints imposed by quantum physics. The data consists of $n$
i.i.d. observations from a probability density equal to the Radon transform of

prove that it is minimax efficient for the pointwise risk over a class of

Cavalier in the context of positron emission tomography. Our work extends this
result to the space of smooth Wigner functions, which is the relevant parameter
space for quantum homodyne tomography.

expose the role of various quantum requirements. These are, e.g., the
uncertainty relation among non-commuting operators, and the no-cloning theorem
which forces the complete elimination of the teleported state at its initial

proving lower bounds on quantum query complexity. It gives optimal lower bounds
for many problems, has application to classical complexity in formula size
lower bounds, and is versatile with equivalent formulations in terms of weight
schemes, eigenvalues, and Kolmogorov complexity. All these formulations rely on
the principle that if an algorithm successfully computes a function then, in
particular, it is able to distinguish between inputs which map to different
values.
  We present a stronger version of the adversary method which goes beyond this
principle to make explicit use of the stronger condition that the algorithm
actually computes the function. This new method, which we call ADV+-, has all
the advantages of the old: it is a lower bound on bounded-error quantum query
complexity, its square is a lower bound on formula size, and it behaves well
with respect to function composition. Moreover ADV+- is always at least as
large as the adversary method ADV, and we show an example of a monotone
function for which ADV+-(f)=Omega(ADV(f)^1.098). We also give examples showing
that ADV+- does not face limitations of ADV like the certificate complexity
barrier and the property testing barrier.
