luminous relativistic jet observed at any redshift, exceeding 10^45 erg/s in
both the radio and X-ray bands. Apart from the jet's extreme redshift,
luminosity, and high inferred equipartition magnetic field (in comparison to
local analogues), its basic properties such as X-ray/radio morphology and radio
polarization are similar to lower-redshift examples. Its resolved linear
structure and the convex broad-band spectral energy distributions of three
distinct knots are also a common feature among known powerful X-ray jets at
lower-redshift. Relativistically beamed inverse Compton and `non-standard'
synchrotron models have been considered to account for such excess X-ray
emission in other jets; both models are applicable to this high-redshift
example but with differing requirements for the underlying jet physical
properties, such as velocity, energetics, and electron acceleration processes.
One potentially very important distinguishing characteristic between the two
models is their strongly diverging predictions for the X-ray/radio emission
with increasing redshift. This is considered, though with the limited sample of
three z>3 jets it is apparent that future studies targeted at very
high-redshift jets are required for further elucidation of this issue. Finally,
from the broad-band jet emission we estimate the jet kinetic power to be no
less than 10^46 erg/s, which is about 10% of the Eddington luminosity

indications that the new FF star, Sakurai's Object (V4334 Sgr), which appeared

overdensity. We correct for projection effects, by determining the galaxy
surface number density profile in our cluster sample. This is best fitted by a
cored King profile in low and intermediate mass systems. The core radius
decreases with cluster mass, and, for the highest mass clusters, the profile is
better represented by a generalized King profile or a cuspy Navarro, Frenk &
White profile. We find a very tight proportionality between $L_{op}$ and
$N_{gal}$, which, in turn, links the cluster mass-to-light ratio to the Halo
Occupation Distribution $N_{gal}$ vs. $M_{200}$. After correcting for
projection effects, the slope of the $L_{op}-M_{200}$ and $N_{gal}-M_{200}$

elliptical and lenticular galaxies. The selected objects come from a
representative sample of nearby galaxies earlier studied at optical wavelengths
with the integral-field spectrograph Sauron. We detect HI - both in regular
discs as well as in clouds and tails off-set from the host galaxy - in 70% of
the galaxies. This detection rate is much higher than in previous, shallower
single-dish surveys, and is similar to that for the ionised gas. The results
suggest that at faint detection levels the presence of HI is a relatively
common characteristic of field early-type galaxies. The observed total HI
masses range between a few times 10^6 Msun to just over 10^9 Msun. The presence
of regular disc-like structures is a situation as common as HI in offset clouds
and tails around early-type galaxies. All galaxies where HI is detected also
contain ionised gas, whereas no HI is found around galaxies without ionised
gas. Galaxies with regular HI discs tend to have strong emission from ionised
gas. In these cases, the similar kinematics of the neutral hydrogen and ionised
gas suggest that they form one structure. We do not find a clear trend between
the presence of HI and the global age of the stellar population or the global
dynamical characteristics of the galaxies. Our observations support the idea
that gas accretion is common and does not happen exclusively in peculiar
early-type galaxies. For the majority of the cases the gas is likely acquired
through merging, but the lack of correlation with the stellar population age
suggests that smooth, cold accretion could be an alternative scenario, at least
in some galaxies. In either cases, the data suggest that early-type galaxies
continue to build their mass up to the present.

hole accretion discs at high luminosity, under the hypothesis that radiation
pressure dominated discs are subject to violent clumping instabilities and, as
a result, have a highly inhomogeneous two-phase structure. After deriving the
full accretion disc solutions explicitly in terms of the parameters of the
model, we study their radiative properties both with a simple two-zones model,
treatable analytically, and with radiative transfer simulations which account
simultaneously for energy balance and Comptonisation in the hot phase, together
with reflection, reprocessing, ionization and thermal balance in the cold
phase. We show that, if not only the density, but also the heating rate within
these flows is inhomogeneous, then complex reflection-dominated spectra can be
obtained for a high enough covering fraction of the cold phase. In general,
large reflection components in the observed X-ray spectra should be associated
with strong soft excesses, resulting from the combined emission of ionized
atomic emission lines. The variability properties of such systems are such
that, even when contributing to a large fraction of the hard X-ray spectrum,
the reflection component is less variable than the power-law like emission
originating from the hot Comptonising phase, in agreement with what is observed
in many Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies and bright Seyfert 1. Our model falls
within the family of those trying to explain the complex X-ray spectra of
bright AGN with ionized reflection, but presents an alternative, specific,
physically motivated, geometrical setup for the complex multi-phase structure
of the inner regions of near-Eddington accretion flows.

detailed model of the photophysics of interstellar PAHs is required for such
single-molecule identification of their far-IR features in the presently
available Infrared Space Observatory data and in those of the forthcoming
Herschel Space Observatory mission. Methods. We modelled the detailed
photophysics of a vast sample of species in different radiation fields, using a
compendium of Monte-Carlo techniques and quantum-chemical calculations. This
enabled us to validate the use of purely theoretical data and assess the
expected accuracy and reliability of the resulting synthetic far-IR emission
spectra. Results. We produce positions and intensities of the expected far-IR
features which ought to be emitted by each species in the sample in the
considered radiation fields. A composite emission spectrum for our sample is
computed for one of the most favourable sources for detection, namely the Red
Rectangle nebula. The resulting spectrum is compared with the estimated dust
emission in the same source, to assess the dependence of detectability on key
molecular parameters. Conclusions. Identifying specific PAHs from their far-IR
features is going to be a difficult feat in general, still it may well be
possible under favourable conditions.

The threshold and energy resolution of the golden channel detector have the
most promising optimization potential. This, in turn, could be used to lower

establish a superior performance for a neutrino factory in the case \sin^2 2

with full account of detection efficiencies, in the framework of a chiral
unitary description with coupled-channel final state interactions between pi-pi

strange and nonstrange scalar form factors of the pion and the kaon, which
include the final state interaction and are constrained by unitarity and by
matching to the next-to-leading-order chiral expressions. This procedure allows
for a calculation of the S-wave component of the dimeson spectrum including the

problems: the problems of reproducing the correct scale for electroweak
symmetry breaking, the correct abundance for dark matter, and small rates for
flavor violating processes. We argue that the first two problems point to
particular regions of parameter space in models with weak scale supersymmetry:
those with a small mu term. This has an interesting implication on direct dark
matter detection experiments. We find that, if the signs of the three gaugino
mass parameters are all equal, we can obtain a solid lower bound on the
spin-independent neutralino-nucleon cross section, \sigma. In the case that the
gaugino masses satisfy the unified mass relations, we obtain \sigma > 4 x
10^{-46} cm^2 (1 x 10^{-46} cm^2) for fine-tuning in electroweak symmetry
breaking no worse than 10% (5%). We also discuss a possibility that the three
problems listed above are all connected to the hierarchy of fermion masses.
This occurs if supersymmetry breaking and electroweak symmetry breaking (the
Higgs fields) are coupled to matter fields with similar hierarchical
structures. The discovery of mu -> e transition processes in near future
experiments is predicted in such a framework.

Higgs boson decays with flavor changing neutral currents (FCNC) in the
framework of generic Two Higgs Doblet Models (2HDM) and the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). We have applied these two extensions to
the SM to see whether they can produce new FCNC effects. Introductory chapters
deal with the 2HDM and the MSSM. In the next chapters we have computed the
following FCNC decays: (1) the branching ratios (B) of the top quark to Higgs
bosons and charm quark in the 2HDM; (2) B and number of events at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) of the Higgs bosons to top and charm quarks in the 2HDM;
(3) B of the Higgs bosons to bottom and strange quarks in the MSSM; (4) cross
section and number of events at the LHC of the Higgs bosons to FCNC final
states involving the heavy quarks like the top and bottom quark in the MSSM
(Higgs bosons = h^0, H^0, A^0). We also studied the experimental signatures
that would allow discover of the nature of these Higgs bosons in the LHC. In
this study we have applied the severe restrictions from observed low-energy
FCNC processes like b -> s\gamma. Our general conclusion is that the physics of
the processes with flavor changing neutral currents can be very important in
seeing the physics beyond the Standard Model and to disentangle the nature of
the most adequate model. Experiments at the LHC can be crucial to unravel signs
of FCNC physics beyond the SM.

is broken by an uplifting brane as in KKLT compactification, again
independently of the detailed form of the moduli K\""ahler potential, the
moduli-mediated gaugino masses at the compactification scale are universal
also, and are comparable to the anomaly-mediated gaugino masses. As a result,
both the gauge coupling unification at high energy scale and the mirage

C=(GL(2,F)xGL(2,F))'/F^x (F^x embeds diagonally, prime means equal
determinants). It is a twisted elliptic endoscopic group of PGL(4). We deduce
from the computation that \chi_\pi is an unstable function: its value at one
twisted regular elliptic conjugacy class with norm in C is minus its value at
the other class within the twisted stable conjugacy class, and zero at the
classes without norm in C. Moreover \pi is the unstable endoscopic lift of the
trivial representation of C. Naturally, this computation plays a role in the
theory of lifting from C (=``SO(4,F)'') and PGp(2,F) to PGL(4,F) using the
trace formula. Our work develops a 4-dimensional analogue of the model of the

the consumer networks formed using direct interactions (e.g., communications)

emphasis on the statistical methods used and the data to which these methods
have been applied. We also provide a discussion of challenges and opportunities
for this burgeoning research topic. Our survey highlights a gap in the
literature. Because of inadequate data, prior studies have not been able to
provide direct, statistical support for the hypothesis that network linkage can
directly affect product/service adoption. Using a new data set that represents
the adoption of a new telecommunications service, we show very strong support
for the hypothesis. Specifically, we show three main results: (1) ``Network
neighbors''--those consumers linked to a prior customer--adopt the service at a
rate 3--5 times greater than baseline groups selected by the best practices of
the firm's marketing team. In addition, analyzing the network allows the firm
to acquire new customers who otherwise would have fallen through the cracks,
because they would not have been identified based on traditional attributes.
(2) Statistical models, built with a very large amount of geographic,
demographic and prior purchase data, are significantly and substantially
improved by including network information. (3) More detailed network
information allows the ranking of the network neighbors so as to permit the
selection of small sets of individuals with very high probabilities of
adoption.

stimulated Raman (ORSR) scattering can be effectively used for excitation of
the quadrupole states in high-frequency (quadrupole plasmon) and low-frequency
(infrared) regions, respectively. In ORSR, isolated dipole particle-hole states
as well as the tail of the dipole plasmon can serve as an intermediate state. A
simultaneous study of low- and high-frequency quadrupoles, combining DTP and
ORSR, is most effective. Femtosecond pulses with intensities $I = 2\cdot
10^{10} - 2\cdot 10^{11} W/cm^2$ and pulse durations $T = 200 - 500$ fs are
found to be optimal. Since the low-lying quadrupole states are dominated by one
single electron-hole pair, their energies, being combined with the
photoelectron data for hole states, allow to get the electron spectrum above
the Fermi level and thus greatly extend our knowledge on the single particle
spectra of clusters. Besides, the developed schemes allow to estimate the
