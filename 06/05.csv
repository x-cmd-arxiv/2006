spectrum of the system in the hard X-ray band does not reveal the presence of a

fragmentation has on the validity of at least six common assumptions on the
Virial Theorem (VT), which are: (i) the only role of turbulent motions within a
cloud is to provide support against collapse, (ii) the surface terms are
negligible compared to the volumetric ones, (iii) the gravitational term is a
binding source for the clouds, (iv) the sign of the second-time derivative of
the moment of inertia determines whether the cloud is contracting or expanding,
(v) interstellar clouds are in Virial Equilibrium (VE), and (vi) Larson's
(1981) relations are the observational proof that clouds are in VE.
Interstellar clouds cannot fulfill these assumptions, however, because
turbulent fragmentation will induce flux of mass, moment and energy between the
clouds and their environment, and will favor local collapse while may disrupt
the clouds within a dynamical timescale. It is argued that, although the
observational and numerical evidence suggests that interstellar clouds are not
in VE, the so-called ``Virial Mass'' estimations, which actually should be
called ``energy-equipartition mass'' estimations, are good order-of magnitude
estimations of the actual mass of the clouds just because observational surveys
will tend to detect interstellar clouds appearing to be close to energy
equipartition. However, since clouds are actually out of VE, as suggested by
asymmetrical line profiles, they should be transient entities. These results
are compatible with observationally-based estimations for rapid star formation.
, and call into question the models for the star formation efficiency based on
clouds being in VE.

nonrelativistic shocks, we present an analytic treatment of the electron
injection. We estimate the velocity distribution of the injected electrons as
the product of the post-shock thermal distribution of electrons times the
probability for electrons with a given velocity to be accelerated; the
injection efficiency is then evaluated as the integral of this velocity
distribution. We estimate the probability of a particle to be injected as that
of going back to the upstream region at least once. This is the product of the
probability of returning to the shock from downstream times that of recrossing
the shock from downstream to upstream. The latter probability is expected to be
sensitive to details of the process of electron thermalisation within the
(collisionless) shock, a process that is poorly known. In order to include this
effect, for our treatment we use results of a numerical, fully kinetic study,
by Bykov & Uvarov (1999). According to them, the probability of recrossing
depends on physics of thermalisation through a single free parameter (Gamma),
which can be expressed as a function of the Mach number of the shock, of the
level of electron-ion equilibration, as well as of the spectrum of turbulence.
It becomes apparent, from our analysis, that the injection efficiency is
related to the post-shock electron temperature, and that it results from the
balance between two competing effects: the higher the electron temperature, the
higher the fraction of downstream electrons with enough velocity to return to
the shock and thus to be ready to cross the shock from downstream to upstream;
at the same time, however, the higher the turbulence, which would hinder the
crossing.

kT = 7.4 (+2.7,-1.8) keV (90 % confidence); if there is an undetected central

a lower limit on the dimensionless spin parameter of a* greater than 0.98. Our
result is robust in the sense that it is independent of the details of the data
analysis and insensitive to the uncertainties in the mass and distance of the
black hole. Furthermore, our accretion-disk model includes an advanced
treatment of spectral hardening. Our data selection relies on a rigorous and
quantitative definition of the thermal state of black hole binaries, which we
used to screen all of the available RXTE and ASCA data for the thermal state of
GRS 1915+105. In addition, we focus on those data for which the accretion disk
luminosity is less than 30% of the Eddington luminosity. We argue that these
low-luminosity data are most appropriate for the thin alpha-disk model that we
employ. We assume that there is zero torque at the inner edge of the disk, as
is likely when the disk is thin, although we show that the presence of a
significant torque does not affect our results. Our model and the model of the
relativistic jets observed for this source constrain the distance and black
hole mass and could thus be tested by determining a VLBA parallax distance and
improving the measurement of the mass function. Finally, we comment on the

generation of model atmospheres are significantly lower than the earlier
standard values. In Paper I we demonstrated that a low solar metallicity is
inconsistent with helioseismology if the quoted errors in the atmospheres
models (of order 0.05 dex) are correct. In this paper we undertake a critical
analysis of the solar metallicity and its uncertainty from a model atmospheres
perspective, focusing on CNO. We argue that the non-LTE corrections for
abundances derived from atomic features are overestimated in the recent
abundance studies, while systematic errors in the absolute abundances are
underestimated. If we adopt the internal consistency between different
indicators as a measure of goodness of fit, we obtain intermediate abundances
[C/H] = 8.44 +/- 0.06, [N/H] = 7.96 +/- 0.10 and [O/H] = 8.75 +/- 0.08. The
errors are too large to conclude that there is a solar abundance problem, and
permit both the high and low scales. However, the center-to-limb continuum flux
variations predicted in the simulations appear to be inconsistent with solar
data, which would favor the traditional thermal structure and lead to high CNO
abundances of (8.52, 7.96, 8.80) close to the seismic scale. We argue that
further empirical tests of non-LTE corrections and the thermal structure are
required for precise absolute abundances. The implications for beryllium
depletion and possible sources of error in the numerical simulations are
discussed.

optical and X-ray variability among a statistically significant ensemble of PMS
stars, with the goal of elucidating the origins of PMS X-ray production. In
this first paper, we present the optical observations, describe the combined

Examples of both positive and negative time-correlations are found, possibly
representing X-ray flares and persistent coronal features associated with both
cool and hot surface spots (i.e. magnetically active regions and accretion
shocks). We also find two possible examples of ""white-light"" flares coincident
with X-ray flares; these may correspond to the impulsive heating phase in
solar-analog flares. However, though interesting, these represent unusual
cases. More generally, we find very little evidence to suggest a direct causal
link between the sources of optical and X-ray variability in PMS stars. The
conclusion that accretion is a primary driver of X-ray production in PMS stars

offset from the ULX (~ 80 pc). Its radio spectral index alpha ~ -0.7 suggests
optically-thin synchrotron emission, either from a young supernova remnant or
from a radio lobe powered by a ULX jet. An even brighter, unresolved radio
source (0.22 mJy at 4.79 GHz) is found in another young, massive stellar
complex, not associated with any X-ray sources: based on its flatter radio

shrinkage. Here we suggest an alternative explanation, assuming that a small

orbital angular momentum from the binary through tidal torques. We also perform
numerical calculations of the evolution of Algol binaries with typical initial
masses and orbital periods. The results indicate that, for reasonable input
parameters, the circumbinary disk can significantly influence the orbital
evolution, and cause the orbit to shrink on a sufficiently long timescale.
Rapid mass transfer in Algol binaries with low mass ratios can also be

r_0=9.2_{+1.5}_{-1.7} Mpc/h (comoving) assuming a power law correlation
function, with gamma=1.6. Applying this transverse clustering strength to the

overpredicts the number of absorbers along the line-of-sight by a large factor,
providing compelling evidence that the clustering pattern of optically thick

explanationfor the anisotropy is that the transverse direction is less likely
to be illuminated by ionizing photons than the line-of-sight, and that
absorbers along the line-of-sight are being photoevaporated. A simple model for
the photoevaporation of absorbers subject to the ionizing flux of a quasar is

IRAS point sources. We have obtained 7 maser detections, 6 of which (in CB 34,
CB 54, CB 65, CB 101, CB 199, and CB 232) are reported for the first time here.
Most of the water masers we detected are likely to be associated with young
stellar objects (YSOs), except for CB 101 (probably an evolved object) and CB
65 (uncertain nature). The water maser in CB 199 shows a relatively high shift
(~30 km/s) of its velocity centroid with respect to the cloud velocity, which
is unusual for low-mass YSOs. We speculate that high-velocity masers in this
kind of object could be related with episodes of energetic mass-loss in close
binaries. Alternatively, the maser in CB 199 could be pumped by a
protoplanetary or a young planetary nebula. CB 232 is the smallest Bok globule
(~0.6 pc) known to be associated with water maser emission, although it would
be superseded by the cases of CB 65 (~0.3 pc) and CB 199 (~0.5 pc) if their
association with YSOs is confirmed. All our selection criteria have
statistically compatible detection rates, except for IRAS sources, which tend
to be a somewhat worse predictor for the presence of maser emission.

and turbulent pumping from local convection calculations are presented. We
estimate the magnitude of these effects to be around 2-3 m/s. The rotation
profile of the Sun as obtained from helioseismology is applied. We obtain an
estimate of the ratio of the two induction effects, C_alpha/C_Omega \approx
10^-3, which we keep fixed in all models. We also include a one-cell meridional
circulation pattern having a magnitude of 10-20 m/s near the surface and 1-2
m/s at the bottom of the convection zone. The model essentially represents a
distributed turbulent dynamo, as the alpha-effect is nonzero throughout the
convection zone, although it concentrates near the bottom of the convection
zone obtaining a maximum around 30 degrees of latitude. Turbulent pumping of
the mean fields is predominantly down- and equatorward. We find that, when all
these effects are included in the model, it is possible to correctly reproduce
many features of the solar activity cycle, namely the correct equatorward
migration at low latitudes and the polar branch at high latitudes, and the
observed negative sign of B_r B_phi. Although the activity clearly shifts
towards the equator in comparison to previous models due to the combined action
of the alpha-effect peaking at midlatitudes, meridional circulation and
latitudinal pumping, most of the activity still occurs at too high latitudes
(between 5-60 degrees). Other problems include the relatively narrow parameter
space within which the preferred solution is dipolar (A0), and the somewhat too
short cycle lengths of the solar-type solutions. The role of the surface shear
layer is found to be important only in the case where the alpha-effect has an
appreciable magnitude near the surface.

depth from the spectra of high-redshift quasars. We confirm previous results
demonstrating that such a non-Gaussian distribution leads to a slower
reionization as compared to the Gaussian case. We further show that the recent
WMAP three-year measurement of the optical depth due to electron scattering,
$\tau=0.09 \pm 0.03$, weakly constrains the allowed deviations from Gaussianity
on the small scales relevant to reionization if a constant spectral index is
assumed. We also confirm the need for a significant suppression of star
formation in mini-halos, which increases dramatically as we decrease $\nu$.

transition temperature from the normal phase to an e-h pair condensed one is
studied to clarify the crossover from an e-h BCS-like state to an excitonic
Bose-Einstein condensation, which takes place on increasing the e-h attraction
strength. To investigate effects of the repulsive interaction and the e-h mass
difference, we calculate the transition temperature for various parameters of
the interaction strengths, the e-h particle density, and the mass difference.
While the transition temperature in the e-h BCS regime is sufficiently
suppressed by the repulsive interaction, that of the excitonic BEC is largely
insensitive to it. We also show quantitatively that in the whole regime the
mass difference leads to large suppression of the transition temperature.

described and they may be principally different in nature. Mobile electron
spins are considered as being free in all the contacting ferromagnetic layers.
Joint action of the following two current effects is investigated: the
nonequilibrium longitudinal spin-injection effective field and the transverse
spin-transfer surface torque. Dispersion relation for fluctuations is derived
and solved for a junction model having spatially localized spin transfer
torque: depth of the torque penetration into the free layer is assumed much
smaller than the total free layer thickness. Some critical value of the well
known Gilbert damping constant is established for the first time. Spin transfer
torque dominates in the instability threshold determination for small enough
damping constants, while the spin-injection effective field dominates for high
damping. Fine interplay between spin transfer torque and spin injection is
necessary to provide a hysteretic behavior of the resistance versus current
dependence. The state diagram building up shows the possibility of
non-stationary (time dependent) nonlinear states arising due to instability
development. Calculations lead to the instability rise time values of the order
of 0.1 ns. Spin wave resonance frequency spectrum softening occurs under the
current growing to the instability threshold. Magnetization fluctuations above
the threshold rise oscillating with time for low damping, but rise
aperiodically and much more rapid for high damping.

magnetically like low-spin Co4+ ions. The Weiss temperature of NaxCoO2 is more
negative along the direction of the lower g-factor (i.e., Theta_parallel <

the metallic properties. The picture of the magnetic structure derived from
neutron scattering studies below ~22 K are in apparent conflict with that
deduced from magnetic susceptibility measurements between ~50 - 300 K. These

a modification to oscillation behaviour, as well as a power-law cutoff of the

space-time foam configurations of quantum-fluctuating charged black holes as a
way of generating (parts of) neutrino mass differences, mimicking appropriately
the celebrated MSW effects of neutrinos in stochastically fluctuating random
media. We pay particular attention to disentangling genuine quantum-gravity
effects from ordinary effects due to the propagation of a neutrino through
ordinary matter. Our results are of interest to precision tests of quantum

system to the standard D-brane inflation scenarios, such as brane-antibrane
inflation, D3/D7 brane inflation and different configurations of branes at
angles. This can then be seen as a generalised approach to inflation from open
string modes. Inflation ends when the Wilson lines achieve a critical value and
an open string mode becomes tachyonic. Then hybrid-like inflation, including
its cosmic string remnants, is realized in string theory beyond the brane
annihilation picture. Our formalism can be incorporated within flux-induced
moduli stabilisation mechanisms in type IIB strings. Also, contrary to the
standard D-brane separation, Wilson lines can be considered in heterotic string
models. We provide explicit examples to illustrate similarities and differences

In particular, we shall see that this matching of CFT's, this duality between
noneffective gaugings and sigma models on disconnected targets, is a worldsheet
duality related to T-duality. We perform a wide variety of tests of this claim,
ranging from checking partition functions at arbitrary genus to D-branes to

D-strings are formed at the end of inflation. Within the supergravity model of
D-strings there are 2(n-1) chiral fermion zero modes for a D-string of winding
n. Using the bounds on the relic vorton density, we show that D-strings with
winding number n>1 are more strongly constrained than cosmic strings arising in
cosmological phase transitions. The D-string tension of such vortons, if they
survive until the present, has to satisfy 8\pi G_N \mu \lesssim p 10^{-26}
where p is the intercommutation probability. Similarly, D-strings coupled with
spectator fermions carry currents and also need to respect the above bound.
D-strings with n=1 do not carry currents and evade the bound. We discuss the
coupling of D-strings to supersymmetry breaking. When a single U(1) gauge group
is present, we show that there is an incompatibility between spontaneous
supersymmetry breaking and cosmic D-strings. We propose an alternative
mechanism for supersymmetry breaking, which includes an additional U(1), and
might alleviate the problem. We conjecture what effect this would have on the
fermion zero modes.

transformations contains the Lorentz group as the inertial special case. In the
limit of small forces and velocities, it reduces to the expected Hamilton
transformations leaving invariant the symplectic metric and the nonrelativistic

c and relative forces by b. Spacetime is no longer an invariant subspace but is
relative to noninertial observer frames. Born was lead to the metric by a

  For large b, such effects will almost certainly only manifest in a quantum
regime. Wigner showed that special relativistic quantum mechanics follows from
the projective representations of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group. Projective
representations of a Lie group are equivalent to the unitary reprentations of
its central extension. The same method of projective representations of the

from complex systems such as outages in the US power grid, the robustness
properties of cell biology networks, and trade links and the propagation of
both currency crises and disease. We consider networks which are populated by
agents which are heterogeneous in terms of their fitness for survival. The
network evolves over time, and in each period agents take self-interested
decisions to increase their fitness for survival to form alliances which
increase the connectivity of the network. The network is subjected to external
negative shocks both with respect to the size of the shock and the spatial
impact of the shock. We examine the size/frequency distribution of extinctions
and how this distribution evolves as the connectivity of the network grows. The
results are robust with respect to the choice of statistical distribution of
the shocks. We find that increasing the number of connections causes an
increase in the average fitness of agents, yet at the same time makes the
system as whole more vulnerable to catastrophic failure/extinction events on an
near-global scale.

we particularly focus on the first passage time problems in the truncated

arbitrarily large tail of the L$\acute{\rm e}$vy distribution is cut off. We

changes from $t^{-(\alpha +1)/\alpha}$-law (non-Gaussian L$\acute{\rm e}$vy

evaluate the average waiting time which is defined as the average time that
customers have to wait between any instant when they want to observe the rate

find that the assumption of exponential distribution for the first-passage

for explaining the stochastic process of the Sony Bank rate. Our approach also
enables us to evaluate the expected reward for customers, i.e. one can predict
how long customers must wait and how much reward they will obtain by the next
price change after they log in to their computer systems. We check the validity

dots coupled to micropillars and photonic bandgap cavities, and Cooper-pairs
interacting with superconducting resonators. Experiments with single, localized

resonators in high-finesse Fabry-Perot configurations. As a result of the
extreme technical challenges involved in further improving the multilayer
dielectric mirror coatings of these resonators and in scaling to large numbers

microcavity systems. Here we show strong coupling between individual Cesium
atoms and the fields of a high-quality toroidal microresonator. From
observations of transit events for single atoms falling through the resonator's
evanescent field, we determine the coherent coupling rate for interactions near
the surface of the resonator. We develop a theoretical model to quantify our
observations, demonstrating that strong coupling is achieved, with the rate of
coherent coupling exceeding the dissipative rates of the atom and the cavity.
Our work opens the way for investigations of optical processes with single
