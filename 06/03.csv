definitive extrasolar planet detected by microlensing. The light curve model
for this event predicts that the lens star should be separated from the source
star by ~6mas at the time of the HST images. If the lens star is a late G, K or
early M dwarf, then it will be visible in the HST images as an additional
source of light that is blended with the source image. Unless the lens and
source have exactly the same colors, its presence will also be revealed by a
systematic shift between centroids of the source plus lens in different filter
bands. The HST data indicates both of these effects: the HST source that
matches the position of the source star is 0.21 magnitudes brighter in the
ACS/HRC-F814W filter than the microlensing model predicts, and there is an
offset of ~0.7mas between the centroid of this source in the F814W and F435W
filter bands. We conclude the planetary host star has been detected in these
HST images, and this identification of the lens star enables a complete
solution of the lens system. The lens parameters are determined with a Bayesian
analysis, averaging over uncertainties in the measured parameters, interstellar
extinction, and allowing for the possibility of a binary companion to the
source star. This yields a stellar mass of M_* = 0.63(+0.07/-0.09) M_solar and
a planet mass of M_p = 2.6 (+0.8/-0.6) M_Jup at an orbital separation of 4.3
(+2.5/-0.8) AU. Thus, the lens system resembles our own Solar System, with a
planet of ~3 Jupiter-masses in a Jupiter-like orbit around a star of two-thirds
of a Solar mass. These conclusions can be tested with future HST images, which
should reveal a broadening of the blended source-plus-lens point spread
function due to the relative lens-source proper motion.

VIMOS VLT Deep Survey first observations of 21000 spectra in 1.75 square
degree. This sample, which is purely magnitude limited, free of morphological
or color selection biases, contains 130 broad line AGN (BLAGN) spectra with
redshift up to 5. Our data are divided into a wide (Iab < 22.5) and a deep (Iab
< 24) subsample containing 56 and 74 objects respectively. Because of its depth
and selection criteria, this sample is uniquely suited to study the population
of faint type-1 AGN. Our measured surface density (~ 472 +- 48 BLAGN per square
degree with Iab < 24) is significantly higher than that of any other optically
selected sample of BLAGN with spectroscopic confirmation. By applying a
morphological and color analysis to our AGN sample we find that: (1)~23% of the
AGN brighter than Iab=22.5 are classified as extended; this percentage
increases to ~42% for those with z < 1.6; (2) a non-negligible fraction of our
BLAGN are lying close to the color space area occupied by stars in u*-g' versus
g'-r' color-color diagram. This leads us to the conclusion that classical
optical ultraviolet preselection technique, if employed at such deep magnitudes
(Iab=22.5) in conjuction with a preselection of point-like sources, can miss
miss up to ~35% of the AGN population. Finally, we present a composite spectrum
of our sample of objects. While the continuum shape is very similar to that of
the SDSS composite at short wavelengths, it is much redder than it at lambda >
3000 A. We interpret this as due to significant contamination from emission of
the host galaxies, as expected from the faint absolute magnitudes sampled by

designed for operation in the astrophysically important 870 micron atmospheric

and chemistry of molecular clouds in the Galaxy and their direct relation to
star and planet formation. The advent of such a system will provide an order of
magnitude increase in mapping speed over what is now available and
revolutionize how observational astronomy is performed in this important
wavelength regime. Unlike the situation with bolometric detectors, heterodyne
receiver systems are coherent, retaining information about both the amplitude
and phase of the incident photon stream. From this information a high
resolution spectrum of the incident light can be obtained without multiplexing.
SuperCam will be constructed by stacking eight, 1x8 rows of fixed tuned, SIS
mixers. The IF output of each mixer will be connected to a low-noise, broadband
MMIC amplifier integrated into the mixer block. The instantaneous IF bandwidth
of each pixel will be ~2 GHz, with a center frequency of 5 GHz. A spectrum of
the central 500 MHz of each IF band will be provided by the array spectrometer.
Local oscillator power is provided by a frequency multiplier whose output is
divided between the pixels by using a matrix of waveguide power dividers. The
mixer array will be cooled to 4K by a closed-cycle refrigeration system.
SuperCam will reside at the Cassegrain focus of the 10m Heinrich Hertz
telescope (HHT). A prototype single row of the array will be tested on the HHT
in 2006, with the first engineering run of the full array in late 2007. The
array is designed and constructed so that it may be readily scaled to higher

velocity dispersions of these groups range from 125 to 650 km/s. Similar to
X-ray groups at low redshift, these systems contain a significant number of
early-type galaxies. Therefore, the trend for X-ray luminous groups to have
high early-type fractions is already in place by at least z=0.5. In 4 of the 9
groups, the X-ray emission is clearly peaked on the most luminous early-type
galaxy in the group. However, in several cases the central galaxy is composed
of multiple luminous nuclei, suggesting that the brightest group galaxy may
still be undergoing major mergers. In at least 3 of the groups in our sample, a
dominant early-type galaxy is not found at the center of the group potential.
This suggests that many of our groups are not dynamically evolved despite their
high X-ray luminosities. While similar systems have been identified at low
redshift, the X-ray luminosities of the intermediate redshift examples are one
to three orders of magnitude higher than those of their low redshift
counterparts. We suggest that this may be evidence for group downsizing: while
massive groups are still in the process of collapsing and virializing at
intermediate redshifts, only low-mass groups are in the process of forming at
the present day.

four of the six groups is also centered on a dominant early-type galaxy. The
lack of a bright elliptical galaxy at the peak of the group X-ray emission is
rare at low-redshifts, and the other two groups may be less dynamically

distributions of the galaxies at each mass and redshift interval are very
similar. At 0.3<z<2.7, we found that more massive galaxies always tend to have
a redder U-V color. High- and low-mass galaxies exhibit quite different color
evolutions. As seen in our previous study in HDF-N, the color distribution of
low-mass (M_stellar < 3x10^9M_solar) galaxies becomes significantly bluer with
an increase in the redshift. This evolution of the average color can be
explained by a constant star formation rate model with z_form~4. On the other
hand, the average color of high-mass galaxies (M_stellar > 3x10^10M_solar)
evolves more strongly at a high redshift. Such mass-dependent color
distribution and its evolution indicate that galaxies with a larger stellar
mass appear to have shorter star-formation timescales, and on an average, they
form the larger fraction of their stars in the earlier epoch.

using a combination of dirty paper coding and a generalization of the

theory is unavoidable. Two geometric counter-terms are needed to regularize the

responsible for a higher derivative metric gravitation. Starobinsky idea was
that these higher derivatives could mimic a cosmological constant. In this work
it is considered numerical solutions for general Bianchi I anisotropic
space-times in this higher derivative theory. The approach is ``experimental''
in the sense that there is no attempt to an analytical investigation of the
results. It is shown that for zero cosmological constant $\Lambda=0$, there are
sets of initial conditions which form basins of attraction that asymptote
Minkowski space. The complement of this set of initial conditions form basins
which are attracted to some singular solutions. It is also shown, for a
cosmological constant $\Lambda> 0$ that there are basins of attraction to a
specific de Sitter solution. This result is consistent with Starobinsky's
initial idea. The complement of this set also forms basins that are attracted
to some type of singular solution. Because the singularity is characterized by
curvature scalars, it must be stressed that the basin structure obtained is a

inhomogeneous cosmologies to scalar field cosmologies, allowing to reinterpret,
e.g., quintessence scenarios by routing the physical origin of the scalar field
source to inhomogeneities in the Universe. We investigate a one-parameter
family of scaling solutions to the backreaction problem. Subcases of these
solutions (all without an assumed cosmological constant) include
scale-dependent models with Friedmannian kinematics that can mimic the presence
of a cosmological constant or a time-dependent cosmological term. We explicitly
reconstruct the scalar field potential for the scaling solutions, and discuss
those cases that provide a solution to the Dark Energy and coincidence
problems. In this approach, Dark Energy emerges from morphon fields, a
mechanism that can be understood through the proposed correspondence: the
averaged cosmology is characterized by a weak decay (quintessence) or growth
(phantom quintessence) of kinematical fluctuations, fed by `curvature energy'
that is stored in the averaged 3-Ricci curvature. We find that the late-time
trajectories of those models approach attractors that lie in the future of a

deals with the second logarithmic derivative of the short distance coefficient
functions for deep inelastic scattering and the Drell-Yan process. A uniquely
defined Sudakov exponent emerges, and I conjecture that the leftover constant
terms not included in the exponent are given by the second logarithmic
derivative of the massless quark form factor. The meaning of a previously
obtained large $N_f$ evidence for an infrared finite perturbative Sudakov
coupling is reconsidered. This coupling is reinterpreted as a Minkowskian
coupling, making the introduction of a low-energy non-perturbative modification
of the corresponding Euclidean coupling a priori necessary. Some hints for a
Banks-Zaks type of fixed point in the Euclidean coupling at finite $N_f$ are
nevertheless pointed out, and strong evidence is provided in favor of its
universality. A criterion to select in a unique way the proper Euclidean
Sudakov coupling relevant to the issue of power corrections is suggested.

It is demonstrated that the CP-averaging branching ratio difference $\Delta R =
R_c - R_n$ in $B\to \pi K$ decays with $R_c = 2Br(\pi^0K^-)/Br(\pi^-\bar{K}^0)$
and $R_n =Br(\pi^+K^-)/2Br(\pi^0\bar{K}^0)$ defines a sensitive quantity for
probing new physics as $\Delta R$ is dominated by the second order of
electroweak penguin contributions. A large discrepancy between experimental
data and standard model (SM) prediction $\Delta R^{exp}/\Delta R^{SM} > 9.0\pm
5.0$ strongly indicates a signal of new physics in the electroweak penguin
sector. Within the SM, the current $\pi K$ data favor a very large
color-suppressed tree amplitude $|C'/T'|\sim 2$, large CP violations
($A_{CP}(\pi^0\bar{K}^0)\sim 0.69$ and $A_{CP}(\pi^0\bar{K}^-)\sim 0.56$),
which is connected to $\Delta R$ and be solved simultaneously with extra
electroweak penguin contributions. More accurate measurements on the ratio
difference $\Delta R$ and CP violation in $B\to \pi \pi, \pi K$ decays may
provide a window for probing new physics and testing the isospin and SU(3)

theory of higher operads, the nonsymmmetric operads are 1-operads and $Sym_1$
is the first term of the infinite series of left adjoint functors $Sym_n,$
called symmetrisation functors, from $n$-operads to symmetric operads with the
property that the category of one object, one arrow, . . ., one $(n-1)$-arrow
algebras of an $n$-operad $A$ is isomorphic to the category of algebras of

of the symmetrisation of $n$-operads. We construct an $n$-operadic analogue of
Fulton-Macpherson operad and show that its symmetrisation is exactly the operad
of Fulton and Macpherson. This implies that a space $X$ with an action of a
ontractible $n$-operad has a natural structure of an algebra over an operad
weakly equivalent to the little $n$-disks operad. A similar result holds for
chain operads. These results generalise the classical Eckman-Hilton argument to
arbitrary dimension. Finally, we apply the techniques to the Swiss Cheese type

multiple variable zeta functions at positive integers. Their extensive studies
are important in both mathematics and physics with broad connections and
applications. In contrast, very little is known about the special values of
multiple zeta functions at non-positive integers since the values are usually
singular. We define and study multiple zeta functions at any integer values by
adapting methods of renormalization from quantum field theory, and following
the Hopf algebra approach of Connes and Kreimer. This definition of
renormalized MZVs agrees with the convergent MZVs and extends the work of
Ihara-Kaneko-Zagier on renormalization of MZVs with positive arguments. We
further show that the important quasi-shuffle (stuffle) relation for usual MZVs
remains true for the renormalized MZVs.

the knowledge of the present author, never been tested against the alternative
hypothesis that evolution is, in fact, the ongoing development of a single,
world-spanning super-organism. Just what kind of evidence would settle this
question is not clear, so this paper is intended to begin the discussion. It
does so by suggesting how a new, quantitative theory of pragmatic information,

focusing is developed. This is done by matching the solution of geometrical
optics with a wave pattern which is universal for the underlying ray structure.
The corresponding canonical integral is the Bessoid integral, which is a three
dimensional generalization of the Pearcey integral that approximates the field
near an arbitrary two-dimensional cusp. We first develop the description for
scalar fields and then generalize it to the vector case. As a practical example
the formalism is applied to the focusing of light by transparent dielectric
spheres with a few wavelengths in diameter. The results demonstrate good
agreement with the Mie theory down to Mie parameters of about 30. Compact
analytical expressions are derived for the intensity on the axis and the
position of the diffraction focus both for the general case and for the
focusing by microspheres. The high intensity region is narrower than for an
ideal lens of the same aperture at the expense of longitudinal localization and
has a polarization dependent fine structure, which can be explained
quantitatively. The results are relevant for aerosol and colloid science where
natural light focusing occurs and can be used in laser micro- and
nano-processing of materials.
