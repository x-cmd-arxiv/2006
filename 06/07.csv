time-dependent radiative transfer problem in rapidly expanding supernova
atmospheres. The transfer code SEDONA has been developed to calculate the
lightcurves, spectra, and polarization of aspherical supernova models. From the
onset of free-expansion in the supernova ejecta, SEDONA solves the radiative
transfer problem self-consistently, including a detailed treatment of gamma-ray
transfer from radioactive decay and with a radiative equilibrium solution of
the temperature structure. Line fluorescence processes can also be treated
directly. No free parameters need be adjusted in the radiative transfer
calculation, providing a direct link between multi-dimensional hydrodynamical
explosion models and observations. We describe the computational techniques
applied in SEDONA, and verify the code by comparison to existing calculations.
We find that convergence of the Monte Carlo method is rapid and stable even for
complicated multi-dimensional configurations. We also investigate the accuracy
of a few commonly applied approximations in supernova transfer, namely the
stationarity approximation and the two-level atom expansion opacity formalism.

Reynolds and Lundquist numbers, suggesting that HMRI might be easier to realize
than standard MRI (axial field only). We confirm their results, calculate HMRI
growth rates, and show that in the resistive limit, HMRI is a weakly
destabilized inertial oscillation propagating in a unique direction along the
axis. But we report other features of HMRI that make it less attractive for
experiments and for resistive astrophysical disks. Growth rates are small and
require large axial currents. More fundamentally, instability of highly
resistive flow is peculiar to infinitely long or periodic cylinders: finite
cylinders with insulating endcaps are shown to be stable in this limit. Also,
keplerian rotation profiles are stable in the resistive limit regardless of
axial boundary conditions. Nevertheless, the addition of toroidal field lowers
thresholds for instability even in finite cylinders.

more massive than 0.2 Mo show a bimodal distribution with peaks at ~2 and ~8 d.
We combine all published rotation periods in IC348 with Spitzer/IRAC photometry
in order to test the disk-braking paradigm. We find no evidence that the tail
of slow rotators in low-mass stars or the long period peak in high-mass stars
are preferentially populated by objects with disks as might be expected based
on the current disk-braking model. Also, we find no significant correlation
between period and the magnitude of the IR-excess, regardless of the mass range
considered. Our results do not support a strong correlation in this cluster
between rotation period and the presence of a disk as predicted by disk-braking
theory. Rather, they are consistent with the suggestion that the correlation
between period and the amplitude of the (I-K) excess reported in the past is a
secondary manifestation of the correlation between the amplitude of near-IR
excess and mass. Finally, we find some indication that the disk fraction
decreases significantly for stars with very short periods (P < 1.5 d). This is
the only feature of our sample that could potentially be interpreted as
evidence for disk braking. It has been proposed that the observational
signatures of disk braking might be significantly masked by the intrinsic
breadth of the initial period distribution. We argue that more rigorous
modeling of angular momentum evolution and a quantitative analysis of the
observational data are required before the disk-braking model can be regarded
as inconsistent with observations.

both to the more favorable contrast of gas giant planets at M band and to the

obtained with ISAAC/VLT. These images, combined with existing data in the
optical bands, including HST images, were used to select very high redshift
candidates at z>~6 among the optical-dropouts. We have identified 18(8) first
and second-category optical dropouts in A1835 (AC114), detected in more than
one filter up to H(Vega)~23.8 (AB~25.2,uncorrected for lensing). Among them,
8(5) exhibit homogeneous SEDs compatible with star-forming galaxies at z>~6,
and 5(1) are more likely intermediate-redshift EROs based on luminosity
considerations. We have also identified a number of fainter sources in these
fields fulfilling our photometric selection and located around the critical
lines. We use all these data to make a first attempt at constraining the
density of star-forming galaxies present at 6<z<10 using lensing clusters.
Taken at face value, it appears that the number of candidates found seems to be
higher than the one achieved in blank fields with similar photometric depth in
the near-IR. The luminosity function derived for z>6 candidates appears
compatible with that of LBGs at z~3. The turnover observed by Bouwens et al.
(2005) towards the bright end relative to the z~3 LF is not observed in this
sample. Also the upper limit for the UV SFR density at z~6-10 is compatible
with the usual values derived at z~5-6, but higher than the estimates obtained
in the NICMOS Ultra Deep Field (UDF). Increasing the number of blank and
lensing fields with ultra-deep near-IR photometry is essential to get more
accurate constraints on the abundance of z>6 galaxies.

97 sources to the limit ~8e-16erg/s/cm2, this being the most complete in terms
of optical identification rate (86%) and redshift determination fraction (63%;
both spectroscopic and photometric). We first construct the redshift
distribution of the sample which shows a peak at z~1. This is in broad
agreement with models where less luminous AGNs evolve out to z~1 with powerful
QSOs peaking at higher redshift, z~2. Evolution similar to that of broad-line
QSOs applied to the entire AGN population (both type-I and II) does not fit the
data. We also explore the observed N_H distribution of the sample and estimate
a fraction of obscured AGN (N_H>1e22) of ~48%. This is found to be consistent
with both a luminosity dependent intrinsic N_H distribution, where less
luminous systems comprise a higher fraction of type-II AGNs, and models with a
fixed ratio 2:1 between type-I and II AGNs. We further compare our results with
those obtained in deeper and shallower surveys. We argue that a luminosity
dependent parametrisation of the intrinsic N_H distribution is required to
account for the fraction of obscured AGN observed in different samples over a
wide range of fluxes.

obtain the particle distributions, here we solve a more general
integro-differential equation that correctly takes into account the large
change in particle energy that occur when the leptons Compton scatter off hard
X-rays. Thus this formalism can also be applied to the hard state of black hole
systems, where the dominant ambient photons are hard X-rays. The corresponding
photon energy spectrum is calculated and compared with broadband data of black
hole binaries in different spectral states. The results indicate that the
$\gamma$-ray spectra ($E > 0.8$ MeV) of both the soft and hard spectral states
and the entire hard X-ray/$\gamma$-ray spectrum of the ultra-soft state, could
be due to $p-p$ interactions. These results are consistent with the hypothesis
that there always exists in these systems a $\gamma$-ray spectral component due
to $p-p$ interactions which can contribute between 0.5 to 10% of the total
bolometric luminosty. The model predicts that {\it GLAST} would be able to
detect black hole binaries and provide evidence for the presence of non-thermal

incorporating alpha particles and by allowing the solar wind to flow out of the
equatorial plane in an axisymmetrical configuration. In the ion momentum
equations of the solar wind, the ion gyro-frequency is many orders of magnitude
higher than any other frequency. This requires that the difference between
proton and alpha velocity vectors be aligned with the background magnetic
field. With the aid of this alignment condition, the governing equations of the
multi-fluid solar wind are derived from the standard transport equations. The
governing equations are numerically solved along a prescribed meridional
magnetic field line located at colatitude $70^\circ$ at 1AU and a steady state
fast solar wind solution is found. A general analysis concludes, in agreement
with the Weber-Davis model, that the magnetic field helps the coronal plasma to
achieve an effective corotation out to the Alfv\'enic radius, where the
poloidal Alfv\'enic Mach number $M_T$ equals unity ($M_T$ is defined by
equation (\ref{eq:mach})). The model computations show that, magnetic stresses
predominate the angular momentum loss of the Sun. For the fast wind considered,
the proton contribution to the angular momentum loss, which can be larger than
the magnetic one, is almost completely canceled by the alpha particles that
develop an azimuthal speed in the direction opposite to the solar rotation. The
Poynting flux associated with the azimuthal components is negligible in the
energy budget. However, the solar rotation can play some role in reducing the
relative speed between alpha particles and protons for low latitude fast solar
wind streams in interplanetary space.

  Aims. A method is described based on structure functions for determining
whether a region of gas, such as a molecular cloud, is fractal or contains
structure with characteristic scale sizes.
  Methods. Using artificial data containing structure it is shown that
derivatives of higher order structure functions provide a powerful way to
detect the presence of characteristic scales should any be present and to
estimate the size of such structures. The method is applied to observations of
hot H2 in the Kleinman-Low nebula, north of the Trapezium stars in the Orion
Molecular Cloud, including both brightness and velocity data. The method is
compared with other techniques such as Fourier transform and histogram

  Results. It is found that the density structure, represented by H2 emission

colour-magnitude relation has an intrinsic dispersion of 0.045 mag and is
0.015\pm0.005 mag redder in the highest-density regions, indicative of the red
sequence galaxy population being 500 Myr older in the cluster cores than
towards the virial radius. The B-R colours of galaxies are dependent on their
environment, whereas their luminosities are independent of the local density,
except for the very brightest galaxies (M_R<-22). The global colours of faint
(>M*+2) galaxies change from the cluster cores where ~90% of galaxies lie along
the cluster red sequence to the virial radius, where the fraction has dropped
to just ~20%. This suggests that processes related to the supercluster

merging, which should be infrequent in any of the regions studied here. The
largest concentrations of faint blue galaxies are found between the clusters,

star known. Circularly polarized Zeeman signatures are clearly detected in
observations collected mostly with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter, recently
installed on the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope; temporal variability is
also clearly established in the polarimetry, and can be unambiguously
attributed to rotational modulation with a period close to 41d. Archival UV
spectra confirm that this modulation repeats over timescales of decades.
  By reconstructing the large-scale structure of its magnetic topology, we find
that the magnetic structure is unusually complex for a hot star. The surface
topology is dominated by a potential field, although a moderate toroidal
component is probably present. We fail to detect intrinsic temporal variability
of the magnetic structure over the 1.5-yr period of our spectropolarimetric
observations (in agreement with the stable temporal variations of the UV
spectra), and infer that any differential surface rotation must be very small.
  The topology of the extended magnetic field that we derive from the
photospheric magnetic maps is also more complex than a global dipole, and
features in particular a significantly warped torus of closed magnetic loops
encircling the star (tilted at about 90deg to the rotation axis), with
additional, smaller, networks of closed field lines. This topology appears to
be consistent with the exceptional Xray properties of tauSco and also provides
a natural explanation of the variability observed in wind-formed UV lines. We
conclude that its magnetic field is most probably a fossil remnant from the
star-formation stage.

conducted on layered diatomic Lennard-Jones crystals with various mass ratios.
Lattice dynamics theory and molecular dynamics simulations are used to predict
the phonon dispersion curves and the thermal conductivity. The layered
structure generates directionally dependent thermal conductivities lower than
those predicted by density trends alone. The dispersion characteristics are
quantified using a set of novel band diagram metrics, which are used to assess
the contributions of acoustic phonons and optical phonons to the thermal
conductivity. The thermal conductivity increases as the extent of the acoustic
modes increases, and decreases as the extent of the stop bands increases. The
sensitivity of the thermal conductivity to the band diagram metrics is highest
at low temperatures, where there is less anharmonic scattering, indicating that
dispersion plays a more prominent role in thermal transport in that regime. We
propose that the dispersion metrics (i) provide an indirect measure of the
relative contributions of dispersion and anharmonic scattering to the thermal
transport, and (ii) uncouple the standard thermal conductivity
structure-property relation to that of structure-dispersion and
dispersion-property relations, providing opportunities for better understanding
of the underlying physical mechanisms and a potential tool for material design.

a spin-singlet superconductor. The original Knight shift and neutron scattering
measurements were performed for magnetic fields aligned in the ruthenate a-b

be constant below T_c, which is not expected for this symmetry state. In this

many theories about electron pairing in cuprate superconductors may be on the
wrong track and there is no reason to believe that the dynamic screening

other hand, the most recent experimental observations imply the possible
generic existence of the real space localized Cooper pairs in amorphous
insulating and other nonsuperconducting systems [M. D. Stewart Jr. et al.,
Science 318, 1273 (2007)]. It is therefore clear that the glue for high-T_{c}
superconductors is relevant to the real space correlations. In this paper, we
argue that real space electron-electron interactions can play the role of glue
in high-T_{c} superconductors. It is found that two localized electrons, due to
a real space Coulomb confinement effect, can be in pairing inside a single
plaquette of the CuO plane. The scenario suggests appearance of a dominating
d-wave-like pairing symmetry in the hole-doped cuprates, while a more complex
mixed (s+d) symmetry in the electron-doped cuprates. Based on the mechanism,
the relationships between the superconductivity and the charge-stripe order are
discussed. In the La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} (LSCO) with 1/18\leq x\leq 1/4, we show
that the paired electrons can self-organize into the dimerized Wigner crystal.
Two kinds of quasi-one-dimensional metallic magnetic-charge stripes, where the
superconductivity and dynamical spin density wave (SDW) coexist, are
analytically determined. Furthermore, the physical original of the magic doping
fractions (at x=1/4, 1/8, 1/9, 1/16 and 1/18) of superconductivity and an

As in recent experiments, the data bus can be either an LC circuit or a cavity

should be made far larger than their coupling constant, so these can be treated
as two independent subsystems. However, if a TDEF is applied to the qubit, then
a ""dressed qubit"" (i.e., qubit plus the electromagnetic field) can be formed.
By choosing appropriate parameters for the TDEF, the dressed qubit can be
coupled to the data bus and, thus, the qubit and the data bus can exchange
information with the assistance of the TDEF. This mechanism allows the
scalability of the circuit to many qubits. With the help of the TDEF, any two
qubits can be selectively coupled to (and decoupled from) a common data bus.
Therefore, quantum information can be transferred from one qubit to another.

the use of a dynamical action principle that includes all the degrees of

version of non-viscous, isentropic hydrodynamics. The matter fields are a
scalar density and a velocity potential; the conventional, four-vector velocity
field is replaced by the gradient of the potential and its scale is fixed by
one of the eulerian equations of motion, an innovation that significantly
affects the imposition of boundary conditions. If the density is integrable at
infinity, then the metric approaches the Schwarzschild metric at large
distances. There are stars without boundary and with finite total mass; the
metric shows rapid variation in the neighbourhood of the Schwarzschild radius
and there is a very small core where a singularity indicates that the gas laws
break down. For stars with boundary there emerges a new, critical relation
between the radius and the gravitational mass, a consequence of the stronger
boundary conditions. Tentative applications are suggested, to certain Red
Giants, and to neutron stars, but the investigation reported here was limited
to polytropic equations of state. Comparison with the results of Oppenheimer
and Volkoff on neutron cores shows a close agreement of numerical results.
However, in the model the boundary of the star is fixed uniquely by the
required matching of the interior metric to the external Schwarzschild metric,
which is not the case in the traditional approach.

annihilation/exchange topologies. Naive SU(3)-breaking effects in the decay
amplitudes are taken into account, through the inclusion of pi and K decay

with the limited set of observables currently available, significant

are shown to bring non trivial constraints on the CKM angles alpha and beta, in
agreement with analytical solutions that we derive. Finally, the future physics

establishing that 2T-physics provides a correct description of Nature from the
point of view of 4+2 dimensions. The 2T formulation leads to phenomenological
consequences of considerable significance. In particular, the higher structure
in 4+2 dimensions prevents the problematic F*F term in QCD. This resolves the
strong CP problem without a need for the Peccei-Quinn symmetry or the
corresponding elusive axion. Mass generation with the Higgs mechanism is less
straightforward in the new formulation of the Standard Model, but its
resolution leads to an appealing deeper physical basis for mass, coupled with
phenomena that could be measurable. In addition, there are some brand new
mechanisms of mass generation related to the higher dimensions that deserve
further study. The technical progress is based on the construction of a new
field theoretic version of 2T-physics including interactions in an action
formalism in d+2 dimensions. The action is invariant under a new type of gauge
symmetry which we call 2Tgauge-symmetry in field theory. This opens the way for
investigations of the Standard Model directly in 4+2 dimensions, or from the
point of view of various embeddings of 3+1 dimensions, by using the duality,
holography, symmetry and unifying features of 2T-physics.

free, the size of every list is at least $\alpha \Delta$, where $\alpha$ is an

implication for the uniqueness of Gibbs measures in infinite graphs. This
approach was proposed in two recent papers \cite{BandyopadhyayGamarnikCounting}
and \cite{weitzCounting}. The principle insight of this approach is that the
correlation decay property can be established with respect to certain
\emph{computation tree}, as opposed to the conventional correlation decay
property with respect to graph theoretic neighborhoods of a given node. This
allows truncation of computation at a logarithmic depth in order to obtain
polynomial accuracy in polynomial time.

phase of particle accelerators, producing low emittance beams appropriate even
for the demanding high energy Linear Collider specifications. In this paper we
work out the injection into the acceleration phase of the wake field in a
plasma behind a high intensity laser pulse, taking advantage of the laser
polarization and focusing. With the aid of catastrophe theory we categorize the
injection dynamics. The scheme uses the structurally stable regime of
transverse wake wave breaking, when electron trajectory self-intersection leads
to the formation of a flat electron bunch. As shown in three-dimensional
particle-in-cell simulations of the interaction of a laser pulse in a
line-focus with an underdense plasma, the electrons, injected via the
transverse wake wave breaking and accelerated by the wake wave, perform
betatron oscillations with different amplitudes and frequencies along the two
transverse coordinates. The polarization and focusing geometry lead to a way to
produce relativistic electron bunches with asymmetric emittance (flat beam). An
approach for generating flat laser accelerated ion beams is briefly discussed.

through chiral sculptured thin films (STFs) were calculated using a
finite-difference time-domain algorithm. Chiral STFs are a class of
nanoengineered materials whose microstructure comprises parallel helicoidal
nanowires grown normal to a substrate. The nanowires are $\sim$10-300 nm in
diameter and $\sim1-10 \mu$m in length. Durations of transmitted pulses tend to
increase with decreasing (free-space) wavelength of the carrier plane wave,
while average speeds tend to increase with increasing wavelength. An increase
in nonlinearity, as manifested by an intensity-dependent refractive index in
the frequency domain, tends to increase durations of transmitted pulses and
decrease average speeds. The circular Bragg phenomenon exhibited by a chiral
STFs manifests itself in the frequency domain as high reflectivity for normally
incident carrier plane waves whose circular polarization state is matched to
the structural handedness of the film and whose wavelength falls in a range
known as the Bragg regime; films of the opposite structural handedness reflect
such plane waves little. This effect tends to distort the shapes of transmitted
pulses with respect to the incident pulses, and such shaping can cause sharp
changes in some measures of average speed with respect to carrier wavelength. A
local maximum in the variation of one measure of the pulse duration with
respect to wavelength is noted and attributed to the circular Bragg phenomenon.
Several of these effects are explained via frequency-domain arguments. The
presented results serve as a foundation for future theoretical and experimental
studies of optical pulse propagation through causal, nonlinear, nonhomogeneous,
and anisotropic materials.
