lensing by large-scale structure using archival observations from the Advanced
Camera for Surveys (ACS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).
  In this work we present results from a pilot study testing the capabilities
of the ACS for cosmic shear measurements with early parallel observations and
presenting a re-analysis of HST/ACS data from the GEMS survey and the GOODS
observations of the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS). We describe our new
correction scheme for the time-dependent ACS PSF based on observations of
stellar fields. This is currently the only technique which takes the full time
variation of the PSF between individual ACS exposures into account. We estimate
that our PSF correction scheme reduces the systematic contribution to the shear
correlation functions due to PSF distortions to < 2*10^{-6} for galaxy fields
containing at least 10 stars. We perform a number of diagnostic tests
indicating that the remaining level of systematics is consistent with zero for
the GEMS and GOODS data confirming the success of our PSF correction scheme.
For the parallel data we detect a low level of remaining systematics which we
interpret to be caused by a lack of sufficient dithering of the data.
  Combining the shear estimate of the GEMS and GOODS observations using 96
galaxies arcmin^{-2} with the photometric redshift catalogue of the GOODS-MUSIC
sample, we determine a local single field estimate for the mass power spectrum
normalisation sigma_{8,CDFS}=0.52^{+0.11}_{-0.15} (stat) +/- 0.07 (sys) (68%
confidence assuming Gaussian cosmic variance) at fixed Omega_m=0.3 for a
LambdaCDM cosmology. We interpret this exceptionally low estimate to be due to
a local under-density of the foreground structures in the CDFS.

analytical approach to find the local rules of random Boolean networks (RBNs)
to solve the global density classification and the synchronization task from
any initial configuration. We quantitatively and qualitatively compare our
results with previously published work on cellular automata and show that
randomly interconnected automata are computationally more efficient in solving
these two global tasks. Our approach also provides convergence and quality
estimates and allows the networks to be randomly rewired during operation,
without affecting the global performance. Finally, we show that RBNs outperform
small-world topologies on the density classification task and that they perform
equally well on the synchronization task. Our novel approach and the results
may have applications in designing robust complex networks and locally

kinetic accessibility (they must be sufficiently wide to avoid kinetic traps).
Similarly, for good yields the temperature must be low enough for the clusters
to be thermodynamically stable, but the clusters must also have enough thermal
energy to allow incorrectly formed bonds to be broken. Ordered clusters can
form through a number of different dynamic pathways, including direct
nucleation and indirect pathways involving large disordered intermediates. The
latter pathway is related to a reentrant liquid-to-gas transition that occurs
for intermediate patch widths upon lowering the temperature. We also find that
the assembly process is robust to inaccurate patch placement up to a certain
threshold, and that it is possible to replace the five discrete patches with a
single ring patch with no significant loss in yield.

enhanced prominence of the relativistic terms. Also discussed are the effects

the scattering amplitude at high energy in QCD. In this paper we show that the
generating functional approach is equivalent to the BFKL Pomeron Calculus and
leads to a clear interpretation of this calculus as an alternative description
of the system of interacting colourless dipoles. We calculated the two BFKL
Pomerons into one BFKL Pomeron vertex directly in the dipole approach and show
that this merging can be described as the decay of two dipoles into four
dipoles in the dipole approach. This result means the JIMWLK approach can give

categories of sheaves on two spaces over the same base. The first aspect of
this is that the derived categories of sheaves on the spaces are twisted. They
become derived categories of sheaves on gerbes living over spaces that are
locally (on the base) isomorphic to the original spaces. Secondly, this is done
in a compatible way so that the equivalence is maintained. We apply this method
by proving the conjectures of Donagi and Pantev on dualities between gerbes on
genus-one fibrations and comment on other applications to families of higher
genus curves. We also include a related conjecture in Mirror Symmetry. This
represents a modified version of my May 2006 thesis for the University of
Pennsylvania. The only addition is the subsection titled 'Alternative Method'.

  the Santa Cruz conference on Artin's braid groups (July 1986), 1988, 615-656",,,"math.GT",,"  It is a natural question to ask whether two links are equivalent by the
following moves -- parallel parts of a link are changed to k-times half-twisted
parts and if they are, how many moves are needed to go from one link to the
other. In particular if k=2 and the second link is a trivial link it is the
question about the unknotting number. The new polynomial invariants of links
often allow us to answer the above questions. Also the first homology groups of
cyclic branch covers over links provide some interesting information. In the
first part of the paper we apply the Jones-Conway (Homflypt) and Kauffman
polynomials to find whether two links are not t_k equivalent and if they are,
to gain some information how many moves are needed to go from one link to the
other. In the second part we describe the Fox congruence classes and their
relations with t_k moves. We use the Fox method to analyze relations between
t_k moves and the first homology groups of branched cyclic covers of links.In
the third part we consider the influence of t_k moves on the Goeritz and
Seifert matrices and analyze Lickorish-Millett and Murakami formulas from the
point of view of t_k moves and illustrate them by various examples. At the end
of the paper we outline some relations with signatures of links and non-cyclic
coverings of link spaces.

classes of the t-ideals with the operation induced by ideal t-multiplication.
This paper investigates ring-theoretic properties of an integral domain that
reflect reciprocally in the Clifford or Boolean property of its t-class
semigroup. Contexts (including Lipman and Sally-Vasconcelos stability) that
suit best t-multiplication are studied in an attempt to generalize well-known
developments on class semigroups. We prove that a Prufer v-multiplication
domain (PVMD) is of Krull type (in the sense of Griffin) if and only if its
t-class semigroup is Clifford. This extends Bazzoni and Salce's results on
valuation domains and Prufer domains. We also characterize GCD domains with
Boolean t-class semigroup, recovering thus recent results on Bezout domains.

valence electrons in the no virtual-pair approximation (NVPA). A total of 302
third-order Goldstone diagrams are organized into 12 one-body and 23 two-body
terms. Only third-order two-body terms and diagrams are presented here, owing
to the fact that the one-body terms are identical to the previously studied
third-order terms in monovalent ions. Dominant classes of diagrams are
identified. The model potential is a Dirac-Hartree-Fock $V^{N-2}$ potential,
and B-spline basis functions in a cavity of finite radius are employed in the
numerical calculations. The Breit interaction is taken into account through
second order of perturbation theory and the lowest-order Lamb shift is also
evaluated. Sample calculations are performed for berylliumlike ions with Z =
4--7, and for the magnesiumlike ion P IV. The third-order energies are in
excellent agreement with measurement with an accuracy at 0.2% level for the
cases considered. Comparisons are made with previous second-order MBPT results
and with other calculations. The third-order energy correction is shown to be
significant, improving second-order correlation energies by an order of
magnitude.

an optical isolator or a polarizer is described. The waveguide is rectangular,
and chirality is introduced by making slanted rectangular grooves on the
waveguide walls. Chirality of the waveguide manifests as a strong circular
dichroism, and is responsible for transmitting one circular polarization of
light and reflecting the other. Optical isolation of the propagating circular
polarization is accomplished when the chiral waveguide is placed in front of a
non-chiral optical device. Even the crudest implementations of chirality are
shown to exhibit significant circular dichroism.

Transformed Infrared (FTIR) microscopy and explained by introducing a
frequency-dependent effective permittivity $\epsilon_{\rm eff}(\omega)$ of the

excitation of two distinct types of hole resonances: a delocalized slow surface
polariton (SSP) whose frequency is largely determined by the array period, and
a localized surface polariton (LSP) which corresponds to the resonances of an
isolated hole. Only SSPs are shown to modify $\epsilon_{\rm eff}(\omega)$
strongly enough to cause giant transmission and absorption.

that dark-matter is composed by Neutrino's massive energy, we hint that the

number of Neutrinos in the Universe increases with the square of R, where R
stands for Hubble's length. This makes possible that the dark mater-energy
density be of Neutrinos origin, to vary with the inverse square of R, as is
necessary for a Machian Universe. The neutrino average mass is estimated for
the present Universe (=10 to the minus 76 power, in grams).

diagonalization method of finite cluster of spins. The relationship between the
global phase diagram and the ground-state entanglement is investigated. It is
shown that the block-block entanglement of different block size and geometry
manifests richer information of the system. We find that the extremal point of
the two-site block-block entanglement on the rung locates a transition point
exactly due to SU(4) symmetry at this point. The scaling behavior of the
block-block entanglement is discussed. Our results suggest that the block-block
entanglement can be used as a convenient marker of quantum phase transition in
some complex spin systems.
