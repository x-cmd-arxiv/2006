which revealed that it had an asymmetrical inner circumstellar envelope
following its 2nd photometric outburst. Electron scattering, modified by pre-

envelope. The simplest geometry implied by these observations is that of a
spheroidal shell, flattened by at least 10% and having a projected position
angle on the sky of $\sim37^{\circ}$. Analysis of V838 Mon's polarized flux
reveals that this electron scattering shell lies interior to the envelope
region in which H$\alpha$ and Ca II triplet emission originates. To date, none
of the theoretical models proposed for V838 Mon have demonstrated that they can
reproduce the evolution of V838 Mon's inner circumstellar environment, as

Gamma-Ray Observatory for a handful of gamma-ray bursts has given no indication
of any spectral attenuation that might preclude detection of bursts at higher
energies. With the discovery of optical afterglows and counterparts to bursts
in the last few years, enabling the determination of significant redshifts for
these sources, it is anticipated that profound spectral attenuation will arise
in the Gamma-Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) energy band of 30 MeV-300
GeV for many if not most bursts. This paper explores time-dependent
expectations for burst spectral properties in the EGRET/GLAST band, focusing on
how attenuation of photons by pair creation internal to the source generates
distinctive spectral signatures. The energy of spectral breaks and the
associated spectral indices provide valuable information that constrains the
bulk Lorentz factor of the GRB outflow at a given time. Moreover, the distinct
temporal behavior that is present for internal attenuation is easily
distinguished from extrinsic absorption due to intervening cosmic background
fields. These characteristics define palpable observational goals for both
spaced-based hard gamma-ray experiments such as GLAST, and ground-based
Cherenkov telescopes, and strongly impact the observability of bursts above 300
MeV.

time and rise time as well as the shape and amplitude of the cycle. However,
none of these models includes a discussion of the variations in the length of
the cycle, which has been known to vary from $\sim$7 to 17 years. The focus of
our study was to investigate whether this range was associated with a secular
pattern in the length of the sunspot cycle. To provide a basis for the analysis
of the long-term behavior of the Sun, we analyzed archival data of sunspot
numbers from 1700 - 2005 and sunspot areas from 1874 - 2005. The independent
techniques of power spectrum analysis and phase dispersion minimization were
used to confirm the $\sim$11-year Schwabe Cycle, and to illustrate the large
range in the length of this cycle. Long-term cycles were identified in archival
data from 1610 -- 2000 using median trace analyses of the length of the cycle,
and from power spectrum analyses of the (O-C) residuals of the dates of sunspot
minima and maxima. The median trace analysis suggested that the cycle length
had a period of 183 - 243 years, while the more precise power spectrum analysis
identified a period of 188 $\pm$ 38 years. We found that the 188-year cycle was
consistent with the variation of sunspot numbers and seems to be related to the
Schwabe Cycle. We found a correlation between the times of historic minima and
the length of the sunspot cycle such that the length of the cycle was usually
highest when the actual number of sunspots was lowest. The cycle length was
growing during the Maunder Minimum when there were almost no sunspots visible
on the Sun. This information can now be used to improve the accuracy of the
current solar cycle models, to better predict the starting time of a given
cycle.

influence radius of central supermassive black holes were derived from
brightness profiles obtained by Hubble Space Telescope observations. The
present study indicates that the capture rates scale as $\propto
M_{bh}^{-1.048}$, consequence of the fact that dwarf galaxies have denser
central regions than luminous objects. If the mass distribution of supermassive
black holes has a lower cutoff at $\sim 1.4\times 10^6$ M$_{\odot}$
(corresponding to the lowest observed supermassive black hole mass, located in

to white dwarf captures and 1-2 to neutron star and stellar black hole
captures) after one year of operation. However, if the mass distribution
extends down to $\sim 2\times 10^5$ M$_{\odot}$, then the total number of

been extended to a total of seven years. Twelve new periodic stars have been
found in the last two years, bringing the total discovered by this program to
40. In addition, we confirm 16 of the periods reported by others and resolve
some discrepancies. The total number of known rotation periods in the cluster,
from all studies has now reached 70. This is sufficient to demonstrate that the
parent population of K5-M2 stars is rotationally indistinguishable from that in
the Orion Nebula Cluster even though their radii are 20% smaller and they would
be expected to spin about twice as fast if angular momentum were conserved. The
median radius and, therefore, inferred age of the IC 348 stars actually closely
matches that of NGC 2264, but the stars spin significantly more slowly. This
suggests that another factor besides mass and age plays a role in establishing
the rotation properties within a cluster and we suggest that it is environment.
If disk locking were to persist for longer times in less harsh environments,
because the disks themselves persist for longer times, it could explain the
generally slower rotation rates observed for stars in this cluster, whose
earliest type star is of class B5. We have also obtained radial velocities, the
first for PMS stars in IC348, and v sin i measurements for 30 cluster stars to
assist in the study of rotation and as an independent check on stellar radii.
Several unusual variable stars are discussed; in some or all cases their
behavior may be linked to occultations by circumstellar material. A strong
correlation exists between the range of photometric variability and the slope
of the spectral energy distribution in the infrared. Nineteen of the 21 stars
with I ranges exceeding 0.4 mag show infrared evidence for circumstellar disks.

emission by dust. Since optical interstellar polarization is commonly seen,
from differential extinction by aligned aspherical dust particles, it is
expected that thermal emission from these grains will be polarized. Indeed, in
the Galactic plane and in dark (molecular) clouds, dust emission in the
infrared and submillimetre has been measured to be polarized. It seems likely
that the faint diffuse cirrus emission, of more relevance to CMB experiments,
will be polarized too. We discuss how well the amount of polarization of this

infrared and ultraviolet) interstellar polarization and extinction. Some
constraints on the alignment of the carrier of the dust-correlated anomalous

The mass gap equation for the vacua and the Salpeter-RPA equation for the
mesons are solved for a simple chiral invariant and confining quark model. At
T=0 and in the true vacuum, the scalar and pseudoscalar, or the vector and
axial vector are not degenerate, and in the chiral limit, the pseudoscalar
groundstates are Goldstone bosons. At T=0 the chiral invariant vacuum is an
unstable vacuum, decaying through an infinite number of scalar and pseudoscalar
tachyons. Nevertheless the axialvector and vector remain mesons, with real
masses. To illustrate the chiral restoration, an arbitrary path between the two
vacua is also studied. Different families of light-light and heavy-light
mesons, sensitive to chiral restoration, are also studied. At higher
temperatures the potential must be suppressed, and the chiral symmetry can be
restored without tachyons, but then all mesons have small real masses.
Implications for heavy-ion collisions, in particular for the recent vector
meson spectra measured by the NA60 collaboration, are discussed.

the stochastic calculus of variations for a L\'evy process, based on the

non-degenerated in an appropriate sense, then the law of the solution to the
Cauchy problem for the initial equation is absolutely continuous, as soon as
the L\'evy measure of the noise satisfies one of the rather weak intensity

provide the sufficient conditions for the density of the distribution of the
solution to the Cauchy problem to be smooth in the terms of the family of the
so-called order indices of the L\'evy measure of the noise (the drift again is
supposed to be non-degenerated). At last, we show that an invariant

of G. I. Taylor's theory of turbulent energy dissipation by the process of

mechanism for the breakdown of Kelvin's Theorem in ideal turbulence at infinite
Reynolds number. We develop here a detailed physical theory of this ``cascade
of circulations''. Our analysis is based upon an effective equation for
large-scale ``coarse-grained'' velocity, which contains a turbulent-induced
``vortex-force'' that can violate Kelvin's Theorem. We show that singularities
of sufficient strength, which are observed to exist in turbulent flow, can lead
to non-vanishing dissipation of circulation for an arbitrarily small filtering
length in the effective equations. This result is an analogue for circulation
of Onsager's theorem on energy dissipation for singular Euler solutions. The
physical mechanism of the breakdown of Kelvin's Theorem is diffusion of lines
of large-scale vorticity out of the advected loop. This phenomenon can be
viewed as a classical analogue of the Josephson-Anderson phase-slip phenomenon
in superfluids due to quantized vortex lines. We show that the circulation
cascade is local in scale and use this locality to develop concrete expressions
for the turbulent vortex-force by a multi-scale gradient-expansion. We discuss
implications for Taylor's theory of turbulent dissipation and we point out some
related cascade phenomena, in particular for magnetic-flux in
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence.

system and whispering-gallery modes (WGMs) of a microdisk cavity is presented,
with specific attention paid to current experiments involving a semiconductor
quantum dot (QD) embedded in a fiber-coupled, AlGaAs microdisk cavity. In
standard single mode cavity QED, three important rates characterize the system:
the QD-cavity coupling rate g, the cavity decay rate kappa, and the QD
dephasing rate gamma_perpendicular. A more accurate model of the microdisk
cavity includes two additional features. The first is a second cavity mode that
can couple to the QD, which for an ideal microdisk corresponds to a traveling
wave WGM propagating counter to the first WGM. The second feature is a coupling
between these two traveling wave WGMs, at a rate beta, due to backscattering
caused by surface roughness that is present in fabricated devices. We consider
the transmitted and reflected signals from the cavity for different parameter
regimes of {g,beta,kappa,gamma_perpendicular}. A result of this analysis is
that even in the presence of negligible roughness induced backscattering, a
strongly coupled QD mediates coupling between the traveling wave WGMs,
resulting in an enhanced effective coherent coupling rate g = sqrt(2)*g0
corresponding to that of a standing wave WGM with an electric field maximum at
the position of the QD. In addition, analysis of the second-order correlation
function of the reflected signal from the cavity indicates that regions of
strong photon antibunching or bunching may be present depending upon the
strength of coupling of the QD to each of the cavity modes. Such intensity
correlation information will likely be valuable in interpreting experimental
measurements of a strongly-coupled QD to a bi-modal WGM cavity.

standing wave light, using both classical and quantum treatments of the
problem. Operation of the focusing setup is considered as a nonlinear spatial
squeezing of atoms in the thin- and thick-lens regimes. It is found that the
near-resonant standing wave focuses the atoms with a reduced background in
comparison with far-detuned light fields. For some parameters, the quantum
atomic distribution shows even better localization than the classical one.
Spontaneous emission effects are included via the technique of quantum Monte
Carlo wave function simulations. We investigate the extent to which
non-adiabatic and spontaneous emission effects limit the achievable minimal
size of the deposited structures.
