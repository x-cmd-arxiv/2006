M33-C38, which rules out the possibility of an artificially young spectroscopic
age due to the presence of hot stars. We infer a total mass of 5-9 x 10^4 M_sol

some dynamical evolution model predictions for star clusters in M33, although

the galaxy distribution requires a mechanism that can truncate star formation
in massive haloes. Current models of galaxy formation consider two such
truncation mechanisms: strangulation, which acts on satellite galaxies, and AGN
feedback, which predominantly affects central galaxies. The efficiencies of
these processes set the blue fraction of galaxies as function of galaxy
luminosity and halo mass. In this paper we use a galaxy group catalogue
extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to determine these
fractions. To demonstrate the potential power of this data as a benchmark for
galaxy formation models, we compare the results to the semi-analytical model
for galaxy formation of Croton et al. (2006). Although this model accurately
fits the global statistics of the galaxy population, as well as the shape of
the conditional luminosity function, there are significant discrepancies when
the blue fraction of galaxies as a function of mass and luminosity is compared
between the observations and the model. In particular, the model predicts (i)
too many faint satellite galaxies in massive haloes, (ii) a blue fraction of
satellites that is much too low, and (iii) a blue fraction of centrals that is
too high and with an inverted luminosity dependence. In the same order, we
argue that these discrepancies owe to (i) the neglect of tidal stripping in the
semi-analytical model, (ii) the oversimplified treatment of strangulation, and
(iii) improper modeling of dust extinction and/or AGN feedback. The data
presented here will prove useful to test and calibrate future models of galaxy
formation and in particular to discriminate between various models for AGN

structure with structure maps generated from visible-wavelength HST data,
finding that tightly wound nuclear dust spirals are primarily found in weakly
barred galaxies. While strongly barred galaxies sometimes exhibit grand design
structure within the central 10 percent of D25, this structure rarely extends
to within ~10 pc of the galaxy nucleus. In some galaxies, these spiral arms
terminate at a circumnuclear starburst ring. Galaxies with circumnuclear rings
are generally more strongly barred than galaxies lacking rings. Within these
rings, the dust structure is fairly smooth and usually in the form of a loosely
wound spiral. These data demonstrate that multiple nuclear morphologies are
possible in the most strongly barred galaxies: chaotic central dust structure
inconsistent with a coherent nuclear spiral, a grand design spiral that loses
coherence before reaching the nucleus, or a grand design spiral that ends in a
circumnuclear ring. These observations may indicate that not all strong bars
are equally efficient at fueling material to the centers of their host
galaxies. Finally, we investigate the longstanding hypothesis that SB(s)
galaxies have weak bars and SB(r) galaxies have strong bars, finding the
opposite to be the case: namely, SB(r) galaxies are less strongly barred and
have less dust structure than SB(s) galaxies. In general, more strongly barred
galaxies tend to have higher nuclear dust contrast.

spectra of GRB 020813 obtained in two epochs of ~16 hours apart, and examine
transitions from the first excited state of Fe^+ at J=7/2 in these two sets of

state imposed by the volatile composition. In the deep interior of a planet, an
absence of oxidative volatiles will cause U and Th to stay in a state of metal
or low valance compounds with a big density. Consequently, they migrate to the
bottom of its mantle first, and then are gradually sequestered to its liquid
metal core. Earth is rich in oxidative volatiles including water, therefore, U
and Th in the core can be moved up by an internal circulation system consisting
of the outer core, hot super plumes, asthenosphere and subduction zone (or cold
super plumes). This internal circulation system is the key for the formation of
plate tectonics, the geodynamo and the consequent geomagnetic field. Moreover,
plentiful oxidative volatiles and water within Earth is the precondition to
form such a circulation system. In the early stage (> 4 Ga), Mars developed an
Earth-like internal circulation system due to relatively large amount of
oxidative volatile compositions coming from its building material. This would
have produced a dynamo and correspondingly an Earth-like magnetic field.
However, this internal circulation system was destroyed by one or several giant
impact events in the early stage, which drove off these volatile compositions.
These events also shaped the striking hemispheric dichotomy structure on the
Martian surface. The other result is that its dynamo and geomagnetic field have
also disappeared. Since then, Mars has been the same as Mercury and Venus in
that the heat release from the U and Th in their cores can not be moved by an
internal circulation system gently, but by sporadically catastrophic
resurfacing events (Venus), or super plumes (Mars) or gradual heat conduction

for a sample of 76 ultra-steep-spectrum radio sources designed to find galaxies
at high redshift. Here we present multi-frequency radio observations, from the
Australia Telescope Compact Array, for a subset of 37 galaxies from the sample.
Matched resolution observations at 2.3, 4.8 and 6.2GHz are presented for all
galaxies, with the z<2 galaxies additionally observed at 8.6 and 18GHz. New
angular size constraints are reported for 19 sources based on high resolution
4.8 and 6.2GHz observations. Functional forms for the rest-frame spectral
energy distributions are derived: 89% of the sample is well characterised by a
single power law, whilst the remaining 11% show some flattening toward higher
frequencies: not one source shows any evidence for high frequency steepening.
We discuss the implications of this result in light of the empirical
correlation between redshift and spectral index seen in flux limited samples of
radio galaxies. Finally, a new physical mechanism to explain the redshift --
spectral index correlation is posited: extremely steep spectrum radio galaxies
in the local universe usually reside at the centres of rich galaxy clusters. We
argue that if a higher fraction of radio galaxies, as a function of redshift,
are located in environments with densities similar to nearby rich clusters,
then this could be a natural interpretation for the correlation. We briefly
outline our plans to pursue this line of investigation.

detected are used to fit jointly an absorbed power-law model, from which the
power-law photon index is determined to be $\sim$2.5. Assuming that all other

Monte Carlo simulations show that these sources are more likely concentrated in
the Galactic center region, rather than distributed throughout the Galactic
disk. We also find that the luminosities of the sources are positively
correlated with their HI column densities, i.e. a more luminous source has a
higher HI column density. From this relation, we suggest that the X-ray
luminosity comes from the interaction between an isolated old neutron star and
interstellar medium (mainly dense molecular clouds). Using the standard Bondi
accretion theory and the statistical information of molecular clouds in the
Galactic center, we confirm this positive correlation and calculate the
luminosity range in this scenario, which is consistent with the observation

collisional rate coefficients recently derived by us. The goal of this study is
to check the validity of the assumptions made to treat the hyperfine structure
and to study the physical mechanisms leading to the observed hyperfine
anomalies.
  We find that the usual hypothesis of identical excitation temperatures for
all hyperfine components of the $J$=1-0 transition is not correct within the
range of densities existing in cold dense cores, i.e., a few 10$^4$ $\textless$
n(H$_2$) $\textless$ a few 10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$. This is due to different radiative
trapping effects in the hyperfine components. Moreover, within this range of
densities and considering the typical abundance of N$_2$H$^+$, the total
opacity of rotational lines has to be derived taking into account the hyperfine
structure. The error made when only considering the rotational energy structure
can be as large as 100%. Using non-local models we find that, due to
saturation, hyperfine anomalies appear as soon as the total opacity of the
$J$=1-0 transition becomes larger than $\simeq$ 20. Radiative scattering in
less dense regions enhance these anomalies, and particularly, induce a
differential increase of the excitation temperatures of the hyperfine
components. This process is more effective for the transitions with the highest
opacities for which emerging intensities are also reduced by self-absorption
effects. These effects are not as critical as in HCO$^+$ or HCN, but should be
taken into account when interpreting the spatial extent of the N$_2$H$^+$
emission in dark clouds.

added to interferometric data. New Spitzer infrared (IR) images of six of these
galaxies have been released. The analysis of these high resolution images
allowed us to probe the RC-IR-CO correlations down to linear scales of a few
hundred pc. Results: for the 22 galaxies analysed, the RC-CO correlation on
scales from $\sim10$ kpc down to $\sim100$ pc is nearly linear and has a
scatter of a factor of two, i.e. comparable to that of the global correlations.
There is no evidence for any severe degradation of the scatter below the kpc
scale. This also applies to the six galaxies for which high-resolution mid-IR
data are available. In the case of NGC 5194, we find that the non-thermal radio
spectral index is correlated with the RC/FIR ratio. Conclusions: The scatter of
the point-by-point correlations does not increase significantly with spatial
resolution. We thus conclude that we have not yet probed the physical scales at
which the correlations break down. However, we observe local deviations from
the correlations in regions with a high star formation rate, such as the spiral
arms, where we observe a flat radio spectrum and a low RC/FIR ratio. In the
intra-arm regions and in the peripheral regions of the disk, the RC/FIR is
generally higher and it is characterized by a steepening of the radio spectrum.

clusters in a LCDM cosmology are used to simulate cluster X-ray observations as
expected from Chandra observations. The physical modeling of the gas includes
radiative cooling, star formation, energy feedback and metal enrichment. The
biasing of spectral temperatures with respect to mass-weighted temperatures is
found to be influenced by two independent processes. The first scale dependency
is absent in adiabatic runs and is due to cooling, whose efficiency to
transform cold gas into stars is higher for cool clusters and this in turn
implies a strong dependency of the spectral versus mass-weighted temperature
relation on the cluster mass. The second dependency is due to photon emission
because of cool gas which is accreted during merging events and biases the
spectral fits. These events have been quantified according to the power ratio
method and a robust correlation is found to exist between the spectral bias and
the amount of cluster substructure. The shape of the simulated temperature
profiles is not universal and it is steeper at the cluster center for cool
clusters than for the massive ones. The profiles are in good agreement with
data in the radial range between $\sim 0.1 r_{vir}$ and $\sim 0.4 r_{vir}$; at
small radii ($r< 0.1 r_{vir}$) the cooling runs fail to reproduce the shape of
the observed profiles. The fit is improved if one considers a hierarchical
merging scenario in which cluster cores can accrete cooler gas through merging
with cluster subclumps, though the shape of the temperature profiles is
modified in a significant way only in the regime where the mass of the
substructure is a large fraction of the cluster mass.

both an enhancement in the abundance of coolants (H2 and HD) and an increase of
gas temperature. We find that for all the considered DM models the critical
halo mass for collapse, m_crit, is generally higher than in the unperturbed
case. However, the variation of m_crit is small. In the most extreme case, i.e.
considering light DM annihilations (decays) and halos virializing at redshift
z_vir>10 (z_vir~10), m_crit increases by a factor ~4 (~2). In the case of
annihilations the variations of m_crit are also sensitive to the assumed
profile of the DM halo. Furthermore, we note that the fraction of gas which is
retained inside the halo is substantially reduced (to ~40 per cent of the
cosmic value), especially in the smallest halos, as a consequence of the energy
injection by DM decays and annihilations.

stars. Our analysis is carried out within the theoretical framework developed
by Randall et al., which includes full nonadiabatic effects. The goal of this
analysis is partial mode identification, i.e., the determination of the degree
index l of each of the observed pulsation modes. We assume possible values of l
from 0 to 5 in our calculations. For each target star, we compute a specific
model atmosphere and a specific pulsation model using estimates of the
atmospheric parameters coming from time-averaged optical spectroscopy. For
every assumed value of l, we use a formal chi-squared approach to model the
observed amplitude-wavelength distribution of each mode, and we compute a
quality-of-fit Q probability to quantify the derived fit and to discriminate
objectively between the various solutions. We find that no completely
convincing and unambiguous l identification is possible on the basis of the
available data, although partial mode discrimination has been reached for 25

modes in rapidly pulsating B subdwarfs have a higher visibility in the optical
domain than modes with l = 3. Although somewhat disappointing in terms of mode
discrimination, our results still suggest that the full potential of multicolor
photometry for l identification in pulsating subdwarfs is within reach.

gamma--ray bursts (GRBs) detected by BATSE are studied. In order to bring forth
their main characteristics, care was taken to define a representative set of
ten parameters. A multivariate analysis gives that ~70% of the total variation
in parameter values is driven by only three principal components. The variation
of the temporal parameters is clearly distinct from that of the spectral ones.
A close correlation is found between the half-width of the autocorrelation
function (tau) and the emission time (Tem); most importantly, this correlation
is self-similar in the sense that the mean values and dispersions of both tau
and Tem scale with the duration of the burst (T90). It is shown that the
Amati-relation can be derived from the sample and that the scatter around this
relation is correlated with the value of tau. Hence, tau has a role similar to
that of the break in the afterglow light curve (Tb) in the Ghirlanda-relation.
In the standard GRB-scenario, the close relation between a global parameter
(Tb) and a local one (tau) indicates that some of the jet-properties do not
vary much for different lines of sight. Finally, it is argued that the basic
temporal and spectral properties are associated with individual pulses, while
the overall properties of a burst is determined mainly by the number of pulses.

examples, simple traffic flow models are considered. On a microscopic level,
traffic flow is described by Bando's optimal velocity model in terms of
accelerating and decelerating forces. It allows to introduce kinetic,
potential, as well as total energy, which is the internal energy of the car
system in view of thermodynamics. The latter is not conserved, although it has
certain value in any of two possible stationary states corresponding either to
fixed point or to limit cycle in the space of headways and velocities. On a
mesoscopic level of description, the size n of car cluster is considered as a
stochastic variable in master equation. Here n=0 corresponds to the fixed-point
solution of the microscopic model, whereas the limit cycle is represented by
coexistence of a car cluster with n>0 and free flow phase. The detailed balance
holds in a stationary state just like in equilibrium liquid-gas system. It
allows to define free energy of the car system and chemical potentials of the
coexisting phases, as well as a relaxation to a local or global free energy
minimum. In this sense the behaviour of traffic flow can be described by
equilibrium thermodynamics. We find, however, that the chemical potential of
the cluster phase of traffic flow depends on an outer parameter - the density
of cars in the free-flow phase. It allows to distinguish between the traffic
flow as a driven system and purely equilibrium systems.

low-bias suppression of the current through single-molecule devices, termed
Franck-Condon blockade. In the limit of slow vibrational relaxation, transport
in the Franck-Condon-blockade regime proceeds via avalanches of large numbers
of electrons, which are interrupted by long waiting times without electron
transfer. The avalanches consist of smaller avalanches, leading to a
self-similar hierarchy which terminates once the number of transferred
electrons per avalanche becomes of the order of unity. Experimental signatures
of self-similar avalanche transport are strongly enhanced current (shot) noise,
as expressed by giant Fano factors, and a power-law noise spectrum. We develop
a theory of the Franck-Condon-blockade regime with particular emphasis on
effects of electron cotunneling through highly excited vibrational states. As
opposed to the exponential suppression of sequential tunneling rates for
low-lying vibrational states, cotunneling rates suffer only a power-law
suppression. This leads to a regime where cotunneling dominates the current for
any gate voltage. Including cotunneling within a rate-equation approach to
transport, we find that both the Franck-Condon blockade and self-similar
avalanche transport remain intact in this regime. We predict that cotunneling
leads to absorption-induced vibrational sidebands in the Coulomb-blockaded
regime as well as intrinsic telegraph noise near the charge degeneracy point.

generalization of LP-type problems. We show that Clarkson's randomized
algorithms for low-dimensional linear programming work in the context of
violator spaces. For example, in this way we obtain the fastest known algorithm
for the P-matrix generalized linear complementarity problem with a constant

they are equivalent to acyclic violator spaces, as well as to concrete LP-type
problems (informally, the constraints in a concrete LP-type problem are subsets
of a linearly ordered ground set, and the value of a set of constraints is the
minimum of its intersection).

disabilities to overcome their difficulties. With text-to-speech, a person
types at a keyboard, the text is synthesized, and the sound comes out through
the computer speakers.
  In recent years, Voice over IP (VoIP) applications have become very popular
and have been used by people worldwide. These applications allow people to talk
for free over the Internet and also to make traditional calls through the
Public-Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) at a small fraction of the cost
offered by traditional phone companies.
  We have created a system, called EasyVoice, which integrates speech
synthesizers with VoIP applications. The result allows a person with motor
impairments and voice disabilities to talk with another person located anywhere
in the world. The benefits in this case are much stronger than the ones
obtained by non-disabled people using VoIP applications. People with motor
impairments sometimes can hardly use a regular or mobile phone. Thus, the
advantage is not only the reduction in cost, but more important, the ability to
talk at all.

that end a conformal transformation is performed. That brings the theory into
the standard minimally coupled form (Einstein frame) with some effective field

coupling constant is preferable for successful inflation. Moreover, provided
fixed initial conditions, larger $|\xi|$ leads to a greater number of {\em

understood, but they enter critically into many observables. We argue that in
some regimes, stretching will be the only relevant process governing the
evolution. In this case, the string two-point function is determined up to
normalization: the fractal dimension approaches one at short distance, but the
rate of approach is characterized by an exponent that plays an essential role
in network properties. The smoothness at short distance implies, for example,
that cosmic string lensing images are little distorted. We then add in loop
production as a perturbation and find that it diverges at small scales. This
need not invalidate the stretching model, since the loop production occurs in
localized regions, but it implies a complicated fragmentation process. Our
ability to model this process is limited, but we argue that loop production
peaks a few orders of magnitude below the horizon scale, without the inclusion
of gravitational radiation. We find agreement with some features of
simulations, and interesting discrepancies that must be resolved by future
work.

mechanism in a two Higgs doublets model can trigger the electroweak symmetry
breaking if at least one of the eigenvalues of the squared mass matrix is
negative. We then consider two special cases of interest. In the decoupling
scenario, there is only one scalar degree of freedom in the low energy regime.
In the degenerate scenario, all five degrees of freedom are in the low energy
regime and will lead to observables effects at the LHC. Furthermore, in that
scenario, it is possible to impose a discrete symmetry between the doublets
that makes the extra neutral degrees of freedom stable. These are thus viable
dark matter candidates. We find an interesting relation between the electroweak
symmetry breaking mechanism and dark matter.

Heisenberg equations. In such a setting, the quantum system allows solutions in
a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, with a discrete spectrum for all physical
operators. We show that a class of solutions can be obtained using generators
of the Lie superalgebra gl(1|M). Then we study the properties and spectra of
the physical operators in a class of unitary representations of gl(1|M). These
properties are both interesting and intriguing. In particular, we can give a
complete analysis of the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian and of the position and
momentum operators (including multiplicities). We also study probability
distributions of position operators when the quantum system is in a stationary
state, and the effect of the position of one oscillator on the positions of the
remaining oscillators in the chain.

exploiting exchange relations dictated by the reflection equation we show that
the transfer matrix with trivial boundary conditions enjoys the recognized

i.e. a subset of the disk such that the analogue of the norm of a function in

  We show it is equivalent with the notion of determination set for the same
class, that is, subsets such that any function in the class which is bounded on
the subset must be bounded everywhere (by the same bound, in fact); and more
restrictive than the condition of being a determination set for the class of
differences of positive harmonic functions (which had been studied in
particular by Hayman, Lyons, and Gardiner).
  We give sufficient conditions for sampling to hold, as well as necessary
conditions (different but closely related), and show that in the case of
certain (natural) regular sets, the necessary and sufficient conditions
coincide and characterize the sampling property in a numerically precise way.

complications in regression-type analyses. Their most common use is to account
for within-subject correlation in longitudinal data analysis. They are also the
standard vehicle for smoothing spatial count data. However, when treated in
full generality, mixed models can also handle spline-type smoothing and closely
approximate kriging. This allows for nonparametric regression models (e.g.,
additive models and varying coefficient models) to be handled within the mixed
model framework. The key is to allow the random effects design matrix to have
general structure; hence our label general design. For continuous response
data, particularly when Gaussianity of the response is reasonably assumed,
computation is now quite mature and supported by the R, SAS and S-PLUS
packages. Such is not the case for binary and count responses, where
generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) are required, but are hindered by the
presence of intractable multivariate integrals. Software known to us supports
special cases of the GLMM (e.g., PROC NLMIXED in SAS or glmmML in R) or relies
on the sometimes crude Laplace-type approximation of integrals (e.g., the SAS
macro glimmix or glmmPQL in R). This paper describes the fitting of general
design generalized linear mixed models. A Bayesian approach is taken and Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used for estimation and inference. In this
generalized setting, MCMC requires sampling from nonstandard distributions. In
this article, we demonstrate that the MCMC package WinBUGS facilitates sound
fitting of general design Bayesian generalized linear mixed models in practice.

include complete case analysis (CC) and last observation carried forward
(LOCF). However, such methods rest on strong assumptions, including missing
completely at random (MCAR) for CC and unchanging profile after dropout for
LOCF. Such assumptions are too strong to generally hold. Over the last decades,
a number of full longitudinal data analysis methods have become available, such
as the linear mixed model for Gaussian outcomes, that are valid under the much
weaker missing at random (MAR) assumption. Such a method is useful, even if the
scientific question is in terms of a single time point, for example, the last
planned measurement occasion, and it is generally consistent with the
intention-to-treat principle. The validity of such a method rests on the use of
maximum likelihood, under which the missing data mechanism is ignorable as soon
as it is MAR. In this paper, we will focus on non-Gaussian outcomes, such as
binary, categorical or count data. This setting is less straightforward since
there is no unambiguous counterpart to the linear mixed model. We first provide
an overview of the various modeling frameworks for non-Gaussian longitudinal
data, and subsequently focus on generalized linear mixed-effects models, on the
one hand, of which the parameters can be estimated using full likelihood, and
on generalized estimating equations, on the other hand, which is a
nonlikelihood method and hence requires a modification to be valid under MAR.
We briefly comment on the position of models that assume missingness not at
random and argue they are most useful to perform sensitivity analysis. Our
developments are underscored using data from two studies. While the case
studies feature binary outcomes, the methodology applies equally well to other
discrete-data settings, hence the qualifier ``discrete'' in the title.

proof is by direct approach for x=0, and via classical Invariant Theory in the
other cases, exploiting then the well-known representation of Brauer algebras
as centralizer algebras of orthogonal or symplectic groups acting on tensor
powers of their standard representation. This also gives a great part of the

of significant control noise. The noise enters as run-to-run variations in the
control amplitude and phase with the observation being an ensemble average over
many runs as is commonly done in the laboratory. A genetic algorithm with an
improved elitism operator is used to find the optimal field that either fights
against or cooperates with control field noise. When seeking a high control
yield it is possible to find fields that successfully fight with the noise
while attaining good quality stable results. When seeking modest control
yields, fields can be found which are optimally shaped to cooperate with the
noise and thereby drive the dynamics more efficiently. In general, noise
reduces the coherence of the dynamics, but the results indicate that population
transfer objectives can be met by appropriately either fighting or cooperating
with noise, even when it is intense.

  not in JFM style), short version of the abstract",,"10.1017/S0022112007006830",,"physics.flu-dyn",,"  We investigate the two-dimensional flow of a liquid foam around circular
obstacles by measuring all the local fields necessary to describe this flow:
velocity, pressure, bubble deformations and rearrangements. We show how our
experimental setup, a quasi-2D ""liquid pool"" system, is adapted to the
determination of these fields: the velocity and bubble deformations are easy to
measure from 2D movies, and the pressure can be measured by exploiting a
specific feature of this system, a 2D effective compressibility. To describe
accurately bubble rearrangements, we propose a new, tensorial descriptor. All
these quantities are evaluated via an averaging procedure that we justify
showing that the fluctuations of the fields are essentially random. The flow is
extensively studied in a reference experimental case; the velocity presents an
overshoot in the wake of the obstacle, the pressure is maximum at the leading
side and minimal at the trailing side. The study of the elastic deformations
and of the velocity gradients shows that the transition between plug flow and
yielded regions is smooth. Our tensorial description of T1s highlight their
correlation both with the bubble deformations and the velocity gradients. A
salient feature of the flow, notably on the velocity and T1 repartition, is a
marked asymmetry upstream/downstream, signature of the elastic behaviour of the
foam. We show that the results do not change qualitatively when various control
parameters vary, identifying a robust quasistatic regime. These results are
discussed in the frame of the actual foam rheology literature, and we argue
that they constitute a severe test for existing rheological models, since they
capture both the elastic, plastic and fluid behaviour of the foam.

non-zero energy h nu for light in free space does not apply for the analogous
situation in dispersive media. Because the speed of light u is no longer equal
to c in this case, the key quantity, gamma = (1-u2/c2)-0.5, is finite as a
result. Since the rest energy of photons is believed to always be equal to
zero, multiplying it with gamma in analogy to the usual procedure employed in
the special theory of relativity (STR) does not produce a nonzero result for
photons in dispersive media. The experimental evidence of the Fizeau light-drag
and Cerenkov radiation phenomena indicate that the Lorentz transformation in
free space is nonetheless valid for light in dispersive media. Instead, the
energy and momentum of photons in transparent media can be obtained from
observations of the frequency, wavelength and index of refraction of the light.
A modification of the Lorentz transformation in which the observed speed of
light does appear explicitly is required, however, in order to accurately
predict the results of measurements made when the observer is at a different
gravitational potential than the object.

of local optima. We find that whether the evolutionary trajectory is
deterministic or stochastic depends on the effective mutational distance
$d_{\mathrm{eff}}$ upto which the population can spread in genotype space. For
$d_{\mathrm{eff}}=L$, the deterministic quasispecies theory operates while for
$d_{\mathrm{eff}} < 1$, the evolution is completely stochastic. Between these
two limiting cases, the dynamics are described by a local quasispecies theory

interference and uphill adaptive walks, respectively. We argue that our
findings are relevant to the interepretation of evolution experiments with

vertebrates, but its control is not understood in spite of the identification
of hundred of genes involved in Caenorhabditis elegans locomotion. To reveal
the mechanisms of nematode undulatory locomotion, we quantitatively analyzed
the movement of C. elegans with genetic perturbations to neurons, muscles, and
skeleton (cuticle). We also compared locomotion of different Caenorhabditis
species. We constructed a theoretical model that combines mechanics and
biophysics, and that is constrained by the observations of propulsion and
muscular velocities, as well as wavelength and amplitude of undulations. We
find that normalized wavelength is a conserved quantity among wild-type C.
elegans individuals, across mutants, and across different species. The velocity
of forward propulsion scales linearly with the velocity of the muscular wave
and the corresponding slope is also a conserved quantity and almost optimal;
the exceptions are in some mutants affecting cuticle structure. In theoretical
terms, the optimality of the slope is equivalent to the exact balance between
muscular and visco-elastic body reaction bending moments. We find that the
amplitude and frequency of undulations are inversely correlated and provide a
theoretical explanation for this fact. These experimental results are valid
both for young adults and for all larval stages of wild type C. elegans. In
particular, during development, the amplitude scales linearly with the
wavelength, consistent with our theory. We also investigated the influence of
substrate firmness on motion parameters, and found that it does not affect the
above invariants. In general, our biomechanical model can explain the observed
robustness of the mechanisms controlling nematode undulatory locomotion.

in motion at certain regions of a DNA sequence that include promoters. We
revisit that system and show that the observed behaviour has nothing to do with
promoters; on the contrary, it originates from the bases at the boundary, which
are not part of the studied genome. We explain this phenomenology in terms of
an effective potential for the kink center. This is further extended to
disprove recent claims that the dynamics of kinks [Lenholm and H\""ornquist,
Physica D, vol. 177, p. 233 (2003)] or breathers [Bashford, J. Biol. Phys.,

formulation on multilevel quantum systems strongly interacting with the
environment without spontaneous emission. When seeking a high control yield it
is possible to find fields that successfully fight with decoherence while
attaining a good quality yield. When seeking modest control yields, fields can
be found which are optimally shaped to cooperate with decoherence and thereby
drive the dynamics more efficiently. In the latter regime when the control
field and the decoherence strength are both weak, a theoretical foundation is
established to describe how they cooperate with each other. In general, the
results indicate that the population transfer objectives can be effectively met
by appropriately either fighting or cooperating with decoherence.
