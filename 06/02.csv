includes episodes of rebrightening. This was attributed in several cases to
large fluctuations in the external density. Here we examine the effect of a
sharp increase in the external density on the light curve by considering, for
the first time, a full treatment of both the hydrodynamic evolution and the
radiation in this scenario. To this end we develop a semi-analytic model for
the light curve and carry out several elaborate numerical simulations using a
1D hydrodynamic code together with a synchrotron radiation code.Two spherically
symmetric cases are explored in detail: a density jump in a uniform external
medium, and a wind termination shock. Contrary to previous works, we find that
even a sharp (step function) and large (by a factor of $a>>1$) increase in the
external density does not produce sharp features in the light curve, and cannot
account for significant temporal variability. For a wind termination shock, the
light curve smoothly transitions between the asymptotic power-laws over about
one decade in time, and there is no rebrightening in the optical or X-rays to
serve as a clear observational signature. For a sharp jump in a uniform density
we find that the maximal deviation $\Delta\alpha_max$ of the temporal decay
index $\alpha$ from its asymptotic value, is bounded (e.g., $\Delta\alpha_max
<0.4$ for $a=10$); $\Delta\alpha_max$ slowly increases with $a$, converging to
$\Delta\alpha_{max} \approx 1$ at very large $a$ values. Therefore, no optical
rebrightening is expected here as well. In the X-rays, while the asymptotic
flux is unaffected by the density jump, the fluctuations in $\alpha$ are found
to be comparable to those in the optical. Finally, we discuss the implications
of our results for the origin of the fluctuations in several afterglows.

We find that thermal conduction produces cooler temperatures and higher

thermal conduction in changing the thermal characteristics of the hot gas
bubble increases as the remnant propagates through denser ISMs. Remnants
evolving in denser ISMs are shown to make a faster transition to a

larger B-component of the CMB polarization, thus making the prospects for
future detection much more promising. Interestingly, the spectral index of

the sense that the synthetic spectrum calculated with the CLOUDY
photoionization code is used to separate the Fe II emission from the Mg II
line. The procedure of measuring the strengths of Fe II emission lines is
twofold; (1) subtracting the continuum components by fitting models of the
power-law and Balmer continua in the continuum windows which are relatively
free from line emissions, and (2) fitting models of the Fe II emission based on
the Fe II template to the continuum-subtracted spectra. From 14 quasars, we
obtained the Fe II fluxes in five wavelength bands, the total flux of Balmer
continuum, and the fluxes of Mg II, Halpha, and other emission lines, together
with the full width at half maxima (FWHMs) of these lines. Regression analysis
was performed by assuming a linear relation between any two of these
quantities. Eight correlations were found with a confidence level higher than
99%. The fact that six of these eight are related to FWHM or M_{BH} may imply
that M_{BH} is a fundamental quantity that controls Gamma or the spectral

Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite (SWAS) observed the 1(10)-1(01)
ortho-water ground-state rotational transition in comet 9P/Tempel 1 before,
during, and after the impact. No excess emission from the impact was detected
by SWAS and we derive an upper limit of 1.8e7 kg on the water ice evaporated by
the impact. However, the water production rate of the comet showed large
natural variations of more than a factor of three during the weeks before and
after the impact. Episodes of increased activity with Q(H2O)~1e28 molecule/s
alternated with periods with low outgassing (Q(H2O)<~5e27 molecule/s). We
estimate that 9P/Tempel 1 vaporized a total of N~4.5e34 water molecules (~1.3e9
kg) during June-September 2005. Our observations indicate that only a small
fraction of the nucleus of Tempel 1 appears to be covered with active areas.
Water vapor is expected to emanate predominantly from topographic features
periodically facing the Sun as the comet rotates. We calculate that appreciable
asymmetries of these features could lead to a spin-down or spin-up of the
nucleus at observable rates.

increase of 34% during the first four observing days, which can not be
explained by source extrinsic causes. The 86 GHz linear polarization fraction

obtained from the INTEGRAL observations. The relativistic beaming of the

with the optical light curve. Here we present an analysis of a huge VLBI data
set including 108 images at 15, 22, and 43 GHz obtained between 1995 and 2004.
The aim of this study is to identify the different components contributing to
the single-dish radio light curves. We obtain separate radio light curves for
the VLBI core and jet and show that the radio spectral index of single-dish
observations can be used to trace the core variability. Cross-correlation of
the radio spectral index with the optical light curve indicates that the
optical variations lead the radio by about 100 days at 15 GHz. By fitting the
radio time lags vs. frequency, we find that the power law is steeper than
expected for a freely expanding conical jet in equipartition with energy
density decreasing as the square of the distance down the jet as in the
K\""onigl model. There is a section of the compact radio jet where the emission
is weak such that flares propagating down the jet are bright first in the core
region with a secondary increase in flux about 1.0 mas from the core. This
illustrates the importance of direct imaging to the interpretation of
multi-wavelength light curves that can be affected by several distinct
components at any given time. We discuss how the complex behaviour of the light

blue horizontal-branch tail with a strong upward tilt in its colour-magnitude
diagram. Several noncanonical scenarios have been proposed to explain these
puzzling observations. In order to test the predictions of these scenarios, we
have obtained medium resolution spectra to determine the atmospheric parameters
of a sample of the blue HB stars in NGC 6388. Using the medium resolution
spectra, we determine effective temperatures, surface gravities and helium
abundances by fitting the observed Balmer and helium lines with appropriate
theoretical stellar spectra. As we know the distance to the cluster, we can
verify our results by determining masses for the stars. During the data
reduction we took special care in subtracting the background, which is
dominated by the overlapping spectra of cool stars. The physical parameters of
the blue HB stars near 10,000 K support the helium pollution scenario. The low
gravities and masses found for the hot blue tail stars, however, are probably
caused by problems with the data reduction, most likely due to remaining
background light in the spectra, which would affect the fainter hot blue tail
stars much more strongly than the brighter cool blue tail stars. Our study of
the hot blue tail stars in NGC 6388 illustrates the obstacles which are
encountered when attempting to determine the atmospheric parameters of hot HB
stars in very crowded fields using ground-based observations. We discuss these
obstacles and offer possible solutions for future projects.

field we study the more general magnetic field structures reminiscent of the
butterfly diagram. The migrating field is prescribed as the observed
axisymmetric radial magnetic field Stenflo (1988, 1994). Our results are in
good agreement with our analitical estimate and our previous works in
Forgacs-Dajka & Petrovay (2001,2002), but the polar ""dip"" in isorotational
surfaces is strongly reduced in this case. On the other hand, a more realistic
model should have a magnetic diffusivity decreasing significantly inside the
radiative interior, so we also explore the effect of diffusivity and magnetic
Prandtl number varying with depth. We found that the downwards decreasing
magnetic diffusivity and Prandtl number have no significant effect on the
solution, although the temporal variation of the tachocline thickness has
decreased.

more complex morphologies than galaxies of other bulge types, more often
showing (off-)centered X structures, secondary major-axis maxima and
spiral-like structures. Those features are also observed in N-body simulations
of barred discs and may trace the main bar orbit families. The surface
brightness profiles of galaxies with a B/PS bulge are also more complex, with
typically 3 or more clearly separated regions, including a flat intermediate
region (Freeman Type II profiles). Those radial breaks offer evidence for
bar-driven transfer of angular momentum and radial redistribution of material.
The profiles also suggest a rapid variation of the scaleheight of the disc
material, contrary to conventional wisdom but again as expected from vertical
resonances and instabilities in barred discs. The steep inner region of the
surface brightness profiles is often shorter than the isophotally thick part of
the galaxies, itself always shorter than the flat region of the profiles.
Contrary to the standard `bulge + disc' model, we thus propose that galaxies
with a B/PS bulge are composed of a thin concentrated disc (a disc-like bulge)
contained within a partially thick bar (the B/PS bulge) and a thin outer disc.
The inner disc likely formed secularly through bar-driven processes and is
responsible for the steep inner region of the surface brightness profiles,
while the bar is responsible for the flat region and the thick complex
morphological structures observed. Those components are strongly coupled
dynamically and are formed mostly of the same (disc) material. [Abridged]

degrees, as expected given the previously-determined size of the AB Aurigae
inner dust disk. However, a clear closure phase signal of -3.5 +/- 0.5 degrees
is detected on one triangle containing relatively short baselines, requiring a
high degree of non-point symmetry from emission at larger (AU-sized) scales in
the disk. We have not identified any alternative explanation for these closure
phase results and demonstrate that a ``disk hot spot'' model can fit our data.
We speculate that such asymmetric near-infrared emission detected might arise
as a result of localized viscous heating due to a gravitational instability in

both on the orbits and their relative orientation on the lattice. Values of the
two exchange parameters which are chosen to give the correct low temperature

behaviour in low-dimensional systems. New electronic phases of matter have been
predicted to occur in the vicinity of a QCP by two-dimensional theories, and
explanations based on these ideas have been proposed for significant unsolved
problems in condensed-matter physics, such as non-Fermi-liquid behaviour and
high-temperature superconductivity. But the real materials to which these ideas
have been applied are usually rendered three-dimensional by a finite electronic
coupling between their component layers; a two-dimensional QCP has not been
experimentally observed in any bulk three-dimensional system, and mechanisms
for dimensional reduction have remained the subject of theoretical conjecture.
Here we show evidence that the Bose-Einstein condensate of spin triplets in the
three-dimensional Mott insulator BaCuSi2O6 provides an experimentally
verifiable example of dimensional reduction at a QCP. The interplay of
correlations on a geometrically frustrated lattice causes the individual
two-dimensional layers of spin-1/2 Cu2+ pairs (spin dimers) to become decoupled
at the QCP, giving rise to a two-dimensional QCP characterized by power law
scaling distinctly different from that of its three-dimensional counterpart.
Thus the very notion of dimensionality can be said to acquire an 'emergent'
nature: although the individual particles move on a three-dimensional lattice,
their collective behaviour occurs in lower-dimensional space.

polarization opposes the electrically induced dipole moments. In the PIM1 and

identical to that predicted by spin-wave theory for the isotropic model, albeit
with a multiplicative factor of 1.1672. This result compares very well to
results of cumulant series expansions and Monte Carlo simulation that again

the electron-phonon interaction (EPI) in pairing mechanism of HTSC cuprates. A
controllable theory for strong correlations and their effects on EPI is
discussed which is based on the 1/N expansion method in the t-J model. Strong
correlations renormalize EPI and other charge-fluctuation properties (by
including nonmagnetic impurity scattering) and the forward scattering peak
(FSP) appears in the effective interactions. Pronounced FSP in EPI of HTSC
cuprates reconciles many puzzling results. The theory of EPI with FSP gives
that the couplings in the s- and d-wave pairing channel are of the same
magnitude near and below the optimal hole doping. FSP in the nonmagnetic
impurity scattering potential is responsible for robustness of d-wave pairing
in cuprates. The ARPES kink and the isotope effect in the nodal and anti-nodal
points and the collapse of the elastic impurity scattering in the
superconducting state, are explained by this theory. It also explains why the
nodal kink is not-shifted in the superconducting state while the anti-nodal
kink is shifted by the maximal superconducting gap. In systems with FSP in EPI
besides the classical phase fluctuations there are also internal fluctuations
of Cooper pairs giving rise to an additional contribution to the pseudogap.

both the electroweak hierarchy and flavor problems. Such models have a warped,
compact extra dimension with the standard model fermions and gauge bosons
living in the bulk, and the Higgs living on or near the TeV brane. In this
paper we consider bounds on these models set by lepton flavor violation
constraints. We find that loop-induced decays of the form l->l'+gamma are
ultraviolet sensitive and uncalculable when the Higgs field is localized on a
four-dimensional brane; this drawback does not occur when the Higgs field
propagates in the full five-dimensional space-time. We find constraints at the
few TeV level throughout the natural range of parameters, arising from
muon-electron conversion in the presence of nuclei, rare muon decays, and rare
tau decays. A ""tension"" exists between loop-induced dipole decays such as
mu->e+gamma and tree-level processes such as muon-electron conversion; they
have opposite dependences on the five-dimensional Yukawa couplings, making it
difficult to decouple flavor-violating effects. We emphasize the importance of
the future experiments MEG and PRIME. These experiments will definitively test
the Randall-Sundrum geometric origin of hierarchies in the lepton sector at the

and numerically. Under the influence of the chromomagnetic background field the
effective potential of the system is found to have a global minimum for a
finite pion condensate even for small values of the effective quark coupling
constant. In the strong field limit, an effective dimensional reduction has
been found to take place.

regularizations, interesting operators here are true tensor objects with
classical transformation laws, even on target spaces where the theory has a

definition of the operators, the anomaly is clearly separated from the issue of
operator renormalization and can be understood in isolation, instead of
infecting the latter as in other approaches. Our method is of wider
applicability to covariant theories that are not Weyl invariant, but where
covariant tensor operators are desired.
  After constructing covariantly regularized vertex operators, we define a
class of background-independent path integral measures suitable for string
quantization. We show how gauge invariance of the path integral implies the
usual physical state conditions in a very conceptually clean way. We then
discuss the construction of the BRST action from first principles, obtaining
some interesting caveats relating to its general covariance. In our approach,
the expected BRST related anomalies are encoded somewhat differently from other
approaches. We conclude with an unusual but amusing derivation of the value $D=
26$ of the critical dimension.

independent of the trace. The first possibility corresponds to General
Relativity, whereas the second corresponds to ""unimodular"" gravity (in a
certain gauge). Phenomenologically, both options are equally acceptable. For
massive gravitons, the situation is more restrictive. Up to field
redefinitions, classical stability and absence of ghosts lead directly to the

against deformations than linearized GR, since a mass term cannot be added

We model the nonsmooth fluctuating part of the potential by the
alternating-sign sine series fractal of Berry and Lewis A(x,g). Setting d=3/2,
we estimate the frequency parameter (gamma), plus an overall scaling parameter
(sigma) we introduce. We search for that pair of parameters (gamma,sigma) which
minimizes the least-squares fit S_{n}(gamma,sigma) of the lowest n eigenvalues

investigating thermal effects of rotation through both random classical zero
point radiation and quantum vacuum. Both RSs consist of an infinite number of
instantaneous global inertial reference frames (RF). The RFs do not accompany
the detector and are defined so that at each moment of proper time of the
detector there are two RFs belonging with different RSs. These RFs agree
momentarily, are connected by a Lorentz transformation with the detector
velocity as a parameter, and with origins at the detector location at the same
proper time. The two- field correlation functions (CF) measured by the observer
rotating through a random classical zero point radiation have been calculated
and presented in terms of elementary functions for both electromagnetic and
massless scalar fields. If the CFs are periodic with a period of rotation the
observer finds the spectrum which is very similar, but not identical, to Plank

electromagnetic and massless scalar case, are taken at the same point then its

the not purely random, but highly co-operative nature of the game is reflected
in averaged properties such as the probability distributions of scored goals

distributions are not well described by the Poissonian or binomial model
resulting from the assumption of uncorrelated random events. Instead, a good
effective description of the data is provided by less basic distributions such
as the negative binomial one or the probability densities of extreme value
statistics. To understand this behavior from a microscopical point of view,
however, no waiting time problem or extremal process need be invoked. Instead,
modifying the Bernoulli random process underlying the Poissonian model to
include a simple component of self-affirmation seems to describe the data
surprisingly well and allows to understand the observed deviation from Gaussian
statistics. The phenomenological distributions used before can be understood as
special cases within this framework. We analyzed historical football score data
from many leagues in Europe as well as from international tournaments,
including data from all past tournaments of the ``FIFA World Cup'' series, and
found the proposed models to be applicable rather universally. In particular,
here we analyse the results of the German women's premier football league and
consider the two separate German men's premier leagues in the East and West
during the cold war times and the unified league after 1990 to see how scoring
in football and the component of self-affirmation depend on cultural and

are the ones of two-dimensional percolation. Further, the degree and clustering
coefficient distributions and the average path length show that the network
associated with such a system presents non-trivial features which, depending on
the collision rule, enables one not only to recover the main properties of
standard networks, such as exponential, random and scale-free networks, but
also to obtain other topological structures. Namely, we show a specific example
where the obtained structure has topological features which characterize
accurately the structure and evolution of social networks in different

that the Price equation being a mathematical identity is not dynamically
sufficient, i.e., it does not allow one to predict changes in the mean of a
trait beyond the immediate response if only the value of covariance of the
trait and fitness at this moment is known. We show that the problem of
dynamically insufficiency for the Price equations and for the FTNS can be
correctly overcome if to study these equations subject to given initial
distribution in framework of exact models of the population dynamics. The
knowledge of the entire distribution at any given instant allows making the
exact prediction for indefinite time and this prediction dramatically depends
on the initial distribution. For these models, the current trait distribution

decoherence by error correction, there is no need to consider decoherence at
the level of algorithms. Nonetheless, enlarging the range of quantum dynamics
to include non-unitary evolution provides a wider range of possibilities for
tuning the properties of quantum walks. For example, small amounts of
decoherence in a quantum walk on the line can produce more uniform spreading (a
top-hat distribution), without losing the quantum speed up. This paper reviews
the work on decoherence, and more generally on non-unitary evolution, in
quantum walks and suggests what future questions might prove interesting to
pursue in this area.
