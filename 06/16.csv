substructure in galaxy-sized halos, via anomalous flux ratios in
quadruply-imaged lenses. In addition to causing anomalous flux ratios,
substructure may also perturb the positions of lensed images at observable
levels. In this paper, we numerically investigate the scale of such astrometric
perturbations using realistic models of substructure distributions.
Substructure distributions that project clumps near the Einstein radius of the
lens result in perturbations that are the least degenerate with the best-fit
smooth macromodel, with residuals at the milliarcsecond scale. Degeneracies
between the center of the lens potential and astrometric perturbations suggest
that milliarcsecond constraints on the center of the lensing potential boost
the observed astrometric perturbations by an order of magnitude compared to
leaving the center of the lens as a free parameter. In addition, we discuss
methods of substructure detection via astrometric perturbations that avoid full
lens modeling in favor of local image observables and also discuss modeling of
systems with luminous satellites to constrain the masses of those satellites.

gravitationally unstable protoplanetary disks with radiative transfer. We adopt
a flux-limited diffusion scheme justified by the high opacity of most of the
disk. The optically thin surface of the disk cools as a blackbody. The disks
grow slowly in mass starting from a Toomre-stable initial condition to the
point at which they become marginally unstable. We find that gravitationally
bound clumps with masses close to a Jupiter mass can arise. Fragmentation
appears to be driven by vertical convective-like motions capable of
transporting the heat from the disk midplane to its surface on a timescale of
only about 40 years at 10 AU. A larger or smaller cooling efficiency of the
disk at the optically thin surface can promote or stifle fragmentation by
affecting the vertical temperature profile, which determines whether convection
can happen or not, and by regulating the accretion flow from optically thin
regions towards overdense regions. We also find that the chances of
fragmentation increase for a higher mean molecular weight $\mu$ since
compressional heating is reduced. Around a star with mass $1 M_{\odot}$ only
disks with $\mu \ge 2.4$, as expected for gas with a metallicity comparable to
solar or higher, fragment. This suggests that disk instability, like
core-accretion, should be more effective in forming gas giants at higher gas
metallicities, consistent with the observed correlation between metallicity of
the planet-hosting stars and frequency of planets

detections over the range 150-400GHz (750-2000 microns), the average
polarization position angles are all found to be consistent with a rotation
measure of -4.4 +/- 0.3 x 10^5 rad/m^2. This implies that the Faraday rotation
occurs external to the polarized source at all wavelengths. This implies an
accretion rate ~0.2 - 4 x 10^-8 Msun/yr for the accretion density profiles
expected of ADAF, jet and CDAF models and assuming that the region at which
electrons in the accretion flow become relativistic is within 10 R_S. The
inferred accretion rate is inconsistent with ADAF/Bondi accretion. The
stability of the mean polarization position angle between disparate
polarization observations over the frequency range limits fluctuations in the
accretion rate to less than 5%. The flat frequency dependence of the inter-day

efficiently form stars through atomic line cooling and to hold onto their gas

in particular that of the supernovae feedback, create a sharp transition: over
the mass range 3-10x10^7 Msun, the BBBs drop two orders ofmagnitude in stellar
mass. Below ~2x10^7 Msun, galaxies will be dark with almost no stars and no
gas. Above this scale is the smallest unit of galaxy formation: the BBB.
  A small fraction (~100) of these gas rich BBBs fall in to a galaxy the size
of the Milky Way. Ten percent of these survive to become the observed LG dwarf
galaxies at the present epoch. Those in-falling halos on benign orbits which
keep them far away from the Milky Way or Andromeda manage to retain their gas
and slowly form stars - these become the smallest dwarf irregular galax ies;
those on more severe orbits lose their gas faster than they can form stars and
become the dwarf spheroidals. The remaining 90% of the BBBs will be accreted.

simultaneously in 16 spectral bands (resolution R~20). For the ~10 most

proposed mission achieves its power by exploiting the most efficient and robust
coronagraphic and wavefront control techniques. The Phase-Induced Amplitude
Apodization (PIAA) coronagraph used by TOPS allows planet detection at 2
lambda/d with nearly 100% throughput and preserves the telescope angular

measures wavefront aberrations which are fed back to the telescope active
primary mirror. Fine wavefront control is also performed independently in each

massive cluster NGC 346. Stellar parameters are determined using an automated
fitting method. Comparison with predictions of stellar evolution that account
for stellar rotation does not result in a unique age, though most stars are
best represented by an age of 1-3 Myr. The present day v_sini distribution of
the 21 dwarf stars in our sample is consistent with an underlying rotational
velocity (v_r) distribution that can be characterised by a mean velocity of
about 160-190 km/s and an effective half width of 100-150 km/s. The v_r
distribution must include a small percentage of slowly rotating stars. If
predictions of the time evolution of the equatorial velocity for massive stars
within the environment of the SMC are correct, the young age of the cluster
implies that this underlying distribution is representative for the initial
rotational velocity distribution. The location in the Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram of the stars showing helium enrichment is in qualitative agreement with
evolutionary tracks accounting for rotation, but not for those ignoring v_r.
The mass loss rates of the SMC objects having luminosities of log L/L_sun > 5.4
are in excellent agreement with predictions. However, for lower luminosity
stars the winds are too weak to determine M_dot accurately from the optical

the VLTI/AMBER instrument operating in the K band which provides a gain by a

Moreover, it is possible to combine the high angular resolution provided with
the (medium) spectral resolution of AMBER to study the kinematics of the inner

first time the direct evidence that the disk is in keplerian rotation,
answering a question that occurs since the discovery of the first Be star

the disk showing that it is compatible with a thin disk + polar enhanced winds
modeled with the SIMECA code. We found that the disk around $\alpha$ Arae is
compatible with a dense equatorial matter confined in the central region
whereas a polar wind is contributing along the rotational axis of the central
star. Between these two regions the density must be low enough to reproduce the
large visibility modulus (small extension) obtained for two of the four VLTI
baselines. Moreover, we obtain that $\alpha$ Arae is rotating very close to its
critical rotation. This scenario is also compatible with the previous MIDI
measurements.

cuts in JHKs in order to exclusively search for galaxies located at high

excess of red galaxies with J-K>2.3 by a factor of two around the combined
radio galaxies fields compared to those found in the general field of GOODS
South. The excess of galaxies around the radio galaxies fields becomes more
than factor of three around 19.5<K<20.5 when the two-colours cuts are applied

fields tend to host high density regions at high redshifts, although there
seems to be the variety of the density of the colour-selected galaxies in each

show very strong density excess and these are likely to be proto-clusters
associated to the radio galaxies which would evolve into rich clusters of

the overdoped regime. Experiments are beginning to reveal that the
phenomenology of the overdoped regime is just as puzzling. For example, the
electrons appear to form a Landau Fermi liquid, but this interpretation is
problematic; any trace of Mott phenomena, as signified by incommensurate
antiferromagnetic fluctuations, is absent, and the uniform spin susceptibility
shows a ferromagnetic upturn. Here we show and justify that many of these

are simultaneously present with superconductivity, and the termination of the

beyond which there should be a genuine ferromagnetic phase at zero temperature.
We propose new experiments, and make new predictions, to test our theory and
suggest that effort must be mounted to elucidate the nature of the overdoped

and magnetic orders. Some of them can be ferroelectric and ferromagnetic and,
for example, provide the unique opportunity of encoding information
independently in electric polarization and magnetization to obtain four
different logic states. However, schemes allowing a simple electrical readout
of these different states have not been demonstrated so far. In this article,
we show that this can be achieved if a multiferroic material is used as the
tunnel barrier in a magnetic tunnel junction. We demonstrate that thin films of
ferromagnetic-ferroelectric La0.1Bi0.9MnO3 (LBMO) retain both ferroic
properties down to a thickness of only 2 nm. We have used such films as
spin-filtering tunnel barriers the magnetization and electric polarization of
which can be switched independently. In that case, the tunnel current across
the structure is controlled by both the magnetic and ferroelectric
configuration of the barrier, which gives rise to four distinct resistance
states. This can be explained by the combination of spin filtering by the
ferromagnetic LBMO barrier and the partial charge screening of electrical
charges at the barrier/electrode interfaces due to ferroelectricity. We
anticipate our results to be a starting point for more studies on the interplay
between ferroelectricity and spin-dependent tunneling, and for the use of
nanometric multiferroic elements in prototype devices. On a wider perspective,
they may open the way towards novel reconfigurable logic spintronics
architectures and to electrically controlled readout in quantum computing

satisfy the empirical relation theta_{sol} + theta_{C} ~ 45^{o}. This relation
suggests the existence of a correlation between the mixing matrices of leptons
and quarks, the so called quark-lepton complementarity. Here, we examine the
possibility that this correlation originates in the strong hierarchy in the
mass spectra of quarks and charged leptons, and the seesaw mechanism that gives
mass to the Majorana neutrinos. In a unified treatment of quarks and leptons in
which the mass matrices of all fermions have a similar Fritzsch texture, we
calculate the mixing matrices V_{CKM} and U_{MNSP} as functions of quark and
lepton masses and only two free parameters, in very good agreement with the
latest experimental values on masses and mixings. Three essential ingredients
to explain the quark-lepton complementarity relation are identified: the strong
hierarchy in the mass spectra of quarks and charged leptons, the normal seesaw
mechanism and the assumption of maximal CP violation in the lepton sector.

both axial and vector form factors is investigated and the values of all the
form factors at zero-momentum transfer are presented. Following the same
strategy already applied to the decay K0 -> pi- l nu, the SU(3)-breaking
corrections to the vector form factor at zero-momentum transfer, f1(0), are
determined with great statistical accuracy in the regime of the simulated quark
masses, which correspond to pion masses above ~ 0.7 GeV. Besides f1(0) also the
axial to vector ratio g1(0) / f1(0), which is relevant for the extraction of
the CKM matrix element Vus, is determined with significant accuracy. Due to the
heavy masses involved, a polynomial extrapolation, which does not include the
effects of meson loops, is performed down to the physical quark masses,
obtaining f1(0) = -0.948 +/- 0.029 and g1(0) / f1(0) = -0.287 +/- 0.052, where
the uncertainties do not include the quenching effect. Adding a recent
next-to-leading order determination of chiral loops, calculated within the
Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory in the approximation of neglecting the
decuplet contribution, we obtain f1(0) = -0.988 +/- 0.029(lattice) +/-
0.040(HBChPT). Our findings indicate that SU(3)-breaking corrections are
moderate on both f1(0) and g1(0). They also favor the experimental scenario in
which the weak electricity form factor, g2(0), is large and positive, and
correspondingly the value of |g1(0) / f1(0)| is reduced with respect to the one

behavior for a critical area. Apparently this is not reflected in the Wilson
loops. However, we show that the existence of a critical area is encoded in the
winding Wilson loops: Although there is no non-analyticity or phase transition
in these Wilson loops, the dynamics of these loops consists of two smoothly
connected domains separated by the critical area, one domain with a confining
behavior for large winding Wilson loops, and one (below the critical size)
where the string tension disappears. We show that this can be interpreted in
terms of a simple tunneling process between an ordered and a disordered state.
In view of recent results by Narayanan and Neuberger this tunneling may also be
relevant for four dimensional QCD.

determines the extension uniquely. The components of the map determine a
quadratic ideal in a polynomial algebra and we say that the extension is
Bockstein closed if this ideal is invariant under the Bockstein operator.
  We find a direct condition on the quadratic map that characterizes when the
extension is Bockstein closed. Using this we show for example that quadratic
maps induced from the fundamental quadratic map on gl_n, Q(A)=A+A^2 yield
Bockstein closed extensions. We also show that this condition is equivalent to
a certain liftability of the extension and under certain conditions, to the
fact that Q corresponds to a 2-power map of a restricted 2-Lie algebra.

thus field emission in the CEBAF SRF cavities during assembly, a cold ceramic

the tongue that are observed in VCV sequences are due partly to the anatomical
arrangement of the tongue muscles and how they are used to produce a velar
closure. The study uses an anatomically based 2D biomechanical tongue model.
Tissue elastic properties are accounted for in finite-element modeling, and
movement is controlled by constant-rate control parameter shifts. Tongue
raising and lowering movements are produced by the model with the combined
actions of the genioglossus, styloglossus and hyoglossus. Simulations of V1CV2
movements were made, where C is a velar consonant and V is [a], [i] or [u]. If
V1 is one of the vowels [a] and [u], the resulting trajectories describe
movements that begin to loop forward before consonant closure and continue to
slide along the palate during the closure. This prediction is in agreement with
classical data published in the literature. If V1 is vowel [i], we observe a
small backward movement. This is also in agreement with some measurements on
human speakers, but it is also in contradiction with the original data
published by Houde (1967). These observations support the idea that the
biomechanical properties of the tongue could be the main factor responsible for
the forward loops when V1 is a back vowel. In the left [i] context, it seems
that additional factors have to be taken into considerations, in order to
explain the observations made on some speakers

  Finite Element Models To Predict Surgical Outcomes",,"Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering 8 (4)
  (2005) 259-265",,,"physics.med-ph",,"  This paper addresses an important issue raised for the clinical relevance of
Computer-Assisted Surgical applications, namely the methodology used to
automatically build patient-specific Finite Element (FE) models of anatomical
structures. From this perspective, a method is proposed, based on a technique
called the Mesh-Matching method, followed by a process that corrects mesh
irregularities. The Mesh-Matching algorithm generates patient-specific volume
meshes from an existing generic model. The mesh regularization process is based
on the Jacobian matrix transform related to the FE reference element and the
current element. This method for generating patient-specific FE models is first
applied to Computer-Assisted maxillofacial surgery, and more precisely to the
FE elastic modelling of patient facial soft tissues. For each patient, the
planned bone osteotomies (mandible, maxilla, chin) are used as boundary
conditions to deform the FE face model, in order to predict the aesthetic
outcome of the surgery. Seven FE patient-specific models were successfully
generated by our method. For one patient, the prediction of the FE model is
qualitatively compared with the patient's post-operative appearance, measured
from a Computer Tomography scan. Then, our methodology is applied to
Computer-Assisted orbital surgery. It is, therefore, evaluated for the
generation of eleven patient-specific FE poroelastic models of the orbital soft
tissues. These models are used to predict the consequences of the surgical
decompression of the orbit. More precisely, an average law is extrapolated from
the simulations carried out for each patient model. This law links the size of
the osteotomy (i.e. the surgical gesture) and the backward displacement of the
eyeball (the consequence of the surgical gesture).

content. A few clinical observations ruling on an almost linear relationship
between globe backward displacement and tissue decompressed volume are
described in the literature. Methods: Fast prediction of decompressed volume is
derived from the geometric model: a sphere in interaction with a cone. Besides,
a poroelastic Finite Element model involving morphology, material properties of
orbital components and surgical gesture was implemented. Results: The geometric
model provided a better decompression volume estimation than the Finite Element
model. Besides, the Finite Element model permitted to quantify the backward
displacement, the surgical gesture and the stiffness of the orbital content.
Conclusions: The preliminary results obtained for one patient, in accordance
with the clinical literature, were relatively satisfying. An efficient aid for
location and size of osteotomies was derived and seemed to be able to help in
the surgery planning. Relevance: To our knowledge, this paper concerns the
first biomechanical study of exophthalmia reduction. The approach permitted to
improve the treatment of orbitopathy and can be used in a clinical setting.

developed in the framework of the computer-assisted maxillofacial surgery.
After a brief overview of the continuous elastic modelling method, two models
are introduced and their use for computer-assisted applications discussed. The
first model deals with orthognathic surgery and aims at predicting the facial
consequences of maxillary and mandibular osteotomies. For this, a generic
three-dimensional model of the face is automatically adapted to the morphology
of the patient by the mean of elastic registration. Qualitative simulations of
the consequences of an osteotomy of the mandible can thus be provided. The
second model addresses the Sleep Apnoea Syndrome. Its aim is to develop a
complete modelling of the interaction between airflow and upper airways walls
during respiration. Dynamical simulations of the interaction during a
respiratory cycle are computed and compared with observed phenomena.

  results",,"C. R. Biologies 325 (2002) 309-319",,,"physics.med-ph",,"  Surgical resection of hepatic tumours is not always possible, since it
depends on different factors, among which their location inside the liver
functional segments. Alternative techniques consist in local use of chemical or
physical agents to destroy the tumour. Radio frequency and cryosurgical
ablations are examples of such alternative techniques that may be performed
percutaneously. This requires a precise localisation of the tumour placement
during ablation. Computer-assisted surgery tools may be used in conjunction
with these new ablation techniques to improve the therapeutic efficiency,
whilst they benefit from minimal invasiveness. This paper introduces the
principles of a system for computer-assisted hepatic tumour ablation and
describes preliminary experiments focusing on data registration evaluation. To
keep close to conventional protocols, we consider registration of pre-operative
CT or MRI data to intra-operative echographic data.

elaborated in the aim to test hypotheses about speech motor control. Tissue
elastic properties are accounted for in Finite Element Modeling (FEM). The FEM
mesh was designed in order to facilitate the implementation of muscle
arrangement within the tongue. Therefore, its structure was determined on the
basis of accurate anatomical data about the tongue. Mechanically, the
hypothesis of hyperelasticity was adopted with the Mooney-Rivlin formulation of
the strain energy function. Muscles are modeled as general force generators
that act on anatomically specified sets of nodes of the FEM structure. The 8
muscles that are known to be largely involved in the production of basic speech
movements are modeled. The model and the solving of the Lagrangian equations of
movement are implemented using the ANSYSTM software. Simulations of the
influence of muscle activations onto the tongue shape are presented and
analyzed.

that gathers the dental and the maxillo-facial analyses together into a single
computer-assisted procedure. The idea is first to propose a repositioning of
the maxilla, via the introduction of a 3D cephalometry, applied to a 3D virtual
model of the patient's skull. Then, orthodontic data are integrated into this
model, thanks to optical measurements of teeth plaster casts. Materials and
Methods : The feasibility of the maxillo-facial demonstrator was first
evaluated on a dry skull. To simulate malformations (and thus to simulate a
""real"" patient), the skull was modified and manually cut by the surgeon, in
order to generate a given maxillo-facial malformation (with asymmetries in the
sagittal, frontal and axial planes). Results : The validation of our simulator
consisted in evaluating its ability to propose a bone repositioning diagnosis
that will put the skull as it was in its original configuration. A first
qualitative validation is provided in this paper, with a 1.5-mm error in the
repositioning diagnosis. Conclusions : These results mainly validate the
concept of a maxillo-facial numerical simulator that integrates 3D cephalometry
and guarantees a correct dental occlusion.

Agarwal and Weidlich-Haake models. It is shown that the states which remain
pure are the squeezed states with constant in time variances. For pure states,
the generalized nonlinear Schr\"" odinger-type equations corresponding to these
master equations are also obtained. Then the condition for purity of states of
a damped harmonic oscillator is considered in the framework of Lindblad theory
for open quantum systems. For a special choice of the environment coefficients,
the correlated coherent states with constant variances and covariance are shown
to be the only states which remain pure all the time during the evolution of
the considered system. In Karrlein-Grabert and Lindblad models, as well as in
the considered particular models, the expressions of the rate of entropy
production is written and it is shown that the states which preserve their
purity in time are also the states which minimize the entropy production and,
therefore, they are the most stable ones under evolution in the presence of the
environment and play an important role in the description of decoherence
phenomenon.
