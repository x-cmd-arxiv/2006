shear surveys. We demonstrate that, in conjunction with results from cosmic
microwave background (CMB) experiments, the properties of dark energy can be
estimated with very high precision with large-scale, fully 3D weak lensing
surveys. In particular, a 5-band, 10,000 square degree ground-based survey to a
median redshift of zm=0.7 could achieve 1-$\sigma$ marginal statistical errors,
in combination with the constraints expected from the CMB Planck Surveyor, of
$\Delta$w0=0.108 and $\Delta$wa=0.099 where we parameterize w by
w(a)=w0+wa(1-a) where a is the scale factor. Such a survey is achievable with a
wide-field camera on a 4 metre class telescope. The error on the value of w at
an intermediate pivot redshift of z=0.368 is constrained to
$\Delta$w(z=0.368)=0.0175. We compare and combine the 3D weak lensing
constraints with the cosmological and dark energy parameters measured from
planned Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) and supernova Type Ia experiments,
and find that 3D weak lensing significantly improves the marginalized errors. A
combination of 3D weak lensing, CMB and BAO experiments could achieve
$\Delta$w0=0.037 and $\Delta$wa=0.099. Fully 3D weak shear analysis avoids the
loss of information inherent in tomographic binning, and we show that the
sensitivity to systematic errors is much less. In conjunction with the fact
that the physics of lensing is very soundly based, this analysis demonstrates
that deep, wide-angle 3D weak lensing surveys are extremely promising for
measuring dark energy properties.

B stars by the iron-bump opacity mechanism. The results are significant for the
interpretation of pulsations in subdwarf B stars, helium-rich subdwarfs and
extreme helium stars, including the EC14026 and PG1716 variables. We
demonstrate that, for radial oscillations, the driving mechanism becomes
effective by increasing the contrast between the iron-bump opacity and the
opacity from other sources. The location of the iron-bump instability boundary
depends on the mean molecular weight in the envelope and also on the radial
order of the oscillation. A bluer instability boundary is provided by
increasing the iron abundance alone, explaining the observed EC14026 variables,
and by higher radial order oscillations. We show that the coolest EC14026
variables may vary in the fundamental radial mode, but the hottest variables
must be of higher radial order. In considering non-radial oscillations, we
demonstrate that g-modes of high radial order and low spherical degree (l<4)
may be excited in some blue horizontal branch stars with near-normal
composition (Z=0.02). Additional iron enhancement extends the g-mode
instability zone to higher effective temperatures and also creates a p-mode
instability zone. With sufficient iron, the p-mode and g-mode instability zones
overlap, allowing a small region where the EC14026 and PG1716-type variability
can be excited simultaneously. However its location is roughly 5000 K too low
compared with the observed boundary between EC14026 and PG1716 variables.

detection of faint objects very close to a bright star, especially giant
extrasolar planets. Apart from a high Strehl ratio, the instrument will be
designed to reduce the scattered light of the central bright star and subtract
the residual speckle halo. Sophisticated post-AO capabilities are needed to

the ground based detection of planetary features. Its goal is to suppress

and 1420 MHz continuum emission and HI-line emission data of the Canadian
Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS) by the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory
(DRAO). Two methods of spectral index analysis for HB9 are presented and
compared: one removes compact sources at both frequencies but is limited to the
resolution of the 408 MHz image; the other removes compact sources only in the
1420 MHz image so is effective at higher spatial resolution. The second allows
more detailed spectral index variation studies than the first. The two T-T plot
methods and new integrated flux densities give spectral index
(S_{\nu}\propto\nu^{-alpha}) for the whole of HB9 of 0.48+-0.03; and
0.47+-0.06, respectively. These are lower than previous spectral index for HB9
(alpha=0.61). Spatial variations of spectral index are derived using the second
method and yield a steeper spectral index for interior regions than for the
rim. This can be explained by a standard curved interstellar electron energy
spectrum combined with lower interior magnetic field compared to that near the
outer shock, which results in a larger proportion of steep spectrum emission
for lines-of-sight through the central body of the SNR. HI observations show
structures probably associated with the SNR in the radial velocity range -3 to
-9 km/s and suggest a distance of 0.8+-0.4 kpc for the SNR. This is consistent
with the distance to the radio pulsar 0458+46, offset from the center of HB9 by
23'. However the pulsar spindown and kinematic ages are significantly greater
than estimates of the SNR age: the Sedov age for HB9 is 6600 yr and the
evaporative cloud model yields ages of 4000-7,000 yr.

progenitors of red galaxies have undergone starbursts, followed by a
post-starburst phase. We investigate the environments of post-starburst
galaxies by measuring \textsl{(1)} number densities in $8 h^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}$
radius comoving spheres, \textsl{(2)} transverse distances to nearest
Virgo-like galaxy clusters, and \textsl{(3)} transverse distances to nearest
luminous-galaxy neighbors. We compare the post-starburst galaxies to currently
star-forming galaxies identified solely by A-star excess or $\Halpha$ emission.
We find that post-starburst galaxies are in the same kinds of environments as
star-forming galaxies; this is our ``null hypothesis''. More importantly, we
find that at each value of the A-star excess, the star-forming and
post-starburst galaxies lie in very similar distributions of environment. The
only deviations from our null hypothesis are barely significant: a slight
deficit of post-starburst galaxies (relative to the star-forming population) in
very low-density regions, a small excess inside the virial radii of clusters,
and a slight excess with nearby neighbors. None of these effects is strong
enough to make the post-starburst galaxies a high-density phenomenon, or to
argue that the starburst events are primarily triggered by external tidal
impulses (e.g., from close passages of massive galaxies). The small excess
inside cluster virial radii suggests that some post-starbursts are triggered by
interactions with the intracluster medium, but this represents a very small
fraction of all post-starburst galaxies.

sky; travel to a black hole in an animated starship; and explore a black hole
from up close. There are also five ""experiments"" that allow the user to: create
a black hole; orbit around a black hole; weigh a black hole; drop a clock into
a black hole; or fall into a black hole. The modules and experiments offer
goal-based scenarios tailored for novices and children. The site also contains
an encyclopedia of frequently asked questions and a detailed glossary that are

scientific knowledge, learning theory, and fun converge. Despite its focus on
black holes, the site also teaches many other concepts of physics, astronomy

grossly over-predicting the optical and under-predicting the hard X-ray
emission. A poorly constrained source of uncertainty in determining the true,
intrinsic spectra, in particular at lower energies, is the amount of
interstellar extinction. In previous studies, extinction column densities with
small statistical errors were derived as part of the fits of the spectra to
simple continuum models. Different choices of model, however, each produced
statistically acceptable fits, but a wide range of columns. Here, we attempt to
measure the interstellar extinction in a model-independent way, using
individual absorption edges of the elements O, Fe, Ne, Mg and Si in X-ray
grating spectra taken with XMM-Newton. We find that our inferred equivalent
hydrogen column density NH for 4U 0142+61 is a factor of 1.4 lower than the
typically quoted value from black-body plus power-law fits, and is now
consistent with estimates based on the dust scattering halo and visual
extinction. For three other sources, we find column densities consistent with
earlier estimates. We use our measurements to recover the intrinsic spectra of
the AXPs empirically, without making assumptions on what the intrinsic spectral
shapes ought to be. We find that the power-law components that dominate at

Detailed analysis shows that the position-velocity diagrams (PVDs) of HL Tau

X-wind models in that the [Fe II] line width is broad in the vicinity of the

suggests, however, that the disk wind model tends to have too large line width
at the jet while the X-wind model has excess emission on the redshifted side at
the stellar position. The narrow velocity width with symmetric line profiles of
the observed high velocity emission supports an X-wind type model where the
launching region is localized in a small radial range, while the low velocity
emission located away from the star favors the presence of a disk wind. The [Fe

are detected in the X-ray bands and eleven of them are as luminous as

Cepheids (including possible RV Tau stars) in galactic globular clusters. We
detected variations of 46 variables in 26 clusters (10 new discoveries in seven
clusters) and present their light curves. Their periods range from 1.2 d to
over 80 d. They show a well-defined period-luminosity relation at each
wavelength. Two type II Cepheids in NGC6441 also obey the relation if we assume
the horizontal branch stars in NGC6441 are as bright as those in metal-poor
globular clusters in spite of the high metallicity of the cluster. This result
supports the high luminosity which has been suggested for the RR Lyr variables
in this cluster. The period-luminosity relation can be reproduced using the
pulsation equation (P sqrt(rho)=Q) assuming that all the stars have the same
mass. Cluster RR Lyr variables were found to lie on an extrapolation of the
period-luminosity relation. These results provide important constraints on the
parameters of the variable stars.
  Using Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) data, we show that the type II
Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) fit our period-luminosity relation
within the expected scatter at the shorter periods. However, at long periods
($P>40$ d, i.e. in the RV Tau star range) the LMC field variables are brighter
by about one magnitude than those of similar periods in galactic globular
clusters. The long-period cluster stars also differ from both these LMC stars
and galactic field RV Tau stars in a colour-colour diagram. The reasons for
these differences are discussed.

and Salam which mimics high-energy scattering in QCD in the presence of both
gluon saturation and gluon number fluctuations, and hence of Pomeron loops.
Unlike other toy models of the reaction-diffusion type, the model studied in
this paper is consistent with boost invariance and, related to that, it
exhibits a mechanism for particle saturation close to that of the JIMWLK
equation in QCD, namely the saturation of the emission rate due to high-density
effects. Within this model, we establish the dominant high-energy behaviour of
the S-matrix element <S^n> for the scattering between a target obtained by
evolving one particle and a projectile made with exactly n particles.
Remarkably, we find that all such matrix elements approach the black disk limit
S=0 at high rapidity Y, with the same exponential law: <S^n> ~ exp(-Y) for all
values of n. This is so because the S-matrix is dominated by rare target
configurations which involve only few particles. We also find that the bulk
distribution for a saturated system is of the Poisson type.

$p$-adic numbers. We define the expectation by analogy with the observation
that for real-valued random variables in $L^2$ the expected value is the
orthogonal projection onto the constants. Previous work has shown that the
local field version of $L^\infty$ is the appropriate counterpart of $L^2$, and
so the expected value of a local field-valued random variable is defined to be
its ``projection'' in $L^\infty$ onto the constants. Unlike the real case, the
resulting projection is not typically a single constant, but rather a ball in
the metric on the local field. However, many properties of this expectation
operation and the corresponding conditional expectation mirror those familiar
from the real-valued case; for example, conditional expectation is, in a
suitable sense, a contraction on $L^\infty$ and the tower property holds. We
also define the corresponding notion of martingale, show that several standard

$\{p_k\}$ that has $p_0=0$, mean $m=\sum kp_k>1$ and exponential tails.
Consider the $\lambda$-biased random walk $\{X_n\}_{n\geq 0}$ on ${\cal T}$;
this is the nearest neighbor random walk which, when at a vertex $v$ with $d_v$
offspring, moves closer to the root with probability $\lambda/(\lambda+d_v)$,
and moves to each of the offspring with probability $1/(\lambda+d_v)$. It is
known that this walk has an a.s. constant speed $\v=\lim_n |X_n|/n$
  (where $|X_n|$ is the distance of $X_n$ from the root), with $\v>0$ for $
0<\lambda<m$ and $\v=0$ for $\lambda \ge m$. For all $\lambda \le m$, we prove
a quenched CLT for $|X_n|-n\v$. (For $\lambda>m$ the walk is positive
recurrent, and there is no CLT.) The most interesting case by far is
$\lambda=m$, where the CLT has the following form: for almost every ${\cal T}$,
the ratio $|X_{[nt]}|/\sqrt{n}$ converges in law as $n \to \infty$ to a
deterministic multiple of the absolute value of a Brownian motion. Our approach
to this case is based on an explicit description of an invariant measure for
the walk from the point of view of the particle (previously, such a measure was
explicitly known only for $\lambda=1$) and the construction of appropriate
harmonic coordinates.

calculated for various moving average time windows, are mapped into the
ultrametric subdominant space as in classical Minimal Spanning Tree methods.
The novelty consists in applying the so-called Moving Average Minimal Length
Path algorithm, which allows a decoupling of fluctuations with respect to the
mass center of the system from the movement of the mass center itself. The
present analysis pertains to the Gross Domestic Product and some of its sources
for 15 EU countries between 1972 and 2004. It is found that the strongly
correlated countries with respect to GDP fluctuations can be partitioned into
stable clusters. The final structure proves to be stable against the
fluctuations induced by the moving time window over the scanned time interval.

dominance and recessiveness could be a force which optimizes the genome size.
While the possibility of complementation of the damaged allele by its
functional counterparts (recessiveness) leads to the redundancy of genetic
information, the dominant effect of defective genes tends to diminish the
number of alleles fulfilling the same function. Playing with the fraction of
dominant loci in the genome it is possible to obtain the condition where the
diploid state of the genome is optimal. If the status of each bit position as
dominant or recessive mutations is changed for each individual randomly and
rarely, then after a long time a stationary equilibrium of many recessive and
few dominant loci is established in the sexual Penna model. This effect
vanishes if the same changing distribution of dominant loci applies to all
individuals.

Quadratic model. However, this model does not integrate complex features of
tumor growth, in particular cell cycle regulation.
  Methods: In this paper, we propose a multiscale model of cancer growth based
on the genetic and molecular features of the evolution of colorectal cancer.
The model includes key genes, cellular kinetics, tissue dynamics, macroscopic
tumor evolution and radiosensitivity dependence on the cell cycle phase. We
investigate the role of gene-dependent cell cycle regulation in the response of
tumors to therapeutic irradiation protocols.
  Results: Simulation results emphasize the importance of tumor tissue features
and the need to consider regulating factors such as hypoxia, as well as tumor
geometry and tissue dynamics, in predicting and improving radiotherapeutic
efficacy.
  Conclusion: This model provides insight into the coupling of complex
biological processes, which leads to a better understanding of oncogenesis.
This will hopefully lead to improved irradiation therapy.

#P-complete problems) utilize the following random walk algorithm for {\em
almost uniform sampling} from a state space $S$ of cardinality $N$: run a
symmetric ergodic Markov chain $P$ on $S$ for long enough to obtain a random
state from within $\epsilon$ total variation distance of the uniform
distribution over $S$. The running time of this algorithm, the so-called {\em
mixing time} of $P$, is $O(\delta^{-1} (\log N + \log \epsilon^{-1}))$, where
$\delta$ is the spectral gap of $P$.
  We present a natural quantum version of this algorithm based on repeated
measurements of the {\em quantum walk} $U_t = e^{-iPt}$. We show that it
samples almost uniformly from $S$ with logarithmic dependence on
$\epsilon^{-1}$ just as the classical walk $P$ does; previously, no such
quantum walk algorithm was known. We then outline a framework for analyzing its
running time and formulate two plausible conjectures which together would imply
that it runs in time $O(\delta^{-1/2} \log N \log \epsilon^{-1})$ when $P$ is
the standard transition matrix of a constant-degree graph. We prove each
conjecture for a subclass of Cayley graphs.
