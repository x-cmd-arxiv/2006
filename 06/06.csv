concept that uses coded masks seen by Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) detectors to
register hard X-rays in the energy region from 10 keV to 600 keV. A partially
active or fully active anti-coincidence shield/collimator with a total area of
between 15 and 35 square meters will be used to define the field of view of the
CZT detectors and to suppress the background of cosmic-ray-induced events. In
this paper, we describe the use of a sodium activated cesium iodide
shield/collimator to detect gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and to measure their energy
spectra in the energy range from 100 keV up to 10 MeV. We use the code GEANT4
to simulate the interactions of photons and cosmic rays with the spacecraft and
instrument and the code DETECT2000 to simulate the optical properties of the
scintillation detectors. The shield collimator achieves a nu-F-nu sensitivity
of 3 x 10^(-9) erg cm^(-2) s^(-1) and 2 x 10^(-8) erg cm^(-2) s^(-1) at 100 keV
and 600 keV, respectively. The sensitivity is well matched to that of the coded
mask telescope. The broad energy coverage of an EXIST-type mission with active
shields will constrain the peak of the spectral energy distribution (SED) for a
large number of GRBs. The measurement of the SED peak may be key for
determining photometric GRB redshifts and for using GRBs as cosmological
probes.

we do find two small but potentially important discrepancies: On large angular
scales there is a small power excess in the WMAP spectrum (5-10% at l<~30)
primarily due to likelihood approximation issues between 13 <= l <~30. On small
angular scales there is a systematic difference between the V- and W-band
spectra (few percent at l>~300). Recently, the latter discrepancy was explained
by Huffenberger et al. (2006) in terms of over-subtraction of unresolved point
sources. As far as the low-l bias is concerned, most parameters are affected by
a few tenths of a sigma. The most important effect is seen in n_s. For the
combination of WMAP, Acbar and BOOMERanG, the significance of n_s =/ 1 drops
from ~2.7 sigma to ~2.3 sigma when correcting for this bias. We propose a few
simple improvements to the low-l WMAP likelihood code, and introduce two
important extensions to the Gibbs sampling method that allows for proper
sampling of the low signal-to-noise regime. Finally, we make the products from
the Gibbs sampling analysis publically available, thereby providing a fast and
simple route to the exact likelihood without the need of expensive matrix

been an unresolved problem in X-ray astronomy for over two decades. We develop
the model proposed Gierlinski & Done (2004), which models the soft excess with
heavily smeared, ionized, absorption, by including the emission that must be
associated with this absorption. We show that, rather than hindering the
ionized absorption model, the addition of the emission actually helps this
model reproduce the soft excess. The emission fills in some of the absorption
trough, while preserving the sharp rise at ~1 keV, allowing the total model to
reproduce the soft excess curvature from a considerably wider range of model
parameters. We demonstrate that this model is capable of reproducing even the
strongest soft X-ray excesses by fitting it to the XMM-Newton EPIC PN spectrum
of PG1211+143, with good results. The addition of the emission reduces the
column density required to fit these data by a factor ~2 and reduces the
smearing velocity from ~0.28c to ~0.2c. Gierlinski & Done suggested a tentative
origin for the absorption in the innermost, accelerating, region of an
accretion disk wind, and we highlight the advantages of this interpretation in
comparison to accretion disk reflection models of the soft excess. Associating
this material with a wind off the accretion disk results in several separate
problems however, namely, the radial nature, and the massive implied mass-loss
rate, of the wind. We propose an origin in a 'failed wind', where the central
X-ray source is strong enough to over-ionize the wind, removing the
acceleration through line absorption before the material reaches escape
velocity, allowing the material to fall back to the disk at larger radii.

The 589 RRab stars in our final sample are used to study the properties of the

Galactic disk. Our metal-rich RRab sample may include a thin disk as well as a
thick disk population, although the uncertainties are too large to establish
this. There is some evidence among the metal-rich RRab stars for a decline in
scale height with increasing [Fe/H], as was found by Layden (1995). The
distribution of RRab stars with -1 < [Fe/H] < -1.25 indicates that within this
metallicity range the RRab stars are a mixture of stars belonging to halo and

the form of planetesimals. We show that the surface density of the planetesimal
swarm tends to be higher around less massive stars. Then, we derive the minimum

combine these results by calculating a set of representative disk models

dominant source of uncertainty in cosmological parameters estimated from
otherwise ideal weak lensing or baryon acoustic oscillation data. However,
either by reducing the number of free parameters in each redshift bin, or by
(unjustifiably) applying our Gaussian analysis into the non-Gaussian regime, we
find that the correlation functions can be used to reconstruct the redshift

conclude that primordial stars formed in early minihalos are massive. We carry

deuterated H3+ ion, H2D+, can be found exclusively in the coldest regions of
molecular cloud cores. This is also a feasibility study for the detection of
the ground-state line of ortho-H2D+ at 372 GHz with APEX.
  Methods. The 1(10)-1(11) transition of H2D+ at 372 GHz was searched towards
selected positions in the massive star forming cloud OriB9, in the dark cloud
L183, and in the low- to intermediate mass star-forming cloud R CrA.
  Results. The line was detected in cold, prestellar cores in the regions of
OriB9 and L183, but only upper limits were obtained towards other locations
which either have elevated temperatures or contain a newly born star. The H2D+
detection towards OriB9 is the first one in a massive star-forming region. The
fractional ortho-H2D+ abundances (relative to H2) are estimated to be about
1.0E-10 in two cold cores in OriB9, and 3.0E-10 in the cold core of L183.
  Conclusions. The H2D+ detection in OriB9 shows that also massive star forming
regions contain very cold prestellar cores which probably have reached matured
chemical composition characterized, e.g., by a high degree of deuterium
fractionation. Besides as a tracer of the interior parts of prestellar cores,
H2D+ may therefore be used to put contraints on the timescales related to

regularities observed in the parsec-scale jet of the well-known quasar 3C 273.
We present here the results from a 3D relativistic hydrodynamics numerical

discrete components have been taken into account. We compare the model with the

constrain the basic properties of the flow. We find growing perturbation modes
in the simulation with similar wavelengths to those observed, but with a
different set of wave speeds and mode identification. If the observed longest
helical structure is produced by the precession of the flow, longer precession
periods should be expected. Our results show that some of the observed
structures could be explained by growing Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in a
slow moving region of the jet. However, we point towards possible errors in the
mode identification that show the need of more complete linear analysis in
order to interpret the observations. We conclude that, with the given viewing
angle, superluminal components and jet precession cannot explain the observed
structures.

star-forming galaxies (typically redder than the general cluster population by
up to A_V~1-2 mags) rather than emission from dusty tori around active galactic

obtain upper limits for the slope of the IMF (assumed to be given by a
power-law) of the stars initially more massive than the present turnoff mass.
We also derive lower limits for the amount of stellar residues. We find that
the polluter IMF had to be much flatter than presently observed IMFs in stellar
clusters, in agreement with the results of two other methods for GC IMF
determination. Additionaly, we find that the present mass of the GC should be
totally dominated by stellar remnants if the polluters were AGB stars, but not
so in the case of WMS. We critically analyse the advantages and shortcomings of
each potential polluter class, and we find the WMS scenario more attractive.

established that the temperature of the region ~7' southeast of the center is

the polarization characteristics and optical morphology of each jet. We find
evidence of high optical polarization, averaging 20%, but reaching upwards of
$\sim 50%$ in some objects, confirming that the optical emission is
synchrotron, and that the components of the magnetic fields perpendicular to
the line of sight are well ordered. We find a wide range of polarization
morphologies, with each jet having a somewhat different relationship between
total intensity and polarized flux and the polarization position angle. We find
two trends in all of these jets. First, jet ``edges'' are very often associated
with high fractional optical polarizations, as also found in earlier radio
observations of these and other radio jets. In these regions, the magnetic
field vectors appear to track the jet direction, even at bends, where we see
particularly high fractional polarizations. This indicates a strong link
between the local magnetic field and jet dynamics. Second, optical flux maximum
regions are usually well separated from maxima in fractional polarization and
often are associated with polarization minima. This trend is not found in radio
data and was found in our optical polarimetry of M87 with HST. However, unlike
in M87, we do not find a general trend for near-90$^\circ$ rotations in the
optical polarization vectors near flux maxima. We discuss possibilities for
interpreting these trends, as well as implications for jet dynamics, magnetic
field structure and particle acceleration.

completely defined by the initial field strength (for a fixed field geometry),

while the others lose almost all of their initial magnetic energy by
transferring it into magnetic and kinetic energy of relatively small--scaled
fields and continue their life as radio pulsars with a dipolar surface field of

disorder-induced phase transition. For a polymer of length $L$, the high
temperature phase is characterized by a diffusive behavior for the end-point
displacement $R^2 \sim L$ and by free-energy fluctuations of order $\Delta F(L)
\sim O(1)$. The low-temperature phase is characterized by an anomalous
wandering exponent $R^2/L \sim L^{\omega}$ and by free-energy fluctuations of
order $\Delta F(L) \sim L^{\omega}$ where $\omega \sim 0.18$. In this paper, we
first study the scaling behavior of various properties to localize the critical
temperature $T_c$. Our results concerning $R^2/L$ and $\Delta F(L)$ point
towards $0.76 < T_c \leq T_2=0.79$, so our conclusion is that $T_c$ is equal or
very close to the upper bound $T_2$ derived by Derrida and coworkers ($T_2$
corresponds to the temperature above which the ratio
$\bar{Z_L^2}/(\bar{Z_L})^2$ remains finite as $L \to \infty$). We then present
histograms for the free-energy, energy and entropy over disorder samples. For
$T \gg T_c$, the free-energy distribution is found to be Gaussian. For $T \ll
T_c$, the free-energy distribution coincides with the ground state energy
distribution, in agreement with the zero-temperature fixed point picture.
Moreover the entropy fluctuations are of order $\Delta S \sim L^{1/2}$ and
follow a Gaussian distribution, in agreement with the droplet predictions,
where the free-energy term $\Delta F \sim L^{\omega}$ is a near cancellation of
energy and entropy contributions of order $L^{1/2}$.

ferromagnetism is stabilized due to a nearly flat band which is a mixture of
conduction and 4f electron states. Because of the strong spin-orbit interaction
in 4f electron states, and of considerable amount of hybridization in the
nearly flat band, the magnetic moments from 4f and conduction electrons tend to
cancel each other. The resultant ferromagnetic moment becomes smaller as
compared with the local 4f moment, and the Fermi surface in the ferromagnetic
ground state is hardly affected by the presence of 4f electrons. These
theoretical results are consistent with experimental observations in CeRh_3B_2

individual of genetic algorithms, and the fitness of the individual is
estimated based on the makespan of the schedule generated by using the

feedback, enables transmit beamforming in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)
wireless systems with a small amount of overhead. Due to its efficiency,
beamforming with limited feedback has been adopted in several wireless
communication standards. Prior work on limited feedback commonly adopts the
block fading channel model where temporal correlation in wireless channels is
neglected. This paper considers temporally-correlated channels and designs
single-user transmit beamforming with limited feedback. Analytical results
concerning CSI feedback are derived by modeling quantized CSI as a first-order
finite-state Markov chain. These results include the source bit rate generated
by time-varying quantized CSI, the required bit rate for a CSI feedback
channel, and the effect of feedback delay. In particular, based on the theory
of Markov chain convergence rate, feedback delay is proved to reduce the
throughput gain due to CSI feedback at least exponentially. Furthermore, an
algorithm is proposed for CSI feedback compression in time. Combining the
results in this work leads to a new method for designing limited feedback
beamforming as demonstrated by a design example.

procedural, functional, or logic (rule-based) style, or a mixture of all three.
For tasks requiring interfaces to the external environment, mathematica
provides mathlink, which allows us to communicate mathematica programs with
external programs written in C, C++, F77, F90, F95, Java, or other languages.
It has also extensive capabilities for editing graphics, equations, text, etc.
  In this article, we explore the basic mechanisms of parallelization of a
mathematica program by sharing different parts of the program into all other
computers available in the network. Doing the parallelization, we can perform
large computational operations within a very short period of time, and
therefore, the efficiency of the numerical works can be achieved. Parallel
computation supports any version of mathematica and it also works as well even
if different versions of mathematica are installed in different computers. The
whole operation can run under any supported operating system like Unix,
Windows, Macintosh, etc. Here we focus our study only for the Unix based
operating system, but this method works as well for all other cases.

frequency and close after each other in the stream of trans- actions. We will
explain this new consecutive support and discuss how patterns can be found
faster by pruning the search space, for instance using so-called parent support
recalculation. Both consecutiveness and the notion of hypercliques are
incorporated into the Eclat algorithm. Synthetic examples show how interesting

applied in many areas, ranging from bio-informatics to trade, supermarkets, and
even law en- forcement. E.g., in bio-informatics it is important to find

particular the gravitational interactions are responsible for the unitarity of
the scattering against the horizon, as dictated by the holographic principle,
but the Standard Model interactions also contribute, and understanding their
effects is an important first step towards a complete understanding of the
horizon's dynamics. The relation between in- and outgoing states is described
in terms of an operator algebra. In this contribution, in which earlier results
are rederived and elaborated upon, we first describe the algebra induced on the
horizon by U(1) vector fields and scalar fields, including the case of an
Englert-Brout-Higgs mechanism, and a more careful consideration of the
transverse vector field components. We demonstrate that, unlike classical black
holes, the quantized black hole has on its horizon an imprint of its (recent)
past history, i.e., quantum hair. The relation between in- and outgoing states
depends on this imprint. As a first step towards the inclusion of non-Abelian
interactions, we then compute the effects of magnetic monopoles both in the
in-states and in the out-states. They completely modify, and indeed simplify,
our algebra.

phenomenon of neutrino flavor oscillations. In a three neutrino model, these
oscillations are described by three angles, two mass splittings, and one CP
violating phase. Experiments using neutrinos from the Sun, the atmosphere,
nuclear reactors, and particle accelerators have gathered considerable
information on these angles and splittings. Two of the three angles are known
to be large: $\theta_{12} \simeq 33^\circ$, $\theta_{23} \simeq 45^\circ$, and
an upper limit is known on the third, $\theta_{13}<10^\circ$. Likewise, the
mass splittings are known to fall in the range $\Delta m^2_{12} \simeq 8 \times

(NSS) presented an interesting model for a noncommutative inspired,
Schwarzschild-like black hole solution in 4-dimensions. The essential effect of
having noncommutative co-ordinates in this approach is to smear out matter
distributions on a scale associated with the turn-on of noncommutativity which
was taken to be near the 4-d Planck mass. In particular, NSS took this smearing
to be essentially Gaussian. This energy scale is sufficiently large that in 4-d
such effects may remain invisible indefinitely. Extra dimensional models which
attempt to address the gauge hierarchy problem, however, allow for the
possibility that the effective fundamental scale may not be far from $\sim$ 1
TeV, an energy regime that will soon be probed by experiments at both the LHC
and ILC. In this paper we generalize the NSS model to the case where flat,
toroidally compactified extra dimensions are accessible at the Terascale and
examine the resulting modifications in black hole properties due to the
existence of noncommutativity. We show that while many of the
noncommutativity-induced black hole features found in 4-d by NSS persist, in
some cases there can be significant modifications due the presence of extra
dimensions. We also demonstrate that the essential features of this approach
are not particularly sensitive to the Gaussian nature of the smearing employed
by NSS.

generators that partially restores the closed operator algebra in the presence

momentum operators in the O(3)-invariant nonrelativistic case, we showed that
the construction can be maximally satisfied in a three dimensional subspace of
the full Minkowski space; this subspace can be chosen to describe either the
O(3)-invariant space sector, or an O(2,1)-invariant restriction of spacetime.
When the O(3)-invariant subspace is selected, the field solution reduces to the
Dirac monopole field found in the nonrelativistic case. For the
O(2,1)-invariant subspace, the Maxwell field can be associated with a
Coulomb-like potential on spacetime, similar to that used by Horwitz and
Arshansky to obtain a covariant generalization of the hydrogen-like bound
state. In this paper we elaborate on the generalization of the Dirac monopole

rich and allows a full development of the theory, while remaining completely
within the setting of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces (thus avoiding the

question in harmonic analysis; namely, decomposing a suitable space of
functions on G into irreducibles for the action of G x G by left and right
multiplication.
  For a split p-adic reductive group G over a local non-archimedean field,
unramified irreducible smooth representations are in bijection with semisimple
conjugacy classes in the ``Langlands dual'' group.
  We generalize this description to an arbitrary spherical variety X of G as
follows: Irreducible unramified quotients of the space $C_c^\infty(X)$ are in
natural ``almost bijection'' with a number of copies of $A_X^*/W_X$, the
quotient of a complex torus by the ``little Weyl group'' of X. This leads to a
description of the Hecke module of unramified vectors (a weak analog of
geometric results of Gaitsgory and Nadler), and an understanding of the
phenomenon that representations ``distinguished'' by certain subgroups are
functorial lifts. In the course of the proof, rationality properties of
spherical varieties are examined and a new interpretation is given for the
action, defined by F. Knop, of the Weyl group on the set of Borel orbits.

  Let S be a finite set of points in the plane, with each point coloured red or
blue or with both colours. Suppose that for any two distinct points A,B in S
sharing a colour there is a third point C in S, of the other colour, collinear
with A and B. Then all the points in S are collinear.
  We define a chromatic geometry to be a simple matroid for which each point is
coloured red or blue or with both colours, such that for any two distinct
points A,B in S sharing a colour there is a third point C in S, of the other
colour, collinear with A and B. This is a common generalisation of proper
finite linear spaces and properly two-coloured finite linear spaces, with many
known properties of both generalising as well. One such property is Kelly's
complex Sylvester-Gallai theorem. We also consider embeddings of chromatic
geometries in Desarguesian projective spaces. We prove a lower bound of 51 for
the number of points in a 3-dimensional chromatic geometry in projective space

corollary of an inequality of Hirzebruch used by Kelly in his proof of the

fluctuations within the Statistical hadronization model. We begin by describing
the theoretical disagreements between different statistical models currently on
the market. We then show how the simultaneous analysis of yields and
fluctuations can be used to differentiate between the different models, and
determine if one of them can be connected to underlying physics. We perform a
study on a RHIC 200 GeV data sample that includes stable particles, resonances,
and the event-by-event fluctuation of the $K/\pi$ ratio. We show that the
equilibrium statistical model can not describe the fluctuation, unless an
unrealistically small volume is assumed. Such small volume then makes it
impossible to describe the total particle multiplicity. The non-equilibrium
model,on the other hand, describes both the $K/\pi$ fluctuation and yields
acceptably due to the extra boost to the $\pi$ fluctuation provided by the high
pion chemical potential. $\Lambda(1520)$ and $K^*$ abundance is described
within error bars, but the $\Sigma^*$ is under-predicted to $\sim$ 1.5 standard
deviations. We suggest further measurements that have the potential to test the
non-equilibrium model, as well as gauge the effect of re-interactions between
hadronization and freeze-out.

the order of a Debye length. The overall energy loss is similar in magnitude to
the energy loss suffered by a charge created in the asymptotic past. This
result has significant implications for the relative contribution to energy

obtained by utilizing two independent solutions of the reference wave equation.
One of them is typically singular (usually, near the origin of configuration
space). Both are asymptotically regular and sinusoidal with a phase difference
(shift) that contains information about the scattering potential. Therefore,
both solutions are essential for scattering calculations. Various
regularization techniques were developed to handle the singular solution
leading to different well-established scattering methods. To simplify the
calculation the regularized solutions are usually constructed in a space that
diagonalizes the reference Hamiltonian. In this work, we start by proposing
solutions that are already regular. We write them as infinite series of square
integrable basis functions that are compatible with the domain of the reference
Hamiltonian. However, we relax the diagonal constraint on the representation by
requiring that the basis supports an infinite tridiagonal matrix representation
of the wave operator. The hope is that by relaxing this constraint on the
solution space a larger freedom is achieved in regularization such that a
natural choice emerges as a result. We find that one of the resulting two
independent wavefunctions is, in fact, the regular solution of the reference
problem. The other is uniquely regularized in the sense that it solves the
reference wave equation only outside a dense region covering the singularity in
configuration space. However, asymptotically it is identical to the irregular
solution. We show that this natural and special regularization is equivalent to
that already used in the J-matrix method of scattering.

error correction schemes to the quantum regime. The input to a noisy system is
embedded in a coded subspace, and error recovery is performed via an operation
designed to perfectly correct for a set of errors, presumably a large subset of
the physical noise process. In this paper, we examine the choice of recovery
operation. Rather than seeking perfect correction on a subset of errors, we
seek a recovery operation to maximize the entanglement fidelity for a given
input state and noise model. In this way, the recovery operation is optimum for
the given encoding and noise process. This optimization is shown to be
calculable via a semidefinite program (SDP), a well-established form of convex
optimization with efficient algorithms for its solution. The error recovery
operation may also be interpreted as a combining operation following a quantum
spreading channel, thus providing a quantum analogy to the classical diversity

physics then has much in common with propagation of ultra-slow light.
Applications to coherent scattering and remote sensing are discussed.

information theory and statistical mechanics. Every game can be described by a
density operator, the von Neumann entropy and the quantum replicator dynamics.
There exists a strong relationship between game theories, information theories
and statistical physics. The density operator and entropy are the bonds between
these theories. The analysis we propose is based on the properties of entropy,
the amount of information that a player can obtain about his opponent and a
maximum or minimum entropy criterion. The natural trend of a physical system is
to its maximum entropy state. The minimum entropy state is a characteristic of
a manipulated system i.e. externally controlled or imposed. There exist tacit
rules inside a system that do not need to be specified or clarified and search
the system equilibrium under the collective welfare principle. The other rules
are imposed over the system when one or many of its members violate this
principle and maximize its individual welfare at the expense of the group.
