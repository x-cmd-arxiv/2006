for predicting the precision with which various cosmological parameters can be
extracted from future data. This approach is fast, and generally returns
accurate estimates for the parameter errors when the individual parameter
likelihoods approximate a Gaussian distribution. However, where Gaussianity is
not respected (due, for instance, to strong parameter degeneracies), the Fisher
matrix formalism loses its reliability. In this paper, we compare the results
of the Fisher matrix approach with those from Monte Carlo simulations. The
latter method is based on the publicly available CosmoMC code, but uses
synthetic realisations of data sets anticipated for future experiments. We
focus on prospective cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Planck
satellite, with or without CMB lensing information, and its implications for a
minimal cosmological scenario with eight parameters and an extended model with
eleven parameters. We show that in many cases, the projected sensitivities from
the Fisher matrix and the Monte Carlo methods differ significantly,
particularly in models with many parameters. Sensitivities to the neutrino mass
and the dark matter fraction are especially susceptible to change.

migration. A long-standing question regarding this mechanism is how to stop the
migration before planets plunge into their central stars. In this paper, we
propose a new, simple mechanism to significantly slow down planet migration,
and test the possibility by using a hybrid numerical integrator to simulate the
disk-planet interaction. The key component of the scenario is the role of low
viscosity regions in protostellar disks known as dead zones, which affect
planetary migration in two ways. First of all, it allows a smaller-mass planet
to open a gap, and hence switch the faster type I migration to the slower type
II migration. Secondly, a low viscosity slows down type II migration itself,
because type II migration is directly proportional to the viscosity. We present
numerical simulations of planetary migration by using a hybrid symplectic
integrator-gas dynamics code. Assuming that the disk viscosity parameter inside
the dead zone is (alpha=1e-4-1e-5), we find that, when a low-mass planet (e.g.
1-10 Earth masses) migrates from outside the dead zone, its migration is
stopped due to the mass accumulation inside the dead zone. When a low-mass
planet migrates from inside the dead zone, it opens a gap and slows down its
migration. A massive planet like Jupiter, on the other hand, opens a gap and
slows down inside the dead zone, independent of its initial orbital radius. The
final orbital radius of a Jupiter mass planet depends on the dead zone's
viscosity. For the range of alpha's noted above, this can vary anywhere from 7
AU, to an orbital radius of 0.1 AU that is characteristic of the hot Jupiters.

the results obtained to a scale-mixed distribution model, which correspond to a
nearly Gaussian model. The results reveal that, even for a small deviation from

in a Gaussian field with the same power spectrum. In addition, the calculations
reveal how the amplitude of the peaks in the fluctuations field is related to
the existing correlations. Our results may be used as an additional tool to
investigate the behavior of the N-point correlation function, to understand how
non-Gaussian correlations affect the peak-peak statistics and extract more
information about the statistics of the density field.

we have identified its blueshifted counterpart. We further speculate that the
origin of the EW outflow lies near HH 102. We use velocity dependent opacity
correction to estimate the mass and the energy of the outflow. The resulting
mass spectral indices from our analysis, are systematically lower (less steep)
than the power law indices obtained towards other outflows in several recent
studies that use a similar opacity correction method. We show that systematic
errors and biases in the analysis procedures for deriving mass spectra could
result in errors in the determination of the power-law indices. The mass
spectral indices, the morphological appearance of the position-velocity plots

than one degree in length. This spheroid is in rotation but its rotation curve
is known only within ~15' from the center. It is therefore critical to identify
bright stars belonging to the spheroid to characterize, as far as possible, its
outer kinematics. We use the new wide field near infrared imager CPAPIR,
operated by the SMARTS consortium, to acquire J, Ks images of two 34.8' x 34.8'
areas in the outer spheroid to search for C stars. The colour diagram of the
fields allows the identification of 192 C stars candidates but a study of the
FWHM of the images permits the rejection of numerous non-stellar objects with
colours similar to C stars. We are left with 75 new C stars, their mean Ks
magnitude and mean colour are similar to the bulk of known NGC 6822 C stars.

major contributor to the stellar populations of the spheroid. The discovery of
some 50 C stars well beyond the limit of the previously known rotation curve
calls for a promising spectroscopic follow-up to a major axis distance of 40'.

of FUV_{AB} ~ 29. All sources have counterparts in the WFPC2 image. Redshifts
(spectroscopic or photometric) for the detected sources are in the range 0<z<1.
We find that the FUV galaxy number counts are higher than those reported by
GALEX, which we attribute at least in part to cosmic variance in the small
HDF-N field of view. Six of the 13 Chandra sources at z<0.85 in the HDF-N are
detected in the FUV, and those are consistent with starbursts rather than AGN.

relationship. We infer star formation rates (SFRs), corrected for extinction
using the UV slope, and find a median value of 0.3 Msun/yr for FUV-detected
galaxies, with 75% of detected sources have SFR<1 Msun/yr. Examining the
morphological distribution of sources, we find that about half of all

suggesting that such sources have significant ongoing star-formation in the

observables, such as the matter-wave interference pattern and the
condensatefraction, are investigated in order to explore the rich phase
diagram. At symmetric half filling a phase similar to the Mott-insulating phase
in a commensurate purely bosonic system is identified and an analogy to recent
experiments is pointed out. Furthermore a phase of complete localization of the
bosonic species generated by the repulsive boson-fermion interaction is
identified. These localized condensates are of a different nature than the
genuine Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices.

energy is increasing and the precession frequency $ \omega (N)$ is decreasing
monotonously with $N$ growth. For high enough anisotropy $K_{\mathrm{eff}} >
0.6 J$ we found some fundamentally new soliton features absent for continuous
models incorporating even the higher powers of magnetization gradients. For
high anisotropy, the dependence of soliton energy E(N) on the number of bound
magnons become non-monotonic, with the minima at some ""magic"" numbers of bound
magnons. Soliton frequency $\omega (N)$ have quite irregular behavior with
step-like jumps and negative values of $\omega $ for some regions of $N$. Near
these regions, stable static soliton states, stabilized by the lattice effects,
exist.

Informally, the frugality ratio is the ratio of the total payment of a

develop a theory of these positioning systems, based on the framework and

the angles formed by each pair of natural vectors. We also prove that the

hence independent of the time broadcast, and 4 parameters, one for each
emitter, scaling linearly with the time broadcast by the corresponding

function of both the inflationary scale and the reheating temperature. Under
some particular although not unconventional assumptions, the axionic field
induces too large isocurvature perturbations. Specifically, for inflation
taking place at intermediate energy scales, we derive some restrictive limits
which can only be evaded by assuming an efficient reheating mechanism, with
T>10^{11} GeV. Chaotic inflation with a quadratic potential is still compatible
with the axion scenario, provided that the Peccei-Quinn scale f_a is close to
10^{10} or 10^{11} GeV. Isocurvature bounds eliminate the possibility of a
larger f_a and a small misalignment angle. We find that isocurvature

several examples of intrinsically virtually linked and knotted graphs. As a
byproduct, we introduce the {\it virtual unknotting number} of a knot, and show
that any knot with non-trivial Jones polynomial has virtual unknotting number
at least 2.

obvious.) This implies that if Gamma has a faithful action on the circle, then
some finite-index subgroup of Gamma has the property that all of its

also means that every left-orderable, amenable group is locally indicable. This

well as the magnitudes of coefficients of a set of additional images calculated
from the observed image. The additional set of images is chosen so that the
wavelet transforms of the full set of images have suitable deterministic and
joint stochastic properties at a fixed scale and position index. Two different
sets of additional images are suggested. The behaviour of the threshold
criterion for a purely noisy image is investigated and a universal threshold is
determined. The properties of the threshold for some typical deterministic
signal structures are also given. The risk of an individual coefficient is
determined, and calculated explicitly when the universal threshold is used, and
some typical deterministic signal structures. The method is implemented on
several examples and the theoretical risk reductions substantiated.

fluid-structure system shows bistability, with both stationary and oscillatory
states. In its stationary state, the loop remains essentially motionless and
its wake is a von K\'arm\'an vortex street. In its oscillatory state, the loop
sheds two vortex dipoles, or more complicated vortical structures, within each
oscillation period. We find that the oscillation frequency of the loop is
linearly proportional to the flow velocity, and that the measured Strouhal

of its calculation is formulated. The component IIR's and the overall
(time-averaged) component ionization rates are calculated for H$_2^+$ at
different values of inter-nuclear distance in a linearly polarized laser field
with $1.0 \times10^{14}$W cm$^{-2}$ intensity and $\lambda \sim 1064 $nm
wavelength by direct numerical solution of the fixed-nuclei full dimensional
time-dependent Schr \""odinger equation. The exact overall component ionization
rates calculated by time-averaging of the component IIR are compared with those
calculated approximately via the virtual detector method (VD). Details of the
time dependent behavior of the outgoing and incoming electron wavepackets of
the H$_2^+$ system in intense laser field at sub-femtosecond time scale are
studied based on the calculated component IIR. It is shown clearly that the
positive (outgoing electron wavepacket) signals of the IIR and its z component
are strong and sharp but the negative (returning electron wavepacket) signals
of the IIR are smooth and weak. The structure of the $\rho$ component of the
IIR has smooth structure. Relation between the R-dependent ionization rate and
duration of the ramp of the laser pulse is studied and it is explicitly shown
that for internuclear distance R<5.6, when the laser pulse is turned on without
a ramp, the first peak of R-dependent ionization rates moves towards the peak
of the lower time dependent Floquet quasi-energy state (QES).
