of these studies is to evaluate the feasibility of CZT calorimeters, to study
their performance and detect and understand performance limiting factors. Such
a calorimeter consists of many layers of closely packed pixellated CZT detector
units. Our simulations of single detector units reproduce experimental results,
indicating that our simulations capture the main factors that limit the
performance of a detector unit. Overall the conclusion of our simulation study
is that between 1 cm and 1.5 cm thick detector units can be used to build a
calorimeter with good performance over the energy range from ~20 keV to ~10

traditional approach, restricted to the second--order correlation
approximation, has been used. Its validity is only guaranteed for a range of
conditions, which is narrow in view of many applications, e.g., in
astrophysics. With the intention to have a wider range of applicability other
approaches have been proposed which make use of the so--called
$\tau$--approximation, reducing correlations of third order in $\vec{u}$ and
$\vec{b}$ to such of second order. After explaining some basic features of the
traditional approach a critical analysis of the approaches of that kind is
given. It is shown that they lead in some cases to results which are in clear
conflict with those of the traditional approach. It is argued that this
indicates shortcomings of the $\tau$--approaches and poses serious restrictions
to their applicability. These shortcomings do not result from the basic
assumption of the $\tau$--approximation. Instead, they seem to originate in
some simplifications made in order to derive $\cal E$ without really solving
the equations governing $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{b}$. A starting point for a new

in bulk of the gas in Cepheus B and to derive constraints on the factors which
determine the abundance of neutral carbon relative to CO. Methods: This paper
presents 15'x15' fully sampled maps of CI at 492 GHz and 12CO 4-3 observed with
KOSMA at 1' resolution. The new observations have been combined with the FCRAO
12CO 1-0, IRAM-30m 13CO 2-1 and C18O 1-0 data, and far-infrared continuum data
from HIRES/IRAS. The KOSMA-tau spherical PDR model has been used to understand
the CI and CO emission from the PDRs in Cepheus B and to explain the observed
variation of the relative abundances of both C^0 and CO. Results: The emission
from the PDR associated with Cepheus B is primarily at V_LSR between -14 and
-11 km s^-1. We estimate about 23% of the observed CII emission from the
molecular hotspot is due to the ionized gas in the HII region. Over bulk of the
material the C^0 column density does not change significantly, (2.0+-1.4)x10^17
cm^-2, although the CO column density changes by an order of magnitude. The
observed \cbyco abundance ratio varies between 0.06 and 4 in Cepheus B. We find
an anti-correlation of the observed C/CO abundance ratio with the observed
hydrogen column density, which holds even when all previous observations
providing C/CO ratios are included. Here we show that this observed variation
of C/CO abundance with total column density can be explained only by clumpy
PDRs consisting of an ensemble of clumps. At high H2 column densities high mass
clumps, which exhibit low C/CO abundance, dominate, while at low column
densities, low mass clumps with high C/CO abundance dominate.

regarding these stars. First, their optical flux excess is correlated to their
near-IR flux excess, as determined from optical EROSII light curves and 2MASS
measurements. Second, the relation between optical colour and magnitude is
observed to be bi-valued in 40% of the cases, resulting in a ""loop"" when the
light curve is presented in a colour-magnitude diagram. We argue that optical
variability for a large fraction of the variable stars is due to variations in
the amount of bound-free and free-free radiation. We do simple model
calculations that allow us to interpret the observed colour-magnitude
variability as due to an outflowing ionized circumstellar disk. The mass loss
of the central star is variable, i.e. on or off. Once the star stops losing
mass, the disk evolves naturally into a ring. The observed bi-valued
colour-magnitude relation is the transition of a partially optically thick to a
fully optically thin disk. Significantly, the loop is traversed clockwise by
outflowing matter, but anti-clockwise by infalling matter. It is observed that
the material is generally outflowing, but few cases of inflow are also
observed.

during the rise of the source to its high/soft state. The EPIC-pn camera was
used in the fast-read Burst mode to avoid photon pile-up. Results: First, we
contributed to the improvement of the calibration of the EPIC-pn, since the

a maximum temperature of 1.3 keV. Two absorption lines are detected in the
EPIC-pn spectra, at 6.7-6.8 and 7.8-8.0 keV, which can be identified either as
blended Fe XXV and Fe XXVI K-alpha and K-beta lines, or as blueshifted Fe XXV.
We find no orbital dependence on the X-ray properties, which provides an upper
limit for the inclination of the system of 73 degr. The RGS spectrometers
reveal interstellar absorption features at 17.2AA, 17.5AA (Fe L edges) and
23.54AA (OI K-alpha). Finally, while checking the interstellar origin of the OI
line, we find a general correlation of the OI K-alpha line equivalent width
with the hydrogen column density using several sources available in the

disc-blackbody models represent the simplest, most robust interpretation of the
X-ray spectra of bright ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs); this has been taken
as evidence for the presence of intermediate-mass black holes (BHs) (M ~ 10^3
Msun) in those sources. Here, we assess this claim by comparing the cool
disc-blackbody model with a range of other models. For example, we show that
the same ULX spectra can be fitted equally well by subtracting a disc-blackbody
component from a dominant power-law component, thus turning a soft excess into
a soft deficit. Then, we propose a more complex physical model, based on a
power-law component slightly modified at various energies by smeared emission
and absorption lines from highly-ionized, fast-moving gas. We use the
XMM-Newton/EPIC spectra of two ULXs in Holmberg II and NGC 4559 as examples.
Our main conclusion is that the presence of a soft excess or a soft deficit
depends on the energy range over which we choose to fit the ``true'' power-law
continuum; those small deviations from the power-law spectrum are well modelled
by disc-blackbody components (either in emission or absorption) simply because
they are a versatile fitting tool for most kinds of smooth, broad bumps. Hence,
we argue that those components should not be taken as evidence for accretion
disc emission, nor used to infer BH masses. Finally, we speculate that bright
ULXs could be in a spectral state similar to (or an extension of) the
steep-power-law state of Galactic BH candidates, in which the disc is now
completely comptonized and not directly detectable, and the power-law emission
may be modified by the surrounding, fast-moving, ionized gas.

particular disk region. The emission line flares may be integrated over
arbitrary ``exposure'' times, producing the synthetic line profiles. Flickering
Doppler maps are created using such synthetic time series. The presence of a

mechanisms of the observed lines. For the TiII ion, for which no atomic data

transition rates and electron impact excitation rate coefficients. It is found
that the observed spectrum is consistent with the lines being excited in a
mostly neutral region with an electron density of the order of $10^7$ cm$^{-3}$

slit orientations recorded between March~2000 and November~2001 we find line
ratios that change among various observations, in a way consistent with changes
of up to an order of magnitude in the strength of the continuum radiation

due to the different slit orientations used for each observation, and yield
clues on the spatial extent and optical depth of the filament. The observed

molecular clouds (GMCs) is slow, in the sense that only ~1% of the gas forms
stars every free-fall time. This result is entirely independent of any
particular model of molecular cloud lifetime or evolution. Here we survey
observational data on higher density objects in the interstellar medium,
including infrared dark clouds and dense molecular clumps, to determine if
these objects form stars slowly like GMCs, or rapidly, converting a significant
fraction of their mass into stars in one free-fall time. We find no evidence
for a transition from slow to rapid star formation in structures covering three
orders of magnitude in density. This has important implications for models of
star formation, since competing models make differing predictions for the
characteristic density at which star formation should transition from slow to
rapid. The data are inconsistent with models that predict that star clusters
form rapidly and in free-fall collapse. Magnetic- and turbulence-regulated star
formation models can reproduce the observations qualitatively, and the
turbulence-regulated star formation model of Krumholz & McKee quantitatively
reproduces the infrared-HCN luminosity correlation recently reported by Gao &
Solomon. Slow star formation also implies that the process of star cluster
formation cannot be one of global collapse, but must instead proceed over many
free-fall times. This suggests that turbulence in star-forming clumps must be
driven, and that the competitive accretion mechanism does not operate in
typical cluster-forming molecular clumps.

momentum fluxes. The latter are higher than, or of the same order as, those

declining steeply with radius, indicating an origin in a cluster wind. In the
outer regions near the Arches cluster, the overall diffuse X-ray enhancement
demonstrates a bow shock morphology and is prominent in the Fe Kalpha 6.4-keV

between the cluster and the adjacent molecular cloud. The older and less
compact Quintuplet cluster contains much weaker X-ray sources and diffuse
emission, probably originating from low-mass stellar objects as well as a
cluster wind. However, the overall population of these objects, constrained by
the observed total diffuse X-ray luminosities, is substantially smaller than
expected for both clusters. This deficiency of low-mass objects may be a
manifestation of the unique star formation environment of the Galactic center.

at small redshifts $z$ as admitted by supernova luminosity-distance data. For
small $z$, the generic solution for these models is constructed in the form of
a power series in $z$ without any approximation. Necessary constraints for DE
to be phantom today and to cross the phantom divide line $p=-\rho$ at small $z$
are presented. Considering the Solar System constraints, we find for the
post-Newtonian parameters that $\gamma_{PN}<1$ and $\gamma_{PN,0}\approx 1$ for
the model to be viable, and $\beta_{PN,0}>1$ (but very close to 1) if the model
has a significantly phantom DE today. However, prospects to establish the
phantom behaviour of DE are much better with cosmological data than with Solar
System experiments. Earlier obtained results for a $\Lambda$-dominated universe
with the vanishing scalar field potential are extended to a more general DE
equation of state confirming that the cosmological evolution of these models
rule them out. Models of currently fantom DE which are viable for small $z$ can
be easily constructed with a constant potential; however, they generically
become singular at some higher $z$. With a growing potential, viable models
exist up to an arbitrary high redshift.

hydrogen cyanide (HCN) bands at these wavelengths are very weak or absent. This
is consistent with low nitrogen abundances in the LMC. The observed 14 micron
C2H2 band is reasonably reproduced by an excitation temperature of 500 K. There
is no clear dilution of the 14 micron band by circumstellar dust emission. This
14 micron band originates from molecular gas in the circumstellar envelope in
these high mass-loss rate stars, in agreement with previous findings for
Galactic stars. The C2H2,column density, derived from the 13.7 micron band,
shows a gas mass-loss rate in the range 3x10^-6 to 5x10^{-5} Msun yr-1. This is
comparable with the total mass-loss rate of these stars estimated from the

the 13.7 micron C2H2 band of our LMC sample with those of a Galactic sample.
Despite the low metallicity of the LMC, there is no clear difference in the

surrounding the radio galaxy TN J1338-1942 at redshift z=4.1. The field
contains excesses of Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) and Lyman break galaxies
(LBGs) identified with a protocluster surrounding the radio galaxy. Our new
wide-field images provide information about the boundary of the protocluster
and its surroundings. There are 874 candidate LBGs within our field, having
redshifts in the range z=3.5-4.5. An examination of the brightest of these
(with i'< 25.0) shows that the most prominent concentration coincides with the
previously discovered protocluster. The diameter of this galaxy overdensity
corresponds to ~2 Mpc at z=4, consistent with the previous estimation using
LAEs. Several other concentrations of LBGs are observed in the field, some of
which may well be physically connected with the z=4.1 protocluster. The
observed structure in the smoothed LBG distribution can be explained as the
projection of large-scale structure, within the redshift range z=3.5-4.5,
comprising compact overdensities and prominent larger voids. If the 5-8
observed compact overdensities are associated with protoclusters, the observed
protocluster volume density is ~5x10^-6 Mpc^-3, similar to the volume density
of rich clusters in the local Universe.

while they are on the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). The gas and dust ejected
during this phase are a major source in the mass budget of the interstellar
medium. Recent studies have pointed towards the importance of variations in the
mass-loss history of such objects. Aims: By modelling the full line profile of
low excitation CO lines emitted in the circumstellar envelope, we can study the
mass-loss history of AGB stars. Methods: We have developed a non-LTE radiative
transfer code, which calculates the velocity structure and gas kinetic
temperature of the envelope in a self-consistent way. The resulting structure
of the envelope provides the input for the molecular line radiative
calculations which are evaluated in the comoving frame. The code allows for the
implementation of modulations in the mass-loss rate. This code has been
benchmarked against other radiative transfer codes and is shown to perform well
and efficiently. Results: We illustrate the effects of varying mass-loss rates
in case of a superwind phase. The model is applied to the well-studied case of
VY CMa. We show that both the observed integrated line strengths as the
spectral structure present in the observed line profiles, unambiguously
demonstrate that this source underwent a phase of high mass loss (~ 3.2E-4
Msun/yr) some 1000 yr ago. This phase took place for some 100 yr, and was
preceded by a low mass-loss phase (~ 1E-6 Msun/yr) taking some 800 yr. The
current mass-loss rate is estimated to be in the order of 8E-5 Msun/yr.
Conclusions: In this paper, we demonstrate that both the relative strength of
the CO rotational line profiles and the (non)-occurrence of spectral structure
in the profile offer strong diagnostics to pinpoint the mass-loss history.

structure of HI in emission around the early-type host galaxy of B2 0648+27
(M_HI = 8.5 x 10^9 Msun, diameter = 190 kpc). We interpret this as the result
of a major merger that occurred > 1.5 Gyr ago. From modelling optical long-slit
spectra we find that a young stellar population of 0.3 Gyr, indicative of a
past starburst event, dominates the stellar light throughout the galaxy. The
off-set in time between the merger event and the starburst activity in B2
0648+27 suggests that the starburst was triggered in an advanced stage of the
merger, which can be explained if the gas-rich progenitor galaxies contained a
bulge. Although the exact age of the radio source remains uncertain, there
appears to be a significant time-delay between the merger/starburst event and
the current episode of radio-AGN activity. We also observe an outflow of
emission-line gas in this system, which is likely related to superwinds driven
by the stars that formed during the starburst event. We argue that the radio

symbiosis between the nuclear activity and galaxy evolution in the southern
compact radio source PKS1549-79 (z=0.1523). The optical imaging observations

the host galaxy has undergone a major merger in the recent past. This is
further supported by the detection of a young stellar population which was
formed 50-250Myr ago and makes up 1-30% of the total stellar mass. Despite the
core-jet structure of the radio source we detect HI absorption associated with
both the core and the jet. The luminous, quasar-like AGN (M_V < -23.5) is
highly extinguished (A_v > 4.9) at optical wavelengths and shows many
properties in common with narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1), including
relatively narrow permitted lines (FWHM ~ 1940 km/s), highly blueshifted [OIII]
lines (~680 km/s), and evidence that the putative supermassive black hole is
accreting at a high Eddington ratio. This suggests that accretion at high
Eddington ratio does not prevent the formation of powerful jets. Our
observations lend strong support to the predictions of some recent numerical
simulations of galaxy mergers in which the black hole grows rapidly through
merger-induced accretion following the coalescence of the nuclei of two merging
galaxies; the major growth phase largely hidden by the natal gas and dust.
Although the models predict that AGN-driven outflows will eventually remove the
gas from the bulge of the host galaxy, the visible warm outflow in PKS1549-79

disturbed morphologies with velocity gradients and splittings of several
hundred km/s on scales of 20 kpc or more. Despite the small sample size, there
are some generic features. The most disturbed H-alpha emission appears to be
associated with secondary galaxies within 10-20 kpc (projected) of the central
galaxy and close in velocity to the H-alpha. The global H-alpha kinematics
match those of CO(1-0) emission in single-dish data. The [NII]/H-alpha,
[SII]/H-alpha and [OI]/H-alpha ratios vary little with position, local H-alpha
surface brightness or between clusters. We propose that the H-alpha and CO
emission arise in molecular clouds heated by a starburst which has been
triggered by interaction with a secondary galaxy. Such CO emission is known to
trace massive (>1E10 M_sun) compact (<20 kpc) reservoirs of cool molecular gas,
which an infalling galaxy may disturb, distorting the H-alpha morphology and
initiating widespread star formation. We suggest that cloud-cloud collisions in
the undisturbed molecular gas reservoir might be an important excitation source
for the emission line gas in the cores of lower H-alpha luminosity cluster
cores with less intense star formation (abridged).

SAXJ1748.2-2808 is clearly resolved into 2 sources in EPIC images with the
brighter contributing almost 80% of the 2-10keV flux. Spectral fits to this
main source are consistent with an absorbed power-law with a photon index of
1.4+/-0.5 and absorption equivalent to 14E22cm-2 together with an iron line at

located in the foreground and gives an evident signature in the absorption of
X-rays. This cloud may have a torus shape and the part of torus interacting
with the IC443 shock gives rise to 2MASS-K emission in the southeast. The
measured density of emitting X-ray shocked plasma increases toward the
northeastern limb, where the remnant is interacting with an atomic cloud. We
found an excellent correlation between emission in the 0.3-0.5 keV band and
bright optical/radio filament on large spatial scales. The partial shell
structure seen in this band therefore traces the encounter with the atomic
cloud.

forces. Although it is idealized, describing two dimensional packings of round,
rigid, frictionless, cohesionless disks with coordination number Z=4, it
appears to describe a central part of the physics present in the more general
cases. The theorem does not make the strong claims of Edwards' hypothesis, nor
does it rely upon Edwards' hypothesis at any point. Instead, it begins solely
from the physical assumption that closed loops of grains are unable to impose
strong force correlations around the loop. This statement is shown to be a
generalization of Boltzmann's Assumption of Molecular Chaos (his
\textit{stosszahlansatz}), allowing for the extra symmetries of granular stress
propagation compared to the more limited symmetries of momentum propagation in
a thermodynamic system. The theorem that follows from this is similar to
Boltzmann's $H$ theorem and is presented as an alternative to Edwards'
hypothesis for explaining some granular phenomena. It identifies a very
interesting feature of granular packings: if the generalized
\textit{stosszahlansatz} is correct, then the bulk of homogeneous granular
packings must satisfy a maximum entropy condition simply by virtue of being
stable, without any exploration of phase space required. This leads to an
independent derivation of the contact force statistics, and these predictions
have been compared to numerical simulation data in the isotropic case. The good
agreement implies that the generalized \textit{stosszahlansatz} is indeed
accurate at least for the isotropic state of the idealized case studied here,
and that it is the reductionist explanation for contact force statistics in
this case.

simplify the task of studying several problems in quasiperiodic systems, since

phase separation varies for different cuprates, it is possible that different
systems with average doping level pm exhibit different degrees of charge and
spin segregation. Calculations on inhomogeneous charge distributions in form of
stripes in finite clusters performed by the Bogoliubov-deGennes superconducting

most of studies on the nodal spinons given so far, the gauge interaction

and vortices were ignored. In the present paper, we shall study strong-coupling
gauge theory of nodal spinons and reveal its nontrivial phase structure. To
this end, we employ recently developed lattice gauge theory techniques for
studying finite-temperature and finite-density gauge theory. At low temperature
and low spinon-density region, an AF long-range order exists. As temperature
and/or density of spinons are increases, a phase transition to nonmagnetic
phase takes place. Order of the phase transition is of second (first) order for
low (high) density region of spinons. At a quantum critical point at vanishing
temperature T=0, abrupt change of spinon density occurs as a function of the
chemical potential. Implications of the results to the heavy-fermion materials

bond axes rather than crystal lattice directions, the nuclear sites can
experience non-vanishing hyperfine fields even in high symmetry sites.

  - June 2, 2006 Symposium U",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  The theoretical analysis of the process of diffusion of interstitial oxygen
atoms and hydrogen molecules in silicon and germanium crystals has been
performed. The calculated values of the activation energy and pre-exponential
factor for an interstitial oxygen atom Ea(Si) = 2.59 eV, Ea(Ge) = 2.05 eV,
D(Si)= 0.28 cm2s-1, D(Ge)= 0.39 cm2s-1 and interstitial hydrogen molecule
Ea(Si) = 0.79-0.83 eV, Ea(Ge) = 0.58-0.62 eV, D(Si)= 7.4 10(-4) cm2s-1, D(Ge)=
6.5 10(-4) cm2s-1 are in an excellent agreement with experimental ones and for
the first time describe perfectly an experimental temperature dependence of an
interstitial oxygen atom and hydrogen molecules diffusion constant in Si and Ge
crystals. It is shown, that for a case of impurity atom with a strong
interaction with a lattice (interstitial oxygen atom) process of diffusion has
a cooperative nature - the activation energy and pre-exponential are controlled
by the optimum position of three nearest lattice atoms. For a case of extended
defect with a weak interaction (an interstitial hydrogen molecule) process of
diffusion is determined by the activation barrier subjected to fluctuations
connected with rotation of a hydrogen molecule. The effect of hydrostatic
pressure on the process of diffusion is discussed also.

GaAs/AlGaAs quantum-well (QW) structures. Resonant changes in the ensemble
photoluminescence induced by far-infrared radiation were studied as a function
of magnetic field for samples having: 1) no growth interrupts (short range
well-width fluctuations), and 2) intentional growth interrupts (long range
monolayer well-width differences). Only bound-to-continuum internal transitions
of the negatively charged trion are observed for samples of type 1. In
contrast, a feature on the high field (low energy) side of electron cyclotron
resonance is seen for samples of type 2 with well widths of 14.1 and 8.4 nm.
This feature is attributed to a bound-to-bound transition of the spin-triplet
with non-zero oscillator strength resulting from breaking of translational
symmetry.

of the network topology that optimizes the rate of convergence of the iterative
decision consensus algorithm. We reformulate the topology design problem as a
spectral graph design problem, namely, maximizing the eigenratio~$\gamma$ of
two eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian~$L$, a matrix that is naturally
associated with the interconnectivity pattern of the network. This
reformulation avoids costly Monte Carlo simulations and leads to the class of
non-bipartite Ramanujan graphs for which we find a lower bound on~$\gamma$. For
Ramanujan topologies and noiseless links, the local probability of error
converges much faster to the overall global probability of error than for
structured graphs, random graphs, or graphs exhibiting small-world
characteristics. With noisy links, we determine the optimal number of
iterations before calling a decision. Finally, we introduce a new class of
random graphs that are easy to construct, can be designed with arbitrary number
of sensors, and whose spectral and convergence properties make them practically
equivalent to Ramanujan topologies.

perturbation with $m^2 = 2H^2$. The self-accelerating universe has a distinct
feature because there is also a helicity-0 mode of spin-2 perturbations with
$m^2 = 2H^2$. In the $-$ branch, which can be thought as the Randall-Sundrum

the cosmological model is constructed that gives as result the closed static

closed expanding Universe in the atomic system of units (a.s.u.). The simple
dynamical model of atomic clock is proposed that leads to the same connection
between the a.s.u. and the g.s.u. as the LNH and allows to specify the
parameters of the model. The question about the equivalence of inertial and
gravitational masses in the arbitrary system of units is ivestigated. It is
deduced that the equivalence of inertial and gravitational masses in the
arbitrary system of units takes place only for the unique transformation law
for G even if the equivalence of two kinds of mass in the g.s.u. is assumed. It
is shown that the model predicts the conservation of the black-body spectrum of
the microvave background radiation independently of choice of the
transformation law for G. It is argued that the some paradoxes of the standard
cosmology can be overcomed in the given model without the supposition about the
existence in the past of a phase of inflationary expansion.

requires dH/dt <~ H^2. We then construct a general low-energy effective theory

that the qualitative features found in our model are very general for stable

non-standard cosmological histories. To illustrate this, we construct an
explicit model in which the expansion of our universe originates from an
asymptotically flat state in the past, smoothing out the big-bang singularity
within control of a low-energy effective theory. This gives an interesting
alternative to standard inflation for solving the horizon problem. We also
construct models in which the present acceleration has w < -1; a periodic
ever-expanding universe and a model with a smooth ``bounce'' connecting a
contracting and expanding phase.

the number of models containing a gauge group SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) or SU(4) x

Gelbart and Piatetski-Shapiro, SLN 1041 (1984), Prop. 2.4(i): ``L^2_{0,1} has
multiplicity 1'', as meaning that each irreducible in the space L^2_{0,1} of
generic cusp forms has multiplicity one in the space L^2_0 of cusp forms. The
statement meant in SLN 1041, ``each irreducible in L^2_{0,1} has multiplicity 1
in L^2_{0,1}'' is too weak to be useful for nongeneric representations, as the
present article points out. To remedy the situation, we detail in this paper
the local method we sketched in the paper of 1988.
  Let \psi be a generic character of the unipotent radical U of a Borel
subgroup of a quasisplit p-adic group G. The number (0 or 1) of \psi-Whittaker
models on an admissible irreducible representation \pi of G was expressed by
Rodier in terms of the limit of values of the trace of \pi at certain measures
concentrated near the origin. An analogous statement holds in the twisted case.
This article proves this twisted analogue for an involution when G=U(3) and p
is not 2, and uses it to provide a local proof of the multiplicity one theorem
for U(3). This asserts that each discrete spectrum automorphic representation
(with induced components at the dyadic places) of the quasisplit unitary group
U(3) associated with a quadratic extension E/F of number fields occurs in the
discrete spectrum with multiplicity one.

linear span A of all finite projections in a semi-finite AW*-algebra M we shall
give a complete description of the strict closure in M of any maximal abelian
self-adjoint subalgebra (masa) of A. We shall see that the situation is
completely different for discrete respectively continuous M : in the discrete
case, for any masa C of A, the strict closure of C is equal to the relative
commutant of C in M, while in the continuous case, under certain conditions
concerning the center valued quasitrace of the finite reduced algebras of M
(satisfied by all von Neumann algebras), C is already strictly closed. Thus in
the continuous case no elements of M which are not already belonging to A can
be strictly approximated from commutative C*-subalgebras of A. In spite of this
pathology of the strict topology in the case of the norm-closed linear span of
all finite projections of a continuous semi-finite AW*-algebra, we shall prove
that in general situations including also this case, any normal y in M is equal
modulo A to some x in M which belongs to an order theoretical closure of an
appropriate commutative C*-subalgebra of A. In other words, if we replace the
strict topology with order theoretical approximation, Weyl-von

hypersensitivity to perturbation. All of these accurately predict chaos in the
classical limit, but it is not clear that they behave the same far from the

an essentially trivial shift map. Linear entropy growth and fidelity decay are
exhibited by this entire family of maps, but hypersensitivity distinguishes
between the simple dynamics of the trivial shift map and the more complicated
dynamics of the other quantizations. This conclusion is supported by an

resonator. The axial atomic motion is cooled by way of coherent Raman
transitions on the red vibrational sideband. An efficient state detection
scheme enabled by strong coupling in cavity QED is used to record the Raman
spectrum, from which the state of atomic motion is inferred. We find that the
lowest vibrational level of the axial potential with zero-point energy 13uK is
occupied with probability P0~0.95.

proposed. The effectiveness of our method is verified by an example of the

maximizes the minimum output purity of a given decohering channel, where the
minimum is taken over all possible pure inputs. This problem is cast as a
max-min optimization problem with a rank constraint on an appropriately defined
matrix variable. The problem is computationally very hard because it is
non-convex with respect to both the objective function (output purity) and the
rank constraint. Despite this difficulty, we provide a tractable computational
algorithm that produces the exact optimal solution for codespace of dimension
two. Moreover, this algorithm is easily extended to cover the general class of
codespaces, in which case the solution is suboptimal in the sense that the
suboptimized output purity serves as a lower bound of the exact optimal purity.
The algorithm consists of a sequence of semidefinite programmings and can be
performed easily. Two typical quantum error channels are investigated to
illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

types of entangled coherent states violate Mermin's version of the Bell
inequality with threshold photon detection (i.e., without photon counting).
Such an experiment can be performed using linear optics elements and threshold
detectors with significant Bell violations for GHZ-type entangled coherent
states. However, to demonstrate Bell-type inequality violations for W-type
entangled coherent states, additional nonlinear interactions are needed. We
also propose an optical scheme to generate W-type entangled coherent states in
free-traveling optical fields. The required resources for the generation are a
single-photon source, a coherent state source, beam splitters, phase shifters,
photodetectors, and Kerr nonlinearities. Our scheme does not necessarily
require strong Kerr nonlinear interactions, i.e., weak nonlinearities can be
used for the generation of the W-type entangled coherent states. Furthermore,
it is also robust against inefficiencies of the single-photon source and the
photon detectors.
