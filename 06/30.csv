sensitive to the size and random speed of the planetesimals.

Second spectra of Ti, Cr, and Fe are rich. Mn II is well identified but not
unusually strong. Numerous lines of S II and P II are found, but not Ga II. The
resonance lines of Sr II are strong. While many Y II lines are identified, and
Nb II is very likely present, {\it no} Zr II lines were found. Xe II is well
identified. Strong absorptions from the third spectra of the lanthanides Pr,
Nd, and Ho are present, but lines from the second spectra of lanthanides are
extremely weak or absent. Among lines from the heavier elements, those of Pt II
are clearly present, and the heaviest isotope, $^{198}$Pt, is indicated. The

based upon its HI rotation curve, we find that the stellar disk is offset in
velocity by ~ 25km/s from the HI disk, consistent with the warping which exists
between these components. The spectroscopic metallicity of the halo component
is [Fe/H] ~ -1.5, significantly more metal-poor than the implied metallicity of
the disk population ([Fe/H] ~ -0.9), which also has a broader colour dispersion
than the halo population. These data represent the first detections of
individual stars in the halo of M33 and, despite being ~ 10 times less massive
than M31 or the Milky Way, all three of these disk galaxies have stellar halo
components with a similar metallicity. The color distribution of the third

expected for a single, coeval, stellar population, and could represent a
stellar stream. More observations are required to determine the true nature of

  I. Model properties","19 pages, 29 figures, accepted in Astronomy & Astrophysics",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20065643",,"astro-ph",,"  We present the results of global 3-D MHD simulations of stratified and
turbulent protoplanetary disc models. The aim of this work is to develop thin
disc models capable of sustaining turbulence for long run times, which can be
used for on-going studies of planet formation in turbulent discs. The results
are obtained using two codes written in spherical coordinates: GLOBAL and
NIRVANA. Both are time--explicit and use finite differences along with the
Constrained Transport algorithm to evolve the equations of MHD. In the presence
of a weak toroidal magnetic field, a thin protoplanetary disc in hydrostatic
equilibrium is destabilised by the magnetorotational instability (MRI). When
the resolution is large enough (25 vertical grid cells per scale height), the
entire disc settles into a turbulent quasi steady-state after about 300 orbits.
Angular momentum is transported outward such that the standard alpha parameter
is roughly 4-6*10^{-3}. We find that the initial toroidal flux is expelled from
the disc midplane and that the disc behaves essentially as a quasi-zero net
flux disc for the remainder of the simulation. As in previous studies, the disc
develops a dual structure composed of an MRI--driven turbulent core around its
midplane, and a magnetised corona stable to the MRI near its surface. By
varying disc parameters and boundary conditions, we show that these basic
properties of the models are robust. The high resolution disc models we present
in this paper achieve a quasi--steady state and sustain turbulence for hundreds
of orbits. As such, they are ideally suited to the study of outstanding
problems in planet formation such as disc--planet interactions and dust
dynamics.

and to shed light on some aspects of galaxy formation and evolution. In this
paper we present a kinematical and photometrical study of a member, NGC4778, of
the nearest (z=0.0137) compact group: Hickson 62.
  Aims: The aim of this work was to investigate the existence of kinematical
anomalies in the brightest group member, NGC4778 in order to constrain the
dynamical status and the formation history of the group.
  Methods: We used long-slit spectra obtained with FORS1 at VLT, to measure
line-of-sight velocity distributions by means of the Fourier Correlation
Quotient method, and to derive the galaxy rotation curve and velocity
dispersion profile.
  Results: Our analysis reveals that Hickson 62a, also known as NGC4778, is an
S0 galaxy with kinematical and morphological peculiarities, both in its central
regions (r < 5'') and in the outer halo. In the central regions, the rotation
curve shows the existence of a kinematically decoupled stellar component,
offset with respect to the photometric center. In the outer halo we find an
asymmetric rotation curve and a velocity dispersion profile showing a rise on
the SW side, in direction of the galaxy NGC4776.
  Conclusions: The nuclear counterrotation, the distorted kinematics in the
outer halo and the X-ray properties of the group suggest that NGC4778 may be
the product of a recent minor merger, more reliable with a small late-type
galaxy.

the FRW universe filled with a massless scalar field in a quantum regime (the

positive or negative) and exponential potentials of the form V(phi) = beta

those predicted from the Mbh-L relationship for the most luminous galaxies,
such as brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). This is because stellar velocity
dispersion, sigma, increases only weakly with L for BCGs and other giant
ellipticals. The Mbh-L relationship predicts that the most luminous BCGs may
have Mbh approaching 10^{10}M_sol, while the M-sigma relationship always
predicts Mbh<3X10^9M_sol. We argue that the Mbh-L relationship is a plausible
or even preferred description for BCGs and other galaxies of similar
luminosity. If cores in central stellar density are formed by binary BHs, then
the inner-core cusp radius, r_gamma, may be an independent witness of Mbh.
Using structural parameters derived from a large sample of early-type galaxies
observed by HST, we argue that L is superior to sigma as an indicator of
r_gamma in luminous galaxies. The observed r_gamma-Mbh relationship for 11 core
galaxies with measured Mbh appears to be consistent with the Mbh-L relationship
for BCGs. BCGs have large cores appropriate for their large luminosities that
may be difficult to generate with the modest BH masses inferred from the
Mbh-sigma relationship. Mbh~L may be expected to hold for BCGs, if they were
formed in dissipationless mergers, which should preserve ratio of BH to stellar
mass. This picture appears to be consistent with the slow increase in sigma
with L and the more rapid increase in effective radii with L seen in BCGs. If
BCGs have large BHs commensurate with their luminosities, then the local BH
mass function for Mbh>3X10^9M_sol may be nearly an order of magnitude richer
than that inferred from the Mbh-sigma relationship. The volume density of QSOs
at earlier epochs may favor the predictions from the Mbh-L relationship.

substantially from today. Sometime within the past ~130,000 years, and possibly
as recent as ~56,000 years ago, the Sun entered the tenuous tepid partially
ionized interstellar material now flowing past the Sun. Prior to that, the Sun
was in the low density interior of the Local Bubble. As the Sun entered the
local ISM flow, we passed briefly through an interface region of some type. The
low column densities of the cloud now surrounding the solar system indicate
that heliosphere boundary conditions will vary from opacity considerations
alone as the Sun moves through the cloud. These variations in the interstellar
material surrounding the Sun affected the paleoheliosphere.

considering a wide range of distributions of various parameters (e.g.

visible HST images exhibit a complex multilobal geometry dominated by faint
lobes. The farthest structures are located at 7"" from the star. The mid-IR
environment of CPD-568032 is dominated by a compact source, barely resolved by
a single UT telescope in a 8.7 micron filter. The infrared core is almost fully
resolved with the three 40-45m projected baselines ranging from -5 to 51 degree
but smooth oscillating fringes at low level have been detected in spectrally
dispersed visibilities. This clear signal is interpreted in terms of a ring
structure which would define the bright inner rim of the equatorial disk.
Geometric models allowed us to derive the main geometrical parameters of the
disk. For instance, a reasonably good fit is reached with an achromatic and
elliptical truncated Gaussian with a radius of 97+/-11 AU, an inclination of
28+/-7 degree and a PA for the major axis at 345+/-7 degree. Furthermore, we
performed some radiative transfer modeling aimed at further constraining the
geometry and mass content of the disk, by taking into account the MIDI
dispersed visibilities, spectra, and the large aperture SED of the source.
These models show that the disk is mostly optically thin in the N band and
highly flared.

estimation of the fundamental parameters of the p modes is a vital
pre-requisite of all subsequent studies. Nine members of the FLAG (the

`hare' (WJC) to simulate full-disc Doppler velocity observations of the Sun.
The rotational frequency splittings of the l=1, 2 and 3 modes were the first

at l=2 and 3 between the fitted splittings of the hounds. Evidence is presented

important came from the different way in which the hounds modeled the

proper motion of $\mu=107.49\pm34.46$ mas/yr. For a distance of 2.2 kpc, this
proper motion is equivalent to a recoil velocity of $1121.79\pm 359.60$ km/s.

place of RX J0822-4300, being near to the optical expansion center of the

indication of a fast moving compact object in a supernova remnant. Although the
positional shift inferred from the current data is significant at a
$\sim3\sigma$ level only, one or more future HRC-I observations can obtain a
much larger positional separation and further constrain the measurement.

secular evolutionary processes of bulge growth. However, N-body simulations of
satellite accretions have paid little attention to the evolution of bulge
photometric parameters, to the processes driving this evolution, and to the
consistency of this evolution with observations. We want to investigate whether
satellite accretions indeed drive the growth of bulges, and whether they are
consistent with global scaling relations of bulges and discs. We perform N-body
models of the accretion of satellites onto disc galaxies. A Tully-Fisher (M
\propto V_{rot}^ {alpha_TF}) scaling between primary and satellite ensures that
density ratios, critical to the outcome of the accretion, are realistic. We
carry out a full structural, kinematic and dynamical analysis of the evolution
of the bulge mass, bulge central concentration, and bulge-to-disc scaling
relations. The remnants of the accretion have bulge-disc structure. Both the
bulge-to-disc ratio (B/D) and the Sersic index (n) of the remnant bulge
increase as a result of the accretion, with moderate final bulge Sersic
indices: n = 1.0 to 1.9. Bulge growth occurs no matter the fate of the
secondary, which fully disrupts for alpha_TF=3 and partially survives to the
remnant center for alpha_TF = 3.5 or 4. Global structural parameters evolve
following trends similar to observations. We show that the dominant mechanism
for bulge growth is the inward flow of material from the disc to the bulge
region during the satellite decay. The models confirm that the growth of the
bulge out of disc material, a central ingredient of secular evolution models,
may be triggered externally through satellite accretion.

isothermal slab (CDL) and at symmetric settings, where both flows have equal
parameters. We performed a set of high-resolution simulations with upwind Mach
numbers, 5 < M_u < 90.
  We find that the CDL is irregularly shaped and has a patchy and filamentary
interior. The size of these structures increases with l_cdl, the extension of
the CDL. On average, but not at each moment, the solution is about self-similar
and depends only on M_u. We find the root mean square Mach number to scale as
M_rms ~ 0.2 M_u. Independent of M_u is the mean density, rho_m ~ 30 rho_u. The
fraction f_eff of the upwind kinetic energy that survives shock passage scales
as f_eff= 1 - M_rms^(-0.6). This dependence persists if the upwind flow
parameters differ from one side to the other of the CDL, indicating that the
turbulence within the CDL and its driving are mutually coupled. In the same
direction points the finding that the auto-correlation length of the confining
shocks and the characteristic length scale of the turbulence within the CDL are
proportional.
  In summary, larger upstream Mach numbers lead to a faster expanding CDL with
more strongly inclined confining interfaces relative to the upstream flows,
more efficient driving, and finer interior structure relative to the extension
of the CDL.

single crystal in two dimensions. Dislocations nucleate only at the free
surface as there are no sources in the interior of the sample. When
dislocations reach sufficient density, they spontaneously coalesce to nucleate
grain boundaries, and the resulting microstructure depends strongly on the
initial crystal orientation of the sample. In initial yield, we find a reverse
size effect, in which larger samples show a higher scaled bending moment than
smaller samples for a given strain and strain rate. This effect is associated
with source-limited plasticity and high strain rate relative to dislocation
mobility, and the size effect in initial yield disappears when we scale the
data to account for strain rate effects. Once dislocations coalesce to form
grain boundaries, the size effect reverses and we find that smaller crystals
support a higher scaled bending moment than larger crystals. This finding is in
qualitative agreement with experimental results. Finally, we observe an
instability at the compressed crystal surface that suggests a novel mechanism
for the formation of a hillock structure. The hillock is formed when a high
angle grain boundary, after absorbing additional dislocations, becomes unstable
and folds to form a new crystal grain that protrudes from the free surface.

systems is investigated by extending the Kadanoff-Wilson renormalization group
of one-dimensional (1D) systems to Q-1D systems. This scheme is applied to the
extended Hubbard model to calculate the temperature ($T$) dependence of the
magnetic susceptibility, $\chi (T)$. The calculation is performed by taking
into account not only the logarithmic Cooper and Peierls channels, but also the
non-logarithmic Landau and finite momentum Cooper channels, which give relevant
contributions to the uniform response at finite temperatures. It is shown that
the interchain hopping, $t_\perp$, reduces $\chi (T)$ at low temperatures,
while it enhances $\chi(T)$ at high temperatures. This notable $t_\perp$
dependence is ascribed to the fact that $t_\perp$ enhances the
antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation at low temperatures, while it suppresses the
1D fluctuation at high temperatures. The result is at variance with the
random-phase-approximation approach, which predicts an enhancement of $\chi
(T)$ by $t_\perp$ over the whole temperature range. The influence of both the
long-range repulsion and the nesting deviations on $\chi (T)$ is further
investigated. We discuss the present results in connection with the data of
$\chi (T)$ in the (TMTTF)$_2X$ and (TMTSF)$_2X$ series of Q-1D organic
conductors, and propose a theoretical prediction for the effect of pressure on

particular topological properties, such as a giant connected component, a broad
degree distribution, the small-world property and the presence of communities
of densely interconnected nodes. Several models, including ensembles of
networks also known in social science as Exponential Random Graphs, have been
proposed with the aim of reproducing each of these properties in isolation.
Here we define a generalized ensemble of graphs by introducing the concept of
graph temperature, controlling the degree of topological optimization of a
network. We consider the temperature-dependent version of both existing and
novel models and show that all the aforementioned topological properties can be
simultaneously understood as the natural outcomes of an optimized,
low-temperature topology. We also show that seemingly different graph models,
as well as techniques used to extract information from real networks, are all
found to be particular low-temperature cases of the same generalized formalism.
One such technique allows us to extend our approach to real weighted networks.
Our results suggest that a low graph temperature might be an ubiquitous
property of real socio-economic networks, placing conditions on the diffusion
of information across these systems.

support simultaneous transmission to multiple users. The optimal multiuser
transmission, known as dirty paper coding, is not directly realizable.
Moreover, close-to-optimal solutions such as Tomlinson-Harashima precoding are
sensitive to CSI inaccuracy. This paper considers a more practical design
called per user unitary and rate control (PU2RC), which has been proposed for
emerging cellular standards. PU2RC supports multiuser simultaneous
transmission, enables limited feedback, and is capable of exploiting multiuser
diversity. Its key feature is an orthogonal beamforming (or precoding)
constraint, where each user selects a beamformer (or precoder) from a codebook
of multiple orthonormal bases. In this paper, the asymptotic throughput scaling
laws for PU2RC with a large user pool are derived for different regimes of the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In the multiuser-interference-limited regime, the
throughput of PU2RC is shown to scale logarithmically with the number of users.
In the normal SNR and noise-limited regimes, the throughput is found to scale
double logarithmically with the number of users and also linearly with the
number of antennas at the base station. In addition, numerical results show
that PU2RC achieves higher throughput and is more robust against CSI
quantization errors than the popular alternative of zero-forcing beamforming if

the full Poisson structure of the constraints.
  The calculation of the Poisson structure in chapter 6 introduces corrections
and generalizations to earlier published results. We show that the full Poisson
structure closes on shell, but not off shell. An attempt is made to interpret
the gauge orbits generated by the constraints.

derived the required propagator functions, investigated the one-loop properties
of quark amplitudes at finite $N_s$ and evaluated three quantities that can
provide insights on chirality-breaking effects from the perturbative side.
  First we have computed the residual mass for various choices of $N_s$ and of
the domain-wall height $M$. We have found that this radiatively induced mass
approaches zero reasonably fast with the extent of the fifth dimension,
depending on $M$ and on a lesser extent on the coupling $g_0$. We have also
computed the differences of the renormalization constants of the vector and
axial-vector currents and of the scalar and pseudoscalar densities. Finally we
have calculated the chirally-forbidden mixing (which at finite $N_s$ is
suppressed only partially) of an operator which describes the lowest moment of
the $g_2$ structure function. In general we see that at $M=1.8$, where
simulations are usually performed, values of $N_s=20$ or larger would be
desirable in order for chiral violations to be negligible.
  The quantities that we have studied turn out to lose gauge invariance when
$N_s$ is not infinite. We have also found that anomalous dimensions of
operators at finite $N_s$ generally depend on $N_s$ and $M$. In particular, the
vector and axial-vector currents have in general a nonzero anomalous dimension
at finite $N_s$.

can be in the electroweak range, gravitational effects in particle physics may
be noticeable even at relatively low energies. In this paper, we perform simple
estimates of the decays of elementary particles with a black hole intermediate
state. Since black holes are believed to violate global symmetries, particle
decays can violate lepton and baryon numbers. Whereas previous literature has
claimed incompatibility between these rates (e.g. $p$-decay) and existing
experimental bounds, we find suppressed baryon and lepton-violating rates due
to a new conjecture about the nature of the virtual black holes. We assume here
that black holes lighter than the (effective) Planck mass must have zero
electric and color charge and zero angular momentum -- this statement is true
in classical general relativity and we make the conjecture that it holds in
quantum gravity as well. If true, the rates for proton-decay,
neutron-antineutron oscillations, and lepton-violating rare decays are
suppressed to below experimental bounds even for large extra dimensions with
TeV-scale gravity. Neutron-antineutron oscillations and anomalous decays of
muons, $\tau$-leptons, and $K$ and $B$-mesons open a promising possibility to
observe TeV gravity effects with a minor increase of existing experimental
accuracy.

that the EDMs are very sensitive to non-minimal flavor violation structures of

to give Einstein supergravities with second order field equations instead of
the higher derivative conformal supergravities that arose from earlier twistor
strings. The theories include one with the spectrum of N=8 supergravity,
another with the spectrum of N=4 supergravity coupled to N=4 super-Yang-Mills,
and a family with $N\ge 0$ supersymmetries with the spectra of self-dual
supergravity coupled to self-dual super-Yang-Mills. The non-supersymmetric
string with N=0 gives self-dual gravity coupled to self-dual Yang-Mills and a
scalar. A three-graviton amplitude is calculated for the N=8 and N=4 theories
and shown to give a result consistent with the cubic interaction of Einstein
supergravity.

based on the posterior probabilities and posterior odds ratios, in testing the
explanatory power of the set of competing GARCH (ang. Generalised

asymmetric and heavy tailed conditional distributions. In building competing
volatility models we consider, as an initial specification, GARCH process with
conditional Student-t distribution with unknown degrees of freedom parameter,
proposed by Bollerslev (1987). By introducing skewness into Student-t family
and incorporating the resulting class as a conditional distribution we
generated various GARCH models, which compete in explaining possible asymmetry
of both conditional and unconditional distribution of financial data. Based on
the daily returns of hypothetical financial time series, we discuss the results
of Bayesian comparison of alternative skewing mechanisms applied in the initial
Student-t GARCH framework. We also check the sensitivity of model ranking with
respect to the changes in prior distribution of model specific parameters.
Additionally, we present formal Bayesian inference about conditional asymmetry
of the distribution of the daily returns in all competing specifications on the
basis of the skewness measure defined by Arnold and Groenveld (1995).

histories when new discoveries are made that involve concepts accessible to
students at every level. Such an opportunity currently exists thanks to the
fact that notes written by Galileo indicating that he observed the double star
Mizar in the ""Big Dipper"" have recently come to light. His measurements of this
star, given the scientific knowledge at the time, strongly supported the theory
that the Earth was fixed in space and not moving. Had Galileo published these
results, it is likely that widespread acceptance of the heliocentric theory in
scientific circles would have been significantly delayed. In light of these
notes, his later reference in his Dialogue to using double stars as a means of
proving that the Earth was in motion is puzzling. The physics and mathematics
behind Galileo's work is easily within reach of students in introductory
physics and astronomy courses, so discussion of Galileo's Mizar work and its
interesting implications can be used in virtually any class.

individuals depend on their spatial distances and usually take place among
their nearest neighbors. In this paper, we introduce a modified
susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model to study geographical effects on
the spread of diseases by assuming that the probability of a healthy individual
infected by an infectious one is inversely proportional to the Euclidean
distance between them. It is found that geography plays a more important role
than hubs in disease spreading: the more geographically constrained the network
is, the more highly the epidemic prevails.

anti-relaxation-coated cells, detected via nonlinear magneto-optical rotation
(NMOR) is a promising technique for a new generation of ultra-sensitive atomic
magnetometers. For magnetic fields directed along the light propagation
direction, resonances in NMOR appear when linearly polarized light is
frequency- or amplitude-modulated at twice the Larmor frequency. Because the
frequency of these resonances depends on the magnitude but not the direction of
the field, they are useful for scalar magnetometry. New NMOR resonances at the
Larmor frequency appear when the magnetic field is tilted away from the light
propagation direction in the plane defined by the light propagation and
polarization vectors. These new resonances, studied both experimentally and
with a density matrix calculation in the present work, offer a convenient
method for NMOR-based vector magnetometry.

flames. The first experiment concerns the observation of the temporal growth of
wrinkling on a freely propagating planar flame. A second experiment concerns
the spatio-temporal growth of structures of controlled wavelength on an
anchored flame. The experimental observations are compared to theoretical
dispersion relation. Finally, we compare observations of the non-linear
evolution to saturation with the predictions of an extended
Michelson-Sivashinsky equation.

without particular control methods are found to be adequately described by a
Gamma function, consistently with the recent results by Graves et al [J.P.
Graves, et al, Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 47, L1 (2005)]. On the other hand,
pulses with external methods for plasma control feature modified PDFs. A first
empirical analysis suggests that they may be interpolated through a linear
combination of simple functions. An inspection of the literature shows that
this kind of PDFs is common to other devices as well, and has been suggested to
be due to the simultaneous presence of different mechanisms driving
respectively coherent bursts and gaussian background turbulence. An attempt is
made to relate differences in the PDFs to plasma conditions such as the local
shift of the plasma column. A simple phenomenological model to interpret the
nature of the PDF and assign a meaning to its parameters is also developed.

oscillator with a nonlinear damping term that is maximal at zero current and
decreases with an inverse current relation for currents far from zero. A set of
nonlinear differential equations for the oscillator circuit is derived and
integrated numerically for comparison with circuit measurements. The agreement
is very good for both the transient and steady-state responses. Unlike the
standard RLC circuit, the behavior of this circuit is amplitude dependent. In
particular for the transient response the oscillator makes a transition from
under-damped to over-damped behavior, and for the driven oscillator the
resonance response becomes sharper and stronger as drive source amplitude
increases. The equipment is inexpensive and common to upper level physics labs.

between structure and dynamics of a complex network: Can we design a network,
e.g. by modifying the features of units or interactions, such that it exhibits
a desired dynamics? Here we present a case study where we positively answer
this question analytically for networks of spiking neural oscillators. First,
we present a method of finding the set of all networks (defined by all mutual
coupling strengths) that exhibit an arbitrary given periodic pattern of spikes
as an invariant solution. In such a pattern all the spike times of all the
neurons are exactly predefined. The method is very general as it covers
networks of different types of neurons, excitatory and inhibitory couplings,
interaction delays that may be heterogeneously distributed, and arbitrary
network connectivities. Second, we show how to design networks if further
restrictions are imposed, for instance by predefining the detailed network
connectivity. We illustrate the applicability of the method by examples of
Erd\""{o}s-R\'{e}nyi and power-law random networks. Third, the method can be
used to design networks that optimize network properties. To illustrate this
idea, we design networks that exhibit a predefined pattern dynamics while at
the same time minimizing the networks' wiring costs.

\right>$ and an associated set of operators $A_\alpha$ which generate
transformations connecting those trial states. Using variational principles, we
show that we can always obtain a quantum Monte-Carlo method where the quantum
evolution of a system is replaced by jumps between density matrices of the form
$D = |Q_a> <Q_b|$, and where the average evolutions of the moments of
$A_\alpha$ up to a given order $k$, i.e. $< A_{\alpha_1} >$, $< A_{\alpha_1}
A_{\alpha_2} >$,..., $< A_{\alpha_1} ... A_{\alpha_k} >$, are constrained to
follow the exact Ehrenfest evolution at each time step along each stochastic
trajectory. Then, a set of more and more elaborated stochastic approximations
of a quantum problem is obtained which approach the exact solution when more
and more constraints are imposed, i.e. when $k$ increases. The Monte-Carlo
process might even become exact if the Hamiltonian $H$ applied on the trial
state can be written as a polynomial of $A_\alpha$. The formalism makes a
natural connection between quantum jumps in Hilbert space and phase-space
dynamics. We show that the derivation of stochastic Schroedinger equations can
be greatly simplified by taking advantage of the existence of this hierarchy of
approximations and its connection to the Ehrenfest theorem. Several examples
are illustrated: the free wave-packet expansion, the Kerr oscillator, a
generalized version of the Kerr oscillator, as well as interacting bosons or
fermions.
