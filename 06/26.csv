The design, characterization, and analysis of data obtained using Polarization
Sensitive Bolometers (PSBs) are described in detail. This is followed by a
brief study of the effect of various polarization modulation techniques on the
recovery of sky polarization from scanning polarimeter data. Having been
successfully implemented on the sub-orbital Boomerang experiment, PSBs are
currently operational in two terrestrial CMB polarization experiments (QUaD and
the Robinson Telescope). We investigate two approaches to the analysis of data
from these experiments, using realistic simulations of time ordered data to
illustrate the impact of instrumental effects on the fidelity of the recovered
polarization signal. We find that the analysis of difference time streams takes
full advantage of the high degree of common mode rejection afforded by the PSB
design. In addition to the observational efforts currently underway, this
discussion is directly applicable to the PSBs that constitute the polarized
capability of the Planck HFI instrument.

mean field, the non-linear incompressible dynamics is replaced by 2D
shell-models for the complex variables u and b, allowing one to reach large
Reynolds numbers while at the same time carrying out sufficiently long time
integrations to obtain a good statistics at moderate computational cost. The
shell-models of different planes are coupled by Alfven waves propagating along
B0. The model may be applied to open or closed magnetic field configurations
where the axial field dominates and the plasma pressure is low; here we apply
it to the specific case of a magnetic loop of the solar corona heated via
turbulence driven by photospheric motions, and we use statistics for its
analysis. The Alfven waves interact non-linearly and form turbulent spectra in
the directions perpendicular and, via propagation, also parallel to the mean
field. A heating function is obtained, and is shown to be intermittent; the
average heating is consistent with values required for sustaining a hot corona,
and is proportional to the aspect ratio of the loop to the power -1.5;
characteristic properties of heating events are distributed as power-laws.
Cross-correlations show a delay of dissipation compared to energy content.

liquid at pressures of 3.0 to14.5 GPa and temperatures of 1660 to 2500 oC. The
solubility of U in liquid Fe is in the range of 0.6 to 800 ppm and increases
with temperature (T) and pressure (P). When P = or > 7 GPa and T > Tmelt of the
silicate phase (olivine), the U concentration in Fe is 3 to 5 times greater
than for run products where T < Tmelt of the silicate phase. Correspondingly,
partitioning coefficient DU values can reach 0.031 at 8.5 GPa (using BN sample
container) and 0.036 at 14.5 GPa (using graphite sample container). This
implies that if a terrestrial-type planetary core with a pure Fe composition
formed from a deep magma ocean (T > Tmelt of the silicate phase), then > 2.4
ppb U could have entered the core. Alternatively, if a core with same
composition formed by percolation (T < Tmelt of the silicate phase), then based
on the experimental results indicating DU increases with increasing P, 1 to 4
ppb U may have entered the core. The concentration of Si in liquid Fe also
increases with pressure. The concentration of Ca is < 0.44 wt % for most
samples and no relation with U concentration is found, which indicates that U
may alloy with Fe directly. If Si concentration in the Fe phase can be used as
an indicator of oxygen fugacity, then the increase in Si and U with pressure
suggests a pressure dependent decrease in oxygen fugacity. This supports U (and
possibly also Si) inclusion in the the core of Earth at the time of core
formation. The implications for radioactive heating in the planetary cores are
briefly discussed. Keywords: Uranium; partition coefficients; high pressure;

classical standing waves in a cavity, by determining the cavity limits and the
wave phases at these limits. The internal boundary condition is determined by a
fitting with an Airy function. The external boundary condition is defined as
the limit where the spatial variation of the background is important compared

possible truncation of the cluster mass function. It is tentatively suggested

are much developed in its critical region so that lifetime widths of
quasiparticles are large and the energy dependence of the selfenergy deviates
from that of Landau's normal Fermi liquids. A pseudogap opens in such a
critical region because quasiparticle spectra around the chemical potential are
swept away due to the large lifetime widths. The pseudogap never smoothly
evolves into a superconducting gap; it starts to open at a temperature higher
than T_c while the superconducting gap starts to open just at T_c. When T_c is
rather low but the ratio of varepsilon_G(0)/k_BT_c, with varepsilon_G(0) the

a value about 4 according to the mean-field theory, the pseudogap must be
closing as temperature T approaches to the low T_c because thermal fluctuations

Even though the symmetries are extracted from the Hubbard model, the effective

  Construction","submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  A code over GF$(q^m)$ can be imaged or expanded into a code over GF$(q)$
using a basis for the extension field over the base field. The properties of
such an image depend on the original code and the basis chosen for imaging.
Problems relating the properties of a code and its image with respect to a
basis have been of great interest in the field of coding theory. In this work,
a generalized version of the problem of self-orthogonality of the $q$-ary image
of a $q^m$-ary code has been considered. Given an inner product (more
generally, a biadditive form), necessary and sufficient conditions have been
derived for a code over a field extension and an expansion basis so that an
image of that code is self-orthogonal. The conditions require that the original
code be self-orthogonal with respect to several related biadditive forms
whenever certain power sums of the dual basis elements do not vanish. Numerous
interesting corollaries have been derived by specializing the general
conditions. An interesting result for the canonical or regular inner product in
fields of characteristic two is that only self-orthogonal codes result in
self-orthogonal images. Another result is that image of a code is
self-orthogonal for all bases if and only if trace of the code is
self-orthogonal, except for the case of binary images of 4-ary codes. The
conditions are particularly simple to state and apply for cyclic codes. To
illustrate a possible application, new quantum error-correcting codes have been
constructed with larger minimum distance than previously known.

a solution satisfying the outgoing wave boundary condition at the horizon must
be continued to some mid point and only then the continued fraction condition
can be applied. This prescription is general and applies to all cases for
which, due to regular singularities on the way from the point of interest to

large rotation of the polarization of light generated in vacuum in the presence

a new light spin-zero particle coupled to two photons. In this Letter of
Intent, we propose to test this hypothesis by setting up a photon regeneration
experiment which exploits the photon beam of the Vacuum-UltraViolet
Free-Electron Laser VUV-FEL, sent along the transverse magnetic field of a
linear arrangement of dipole magnets of size B L ~ 30 Tm. The high photon
energies available at the VUV-FEL increase substantially the expected photon
regeneration rate in the mass range implied by the PVLAS anomaly, in comparison
to the rate expected at visible lasers of similar power. We find that the
particle interpretation of the PVLAS result can be tested within a short
running period. The pseudoscalar vs. scalar nature can be determined by varying
the direction of the magnetic field with respect to the laser polarization. The
mass of the particle can be measured by running at different photon energies.
The proposed experiment offers a window of opportunity for a firm establishment
or exclusion of the particle interpretation of the PVLAS anomaly before other
experiments can compete.

gauge-dependent smoothing techniques. We used 200 O(a^2) improved quenched QCD
gauge-field configurations on a 16^3x32 lattice with a lattice spacing of 0.123
fm. In the presence of static quarks flux tubes representing the suppression of
gluon-field fluctuations are observed. We have analyzed 11 L-shapes and 8 T and
Y shapes of varying sizes in order to explore a variety of flux-tube
topologies, including the ground state. At large separations, Y-shape flux-tube
formation is observed. T-shaped paths are observed to relax towards a Y-shaped
topology, whereas L-shaped paths give rise to a large potential energy. We do
not find any evidence for the formation of a Delta-shaped flux-tube (empty
triangle) distribution. However, at small quark separations, we observe an
expulsion of gluon-field fluctuations in the shape of a filled triangle with
maximal expulsion at the centre of the triangle. Having identified the precise
geometry of the flux distribution, we are able to perform quantitative
comparison between the length of the flux-tube and the associated static quark
potential. For every source configuration considered we find a universal string
tension, and conclude that, for large quark separations, the ground state
potential is that which minimizes the length of the flux-tube. The flux tube
radius of the baryonic ground state potential is found to be 0.38 \pm 0.03 fm,
with vacuum fluctuations suppressed by 7.2 \pm 0.6 %.

circle we compute the corrections to the metric and corresponding
thermodynamics in the limit of small mass. When taking the near-extremal limit,
this gives the corrections to the constant entropy of the extremal three-charge
black hole as a function of the energy above extremality. For the partial
extremal limit with two charges sent to infinity and one finite we show that
the first correction to the entropy is in agreement with the microscopic
entropy by taking into account that the number of branes shift as a consequence
of the interactions across the transverse circle. Beyond these analytical
results, we also numerically obtain the entire phase of non- and near-extremal

find in this paper a rich phase structure, including a new phase of

Under what conditions on A and M is it possible to find a connection on M?
  We consider maximal Cohen-Macaulay (MCM) modules over complete CM algebras
that are isolated singularities, and usually assume that the singularities have
finite CM representation type. It is known that over a simple singularity of
dimension at most two, any MCM module admits an integrable connection. We prove
that over a simple singularity of dimension at least three, an MCM module
admits connections if and only if it is free. Among singularities of finite CM
representation type, we find examples of curves with MCM modules that do not
admit connections, and threefolds with non-free MCM modules that do admit
connections.
  Let A be a singularity not necessarily of finite CM representation type, and
consider the condition that A is a Gorenstein curve or a Q-Gorenstein
singularity of dimension at least two. We show that this condition is
sufficient for the canonical module of A to admit an integrable connection, and
conjecture that it is also necessary. In support of the conjecture, we show

whose boundary is not known. Usually the numerical reconstruction from the
measured current and voltage data is done assuming the domain has a known fixed
geometry. However, in practical applications the geometry of the domain is
usually not known. This introduces an error, and effectively changes the
problem into an anisotropic one. The main result of this paper is a uniqueness
result characterizing the isotropic conductivities on convex domains in terms
of measurements done on a different domain, which we call the model domain, up
to an affine isometry. As data for the inverse problem, we assume the
Robin-to-Neumann map and the contact impedance function on the boundary of the
model domain to be given.
  Also, we present a minimization algorithm based on the use of Cotton--York
tensor, that finds the pushforward of the isotropic conductivity to our model
domain, and also finds the boundary of the original domain up to an affine
isometry. This algorithm works also in dimensions higher than three, but then
the Cotton--York tensor has to replaced with the Weyl--tensor.

systems and the Tutte-Martin polynomial of an isotropic system. Then, Arratia,
Bollob\'as, and Sorkin developed the interlace polynomial of a graph in [ABS00]
in response to a DNA sequencing application. The interlace polynomial has
generated considerable recent attention, with new results including realizing
the original interlace polynomial by a closed form generating function
expression instead of by the original recursive definition (see Aigner and van
der Holst [AvdH04], and Arratia, Bollob\'as, and Sorkin [ABS04b]). Now, Bouchet
[Bou05] recognizes the vertex-nullity interlace polynomial of a graph as the
Tutte-Martin polynomial of an associated isotropic system. This suggests that
the machinery of isotropic systems may be well-suited to investigating
properties of the interlace polynomial. Thus, we present here an alternative
proof for the closed form presentation of the vertex-nullity interlace
polynomial using the machinery of isotropic systems. This approach both
illustrates the intimate connection between the vertex-nullity interlace
polynomial and the Tutte-Martin polynomial of an isotropic system and also
provides a concrete example of manipulating isotropic systems. We also provide
a brief survey of related work.

Here we analyse both high-frequency tick-by-tick as well as daily closing price
data to show that the price fluctuations in the Indian stock market, one of the
largest emerging markets, have a distribution that is identical to that
observed for developed markets (e.g., NYSE). In particular, the cumulative
distribution has a long tail described by a power law with an exponent $\alpha
\approx 3$. Also, we study the historical evolution of this distribution over
the period of existence of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India, which
coincided with the rapid transformation of the Indian economy due to
liberalization, and show that this power law tail has been present almost
throughout. We conclude that the ``inverse cubic law'' is a truly universal
feature of a financial market, independent of its stage of development or the
condition of the underlying economy.
