mixture of peridotite, uraninite, Fe and FeS powder at pressure (P) of 0-9 GPa
and temperature (T) of 1500-2200 oC. Comparisons with the run products
containing pure Fe as the metal phase in our previous study and re-analysis of

including Fe-10wt% S, Fe-35wt% S and pure Fe groups, the solubility and
partitioning of U in the pure metal or metal-sulfide phase relative to the
silicate phase (DU) increases with increasing P and T. With a molten silicate
phase, DU is generally 3-6 times larger than with a solid silicate phase. While
DU has a positive dependence on S concentration of the metal-sulfide phase,
there is a negative correlation between Ca and U. According to our calculations
based on these experimental results, if the core has formed from a magma ocean
at a P of 26 GPa at its base and the core contained 10wt% S, then it could have
incorporated at least 10 ppb U. Alternatively, if the core formed by
percolation and contained 10wt% S, then it could have incorporated 5-22 ppb U.
The geophysical implications of U in the core of Earth are discussed.

galaxies at high redshift, with two of the 14 objects showing significant
emission below the Lyman limit. We also measured the ratio of emergent flux

contribution to the metagalactic ionizing radiation field is
J_nu(900)~2.6x10^{-22} erg/s/cm^2/Hz/sr, comparable to the contribution of
optically-selected quasars at the same redshift. The sum of the contributions
from galaxies and quasars is consistent with recent estimates of the level of
the ionizing background at z~3, inferred from the HI Ly-alpha forest optical
depth. There is significant variance among the emergent far-UV spectra in our
sample, yet the factors controlling the detection or non-detection of
Lyman-continuum emission from galaxies are not well-determined. Because we do
not yet understand the source of this variance, significantly larger samples
will be required to obtain robust constraints on the galaxy contribution to the

we elaborate the final fate of massive stars as a function of initial mass and

which initial conditions long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are expected to be
produced in the frame of the collapsar model. Then, using an empirical spin
distribution of young massive metal-poor stars and a specified
metallicity-dependent history of star-formation, we compute the expected GRB

spectrum for simulations run with identical initial conditions show differences

forest. This allows a meaningful comparison of the effect of the different
implementations of the hydrodynamic part of the two codes. Using the same
cooling and heating algorithm in both codes the differences in the temperature
and the density probability distribution function are of the order of 10%.
These differences can be mainly attributed to a slight mismatch in the
resolution. The differences are smaller than or equal to the effects of boxsize
and resolution on these statistics. Once resolution effects are taken into
account the differences in the flux power spectrum - the statistics most widely
used for estimating the matter power spectrum and cosmological parameters from
Lyman-alpha forest data - are about 5%. This is again smaller than or equal to
the effects of boxsize and resolution. Numerical uncertainties due to a
particular implementation of solving the hydrodynamic or gravitational
equations appear therefore to contribute only moderately to the error budget in
estimates of the flux power spectrum from numerical simulations. We further
find that the differences in the flux power spectrum for Enzo simulations run
with and without adaptive mesh refinement are also of order 5% or smaller. The
latter require 10 times less CPU time making the CPU time requirement similar
to that of a version of Gadget-2 that is optimised for Lyman-alpha forest

possible to geometrically determine the distance to variable Galactic sources,
based on the phenomenon that scattered radiation appearing in the X-ray halo
has to travel along a slightly longer path than the direct, unscattered
radiation. By measuring the delayed variability, constraints on the source
distance can be obtained if the halo brightness is large enough to dominate the
point spread function (PSF) and to provide sufficient statistics. The distance
to Cyg X-3, which has a quasi-sinusoidal light curve, has been obtained with
this approach by Predehl et al. Here we examine the feasibility of using the
delayed signature of type I X-ray bursts as distance indicators. We use
simulations of delayed X-ray burst light curves in the halo to find that the
optimal annular region and energy band for a distance measurement with a
grating observation is roughly 10-50"" and 1-5 keV respectively, assuming
Chandra's effective area and PSF, uniformly distributed dust, the input
spectrum and optical depth to GX 13+1, and the Weingartner & Draine
interstellar grain model. We find that the statistics are dominated by Poisson
noise rather than systematic uncertainties, e.g., the PSF contribution to the
halo. Using Chandra, a distance measurement to such a source at 4 (8) kpc could
be made to about 23% (30%) accuracy with a single burst with 68% confidence. By
stacking many bursts, a reasonable estimate of systematic errors limit the

the accretor radius, depending on the parameters of the cooling function. The
growth rate and oscillation period are comparable to those observed in the
numerical simulations of Blondin & Mezzacappa (2006). The instability mechanism
is analyzed by separately measuring the efficiencies of the purely acoustic
cycle and the advective-acoustic cycle. These efficiencies are estimated
directly from the eigenspectrum, and also through a WKB analysis in the high
frequency limit. Both methods prove that the advective-acoustic cycle is
unstable, and that the purely acoustic cycle is stable. Extrapolating these
results to low frequency leads us to interpret the dominant mode as an
advective-acoustic instability, different from the purely acoustic
interpretation of Blondin & Mezzacappa (2006). A simplified characterization of
the instability is proposed, based on an advective-acoustic cycle between the
shock and the radius r_nabla where the velocity gradients of the stationary
flow are strongest. The importance of the coupling region in this mechanism
calls for a better understanding of the conditions for an efficient
advective-acoustic coupling in a decelerated, nonadiabatic flow, in order to

rather than a single power law. Recently, attention has turned to the rather
rigorous power-law behaviour exhibited by the `pseudo phase-space density' of
the dark matter halo, which is defined dimensionally in terms of the local
density and velocity dispersion of the dark matter particles. The non-power-law
behaviour of the density profile is generally taken to exclude simple
scale-free, in-fall models; however the power-law behaviour of the

behaviours may be at least qualitatively understood in terms of a dynamically
evolving self-similarity, rather than the form for self-similar infall that is
fixed by cosmological initial conditions. The evolution is likely due to
collective relaxation such as that provided by the radial-orbit instability on
large scales. We deduce, from a distribution function given by first order
coarse-graining, both the NFW-type density profile and the power-law
pseudo-density profile. The results are not greatly sensitive to variation
about 3 in the power of the velocity dispersion used in the definition of the

incomplete relaxation.

independent of radio frequency. The harmonic QPOs are likely due to the
quasi-periodic injection of plasma from an oscillating accretion disk into the

the knowledge of accretion disk, it implies that the inner region of accretion

oscillation accretion is due to the p-mode oscillation of the thick disk
probably excited by a SMBHB. The theoretical predications of fundamental
oscillation frequency and the harmonics are well consistent with the

result, the gas-liquid phase diagrams are calculated for $z=2-4$. The results

density functional theory for fluids in quenched disordered matrices (QA-DFT).
We show that the disorder-averaged free energy of the fluid is a functional of
the average density profile of the fluid as well as the pair correlation of the
fluid and matrix particles. For practical reasons it is preferable to use
another functional: the disorder-averaged free energy plus the fluid-matrix
interaction energy, which, for fixed fluid-matrix interaction potential, is a
functional only of the average density profile of the fluid. When the matrix is
created as a quenched configuration of another fluid, the functional can be
regarded as depending on the density profile of the matrix fluid as well. In
this situation, the replica-Ornstein-Zernike equations which do not contain the
blocking parts of the correlations can be obtained as functional identities in
this formalism, provided the second derivative of this functional is
interpreted as the connected part of the direct correlation function. The
blocking correlations are totally absent from QA-DFT, but nevertheless the
thermodynamics can be entirely obtained from the functional. We apply the
formalism to obtain the exact functional for an ideal fluid in an arbitrary
matrix, and discuss possible approximations for non-ideal fluids.

equally-sized parts and then let users download each part (or, for network
coding based systems such as Avalanche, linear combinations of the parts)
either from the server or from another user who has already downloaded it.
However, their performance evaluation has typically been limited to comparing
one system relative to another and typically been realized by means of
simulation and measurements. In contrast, we provide an analytic performance
analysis that is based on a new uplink-sharing version of the well-known
broadcasting problem. Assuming equal upload capacities, we show that the
minimal time to disseminate the file is the same as for the simultaneous
send/receive version of the broadcasting problem. For general upload
capacities, we provide a mixed integer linear program (MILP) solution and a
complementary fluid limit solution. We thus provide a lower bound which can be
used as a performance benchmark for any P2P file dissemination system. We also
investigate the performance of a decentralized strategy, providing evidence
that the performance of necessarily decentralized P2P file dissemination
systems should be close to this bound and therefore that it is useful in
practice.

and the neutron or neutral kaon via the missing mass technique. The mass and
width of known hyperons such as $\Sigma^+$, $\Sigma^-$ and $\Lambda(1116)$ were
used as a check of the mass determination accuracy and experimental resolution.
Approximately 100,000 $\Lambda^*(1520)$'s and 150,000 $\phi$'s were observed in
the $\bar K^0 K^+ n$ and $\bar K^0 K^0 p$ final state respectively. No evidence

upper limit on the total cross section for a resonance peaked at 1540 MeV was
found to be 0.7 nb. Within most of the available theoretical models, this
corresponds to an upper limit on the $\Theta^+$ width, $\Gamma_{\Theta^{+}}$,

preheating in the simplest model of chaotic inflation. While the earlier regime
of parametric resonant particle production and the later turbulent regime of
interacting fields evolving towards equilibrium are well identified and
understood, the short intermediate stage of violent nonlinear dynamics remains
less explored. Lattice simulations of fully nonlinear preheating dynamics show
specific features of this intermediate stage: occupation numbers of the scalar
particles are peaked, scalar fields become significantly non-gaussian and the
field dynamics become chaotic and irreversible. Visualization of the field
dynamics in configuration space reveals that nonlinear interactions generate
non-gaussian inflaton inhomogeneities with very fast growing amplitudes. The
peaks of the inflaton inhomogeneities coincide with the peaks of the scalar
field(s) produced by parametric resonance. When the inflaton peaks reach their
maxima, they stop growing and begin to expand. The subsequent dynamics is
determined by expansion and superposition of the scalar waves originating from
the peaks. Multiple wave superposition results in phase mixing and turbulent
wave dynamics. Thus, the short intermediate stage is defined by the formation,
expansion and collision of bubble-like field inhomogeneities associated with
the peaks of the original gaussian field. This process is qualitatively similar
to the bubble-like inflaton fragmentation that occurs during tachyonic
preheating after hybrid or new inflation.

study the consequences of a possible $K^*(892)$-${\bar \kappa}$ molecular

using the data of $B(J/\psi\to X\pi^0)\cdot B(X\to K^+K^-)$, the branching
ratios $B(J/\psi\to X\pi^0)\cdot B(X\to \pi^+\pi^-)$ and $B(J/\psi\to

much larger branching ratio than the $X\to K^+K^-$ decay mode has. As a
consequence, this resonant structure should also be seen in the $J/\psi\to

beta-deformations of four-dimensional superconformal gauge theories. Using
Generalized Complex Geometry we show that these geometries are characterized by
a closed nowhere-vanishing vector field and a modified fundamental form which
is also closed. The vector field encodes the information about the
superpotential and the type of deformation - mass or beta respectively. We also
show that the Pilch-Warner solution dual to a mass-deformation of N =4 Super
Yang-Mills and the Lunin-Maldacena beta-deformation of the same background fall
in our class of solutions.

practical calculations is the dependence of the Fock stereographic projection
on energy. This is due to the fact that the wave functions of the states with
different energies are proportional to the hyperspherical harmonics (HSH)
corresponding to different points on the hypersphere. Thus, the calculation of
the matrix elements reduces to the problem of re-expanding HSH in terms of HSH
depending on different points on the hypersphere. We solve this problem by
applying the technique of multipole expansions for four-dimensional HSH. As a
result, we obtain the multipole expansions whose coefficients are the matrix
elements of the boost operator taken between hydrogen wave functions (i.e.
hydrogen form-factors). The explicit expressions for those coefficients are
derived. It is shown that the hydrogen matrix elements can be presented as
derivatives of an elementary function. Such an operator representation is
convenient for the derivation of recurrency relations connecting matrix
elements between states corresponding to different values of the quantum
numbers $n$ and $l$.

finite set of elements in G, introduced by the second author, which is a
complete invariant of the conjugacy class of X in G. A fundamental question, if
one wishes to find bounds on the size of USS(X), is to understand its
structure. In this paper we introduce two new operations on elements of USS(X),
called `partial cycling' and `partial twisted decycling', and prove that if Y
and Z belong to USS(X), then Y and Z are related by sequences of partial
cyclings and partial twisted decyclings. These operations are a concrete way to
understand the minimal simple elements which result from the convexity theorem
in the mentioned paper by the second author. Using partial cycling and partial
twisted decycling, we investigate the structure of a directed graph \Gamma_X
which is determined by USS(X), and show that \Gamma_X can be decomposed into
`black' and `grey' subgraphs. There are applications which relate to the
program, outlined in the first paper in this series, for finding a polynomial
solution to the CDP/CSP in the case of braids. A different application is to
give a new algorithm for solving the CDP/CSP in Garside groups which is faster
than all other known algorithms, even though its theoretical complexity is the

  In this paper, we study the intrinsic ultracontractivity for non-symmetric
discontinuous Levy processes. We prove that, for a large class of non-symmetric
discontinuous Levy processes X such that the Lebesgue measure is absolutely
continuous with respect to the Levy measure of X, the semigroup of X^D in any

non-symmetric stable process X, the semigroup of X^D is intrinsic
ultracontractive for any bounded set D. Using the intrinsic ultracontractivity,
we show that the parabolic boundary Harnack principle is true for those
processes. Moreover, we get that the supremum of the expected conditional
lifetimes in a bounded open set is finite. We also have results of the same
nature when the Levy measure is compactly supported.

believed that the study of the prequantum dynamics will give a better

statistical properties. We consider a linear hyperbolic map M in SL(2,Z) which
generates a chaotic dynamics on the torus. This dynamics is lifted on a
prequantum fiber bundle. This gives a unitary prequantum (partially hyperbolic)

from long time behaviour of prequantum dynamics. We present trace formulas, and

tomography (ERT) data. ERT is a typical example of ill-posed problem.
Regularization is the most common way to face this kind of problems; it
basically consists in using a priori information about targets to reduce the
ambiguity and the instability of the solution. By using the minimum gradient
support (MGS) stabilizing functional, we introduce the following geometrical
prior information in the reconstruction process: anomalies have sharp
boundaries. The presented work is embedded in a project (L.A.R.A.) which aims
at the estimation of hydrogeological properties from geophysical
investigations. L.A.R.A. facilities include a simulation tank (4 m x 8 m x 1.35
m); 160 electrodes are located all around the tank and used for 3-D ERT.
Because of the large number of electrodes and their dimensions, it is important
to model their effect in order to correctly evaluate the electrical system
response. The forward modelling in the presented algorithm is based on the
so-called complete electrode model that takes into account the presence of the
electrodes and their contact impedances. In this paper, we compare the results
obtained with different regularizing functionals applied on a synthetic model.

processes occurring inan electron beam with a virtual cathode, as well as on
the processes whereby the structures form in the beamand interact with each
other, is studied by means of two-dimensional numerical simulations based on
solving a self-consistent set of Vlasov-Maxwell equations. It is shown that, as
the focusing magnetic field is decreased,the dynamics of an electron beam with
a virtual cathode becomes more complicated due to the formation andinteraction
of spatio-temporal longitudinal and transverse structures in the interaction
region of a vircator. The optimum efficiency of the interaction of an electron
beam with the electromagnetic field of the vircator isachieved at a
comparatively weak external magnetic field and is determined by the
fundamentally two-dimensional nature of the motion of the beam electrons near
the virtual cathode.

drift in subdivided populations, motivated by a model of the cultural
evolutionary process of language change that is described by the same
mathematics as the biological process. We focus on the growth of fixation times
with the number of subpopulations, and variation of fixation probabilities and
times with initial distributions of mutants. A general formula for the fixation
probability for arbitrary initial condition is derived by extending a duality
relation between forwards- and backwards-time properties of the model from a
panmictic to a subdivided population. From this we obtain new formulae,
formally exact in the limit of extremely weak migration, for the mean fixation
time from an arbitrary initial condition for Wright's island model, presenting
two cases as examples. For more general models of population subdivision,
formulae are introduced for an arbitrary number of mutants that are randomly
located, and a single mutant whose position is known. These formulae contain
parameters that typically have to be obtained numerically, a procedure we
follow for two contrasting clustered models. These data suggest that variation
of fixation time with the initial condition is slight, but depends strongly on
the nature of subdivision. In particular, we demonstrate conditions under which
the fixation time remains finite even in the limit of an infinite number of
demes. In many cases - except this last where fixation in a finite time is seen
- the time to fixation is shown to be in precise agreement with predictions
from formulae for the asymptotic effective population size.

to study the equilibrium thermodynamics of many-body systems. Choosing small
trial moves, the trajectories obtained applying this algorithm agree with those
obtained by Langevin's dynamics. Applying this procedure to a simplified
protein model, it is possible to show that setting a threshold of 1 degree on
the movement of the dihedrals of the protein backbone in a single Monte Carlo
step, the mean quantities associated with the off-equilibrium dynamics (e.g.,
energy, RMSD, etc.) are well reproduced, while the good description of higher
moments requires smaller moves. An important result is that the time duration
of a Monte Carlo step depends linearly on the temperature, something which
should be accounted for when doing simulations at different temperatures.

of feedback. We show their relations and the connection with the onset of
