lensed images of the z = 1.547 quasar SDSS J1650+4251, in order to estimate the
Hubble constant H_0.
  Methods: Our measurement is based on R-band light curves with 57 epochs
obtained at Maidanak Observatory, in Uzbekistan, from May 2004 to September
2005. The photometry is performed using simultaneous deconvolution of the data,
which provides the individual light curves of the otherwise blended quasar
images. The time delay is determined from the light curves using two very
different numerical techniques, i.e., polynomial fitting and direct
cross-correlation. The time delay is converted into H_0 following analytical
modeling of the potential well.
  Results: Our best estimate of the time delay is Dt = 49.5 +/- 1.9 days, i.e.,
we reach a 3.8% accuracy. The R-band flux ratio between the quasar images,
corrected for the time delay and for slow microlensing, is F_A /F_B = 6.2 +/-
5%.
  Conclusions: The accuracy reached on the time delay allows us to discriminate
well between families of lens models. As for most other multiply imaged
quasars, only models of the lensing galaxy that have a de Vaucouleurs mass
profile plus external shear give a Hubble constant compatible with the current
most popular value (H_0 = 72 +/- 8 km s-1 Mpc-1). A more realistic singular
isothermal sphere model plus external shear gives H_0 = 51.7 +4.0 -3.0 km s-1
Mpc-1.

April-May 2005 when the source was 10 to 30 times brighter than previously
observed. We found 3C 454.3 to be very bright and variable at all frequencies
covered by our instrumentation. The broad-band Spectral Energy Distribution
(SED) shows the usual two-bump shape (in nu-nu f(nu) space) with the Infra-red,
optical and UV data sampling the declining part of the synchrotron emission
that, even during this extremely large outburst, had its maximum in the
far-infrared. The X-ray spectral data from the XRT and BAT instruments are flat
and due to inverse Compton emission. The remarkable SED observed implies that
at the time of the Swift pointings 3C 454.3 was one of the brightest objects in
the extragalactic sky with a gamma-ray emission similar or brighter than that
of 3C 279 when observed in a high state by EGRET. Time variability in the
optical-UV flux is very different from that in the X-ray data: while the first
component varied by about a factor two within a single exposure, but remained
approximately constant between different observations, the inverse Compton
component did not vary on short time-scales but changed by more than a factor
of 3 between observations separated by a few days. This different dynamical
behaviour illustrates the need to collect simultaneous multi-frequency data
over a wide range of time-scales to fully constrain physical parameters in
blazars.

steepening or plateau phase in >~ 30% of GRBs in the Swift sample. Treating the
standard relativistic blastwave model in a uniform circumburst medium, it is
shown that if GRBs accelerate ultra-high energy cosmic rays through a Fermi
mechanism, then the hadronic component can be rapidly depleted by means of
photopion processes on time scales ~100 - 10^4 s after the GRB explosion. While
discharging the hadronic energy in the form of ultra-high energy cosmic ray
neutrals and escaping cosmic-ray ions, the blast wave goes through a strongly
radiative phase, causing the steep declines observed with Swift. Following the
discharge, the blast wave recovers its adiabatic behavior, forming the observed
plateaus or slow declines. These effects are illustrated by calculations of
model bolometric light curves. The results show that steep X-ray declines and
plateau features occur when GRB sources take place in rather dense media, with
n >~ 100 cc out to >~ 10^17 cm.

for identifying high redshift radio galaxy (HzRG) candidates, a large sample of
bright (S_{1.4GHz} > 100mJy) radio sources from the FIRST survey having no
optical counterpart in the SDSS is compiled. K-band imaging with the FLAMINGOS
instrument on the 4-meter telescope at Kitt Peak for 96 such candidates allows
preliminary identification of HzRG candidates through the well-known K-z
relation. Of the initial candidates, we identify 70 with magnitudes brighter
than K \approx 19.5, and compute limiting magnitudes for the remainder.
Assigning redshifts based on the K-z Hubble diagram gives a mean redshift for
our sample of z=2.5 and a median redshift of z=2.0. This selection is also
sensitive to a previously unseen population of anomalously red radio galaxies
(r-K > 6.5-7), which may indicate significant obscuration at moderate
redshifts. These obscured objects can be used to test the completeness of QSO
surveys to the effects of reddenning. More than ten percent of our sample falls
into this category, which may represent a sizable radio loud population missing
from current optically selected AGN samples. We additionally identify 479
bright Extremely Red Objects (EROs) in the fields surrounding our HzRG
candidates, to a magnitude of K=17.5, within a non-contiguous area of 2.38
square degrees. This constitutes a small overdensity of EROs surrounding the
radio galaxy candidates over random fields, and we see possible evidence for a
physical association of the EROs with the radio galaxies. However, examining
the clustering of all K < 19.0 galaxies around the radio targets reveals no
evidence of a global galaxy excess.

quasar absorption systems and ~250,000 Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs), both
selected from the SDSS DR3. The MgII systems have rest-frame equivalent widths
W_r(2796)>=0.3A. From the ratio of the MgII-LRG cross-correlation to the
LRG-LRG auto-correlation, we find that the bias ratio between MgII absorbers
and LRGs is 0.65+/-0.08, which implies that the absorber host-galaxies have a
mean halo-mass 20-40 times smaller than that of the LRGs; the MgII absorbers
have halos of mean mass <logM_h(M_sol)>=11.94+/-0.31(stat)+/-0.25(sys). We
demonstrate that this statistical technique, which does not require any
spectroscopic follow-up, does not suffer from contaminants such as stars or
foreground and background galaxies. Finally, we find that the absorber
halo-mass is anti-correlated with the equivalent width. If MgII absorbers were
virialized in galaxy halos a positive M_h-W_r correlation would have been
observed since W_r(2796) is a direct measure of the velocity spread of the MgII
sub-components. Thus, our results demonstrate that the individual clouds of a
MgII system are not virialized in the gaseous halos of the host-galaxies. We
review past results in the literature on the statistics of MgII absorbers and
find that they too require an M_h-W_r anti-correlation. When combined with
measurements of the equivalent width distribution, the M_h-W_r anti-correlation
naturally explains why absorbers with W_r(2796)>=2A are not seen at large
impact parameters. We interpret the M_h-W_r anti-correlation within the
starburst scenario where strong MgII absorbers are produced by
supernovae-driven winds.

fraction of X-ray obscured AGNs in the local universe significantly decreases
with intrinsic luminosity. In this letter we point out that two correction have
to be made to the samples: 1) radio loud AGNs have to be excluded since their
X-ray emission might be dominated by the jet component; 2) Compton thick
sources have to be excluded too since their hard X-ray and soft gamma ray
emission are also strongly attenuated by Compton scattering. The soft gamma-ray
selected AGN samples obtained by SWIFT and INTEGRAL provide the best
opportunity to study the fraction of obscured AGN in the local universe in the
least biased way. We choose these samples to check if the corrections could
alter the above result on the fraction of obscured AGNs. We find that before
the corrections both samples show significant anti-correlation between L_X and
N_H, indicating obvious decrease in the fraction of obscured AGNs with
luminosity. However, after the corrections, we find only marginal evidence of
anti-correlation (at 98% confidence level) in the SWIFT sample, and no evidence
at all in the INTEGRAL sample which consists of comparable number of objects.
We conclude that current samples only show a marginal decrease in the fraction
of obscured AGNs in the local universe, and much larger samples are required to
reach a more robust conclusion.

very faint end of the luminosity function of AGN is shallower than the slope
observed at lower redshifts, beta <1.6, at the 98% confidence level. In fact,
we find marginal evidence that the luminosity function rises with luminosity,
corresponding to a powerlaw slope beta <0, at magnitudes fainter than M_B~-20
(75% confidence level). These results suggest either that accretion onto lower
mass black holes is less efficient than onto their more massive counterparts,
or that the number of black holes powering AGN with M_B >-20 is lower than
expected from the M_BH-sigma relation by one-two orders of magnitude.
Extrapolating from reverberation-mapping studies suggests that these black
holes would have M_BH=10^6-10^7 Msun. To facilitate the identification of AGN
among observed Lya emitters, we derive observational properties of faint AGN in
the Lya line, as well as in the X-ray and optical bands.

  Three new discoveries include: (1) A metal-poor GC color-magnitude trend. (2)
Confirmation that the metal-rich GCs are ~17% smaller than the metal-poor ones
for small projected galactocentric radii (less than ~2 arcmin). However, the
median half-light radii of the two subpopulations become identical at ~3 arcmin
from the center. This is most easily explained if the size difference is the
result of projection effects. (3) The brightest (M_V < -9.0) members of the GC

increasing luminosity. Evidence is presented that supports an intrinsic origin
for this feature rather than a being result from accreted dwarf elliptical
nuclei. In addition, the metal-rich GCs show a shallower positive

inconsistent with each other, with AGASA seeing an unabated continuation of the
energy spectrum even at energies beyond the GZK cutoff energy at $10^{19.6}$

unknown origin of these highly energetic particles, it is crucial that the
extent to which these measurements disagree be well understood. Here we
evaluate the consistency of the two measurements for the first time with a
model-independent method that accounts for the large statistical and systematic

separate parent source hypothesis to a single parent source hypothesis.
Application to the data shows that the two-parent hypothesis is disfavored. We
expand the method to allow comparisons between an experimental flux and that

Incorporation of faster modes such as crankshaft and reptation movements along
with the relatively slow kink-jump dynamics seems crucial in relaxing the
interface width. As the continuously released polymer chains are driven (via
segmental movements) and deposited, the interface width $W$ grows with the
number of time steps $t$, $W \propto t^{\beta},$ ($\beta \sim 0.4$--$0.8)$,
which is followed by its saturation to a steady-state value $W_s$. Stopping the
release of additional chains after saturation while continuing the segmental
movements relaxes the saturated width to an equilibrium value ($W_s \to W_r$).
Scaling of the relaxed interface width $W_r$ with the driving field $E$, $W_r
\propto E^{-1/2}$ remains similar to that of the steady-state $W_s$ width. In
contrast to monotonic increase of the steady-state width $W_s$, the relaxed
interface width $W_r$ is found to decay (possibly as a stretched exponential)

energies around 3 eV increases the magnetization through a reduction of the
canting angle of the manganese core spins for an average electron density on
TCNE less than one. When photoexciting with a smaller energy, divalent TCNE
molecules are formed. The delocalization of the excited electron causes a local
spin flip of a manganese core spin.

provide an exact treatment of the molecular field depletion and s-wave

major source of atom-atom decorrelation is atom-atom recombination which
produces molecules outside the initially occupied condensate mode. The unwanted
molecules are formed from dissociated atom pairs with non-opposite momenta. The
net effect of this process -- which becomes increasingly significant for
dissociation durations corresponding to more than about 40% conversion -- is to
reduce the atom-atom correlations. In addition, for nonuniform systems we find
that mode-mixing due to inhomogeneity can result in further degradation of the
correlation signal. We characterize the correlation strength via the degree of
squeezing of particle number-difference fluctuations in a certain
momentum-space volume and show that the correlation strength can be increased
if the signals are binned into larger counting volumes.

self-organization increases with decreasing bandwidth. In the valence band,
spectral weight of the Mn 3$d$ $e_g$ electrons in PCMO was transferred from

discussed in a spatially isotropic three-dimensional superconductor under a
magnetic field. For this system, Shimahara recently showed that within the

the FF state, we show that even if the pairing interaction is weak, the shift
of the chemical potential from the Fermi energy due to the fluctuations is
crucial near the critical magnetic field of the FF state obtained within the
mean-field theory.

centers of the theory. The S-matrix of this representation is a simple phase
factor, involving the phase shifts of the zero energy forward momentum

  A PF dynamical theory is developed and applied to the one-electron removal

Coloumb repulsion and electronic density, and in the limit of zero

between the bulk and surface terms in a general class of action functionals and
provides a deeper insight into several aspects of classical gravity which have
no explanation in the conventional approach. After highlighting a series of
unresolved issues in the conventional approach to gravity, I show that (i)
principle of equivalence, (ii) general covariance and (iii)a reasonable
condition on the variation of the action functional, suggest a generic
Lagrangian for semiclassical gravity of the form $L=Q_a^{bcd}R^a_{bcd}$ with
$\nabla_b Q_a^{bcd}=0$. The expansion of $Q_a^{bcd}$ in terms of the
derivatives of the metric tensor determines the structure of the theory
uniquely. The zeroth order term gives the Einstein-Hilbert action and the first
order correction is given by the Gauss-Bonnet action. Any such Lagrangian can
be decomposed into a surface and bulk terms which are related holographically.
The equations of motion can be obtained purely from a surface term in the
gravity sector. Hence the field equations are invariant under the
transformation $T_{ab} \to T_{ab} + \lambda g_{ab}$ and gravity does not
respond to the changes in the bulk vacuum energy density. The cosmological
constant arises as an integration constant in this approach. The implications
are discussed.

introduction on the field of extra dimensions. The main motivation for extra
dimensions relies on the more fundamental string theories that predict ten (or
eleven) space-time dimensions. Extra dimensions must be compactified and there
appear branes where gauge and/or gravity propagates. Compactification relates
string constants (string scale and string coupling) with four-dimensional
constants (Planck scale and gauge coupling). Only gravity can propagate in
dimensions transverse to the brane. They can be detected either by
gravitational (table-top) or by collider experiments where Kaluza-Klein
graviton production appears as missing energy. Transverse dimensions can be as
large as the sub-millimeter. Ordinary matter can also propagate in dimensions
parallel to the brane. It can give rise to bumps in the dilepton invariant mass
in hadron colliders or contribute by indirect effects to the electroweak
observables. Longitudinal dimensions can be probed at LHC up to a scale of 6.7
TeV (9 TeV) for one (two) extra dimension(s). Extra dimensions also give rise
to new theoretical ideas related to supersymmetry and electroweak breaking.

introduce the Polonyi model as a simple hidden sector. Due to the warped
metric, the effective cutoff scale on the IR brane is ``warped down'', so that
the gravity mediation occurs at a low scale. As a result, the gravitino is
naturally the lightest superpartner (LSP) and contact interactions between the
hidden and the visible sector fields become stronger. We address
phenomenologies for various IR cutoff scales. In particular, we investigate
collider phenomenology involving a scalar field (Polonyi field) in the hidden
sector for the case with the IR cutoff around 10 TeV. We find a possibility
that the hidden sector scalar can be produced at the LHC and the International
Linear Collider (ILC). Interestingly, the scalar behaves like the Higgs boson
of the standard model in the production process, while its decay process is
quite different and, once produced, it will provide us with a very clean
signature. The hidden sector may be no longer hidden.

Spinors, namely, living in d(=1+13)-dimensional space, manifest in the observed
d(=1+3) space all the known charges of quarks and leptons, while a part of the
starting Lagrange density in d(=1+13) transforms the right handed quarks and
leptons into the left handed ones, manifesting a mass term in $d=1+3$. Since a
spinor carries two kinds of spins and interacts accordingly with two kinds of
the spin connection fields, the approach predicts families and the
corresponding Yukawa couplings. In the previous paper the appearance of
families of quarks and leptons within this approach was investigated and the
explicit expressions for the corresponding Yukawa couplings, following from the

boundary conditions correspond to deformations of the dual field theory by
multi-trace operators. Here we extend this discussion to the case of vector
gauge fields in the bulk spacetime using the results of Ishibashi and Wald
[hep-th/0402184]. As in the context of scalar fields, general boundary
conditions for vector fields involve multi-trace deformations which lead to
renormalization-group flows. Such flows originate in ultra-violet CFTs which
give new gauge/gravity dualities. At least for AdS4/CFT3, the dual of the bulk
photon appears to be a propagating gauge field instead of the usual R-charge
current. Applying similar reasoning to tensor fields suggests the existence of

construct the Fock space of a massive free scalar field.
  In this approach, the vacuum is the unique dS invariant state. The quantum
field is a posteriori defined by an operator subject to covariant
transformations under the dS isometry group. This insures that it obeys
canonical commutation relations, up to an overall factor which should not
vanish as it fixes the value of hbar. However, contrary to what is obtained for
the Poincare group, the covariance condition leaves an arbitrariness in the
definition of the field. This arbitrariness allows to recover the amplitudes
governing spontaneous pair creation processes, as well as the class of alpha
vacua obtained in the usual field theoretical approach. The two approaches can
be formally related by introducing a squeezing operator which acts on the state
in the field theoretical description and on the operator in the present
treatment. The choice of the different dS invariant schemes (different alpha
vacua) is here posed in very simple terms: it is related to a first order
differential equation which is singular on the horizon and whose general
solution is therefore characterized by the amplitude on either side of the
horizon. Our algebraic approach offers a new method to define quantum field
theory on some deformations of dS space.

mapping of such sequences $d\mapsto s(d)\in\Gamma_X$ with the following
property: If s(d) is not 0, then d is not the diagonal of any such operator A.

naturally the structure of twisted Hopf P-algebra. Many properties of classical
Hopf algebraic structures are then shown to be encapsulated in the twisted Hopf
algebraic structure of the corresponding Hopf operad. In particular, various
classical theorems of Lie theory relating Lie polynomials to words (i.e.

invariant under Reidemeister moves. The terms of this chain complex are modules
of a suitable algebra A such that there is one action of A or A^op for every
boundary point of the tangle. We give examples of such algebras A for which our
tangle homology theory reduces to the link homology theories of Khovanov, Lee,

condition, Khovanov's graded theory can only be extended to tangles if the
underlying field has finite characteristic. In all cases in which the algebra A
is strongly separable, i.e. for Bar-Natan's theory in any characteristic and
for Lee's theory in characteristic other than 2, we also provide the required
algebraic operation for the composition of oriented tangles. Just as Khovanov's
theory for links can be recovered from Lee's or Bar-Natan's by a suitable
spectral sequence, we provide a spectral sequence in order to compute our
tangle extension of Khovanov's theory from that of Bar-Natan's or Lee's theory.

strong enough to recover characteristic p Khovanov homology for links.

consider an axion contribution to chaotic inflation(which may have a
temperature dependence) which partly fades out up to the point of chaotic
inflation being matched to a Randall-Sundrum effective potential. If we reject
an explicitly axion mass drop off to infinitesimal values at high temperatures,
we may use the Bogomolnyi inequality to rescale and re set initial conditions
for the chaotic inflationary potential. One of the potential systems embedded
in the Randall-Sundrum brane world is a model with a phase transition bridge
from a tilted wasboard potiential to the chaotic inflationary model pioneered
by Guth which is congruent with the slow roll criteria. If, as written up
earlier, the axion wall contribution is due to di-quarks,this is equivalent to
tying in baryogenesis to the formation of chaotic inflation initial conditions,

electron temperature $T_e$. Recent work has shown that accurate atomic data,
such as electron impact excitation rates, is very important for reliable
determination of the electron density of laboratory and astrophysical plasmas.
Present work indicates that the maximum discrepancy of line ratios introduced
from different atomic data calculated with distorted wave and R-matrix
approximations, is up to 18% in the range of $n_e=10^{9-13}$cm$^{-3}$. By
comparison of these line ratios with experiment results carried out in electron
beam ion trap (EBIT-II), electron density of the laboratory plasma is
diagnosed, and a consistent result is obtained from $R_1$, $R_2$ and $R_3$. Our
result is in agreement with that diagnosed by Chen et al using triplet of N VI.
A relative higher diagnosed electron density from $R_2$ is due to its weak
sensitivity to electron temperature. A better consistency at lower $T_e$
indicates that temperature of the laboratory plasma is lower than
log$T_e$(K)=6.5. Comparison between the measured and theoretical ratios reveals
that 32.014~\AA line is weakly blended by lines from other Ar ions, while
30.344~\AA line is strongly contaminated.

stable Taylor-Couette flow with a helical external magnetic field in the
inductionless approximation defined by a zero magnetic Prandtl number
($\Pm=0)$. This leads to a considerable simplification of the problem
eventually containing only hydrodynamic variables. First, we point out that the
energy of any perturbation growing in the presence of magnetic field has to
grow faster without the field. This is a paradox because the base flow is
stable without the magnetic while it is unstable in the presence of a helical
magnetic field without being modified by the latter as it has been found
recently by Hollerbach and Rudiger [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 124501 (2005)]. We
revisit this problem by using a Chebyshev collocation method to calculate the
eigenvalue spectrum of the linearized problem. In this way, we confirm that MRI
with helical magnetic field indeed works in the inductionless limit where the
destabilization effect appears as an effective shift of the Rayleigh line.
Second, we integrate the linearized equations in time to study the transient
behavior of small amplitude perturbations, thus showing that the energy
arguments are correct as well. However, there is no real contradiction between
both facts. The linear stability theory predicts the asymptotic development of
an arbitrary small-amplitude perturbation, while the energy stability theory
yields the instant growth rate of any particular perturbation, but it does not
account for the evolution of this perturbation.

  prediction of osteotomy size in proptosis reduction",,"Clinical Biomechanics 20 (9) (2005) 900-905",,,"physics.med-ph",,"  BACKGROUND: Proptosis is characterized by a protrusion of the eyeball due to
an increase of the orbital tissue volume. To recover a normal eyeball
positioning, the most frequent surgical technique consists in the osteotomy of
orbital walls combined with the manual loading on the eyeball. Only a rough
clinical rule is currently available for the surgeons but it is useless for
this technique. The first biomechanical model dealing with proptosis reduction,
validated in one patient, has been previously proposed by the authors. METHODS:
This paper proposes a rule improving the pre-operative planning of the
osteotomy size in proptosis reduction. Patient-related poroelastic FE models
combined with sensitivity studies were used to propose two clinical rules to
improve the pre-operative planning of proptosis reduction. This poroelastic
model was run on 12 patients. Sensitivity studies permitted to establish
relationships between the osteotoemy size, the patient-related orbital volume,
the decompressed tissue volume and the eyeball backward displacement. FINDINGS:
The eyeball displacement and the osteotomy size were non-linearly related: an
exponential rule has been proposed. The patient-related orbital volume showed a
significant influence: a bi-quadratic analytical equation liking the osteotomy
size, the orbital volume and the targeted eyeball protrusion has been
established. INTERPRETATION: Two process rules derived from patient-related
biomechanical FE models have been proposed for the proptosis reduction
planning. The implementation of the process rules into a clinical setting is
easy since only a sagittal radiography is required. The osteotomy size can be
monitored using optical guided instruments.

constants that define the frequency of small-amplitude oscillations. For static
stability, the spring constants must be positive. Dynamic instabilities are
characterized by critical ac frequencies that, when exceeded, may result either
in a spin-up or oscillations with increasing amplitude. We found that the
critical frequencies increase with the nonuniformity of the field. We show that
for a spherically harmonic field, the critical frequency for the spin-up

the oscillatory instability in a field of degree $l+1$.

estimation based on continuous weak measurement in the presence of a controlled
dynamical evolution. Our experiment uses optically probed atomic spins as a
testbed, and successfully reconstructs a range of trial states with fidelities
of ~90%. The procedure holds promise as a practical diagnostic tool for the
study of complex quantum dynamics, the testing of quantum hardware, and as a
starting point for new types of quantum feedback control.

B74 (2006) 153309","10.1103/PhysRevB.74.153309",,"quant-ph astro-ph cond-mat.mes-hall",,"  We report on a study of complementarity in a two-terminal ""closed-loop""
Aharonov-Bohm interferometer. In this interferometer, the simple picture of
two-path interference cannot be applied. We introduce a nearby quantum point
contact to detect the electron in a quantum dot inserted in the interferometer.
We found that charge detection reduces but does not completely suppress the
interference even in the limit of perfect detection. We attribute this
phenomenon to the unique nature of the closed-loop interferometer. That is, the
closed-loop interferometer cannot be simply regarded as a two-path
interferometer because of multiple reflections of electrons. As a result, there
exist indistinguishable paths of the electron in the interferometer and the
interference survives even in the limit of perfect charge detection. This
implies that charge detection is not equivalent to path detection in a
closed-loop interferometer. We also discuss the phase rigidity of the
transmission probability for a two-terminal conductor in the presence of a
detector.

optical quantum computing scheme and plays an essential role in many protocols
in quantum information. Indistinguishability is what leads to the effect of
quantum interference. Optical interferometers such as Michaelson interferometer
provide a measure for second-order coherence at one-photon level and
Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer was widely employed to describe two-photon
entanglement and indistinguishability. However, there is not an effective way
for a system of more than two photons. Recently, a new interferometric scheme
was proposed to quantify the degree of multi-photon distinguishability. Here we
report an experiment to implement the scheme for three-photon case. We are able
to generate three photons with different degrees of temporal distinguishability
and demonstrate how to characterize them by the visibility of three-photon
interference. This method of quantitative description of multi-photon
indistinguishability will have practical implications in the implementation of
quantum information protocols.

that a more general source state (like non-maximally entangled state) cannot
straightforwardly account for. We attempt to explain these anomalies by taking
account of the relative efficiencies of the four channels. For this purpose, we
use the fair sampling assumption, and assume explicitly that the detection
efficiencies for the pairs of entangled photons can be written as a product of
the two corresponding detection efficiencies for the single photons. We show
that this explicit use of fair sampling cannot be maintained to be a reasonable
assumption as it leads to an apparent violation of the no-signalling principle.
