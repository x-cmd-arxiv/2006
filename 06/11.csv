so-called Hardness Ratio, which compares the number of counts observed in
different passbands. The hardness ratio is especially useful to distinguish
between and categorize weak sources as a proxy for detailed spectral fitting.
However, in this regime classical methods of error propagation fail, and the
estimates of spectral hardness become unreliable. Here we develop a rigorous
statistical treatment of hardness ratios that properly deals with detected
photons as independent Poisson random variables and correctly deals with the
non-Gaussian nature of the error propagation. The method is Bayesian in nature,
and thus can be generalized to carry out a multitude of
source-population--based analyses. We verify our method with simulation
studies, and compare it with the classical method. We apply this method to real
world examples, such as the identification of candidate quiescent Low-mass
X-ray binaries in globular clusters, and tracking the time evolution of a flare
on a low-mass star.

transition in an ultracold gas of fermionic atoms, by generalizing the BCS
theory of superconductivity to the case when the two species that pair have
different densities and the ground state may spontaneously break one or more
symmetries.
  In a second part, we have studied the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate
whose spin degree of freedom is free to evolve inside a quasi-onedimensional
optical trap. We have used a mean-field formulation to address both the zero
temperature case and the finite temperature one.
  Finally, we have performed a careful study of the ground state and the line

posting a search query. PageRank is based in part on two simple common sense
concepts: (i)A page is important if many important pages include links to it.
(ii)A page containing many links has reduced impact on the importance of the
pages it links to. In this paper we focus on asynchronous iterative schemes to
compute PageRank over large sets of Web pages. The elimination of the
synchronizing phases is expected to be advantageous on heterogeneous platforms.

just to store a small percentage of the Web (the already crawled); distributed
memory machines are necessary for such computations. The present research is

offer many occasions for computations of unprecedent dimensionality that would

discuss how several existing results about NLS can be placed in this

applications, we show that several classes of links, including semiadequate
links and Whitehead doubles of semiadequate knots, have non-trivial Jones
polynomial. We also prove that there are infinitely many positive knots with no
positive minimal crossing diagrams. Some relations to the twist number of a
link, Mahler measure and the hyperbolic volume are given, for example explicit
upper bounds on the volume for Montesinos and 3-braid links in terms of their

vertex from a given starting vertex. The hitting time for a classical random
walk on a connected graph will always be finite. We show that, by contrast,
quantum walks can have infinite hitting times for some initial states. We seek
criteria to determine if a given walk on a graph will have infinite hitting
times, and find a sufficient condition, which for discrete time quantum walks
is that the degeneracy of the evolution operator be greater than the degree of
the graph. The set of initial states which give an infinite hitting time form a
subspace. The phenomenon of infinite hitting times is in general a consequence
of the symmetry of the graph and its automorphism group. Using the irreducible
representations of the automorphism group, we derive conditions such that
quantum walks defined on this graph must have infinite hitting times for some
initial states. In the case of the discrete walk, if this condition is
satisfied the walk will have infinite hitting times for any choice of a coin
operator, and we give a class of graphs with infinite hitting times for any
choice of coin. Hitting times are not very well-defined for continuous time
quantum walks, but we show that the idea of infinite hitting-time walks
naturally extends to the continuous time case as well.
