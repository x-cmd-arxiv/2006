spectra, blue continua, and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images showing them to
be unresolved sources with no host-galaxy obscuration. To check for possible
obscuration on scales smaller than that resolvable by HST, we obtained X-ray
observations using the Chandra X-ray Observatory. All four objects show
evidence of obscuration and therefore could have hidden BLRs. The picture that
emerges is of moderate to high, but not necessarily Compton-thick, obscuration
of the nucleus, with extra-nuclear soft emission extended on the
hundreds-of-parsecs scale that may originate in the narrow-line region. Since
the extended soft emission compensates, in part, for the nuclear soft emission
lost to absorption, both absorption and luminosity are likely to be severely
underestimated unless the X-ray spectrum is of sufficient quality to
distinguish the two components. This is of special concern where the source is
too faint to produce a large number of counts, or where the source is too far
away to resolve the extended soft X-ray emitting region.

prevents the escape of most radiation. In this case, collapse is counteracted
by rising internal pressure and black hole singularities don't occur. Unlike
black holes, these nuclei can have internal magnetic fields, and high-energy
plasma can escape along magnetic field lines closely aligned with the
gravitational field direction. This allows a different model of jets from
active galactic nuclei, where jets can arise without direct fueling by
accretion disks. It also offers a new basis for the tight correlation observed

kinematic and morphological results all confirm the picture in which the
nuclear ring in M100, considered typical, is fed by gas flowing in from the
disc under the action of the bar, is slowed down near a pair of resonances, and
forms significant amounts of massive stars. Detailed stellar population
modelling shows how the underlying bulge and disc were put in place a number of
Gyr ago, and that the nuclear ring has been forming stars since about 500~Myr
ago in a stable succession of bursts. This confirms that nuclear rings of this

proves that they are stable features of a galaxy rather than one-off starburst

distribution of point sources in the cluster, plus a 5' halo of extended

light that is inverse-Compton scattered by MeV electrons. Only 5% of the flux

confirmed case of a ""hybrid"" Type Ia/IIn supernova. Our early-phase photometry
of SN 2005gj shows that the interaction is much stronger than for the
prototype, SN 2002ic. Our first spectrum shows a hot continuum with broad and
narrow H-alpha emission. Later spectra, spanning over 4 months from outburst,
show clear Type Ia features combined with broad and narrow H-gamma, H-beta,
H-alpha and HeI 5876,7065 in emission. At higher resolution, P Cygni profiles
are apparent. Surprisingly, we also observe an inverted P Cygni profile for
[OIII] 5007. We find that the lightcurve and measured velocity of the unshocked
circumstellar material imply mass loss as recently as 8 years ago. The early
lightcurve is well-described by a flat radial density profile for the
circumstellar material. However, our decomposition of the spectra into Type Ia
and shock emission components allows for little obscuration of the supernova,
suggesting an aspherical or clumpy distribution for the circumstellar material.
We suggest that the emission line velocity profiles arise from electron
scattering rather than the kinematics of the shock. This is supported by the
inferred high densities, and the lack of evidence for evolution in the line
widths. Ground- and space-based photometry, and Keck spectroscopy, of the host
galaxy are used to ascertain that the host galaxy has low metallicity Z/Zsun <
0.3; (95% confidence) and that this galaxy is undergoing a significant star
formation event that began roughly 200+/-70 Myr ago. We discuss the
implications of these observations for progenitor models and cosmology using

many GRB line-profiles (e.g. GRB 050730, GRB 050820, GRB 051111) are comprised

may be characteristic of a sightline which penetrates both a high density
star-forming region and more distant, ambient ISM material. Our analysis
suggests that the majority of abundances reported in the literature are
systematically underestimates and that the reported errors are frequently
over-optimistic. Further, we demonstrate that one cannot even report precise
relative abundances with confidence. The implications are profound for our
current understanding on the metallicity, dust-to-gas ratio, and chemical
abundances of the ISM in GRB host galaxies. For example, we argue that all but
a few sightlines allow for the gas to have at least solar metallicity. Finally,
we suggests new approaches for constraining the abundances.

wide range of neutrino luminosity and mass accretion rate. We employ a
realistic EOS and neutrino-heating rates. More importantly, we take into
account the effect of convection phenomenologically. For each mass accretion
rate, we find the critical neutrino luminosity, above which there exists no
steady solution. These critical points are supposed to mark the onset of the
shock revival. As the neutrino luminosity increases for a given mass accretion
rate, there appears a convectively unstable region at some point before the
critical value is reached. We introduce a phenomenological energy flux by
convection so that the negative entropy gradient should be canceled out. We
find that the convection lowers the critical neutrino luminosity substantially.
We also consider the effect of the self-gravity. It is found that the
self-gravity is important only when the neutrino luminosity is high. The
critical luminosity, however, is little affected if the energy transport by

illustrate these effects considering an analytical time-dependent model of the

we have implemented an n-body simulator and we verify that the threshold mass

the statistical significance of the computed solutions. The application of
genetic algorithms in seeking solutions makes it possible to search through a
large parameter space. The mode identification is carried out by minimizing
chi-square, using the observed amplitude and phase across the line profile and
their modeled counterparts. Computations of the theoretical line profiles are
based on a stellar displacement field, which is described as superposition of
spherical harmonics and that includes the first order effects of the Coriolis

limitations. Our results show that whereas the azimuthal order m can be
unambiguously identified for low-order modes, the error of l is in the range of
pm 1. The value of m can be determined with higher precision than with other
spectroscopic mode identification methods. Improved values for the inclination
can be obtained from the analysis of non-axisymmetric pulsation modes. The new
method is ideally suited to intermediatley rotating Delta Scuti and Beta Cephei

brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). We show the extreme hierarchical nature of
these objects and discuss the limits of simple ways to capture their evolution.
In a model where cooling flows are suppressed at late times by AGN activity,
the stars of BCGs are formed very early (50 per cent at z~5, 80 per cent at
z~3) and in many small galaxies. The high star formation rates in these high-z
progenitors are fuelled by rapid cooling, not by merger-triggered starbursts.
We find that model BCGs assemble surprisingly late: half their final mass is
typically locked-up in a single galaxy after z~0.5. Because most of the
galaxies accreted onto BCGs have little gas content and red colours, late
mergers do not change the apparent age of BCGs. It is this accumulation of a
large number of old stellar populations -- driven mainly by the merging history
of the dark matter halo itself -- that yields the observed homogeneity of BCG
properties. In the second part of the paper, we discuss the evolution of BCGs
to high redshifts, from both observational and theoretical viewpoints. We show
that our model BCGs are in qualitative agreement with high-z observations. We
discuss the hierarchical link between high-z BCGs and their local
counter-parts. We show that high-z BCGs belong to the same population as the
massive end of local BCG progenitors, although they are not in general the same
galaxies. Similarly, high-z BCGs end-up as massive galaxies in the local
Universe, although only a fraction of them are actually BCGs of massive
clusters.

measure global trends with environment for both giant (M_r<-20 mag) and dwarf
(-19<M_r<-17.8 mag) subsamples using the luminosity-weighted mean stellar age
and H_alpha emission as independent measures of star-formation history. The
fraction of giant galaxies classed as old (t>7 Gyr) or passive (EW[H_alpha]<4
A) falls gradually from ~80% in the cluster cores to ~40% in field regions

the dwarf galaxy population shows a sharp transition at ~1 R_virial, from being
predominantly old/passive within the cluster, to outside where virtually all
galaxies are forming stars and old/passive galaxies are only found as
satellites to more massive galaxies. These results imply fundamental
differences in the evolution of giant and dwarf galaxies: whereas the
star-formation histories of giant galaxies are determined primarily by their
merger history, star-formation in dwarf galaxies is much more resilient to the
effects of major mergers. Instead dwarf galaxies become passive only once they
become satellites within a more massive halo, by losing their halo gas
reservoir to the host halo, or through other environment-related processes such
as galaxy harassment and/or ram-pressure stripping.

that the method by Reichart (2001) provides an inconsistent estimate of the

covered by the variability. We also show that, using the D'Agostini method, the
slope is consistent with that derived by us earlier and inconsistent with that

temperature ranges and consistent with each other, ensuring the spectroscopic
nature. Features common to all directions are: i) asymmetric behaviors of the
background conductance, which we attribute to the emerging coherent
heavy-fermion liquid; ii) energy scales (~1 meV) for conductance enhancement
due to Andreev reflection; iii) magnitudes of enhanced zero-bias conductance
(10 - 13 %). These values are an order of magnitude smaller than the predicted
value by the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) theory, but comparable to those for

However, it is found that extended BTK models considering the mismatch in Fermi
surface parameters do not account for our data completely, which we attribute
to the shift of spectral weight to low energy as well as to the suppressed
Andreev reflection. A qualitative comparison of the conductance spectra with
calculated curves shows a consistency with d$_{x^2-y^2}$-symmetry, providing

While the evolution of the band structure and density of states is smooth and

point of the fcc Brillouin zone, already soft at ambient pressure, becomes
unstable (in harmonic approximation) at a relative volume V/Vo=0.60 (P ~ 42

branches is not as strong, but extends over more regions of the Brillouin zone

function $\alpha^2F(\omega)$ shows a very strong increase with pressure of
coupling in the 2-7 meV range, with a steady increase also in the 7-20 meV

radically different low-temperature k(T) behaviors depending on whether their

contrast, Cp(T) above 4 K and the general structural properties are essentially
insensitive to carrier tuning. We analyze these combined results within the
framework of a Tunneling/Resonant/Rayleigh scatterings model, and conclude that
the evolution from crystalline to glasslike k(T) is accompanied by an increase
both in the effective density of tunnelling states and in the resonant
scattering level, while neither one of these contributions can solely account
for the observed changes in the full temperature range. This suggests that the
most relevant factor which determines crystalline or glasslike behavior is the
coupling strength between the guest vibrational modes and the frameworks with

analysed here in a Kondo lattice model with an inter-site random coupling

the Mattis model which represents an interpolation between ferromagnetism and a
highly disordered spin glass. Functional integral techniques with Grassmann
fields have been used to obtain the partition function. The static

solution of the problem is presented as a phase diagram giving $T/{J}$ {\it
versus} $J_K/J$ where $T$ is the temperature, $J_{K}$ and ${J}$ are the
strengths of the intrasite Kondo and the intersite random couplings,
respectively. If $J_K/{J}$ is small, when temperature is decreased, there is a
second order transition from a paramagnetic to a spin glass phase. For lower
$T/{J}$, a first order transition appears between the spin glass phase and a
region where there are Mattis states which are thermodynamically equivalent to
the ferromagnetism. For very low ${T/{J}}$, the Mattis states become stable. On
the other hand, it is found as solution a Kondo state for large $J_{K}/{J}$
values. These results can improve the theoretical description of the well known
experimental phase diagram of $CeNi_{1-x}Cu_{x}$.

created by every user with process accounting. Thus process accounting logs
have many potential uses, particularly the monitoring and forensic
investigation of security events. Previous work successfully leveraged the use
of process accounting logs to identify a difficult to detect and damaging
intrusion against high performance computing (HPC) clusters, masquerade
attacks, where intruders masquerade as legitimate users with purloined
authentication credentials. While masqueraders on HPC clusters were found to be
identifiable with a high accuracy (greater than 90%), this accuracy is still
not high enough for HPC production environments where greater than 99% accuracy
is needed.
  This paper incrementally advances the goal of more accurately identifying
masqueraders on HPC clusters by seeking to identify features within command
sets that distinguish masqueraders. To accomplish this goal, we created
NVision-PA, a software tool that produces text and graphic statistical
summaries describing input processing accounting logs. We report NVision-PA
results describing two different process accounting logs; one from Internet
usage and one from HPC cluster usage. These results identify the distinguishing
features of Internet users (as proxies for masqueraders) posing as clusters
users. This research is both a promising next step toward creating a real-time
masquerade detection sensor for production HPC clusters as well as providing
another tool for system administrators to use for statistically monitoring and
managing legitimate workloads (as indicated by command usage) in HPC

first method, the approximate performance of the system is calculated for each

performance (a common performance measure for e.g. MB-OFDM systems). The second
method assumes Rayleigh distributed frequency-domain subcarrier channel gains
and knowledge of their correlation matrix, and can be used to directly obtain
the average BER performance. Both methods are applicable to
convolutionally-coded interleaved multicarrier systems employing Quadrature

more critical when applying this technique to programming languages, mainly due
to the presence of complex data structures. One recent and promising approach
to deal with this problem is the construction of an abstract and correct
representation of the global program state allowing to match visited states
during program model exploration. In particular, one powerful method to
implement abstract matching is to fill the state vector with a minimal amount
of relevant variables for each program point. In this paper, we combine the
on-the-fly model-checking approach (incremental construction of the program
state space) and the static analysis method called influence analysis
(extraction of significant variables for each program point) in order to
automatically construct an abstract matching function. Firstly, we describe the
problem as an alternation-free value-based mu-calculus formula, whose validity
can be checked on the program model expressed as a labeled transition system
(LTS). Secondly, we translate the analysis into the local resolution of a
parameterised boolean equation system (PBES), whose representation enables a
more efficient construction of the resulting abstract matching function.
Finally, we show how our proposal may be elegantly integrated into CADP, a
generic framework for both the design and analysis of distributed systems and
the development of verification tools.

must also consider the possibility of enhanced gravitino production in such

Euclidean conformal field theory. The holographic correspondence (which is
different than Strominger's dS/CFT duality) relates the decay of
(3+1)-dimensional de Sitter space to a two-dimensional CFT. It is not
associated with pure de Sitter space, but rather with Coleman-De Luccia bubble
nucleation. Alternatively, it can be thought of as a holographic description of
the open, infinite, FRW cosmology that results from such a bubble. The
conjectured holographic representation is of a new type that combines
holography with the Wheeler-DeWitt formalism to produce a Wheeler-DeWitt theory
that lives on the spatial boundary of a k=-1 FRW cosmology. We also argue for a
more ambitious interpretation of the Wheeler-DeWitt CFT as a holographic dual
of the entire Landscape.

equivalent in the quantum theory to a commutative 2-dimensional U(N) gauge
field on a lattice with two plaquettes in the axial gauge A_1=0. This quantum
equivalence holds in the fuzzy sphere-weak coupling phase in the limit of
infinite mass of the scalar normal component of the gauge field. The doubling
of plaquettes is a natural consequence of the model and it is reminiscent of
the usual doubling of points in Connes standard model. In the continuum large N
limit the plaquette variable W approaches the identity 1_{2N} and as a
consequence the model reduces to a simple matrix model which can be easily
solved. We compute the one-plaquette critical point and show that it agrees
with the observed value \bar{\alpha}_*=3.35. We compute the quantum effective
potential and the specific heat for U(1) gauge field on the fuzzy sphere
S^2_{N} in the 1/N expansion using this one-plaquette model. In particular the
specific heat per one degree of freedom was found to be equal to 1 in the fuzzy
sphere-weak coupling phase of the gauge field which agrees with the observed
value 1 seen in Monte Carlo simulation. This value of 1 comes precisely because
we have 2 plaquettes approximating the NC U(1) gauge field on the fuzzy sphere.

They correspond to three (inequivalent) classes of orbits of the charge vector,
which is in a 2(n_{V}+1)-dimensional representation $R_{V}$ of the U-duality

conjecture of Jacquet relating the non-vanishing of a certain period integral
to non-vanishing of the central critical value of a certain $L$-function. As a
consequence we deduce certain local results about the existence of
$GL_2(k)$-invariant linear forms on irreducible, admissible representations of
$GL_2({\Bbb K})$ for ${\Bbb K}$ a commutative semi-simple cubic algebra over a
non-archimedean local field $k$ in terms of certain local epsilon factors which
were proved only in certain cases by the first author in his earlier work. This
has been achieved by globalising a locally distinguished representation to a
globally distinguished representation, a result of independent interest.

  It is shown that the concept of depth-trimmed (or central) regions from the
multivariate statistics is closely related to the definition of risk measures.
In particular, the halfspace trimming corresponds to the Value-at-Risk, while
the zonoid trimming yields the expected shortfall. In the abstract framework,
it is shown how to establish a both-ways correspondence between risk measures
and depth-trimmed regions. It is also demonstrated how the lattice structure of
the space of risk values influences this relationship.

uniform error of the kernel estimates $f_n$ of $f$, Bickel and Rosenblatt
(1973) provide confidence bands $B_n$ for $f$ on $C$ with asymptotic level
$1-\alpha\in]0,1[$. Each of the confidence intervals whose union gives $B_n$
has an asymptotic level equal to one; pointwise moderate deviations principles
allow to prove that all these intervals share the same logarithmic asymptotic
level. Now, as soon as both pointwise and uniform moderate deviations
principles for $f_n$ exist, they share the same asymptotics. Taking this
observation as a starting point, we present a new approach for the construction
of confidence bands for $f$, based on the use of moderate deviations
principles. The advantages of this approach are the following: (i) it enables
to construct confidence bands, which have the same width (or even a smaller
width) as the confidence bands provided by Bickel and Rosenblatt (1973), but
which have a better aymptotic level; (ii) any confidence band constructed in
that way shares the same logarithmic asymptotic level as all the confidence
intervals, which make up this confidence band; (iii) it allows to deal with all
the dimensions in the same way; (iv) it enables to sort out the problem of
providing confidence bands for $f$ on compact sets on which $f$ vanishes (or on
all $\bb R^d$), by introducing a truncating operation.

paradigm cases of distributions with infinite moment generating functions: the
case of polynomial or Pareto tails, and the case of stretched exponential or
Weibull tails. In both cases we find asymptotic expansions for the logarithm of
the total mass up to the first random term, which we describe in terms of weak
limit theorems. In the case of polynomial tails, already the leading term in
the expansion is random. For stretched exponential tails, we observe random
fluctuations in the almost sure asymptotics of the second term of the
expansion, but in the weak sense the fourth term is the first random term of
the expansion. The main tool in our proofs is extreme value theory.

natural way, and describes an interplay between orbital motion and the internal
rotation. Based on the above theory, we discuss the geometrical aspects of the
optical Hall effect. We also consider a reduction of the theory to a system
without periodic structure and apply it to the transverse shift at an interface
reflection/refraction. For generic incident beams with elliptic polarizations,
an identical result for the transverse shift of each reflected/transmitted beam
is given by the following different approaches; (i) analytic evaluation of
wavepacket dynamics, (ii) total angular momentum (TAM) conservation {\it for
individual photons}, and (iii) numerical simulation of wavepacket dynamics. It
is consistent with a result by classical electrodynamics. This means that the
TAM conservation for individual photons is already taken into account in wave
optics, i.e, classical electrodynamics. Finally, we show an application of our

specifically a dominant term of its error budget: the reflected-signal range
precision. This is the RMS error on the reflected-signal delay, as estimated by
waveform retracking. So far, the approach proposed by [Lowe et al., 2002] has
been the state of the art to theoretically evaluate this precision, although
known to rely on strong assumptions (e.g., no speckle noise). In this paper, we
perform a critical review of this model and propose an improvement based on the
Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) approach. We derive closed-form expressions for both the
direct and reflected signals. The performance predicted by CRB analysis is
about four times worse for typical space mission scenarios. The impact of this
result is discussed in the context of two classes of GNSS-R applications:
mesoscale oceanography and tsunami detection.

that vorticity is conserved in planar Euler flow, while in axisymmetric Euler
rings it is the ratio of the vorticity to the distance from the symmetry axis

components of the vorticity tensor of a streamline coordinate system that are
normal to the streamline direction are conserved along streamlines. This is
true for both two- and three-dimensional flows, whether the flow is
axisymmetric or not, with or without swirl. What remains of the nonlinear

simplification, is the Lie derivative of the vorticity tensor with respect to

proposed by Drude, is reconsidered here. The quantum Drude model is very
instructive because the optical activity can be calculated analytically without
further approximations apart from the Rosenfeld long wavelength approximation.
While it was generally believed that this model, when treated correctly, is
optically inactive, we show that it leads to optical activity when the motion
of the particle is quantum mechanically treated. We also find that optical
activity arises even in the classical regime at non-zero energy, while for zero
energy the model is inactive, in accordance with previous results. The model is
compared with other one-electron models and it is shown that its predicted
optical activity is qualitatively different from those of other one-electron
systems. The vanishing of optical activity in the classical zero-energy limit
for the Drude model is due to the localization of the particle at the
equilibrium position, whereas in the analogous model of a particle moving
freely on a helix without a definite equilibrium position, optical activity
does not vanish but the spectrum is rescaled. The model under study leads to
interesting predictions about the optical properties of e. g. helicene
derivatives.
