bosons (pNGBs) in the construction of string-inspired models of inflation. In
these models the inflaton is expected to be coupled to gauge fields, and will
lead to the generation of magnetic fields that can be of cosmological interest.
We study the production of such fields mainly focusing on the model of
N-flation, where the collective effect of several pNGBs drives inflation.
Because the produced fields are maximally helical, inverse cascade processes in
the primordial plasma increase significantly their coherence length. We discuss
under what conditions inflation driven by pNGBs can account for the observed
cosmological magnetic fields. A constraint on the parameters of this class of
inflationary scenarios is also derived by requiring that the magnetic field
does not backreact on the inflating background.

remove foreground and background galaxies. The cluster virial mass function
agrees well with recent estimates from both X-ray observations and cluster

$\Omega_m=0.24^{+0.14}_{-0.09}$ and $\sigma_8=0.92^{+0.24}_{-0.19}$, or
$\sigma_8=0.84\pm$0.03 when holding $\Omega_m=0.3$ fixed. We also use the WMAP

First and Third-Year results, we infer velocity segregation of
$\sigma_{gxy}/\sigma_{DM}\approx0.94\pm$0.05 or 1.28$\pm$0.06 respectively. We
compare the velocity dispersion function of clusters to that of early-type
galaxies and conclude that clusters comprise the high-velocity end of the
velocity dispersion function of dark matter haloes. The evolution of cluster
abundances provides constraints on dark energy models; the mass function
presented here offers an important low redshift calibration benchmark.

surface brightnesses and axis ratios due to the presence of dust in pure disk
galaxies, as a function of inclination, central face-on opacity in the B-band

images of disk galaxies created using geometries for stars and dust which can
reproduce the entire spectral energy distribution from the ultraviolet (UV) to
the Far-infrared (FIR)/submillimeter (submm) and can also account for the
observed surface-brightness distributions in both the optical/Near-infrared and
FIR/submm. We found that dust can significantly affect both the scalelength and
central surface brightness, inducing variations in the apparent to intrinsic
quantities of up to 50 percent in scalelength and up to 1.5 magnitudes in
central surface brightness. We also identified some astrophysical effects for
which, although the absolute effect of dust is non-negligible, the predicted
variation over a likely range in opacity is relatively small, such that an
exact knowledge of opacity is not needed. Thus, for a galaxy at a typical
inclination of 37 degrees and having any tau^f_B>2, the effect of dust is to
increase the scalelength in B relative to that in I by a factor of 1.12 +- 0.02
and to change the B-I central colour by 0.36 +- 0.05 magnitudes. Finally we use
the model to analyse the observed scalelength ratios between B and I for a
sample of disk-dominated spiral galaxies, finding that the tendency for
apparent scalelength to increase with decreasing wavelength is primarily due to
the effects of dust.

distances between 140 pc and 6.2 kpc from the center of the galaxy. At a given
metallicity or surface brightness, M33 has a mass-to-light ratio approximately
four times as large as the Local Group dwarf galaxies; other than this constant
offset, we see broad agreement between the M33 and dwarf galaxy data. We use
analytical arguments to show that at least two of the three fundamental line
correlations are basic properties of disk galaxies that can be derived from
very general assumptions. We investigate the effect of supernova feedback on
the fundamental line with numerical models and conclude that while feedback
clearly controls the scatter in the fundamental line, it is not needed to
create the fundamental line itself, in agreement with our analytical
calculations. We also compare the M33 data with measurements of a simulated
disk galaxy, finding that the simulation reproduces the trends in the data
correctly and matches the fundamental line, although the metallicity of the
simulated galaxy is too high, and the surface brightness is lower than that of

helium white dwarf (donor) transferring mass towards its more massive white
dwarf companion (primary), we consider as possible donors white dwarfs which
are the result of common envelope evolution occurring when the helium core mass
of the progenitor giant was still very small (~ 0.2Msun), so that they are
surrounded by a quite massive hydrogen envelope (~1/100Msun or larger), and
live for a very long time supported by proton--proton burning. Mass transfer
from such low mass white dwarfs very probably starts during the hydrogen
burning stage, and the donor structure will remain dominated by the burning
shell until it loses all the hydrogen envelope and begins transferring helium.
We model mass transfer from these low mass white dwarfs, and show that the
radius of the donor decreases while they shed the hydrogen envelope. This
radius behavior, which is due to the fact that the white dwarf is not fully
degenerate, has two important consequences on the evolution of the binary: 1)
the orbital period decreases, with a timescale consistent with the period
decrease of the binary RXJ0806.3+1527; 2) the mass transfer rate is a factor of
about 10 smaller than from a fully degenerate white dwarf, easing the problem
connected with the small X-ray luminosity of this object. The possibility that
such evolution describes the system RXJ0806.3+1527 is also consistent with the
possible presence of hydrogen in the optical spectrum of the star, whose

interloper treatment in dynamical modelling of galaxy clusters. Using
cosmological N-body simulation of standard LCDM model, we select 10 massive
dark matter haloes and use their particles to emulate mock kinematic data in
terms of projected galaxy positions and velocities as they would be measured by
a distant observer. Taking advantage of the full 3D information available from
the simulation, we select samples of interlopers defined with different
criteria. The interlopers thus selected provide means to assess the efficiency
of different interloper removal schemes found in the literature. We study
direct methods of interloper removal based on dynamical or statistical
restrictions imposed on ranges of positions and velocities available to cluster
members. In determining these ranges, we use either the velocity dispersion
criterion or a maximum velocity profile. We also generalize the common
approaches taking into account both the position and velocity information.
Another criterion is based on the dependence of the commonly used virial mass
and projected mass estimators on the presence of interlopers. We find that the
direct methods exclude on average 60-70 percent of unbound particles producing
a sample with contamination as low as 2-4 percent. Next, we consider indirect
methods of interloper treatment which are applied to the data stacked from many
objects. In these approaches, interlopers are treated in a statistical way as a
uniform background which modifies the distribution of cluster members. Using a
Bayesian approach, we reproduce the properties of composite clusters and
estimate the probability of finding an interloper as a function of distance
from the object centre.

unperturbed flows, we adopted the spherically symmetric steady solutions to the
Euler equations obtained with realistic equation of state and formulae for

functions. We found (1) the flows are stable for all modes if the neutrino
luminosity is lower than $\sim 1\times 10^{52}$ ergs/s for
$\dot{M}=1.0M_{\odot}/{\rm s}$. (2) For larger luminosities, the non-radial
instabilities are induced, probably via the advection-acoustic cycles.
Interestingly, the modes with $\ell=2$ and 3 become unstable at first for
relatively low neutrino luminosities, e.g. $\gtrsim 2-3\times 10^{52}$ ergs/s
for the same accretion rate, whereas the $\ell=1$ mode is the most unstable for
higher luminosities, $\sim 3-7\times 10^{52}$ ergs/s. These are all oscillatory

ionized gas morphology shows lambda-dependent variations due to the combined
effects of the dust internal extinction, and the nature and spatial
distribution of the different ionizing sources. The two-dimensional ionization
maps have revealed an off-nuclear conical structure of about 4 kpc in length,
characterized by high excitation conditions and a radial gradient in the gas
electron density. The apex of this structure coincides with B1 region of
NGC3690 which, in turn, presents Seyfert-like ionization, high extinction and a
high velocity dispersion. These results strongly support the hypothesis that B1
is the true nucleus of NGC3690, where an AGN is located. In the circumnuclear
regions HII-like ionization dominates, while LINER-like ionization is found
elsewhere. The Halpha emitting sources with ages from 3.3 to 7.2x10^6 years,
have masses of between 6 and 680x10^6 Msun and contribute (extinction
corrected) about 45% to the bolometric luminosity. The ionized (Halpha) and
neutral (NaD) gas velocity fields show similar structure on scales of several
hundred to about 1 kpc, indicating that these gas components are kinematically
coupled. The kinematic structure is complex and on scales of about 0.2 kpc does
not appear to be dominated by the presence of ordered, rotational motions. The
large velocity dispersion measured in NGC3690 indicates that this galaxy is the
most massive of the system. The low velocity amplitude and dispersion of the
interface suggest that the ionized gas is slowly rotating or in a close to
quiescent phase.

relative magnesium abundances in protodisk halo stars are virtually independent
of metallicity and lie within a fairly narrow range while presumably accreted
stars demonstrate a large spread in relative magnesium abundances up to
negative [Mg/Fe]. The mean metallicity of magnesium-poor ([Mg/Fe]<0.2 dex)
accreted stars has been found to be displaced toward the negative values when
passing from stars with low azimuthal velocities to those with high ones at
\Delta[Fe/H]=0.5dex. The mean apogalactic radii and inclinations of the orbits
also increase while their eccentricities decrease. As a result negative radial
and vertical gradients in relative magnesium abundances are observed in the
accreted halo in the absence of correlations between the [Mg/Fe] ratios and
other orbital elements, while these correlations are found at a high
significance level for genetically related Galactic stars. We surmise that as
the masses of dwarf galaxies decrease, the maximum SNII masses and hence, the
yield of \alpha-elements in them also decrease. In this case, the relation
between the [Mg/Fe] ratios and the inclinations and sizes of the orbits of
accreted stars is in complete agreement with numerical simulations of dynamical
processes during the interaction of galaxies. Thus the behavior of the
magnesium abundance in accreted stars suggests that the satellite galaxies are
disrupted and lose their stars en masse only after dynamical friction reduces
significantly the sizes of their orbits and drags them into the Galactic plane.
Less massive satellite galaxies are disrupted even before their orbits change
appreciably under tidal forces.

Data at 850 micron wavelength were previously obtained using the Submillimetre
Common User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) over periods in 1997-1998 and 2000-2002. By
chi-square fitting after shift and rotation operations, images from these two
epochs were compared to recover proper motion and orbital motion of the disc.
The same procedures were then performed on simulated images to estimate the
accuracy of the results.
  Minima in the chi-square plots indicate a motion of the disc of approximately
0.6'' per year in the direction of the star's proper motion. This
underestimates the true value of 1'' per year, implying that some of the
structure in the disc region is not associated with epsilon Eridani,
originating instead from background galaxies. From the chi-square fitting for
orbital motion, a counterclockwise rotation rate of ~2.75 degrees per year is
deduced. Comparisons with simulated data in which the disc is not rotating show
that noise and background galaxies result in approximately Gaussian
fluctuations with a standard deviation +/-1.5 degrees per year. Thus
counterclockwise rotation of disc features is supported at approximately a
2-sigma level, after a 4-year time difference. This rate is faster than the
Keplerian rate of 0.65 degrees per year for features at ~65 AU from the star,
suggesting their motion is tracking a planet inside the dust ring.
  Future observations with SCUBA-2 can rule out no rotation of the epsilon
Eridani dust clumps with ~4-sigma confidence. Assuming a rate of about 2.75
degrees per year, the rotation of the features after a 10-year period could be
shown to be >1 degree per year at the 3-sigma level.

requires far fewer force evaluations in low density regions of the simulation

softening length. This can be orders of magnitude faster than conventional
ad-hoc methods that employ combinations of acceleration and softening and is
ideally suited for hard problems, such as obtaining the correct dynamics in the
very central regions of dark matter haloes. We also derive an eccentricity
correction for a general leapfrog integration scheme that can follow
gravitational scattering events for orbits with eccentricity e -> 1 with high
precision. These new approaches allow us to study a range of problems in
collisionless and collisional dynamics from few body problems to cosmological

modulation of the very high energy gamma-ray emission of this source. Our model
takes into account time dependent electron injection and acceleration, and the
adiabatic and radiative cooling of non-thermal electrons. It includes
synchrotron, synchrotron self-Compton and external inverse Compton (with seed
photons from the companion star), as well as gamma-gamma absorption of
gamma-rays by starlight photons. The model can successfully reproduce the
available multiwavelength observational data. Our best fit to the SED indicates
that a magnetic field of B_0 ~ 5 X 10^3 G at ~ 10^3 R_g is required, and
electrons need to be accelerated out to TeV energies (gamma_2 = 10^6) with a
nonthermal injection spectrum with a spectral index of q = 1.7, indicating the
operation of acceleration mechanisms beyond the standard first-order Fermi
mechanism at relativistic or non-relativistic shocks. The orbital modulation of
the VHE gamma-ray emission can be explained solely by the geometrical effect of
changes in the relative orientation of the stellar companion with respect to
the compact object and jet as it impacts the position and depth of the
gamma-gamma absorption trough. Such a scenario predicts a trend of spectral
hardening during VHE gamma-ray low orbital phases.

initial conditions of the dark matter density field are set to reproduce the
present time distribution of the galaxies within 80 Mpc/h from the Milky Way.
These initial conditions minimize the uncertainty originated by cosmic
variance, which has affected previous analyses of this small volume of the
Universe. The simulations also model the evolution of the photometric
properties of the galaxy population with semi-analytic prescriptions. The
models yield a galaxy luminosity function sensibly different from that of the
UZC and are unable to reproduce the distribution of groups and their luminosity
content. The discrepancy between the model and the UZC reduces substantially,
if we redistribute the luminosity among the galaxies in the simulation
according to the UZC luminosity function while preserving the galaxy luminosity
rank. The modified LambdaCDM model provides the best match to the UZC: the
abundances of groups by harmonic radius, velocity dispersion, mass and
luminosity are consistent with observations. We find that this model also
reproduces the halo occupation number of groups and clusters. However, the
large-scale distribution of groups is marginally consistent with the UZC and
the redshift-space correlation function of galaxies on scales larger than 6
Mpc/h is still more than 3-sigma smaller than observed. We conclude that
reproducing the properties of the observed groups certainly requires a more
sophisticated treatment of galaxy formation, and possibly an improvement of the
dark matter model.

We analyze the combined effects of the intra-atomic spin-orbit coupling,

the effective spin-orbit Hamiltonian derived recently from group theoretical
arguments by Kane and Mele. We find, for flat graphene, that the intrinsic
spin-orbit coupling $\Hi \propto \Delta^ 2$ and the Rashba coupling due to a
perpendicular electric field ${\cal E}$, $\Delta_{\cal E} \propto \Delta$,
where $\Delta$ is the intra-atomic spin-orbit coupling constant for carbon.
Moreover we show that local curvature of the graphene sheet induces an extra
spin-orbit coupling term $\Delta_{\rm curv} \propto \Delta$. For the values of
$\cal E$ and curvature profile reported in actual samples of graphene, we find
that $\Hi < \Delta_{\cal E} \lesssim \Delta_{\rm curv}$. The effect of
spin-orbit coupling on derived materials of graphene, like fullerenes,
nanotubes, and nanotube caps, is also studied. For fullerenes, only $\Hi$ is
important. Both for nanotubes and nanotube caps $\Delta_{\rm curv}$ is in the
order of a few Kelvins. We reproduce the known appearance of a gap and
spin-splitting in the energy spectrum of nanotubes due to the spin-orbit
coupling. For nanotube caps, spin-orbit coupling causes spin-splitting of the
localized states at the cap, which could allow spin-dependent field-effect
emission.

semiconducting silicon nanowires (SiNWs) using two different numerical
approaches: A real space Kubo method and a recursive Green's function method.
We compare the two approaches and find that they are complementary: depending
on the situation a preferable method can be identified. Several numerical
results are presented to illustrate the relative merits of the two methods. Our
calculations of relaxed atomic structures and their conductance properties are
based on density functional theory without introducing adjustable parameters.
Two specific models of disorder are considered: Un-passivated, surface
reconstructed SiNWs are perturbed by random on-site (Anderson) disorder whereas
defects in hydrogen passivated wires are introduced by randomly removed H
atoms. The un-passivated wires are very sensitive to disorder in the surface
whereas bulk disorder has almost no influence. For the passivated wires, the
scattering by the hydrogen vacancies is strongly energy dependent and for
relatively long SiNWs (L>200 nm) the resistance changes from the Ohmic to the
localization regime within a 0.1 eV shift of the Fermi energy. This high
sensitivity might be used for sensor applications.

includes the corner points and the sum-capacity facet has a special structure
known as polymatroid. Multiaccess channels with fixed input distributions and
multiple-antenna broadcast channels are examples of such systems. Any interior
point of the sum-capacity facet can be achieved by time-sharing among corner
points or by an alternative method known as rate-splitting. The main purpose of
this paper is to find a point on the sum-capacity facet which satisfies a
notion of fairness among active users. This problem is addressed in two cases:
(i) where the complexity of achieving interior points is not feasible, and (ii)
where the complexity of achieving interior points is feasible. For the first
case, the corner point for which the minimum rate of the active users is
maximized (max-min corner point) is desired for signaling. A simple greedy
algorithm is introduced to find the optimum max-min corner point. For the
second case, the polymatroid properties are exploited to locate a rate-vector
on the sum-capacity facet which is optimally fair in the sense that the minimum
rate among all users is maximized (max-min rate). In the case that the rate of
some users can not increase further (attain the max-min value), the algorithm
recursively maximizes the minimum rate among the rest of the users. It is shown
that the problems of deriving the time-sharing coefficients or rate-spitting
scheme can be solved by decomposing the problem to some lower-dimensional
subproblems. In addition, a fast algorithm to compute the time-sharing
coefficients to attain a general point on the sum-capacity facet is proposed.

horizon named $L$. We show that for the apparent horizon the first law is
roughly respected for different epochs while the second laws of thermodynamics
is respected while for $L$ as the system's IR cut-off first law is broken down

also shown that at late-time universe $L$ is equal to $R_A$ and the

Defining the fluid temperature to be proportional to horizon temperature the
range for coefficient of proportionality is obtained provided that the

combined with an accurate solution of the relativistic hydrodynamics equations

following the York-Lichnerowicz conformal decomposition with the assumption of
time symmetry. Unlike other relativistic studies of such systems, no limitation
is set for the mass ratio between the black hole and the neutron star, nor on
the position of the black hole, whose apparent horizon is entirely contained
within the computational domain. The latter extends over ~400M and is covered
with six levels of fixed mesh refinement. Concentrating on a prototypical
binary system with mass ratio ~6, we find that although a tidal deformation is
evident the neutron star is accreted promptly and entirely into the black hole.
While the collision is completed before ~300M, the evolution is carried over up
to ~1700M, thus providing time for the extraction of the gravitational-wave
signal produced and allowing for a first estimate of the radiative efficiency
of processes of this type.

equations in concatenation of gluon correlations. Though non-linear, they
involve highest rank correlations linearly. They are underdetermined in many
cases. Additional linear equations for gluon correlations, associated to
symmetries of action and measure are found. Loop equations aren't differential
equations as they involve left annihilation, which doesn't satisfy the Leibnitz
rule with concatenation. But left annihilation is a derivation of the
commutative shuffle product. Moreover shuffle and concatenation combine to
define a bialgebra. Motivated by deformation quantization, we expand
concatenation around shuffle in powers of q, whose physical value is 1. At
zeroth order the loop equations become quadratic PDEs in the shuffle algebra.
If the variation of the action is linear in iterated commutators of left
annihilations, these quadratic PDEs linearize by passage to shuffle reciprocal
of correlations. Remarkably, this is true for regularized versions of the
Yang-Mills, Chern-Simons and Gaussian actions. But the linear equations are
underdetermined just as the loop equations were. For any particular solution,
the shuffle reciprocal is explicitly inverted to get the zeroth order gluon
correlations. To go beyond zeroth order, we find a Poisson bracket on the
shuffle algebra and associative q-products interpolating between shuffle and
concatenation. This method, and a complementary one of deforming annihilation
rather than product are shown to give over and underestimates for correlations
of a gaussian matrix model.

\in I_{G,k}$ for a certain ideal $I_{G,k} \subseteq \k[x_1, ..., x_n]$. In this
paper, we extend this result by proving a general decomposition theorem for
$I_{G,k}$. This theorem allows us to give an algebraic characterization of
uniquely $k$-colorable graphs. Our results also give algorithms for testing
unique colorability. As an application, we verify a counterexample to a
conjecture of Xu concerning uniquely 3-colorable graphs without triangles.

surfaces with boundary. The various pieces of the Thurston decomposition of a
surface diffeomorphism, thick domains and annular or thin domains, fit into
this flag complex, which we call the complex of domains. The main result of
this paper is a computation of the group of automorphisms of this complex.
Unlike the complex of curves, introduced by Harvey, for which, for all but a
finite number of exceptional surfaces, by the works of Ivanov, Korkmaz, and
Luo, all automorphisms are geometric (i.e. induced by homeomorphisms), the
complex of domains has nongeometric automorphisms, provided the surface in
question has at least two boundary components. These nongeometric automorphisms
of the complex of domains are associated to certain edges of the complex which
are naturally associated to biperipheral pairs of pants on the surface in
question. We project the complex of domains to a natural subcomplex of the
complex of domains by collapsing each biperipheral edge onto the unique vertex
of that edge which is represented by a regular neighborhood of a biperipheral
curve and, thereby, reduce the computation in question to computing the group
of automorphisms of this subcomplex, which we call the truncated complex of
domains. Finally, we prove that the group of automorphisms of the truncated
complex of domains is the extended mapping class group of the surface in

"quant-ph/0606189","Zhang Chi","Chi Zhang, Mingsheng Ying","Universal programmable devices for unambiguous discrimination","9 pages",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We discuss the problem of designing unambiguous programmable discriminators
for any $n$ unknown quantum states in an $m$-dimensional Hilbert space. The
discriminator is a fixed measurement which has two kinds of input registers:
the program registers and the data register. The program registers consist of
the $n$ states, while the data register is prepared among them. The task of the
discriminator is to tell us which state stored in the program registers is
equivalent to that in the data register. First, we give a necessary and
sufficient condition for judging an unambiguous programmable discriminator.
Then, if $m=n$, we present an optimal unambiguous programmable discriminator
for them, in the sense of maximizing the worst-case probability of success.
Finally, we propose a universal unambiguous programmable discriminator for
arbitrary $n$ quantum states. We also show how to use this universal
discriminator to unambiguously discriminate mixed states.

modulated high-dimensional time-bin entanglement. By modulating the relative
phase randomly by {0,pi}, a sender with the entanglement source can randomly
change the sign of the correlation of the measurement outcomes obtained by two
distant recipients. The two recipients must cooperate if they are to obtain the
sign of the correlation, which is used as a secret key. We show that our scheme
is secure against intercept-and-resend (I-R) and beam splitting attacks by an
outside eavesdropper thanks to the non-orthogonality of high-dimensional
time-bin entangled states. We also show that a cheating attempt based on an I-R
attack by one of the recipients can be detected by changing the dimension of
the time bin entanglement randomly and inserting two ""vacant"" slots between the
packets. Then, cheating attempts can be detected by monitoring the count rate
in the vacant slots. The proposed scheme has better experimental feasibility
than previously proposed entanglement-based QSS schemes.

line of first order quantum phase transition that ends at a second order point.

transitions is discussed. We analyze the behavior of the ground and first
excited states near the quantum phase transition, the gap and the entanglement

on the sole basis of the laws of physics, that is without limiting the
computational power of the eavesdropper. The usual security proofs suppose that
the authorized partners, Alice and Bob, have a perfect knowledge and control of
their quantum systems and devices; for instance, they must be sure that the
logical bits have been encoded in true qubits, and not in higher-dimensional
systems. In this paper, we present an approach that circumvents this strong
assumption. We define protocols, both for the case of bits and for generic
$d$-dimensional outcomes, in which the security is guaranteed by the very
structure of the Alice-Bob correlations, under the no-signalling condition. The
idea is that, if the correlations cannot be produced by shared randomness, then
Eve has poor knowledge of Alice's and Bob's symbols. The present study assumes,
on the one hand that the eavesdropper Eve performs only individual attacks
(this is a limitation to be removed in further work), on the other hand that
Eve can distribute any correlation compatible with the no-signalling condition
(in this sense her power is greater than what quantum physics allows). Under
these assumptions, we prove that the protocols defined here allow extracting
secrecy from noisy correlations, when these correlations violate a Bell-type
inequality by a sufficiently large amount. The region, in which secrecy
extraction is possible, extends within the region of correlations achievable by
measurements on entangled quantum states.

singularity at E=-z^2/4. For \Re(z)<0, H has an eigenvalue at E=-z^2/4. For the

from spectral singularities. For this latter case, we construct an associated
biorthonormal system and use it to perform a perturbative calculation of a
positive-definite inner product that renders H self-adjoint. This allows us to
address the intriguing question of the nonlocal aspects of the equivalent
Hermitian Hamiltonian for the system. In particular, we compute the energy
expectation values for various Gaussian wave packets to show that the
non-Hermiticity effect diminishes rapidly outside an effective interaction
region.

one-way quantum computing. They can be grown by projective measurements on the
component qubits. Such measurements typically carry a significant failure
probability. Moreover, they may generate imperfect entanglement. Here we
describe strategies to adapt growth operations in order to cancel incurred
errors. Nascent states that initially deviate from the ideal graph states
evolve toward the desired high fidelity resource without impractical overheads.
Our analysis extends the diagrammatic language of graph states to include
characteristics such as tilted vertices, weighted edges, and partial fusion,
which arise from experimental imperfections. The strategies we present are
relevant to parity projection schemes such as optical `path erasure' with
distributed matter qubits.
