clusters, NGC3293, NGC4755 and NGC6611. Non-LTE model atmosphere calculations
have been used to estimate effective temperatures (from either the helium
spectrum or the silicon ionization equilibrium) and gravities (from the
hydrogen spectrum). Projected rotational velocities have been deduced from the
helium spectrum (for fast and moderate rotators) or the metal line spectrum
(for slow rotators). The observed Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams are compared
with theoretical predictions and some discrepancies including differences in
the main sequence luminosities are discussed. Cluster ages have been deduced
and evidence for non-coeval star formation is found for all three of the
clusters. Projected rotational velocities for targets in the older clusters,
NGC3293 and NGC4755, have been found to be systematically larger than those for
the field, confirming recent results in other similar age clusters. The
distribution of projected rotational velocities are consistent with a Gaussian
distribution of intrinsic rotational velocities. For the relatively unevolved
targets in the older clusters, NGC3293 and NGC4755, the peak of the velocity
distribution would be 250km/s with a full-width-half-maximum of approximately
180km/s. For NGC6611, the sample size is relatively small but implies a lower
mean rotational velocity. This may be evidence for the spin-down effect due to
angular momentum loss through stellar winds, although our results are
consistent with those found for very young high mass stars. For all three
clusters we deduce present day mass functions with Gamma-values in the range of
-1.5 to -1.8, which are similar to other young stellar clusters in the Milky
Way (Abridged).

side of the rotation curve flattens but the other side continues to rise. This
kinematic asymmetry is coupled with a dramatic asymmetry in the molecular gas
distribution but not in the atomic gas. An analysis of the gas column densities
and the interstellar pressure suggests that the H2/HI surface density ratio on
the east side of the galaxy is three times higher than expected from the
hydrostatic pressure contributed by the mass of the stellar disk. We discuss
the probable effects of ram pressure, gravitational interactions, and
asymmetric potentials on the interstellar medium and suggest it is likely that
a m=1 perturbation in the gravitational potential could be responsible for all
of the galaxy's features. Kinematic disturbances of the type seen here are
common, but the curious thing about NGC 4647 is that the molecular distribution
appears more disturbed than the HI distribution. Thus it is the combination of
the two gas phases that provides such interesting insight into the galaxy's
history and into models of the interstellar medium.

four show indirect evidence of moderate X-ray absorption (inferred N_H~10^22

objects show no evidence for even moderate intrinsic X-ray absorption. Thus,
while optically red quasars are marginally more likely to show signatures of
X-ray absorption than optically selected quasars with normal colors,
dust-reddened type 1 AGN (as opposed to fully obscured type 2 AGN) are unlikely
to contribute significantly to the remaining unresolved hard X-ray background.
The red quasar population includes objects with intrinsically red continua as
well as objects with dust-reddened continua. Improved sample selection is thus
needed to increase our understanding of either subpopulation. To identify
dust-reddened quasars likely to exhibit X-ray absorption, some measure of

the formation of ~20,000 galaxies, and simulate the galactic outflows produced
by these galaxies. When these outflows collide with density peaks, ram pressure
stripping of the gas inside the peak may result. This occurs in around half the
cases and prevents the formation of galaxies. Anisotropic outflows follow the
path of least resistance, and thus travel preferentially into low-density
regions, away from cosmological structures (filaments and pancakes) where
galaxies form. As a result, the number of collisions is reduced, leading to the
formation of a larger number of galaxies. Anisotropic outflows can
significantly enrich low-density systems with metals. Conversely, the
cross-pollution in metals of objects located in a common cosmological
structure, like a filament, is significantly reduced. Highly anisotropic
outflows can travel across cosmological voids and deposit metals in other,

This novel physical phenomenon, called spin transfer, offers unprecedented
spatial and temporal control over the magnetic state of a ferromagnet and has
tremendous potential in a broad range of technologies, including magnetic
memory and recording. Recently, it has been predicted that spin transfer is not
limited to ferromagnets, but can also occur in antiferromagnetic materials and
even be stronger under some conditions. In this paper we demonstrate transfer
of spin angular momentum across an interface between ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic metals. The spin transfer is mediated by an electrical
current of high density (~10^12 A/m^2) and revealed by variation in the
exchange bias at the ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interface. We find that,
depending on the polarity of the electrical current flowing across the
interface, the strength of the exchange bias can either increase or decrease.
This finding is explained by the theoretical prediction that a spin polarized
current generates a torque on magnetic moments in the antiferromagnet.
Current-mediated variation of exchange bias can be used to control the magnetic
state of spin-valve devices, e.g., in magnetic memory applications.

discuss recent theoretical attempts to explain the unusual,
faster-than-exponential dynamical structure factors observed in jammed soft

modelled on some Calabi-Yau cone V, and construct a desingularization of M_0 by
gluing in an Asymptotically Conical (AC) Calabi-Yau 3-fold Y to M_0 at x. In
this paper, we shall investigate a similar desingularization problem on special
Lagrangian (SL) 3-folds in the corresponding Calabi-Yau 3-folds. More
precisely, suppose M_0 is now a Calabi-Yau 3-fold with finitely many conical
singularities at x_i modelled on Calabi-Yau cones V_i for i=1,...,n, and N_0 an
SL 3-fold in M_0 with conical singularities at the same points x_i modelled on
SL cones C_i in V_i. Let Y_i be an AC Calabi-Yau 3-fold modelled on the
Calabi-Yau cones V_i, and L_i an AC SL 3-fold in Y_i modelled on the SL cones
C_i. We then simultaneously desingularize M_0 and N_0 by gluing in rescaled Y_i
and L_i at each x_i. The construction is achieved by applying Joyce's analytic
result [16, Thm. 5.3] on deforming Lagrangian submanifolds to nearby special
Lagrangian submanifolds. As an application, we take M_0 to be the orbifold
T^6/\mathbb{Z}_3 and construct some singular SL 3-folds N_0 in M_0 and AC SL
3-folds L_i in the corresponding Y_i, and glue them together to obtain examples

controlling the deformation theory of Yang-Mills connections. In the case of
Riemannian signature the complex is elliptic. If the bundle connection respects
a metric on the vector bundle then the complex is formally self-adjoint. In
dimension 4 the complex is conformally invariant and generalises, to the full
Yang-Mills setting, the composition of (two operator) Yang-Mills complexes for
(anti-)self-dual Yang-Mills connections. Via a prolonged system and tractor
connection a diagram of differential operators is constructed which, when
commutative, generates differential complexes of natural operators from the
Yang-Mills detour complex. In dimension 4 this construction is conformally
invariant and is used to yield two new sequences of conformal operators which
are complexes if and only if the Bach tensor vanishes everywhere. In Riemannian
signature these complexes are elliptic. In one case the first operator is the
twistor operator and in the other sequence it is the operator for Einstein
scales. The sequences are detour sequences associated to certain
Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand sequences.

of 2^{card(\Omega)} copies of A, not only in the variety of all groups, but in
any variety of groups to which A belongs. His key lemma is here generalized to

2^{card(\Omega)} copies of itself.
  That paper also gave an example of a group of cardinality 2^{card(\Omega)}

established a large class of such examples. Those results are shown to be
instances of a general property of the lattice of solution sets in Sym(\Omega)
of sets of equations with constants in Sym(\Omega). Again, similar results --
this time of varying strengths -- are obtained for Self(\Omega), End_K (V), and
Equiv(\Omega), and also for the monoid \Rel of binary relations on \Omega.

delay method were found to be in agreement with a recent claim of eta-mesic 3He
states made by the TAPS collaboration. Here, we extend this method to a
speculative study of the unstable states occurring in the eta-d and eta-4He
elastic scattering. The T-matrix for eta-4He scattering is evaluated within the
Finite Rank Approximation (FRA) of few body equations. For the evaluation of
time delay in the eta-d case, we use a parameterization of an existing Faddeev
calculation and compare the results with those obtained from FRA. With an eta-N
scattering length, $a_{\eta N} = (0.42, 0.34)$ fm, we find an eta-d unstable
bound state around -16 MeV, within the Faddeev calculation. A similar state
within the FRA is found for a low value of $a_{\eta N}$, namely, $a_{\eta N} =
(0.28, 0.19)$ fm. The existence of an eta-4He unstable bound state close to
threshold is hinted by $a_{\eta N} = (0.28, 0.19)$ fm, but is ruled out by
large scattering lengths.

physics of magic. What usually makes magic tricks interesting is that something
unexpected occurs. Similarly, demonstrations are interesting inasmuch as they
produce something unexpected. Since expectations are linked to preconceptions,
a demonstration making use of a flaw in a preconception will result in
something unexpected. Given the numerous misconceptions in physics, many
demonstrations can be dressed up as magic tricks. The first objective of this
paper is to share with other physics teachers the excitement of creating and
using magical classroom demonstrations. The second objective is to provide
interested instructors with practical means to convert a classical
demonstration into a magic trick. To illustrate the procedure, two classical
demonstrations will be re-presented as the magic tricks we have presented in
our courses. The final goal is to use current ideas in educational psychology
to explain why using magic has worked so well in our courses in providing
students with a new impetus to learn physics. This description is not meant to
be formal, but proposes a theoretical model that fits our classroom
observations.

nuclear physicist in the late 1930s, led the theoretical development of radar
technology at MIT during World War II, and then, soon after the war, conquered
quantum electrodynamics, and became the leading quantum field theorist for two
decades, before taking a more iconoclastic route during his last quarter

spectral emission of a moving atom exhibits always a redshift which informs not
the direction of the atom's motion. The conclusion is also evident from a
simple energy relation: atomic spectral radiation is emitted as an orbiting
electron consumes a portion of its internal energy on transiting to a
lower-energy state which however has in a moving atom an additional energy
gain; this results in a redshift in the emission frequency. Based on auxiliary
experimental information and a scheme for de Broglie particle formation, we
give a vigorous elucidation of the mechanism for deceleration radiation of
atomic electron; the corresponding prediction of the redshift is in complete
agreement with the Ives and Stilwell's experimental formula.

are reconstructed thoroughly in this paper based on flat reference frame. The
rational parts of the Einstein theories are reserved while the irrational parts
including space-time paradoxes and singularities and so on are eliminated
completely. A more rational the theory of space-time, gravitation and cosmology
is established. By transforming the geodesic equation described by the
Schwarzschild solution of the Einsteins equation of gravitational field into
flat reference frame for of gravitational field, it is provdescription, the
revised formulas of the Newtonian gravitation is obtained. Based on the
formulas, all experiments which support general relativity can also be
explained well, but the theory has no any space-time singularity and other
strange characters which exist in general relativity. It is pointed that there
exists logical difficulties to use the equivalent principle to explain spectrum
gravitational redshift actually. The new formula of gravitational redshift and
the revised Doppler formula of redshift when light source moves in
gravitational field are deduced. Based on the Schwarzschild solution of the
Einstein equation field, it is proved that the speed of light would change and
the isotropy of light speed would be violated in gravitational field with
spherical symmetry. It is suggested to use the method of the Michelson Morley
interference to verify the change of light speed and the violation of isotropy
in the gravitational field of the earth. This experiment can be considered as a
new verification for general relativity in the weak gravitational field with
spherical symmetry. The theory may also be used to explain so-called the
Pioneer Anomaly which the Einstein theory of gravitation can not do.

calculation of poloidal axisymmetric magnetic fields applicable in a wide range
of ac frequencies. The method is based on the vector potential formulation and
it uses the Green's functions of Laplace and Helmholtz equations for the
exterior and interior of conductors, respectively. The work is particularly
focused on a calculation of axisymmetric Green's function for the Helmholtz
equation which is both simpler and more accurate compared to previous
approaches. Three different approaches are used for calculation of the Green's
function depending on the parameter range. For low and high dimensionless ac
frequencies we use a power series expansion in terms of elliptical integrals
and an asymptotic series in terms of modified Bessel functions of second kind,
respectively. For the intermediate frequency range, Gauss-Chebyshev-Lobatto
quadratures are used. The method is verified by comparing with the analytical
solution for a sphere in a uniform external ac field. The application of the
method is demonstrated for a composite model inductor containing an external
secondary circuit.

that they have an entry-wise non-negative Gibbs density matrix for any

complexity class AM -- a probabilistic version of NP with two rounds of
communication between the prover and the verifier. We also show that 2-local
