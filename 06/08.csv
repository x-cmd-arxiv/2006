from the open cluster NGC 6611, which borders to a Giant Molecular Cloud.
Radiation from these hot stars has sculpted columns of dense obscuring material
on a few arcmin scales. The interface between these pillars and the hot ionised
medium provides a textbook example of a Photodissociation Region (PDR).
  Aims: To constrain the physical conditions of the atomic and molecular
material with submillimeter spectroscopic observations.
  Methods: We used the APEX submillimeter telescope to map a ~3'x3' region in
the CO J=3-2, 4-3 and 7-6 rotational lines, and a subregion in atomic carbon
lines. We also observed C18O(3-2) and CO(7-6) with longer integrations on five
peaks found in the CO(3-2) map. The large scale structure of the pillars is
derived from the molecular lines' emission distribution. We estimate the
magnitude of the velocity gradient at the tips of the pillars and use LVG
modelling to constrain their densities and temperatures. Excitation
temperatures and carbon column densities are derived from the atomic carbon
lines.
  Results: The atomic carbon lines are optically thin and excitation
temperatures are of order 60 K to 100 K, well consistent with observations of
other Hii region-molecular cloud interfaces. We derive somewhat lower
temperatures from the CO line ratios, of order 40 K. The Ci/CO ratio is around
0.1 at the fingers tips.

related to star formation), as well as continuum luminosities over a range of
mid- to far-infrared wavelengths between 6 and 60um. We detect star-formation
related PAH emission in 11/26 QSOs and fine-structure line emission in all of
them, often in multiple lines. The detection of PAHs in the average spectrum of
sources which lack individual PAH detections provides further evidence for the
widespread presence of PAHs in QSOs. Similar PAH/FIR and [NeII]/FIR ratios are
found in QSOs and in starburst-dominated ULIRGs and lower luminosity
starbursts. We conclude that the typical QSO in our sample has at least 30% but
likely most of the far-infrared luminosity (~ 10^(10...12)Lsun) arising from
star formation, with a tendency for larger star formation contribution at the
largest FIR luminosities. In the QSO sample, we find correlations between most
of the quantities studied including combinations of AGN tracers and starburst
tracers. The common scaling of AGN and starburst luminosities (and fluxes) is
evidence for a starburst-AGN connection in luminous AGN. Strong correlations of
far-infrared continuum and starburst related quantities (PAH, low excitation
[NeII]) offer additional support for the starburst origin of far-infrared
emission.

temperature of a few thousand degrees Kelvin. However, when molecular hydrogen
is present cooling can proceed down to a few hundred degrees Kelvin. Analogous
to the case of the larger scale proto-galactic discs, we assume that the
evolution of these discs is mainly driven by angular momentum redistribution
induced by the development of gravitational instabilities in the disc. We also
properly take into account the possibility of disc fragmentation. We thus show
that this simple model naturally predicts the formation of supermassive black
holes in the nuclei of such discs and provides a robust determination of their
mass distribution as a function of halo properties. We estimate that roughly 5%
of discs resulting from the collapse of haloes with $M\approx 10^7 M_{\odot}$
should host a massive black hole with a mass $M_{\rm BH}\approx 10^5
M_{\odot}$. We confirm our arguments with time-dependent calculations of the
evolution of the surface density and of the accretion rate in these primordial
discs. This mechanism offers an efficient way to form seed black holes at high
redshift. The predicted masses for our black hole seeds enable the comfortable
assembly of $10^9 M_{\odot}$ black holes powering the luminous quasars detected
by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at $z = 6$ for a concordance cosmology.

nitrogen-bearing species, such as ammonia, are affected by this process. As
deuterium fractionation is efficient in cold, dense gas, deuterated species are
excellent tracers of prestellar cores. A comparison of the spatial distribution
of neutral and ionized deuterated species with the dust continuum emission can
thus provide important insights into the physical and chemical structure of
such regions. We study the spatial distribution of the ground-state 335.5 GHz

the DCO+(3--2) line, as well as the 350 micron dust continuum emission observed

nearby molecular clouds. The masses and sizes of the model clusters are in

tSZ luminosity (i.e., $\sim 15$% of the total) comes from overdense regions
with $\delta_{gas}>$10, such as filaments and superclusters. The gas present in
slightly overdense and underdense regions with $\delta_{gas} < 10$, despite
making up 50% of the total baryon budget, leaves very little tSZ signature: it
gives rise to only $\sim$ 5% of the total tSZ luminosity. Thus, future Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) observations will be sensitive to, at best, one half
of the missing baryons, improving the current observational status, but still
leaving one half unobserved. Since most of the tSZ is generated in haloes, we
find a tight correlation between gas pressure and galaxy number density. This
allows us to predict the CMB Comptonization from existing galaxy surveys and to
forecast the tSZ effect from the local structures probed by the Two Micron All
Sky Survey (2MASS) galaxy catalog.

detected in the distant Coma cluster. The first theoretical studies of
intracluster planetaries have also been completed, studying their utility as
tracers of the intracluster light as a whole, and also as individual objects.
  From the results to date, it appears that intracluster planetaries are common
in galaxy clusters (10-20% of the total amount of starlight), but thus far,
none have been detected in galaxy groups, a result which currently is not well
understood. Limited spectroscopic follow-up of intracluster planetaries in
Virgo indicate that they have a complex velocity structure, in agreement with
numerical models of intracluster light. Hydrodynamic simulations of individual
intracluster planetaries predict that their morphology is significantly altered
by their intracluster environment, but their emission-line properties appear to
be unaffected.

be dominated by optically thick, continuum-driven outbursts or explosions,
instead of by steady line-driven winds. In order for a massive star to become a
WR star, it must shed its H envelope, but new estimates of the effects of
clumping in winds indicate that line driving is vastly insufficient. We discuss
massive stars above roughly 40-50 Msun, for which the best alternative is mass
loss during brief eruptions of luminous blue variables (LBVs). Our clearest
example of this phenomenon is the 19th century outburst of eta Car, when the
star shed 12-20 Msun or more in less than a decade. Other examples are
circumstellar nebulae of LBVs, extragalactic eta Car analogs (``supernova
impostors''), and massive shells around SNe and GRBs. We do not yet fully
understand what triggers LBV outbursts, but they occur nonetheless, and present
a fundamental mystery in stellar astrophysics. Since line opacity from metals
becomes too saturated, the extreme mass loss probably arises from a
continuum-driven wind or a hydrodynamic explosion, both of which are
insensitive to metallicity. As such, eruptive mass loss could have played a
pivotal role in the evolution and fate of massive metal-poor stars in the early
universe. If they occur in these Population III stars, such eruptions would
profoundly affect the chemical yield and types of remnants from early SNe and
hypernovae.

determine the ionization history of the early universe. The Assembly of
Galaxies theme seeks to determine how galaxies and the dark matter, gas, stars,
metals, morphological structures, and active nuclei within them evolved from

systems. The Planetary Systems and the Origins of Life theme seeks to determine
the physical and chemical properties of planetary systems including our own,
and investigate the potential for the origins of life in those systems. To
enable these observations, JWST consists of a telescope, an instrument package,
a spacecraft and a sunshield. The telescope consists of 18 beryllium segments,
some of which are deployed. The segments will be brought into optical alignment
on-orbit through a process of periodic wavefront sensing and control. The JWST

Theta, part of the funnel stream is located in the equatorial plane and the gap
is not empty. Furthermore, if the adiabatic index is small (gamma=1.1) and the
rotational and magnetic axes are almost aligned, then matter penetrates through
the magnetosphere due to 3D instabilities forming high-density equatorial
funnels. For these two limits there is appreciable matter density in the

suggest that the lack of 21-cm absorption detections at high redshift arises
from the fact that these DLAs are at similar angular diameter distances to the
background quasars (i.e. the distance ratios are always close to unity): Above
z~1.6 the covering factor becomes largely independent of the DLA--QSO distance,
making the high redshift absorbers much less effective at covering the
background continuum emission. At low redshift, small distance ratios are
strongly favoured by the 21-cm detections, whereas large ratios are favoured by
the non-detections. This mix of distance ratios gives the observed mix of
detections and non-detections at z<1.6.In addition to the predominance of large
distance ratios and non-detections at high redshift, this strongly suggests
that the observed distribution of 21-cm absorption in DLAs is dominated by
geometric effects.

negative effects of hot cluster environments on galactic coronae. Nevertheless,
these coronae still manage to survive ICM stripping, evaporation, rapid
cooling, and powerful AGN outflows, making them a rich source of information
about gas stripping, microscopic transport, and feedback processes in the

NIDM-particle mass) and compare with the constraint from observation of
neutrinos from supernova 1987A. If only a fraction of the dark matter interacts
with neutrinos, then NIDM oscillations may affect current cosmological
constraints from measurements of galaxy clustering. We discuss how detection of
NIDM oscillations would suggest a particle-antiparticle asymmetry in the

Abell clusters in the SDSS database. We search for the X-ray counterpart of
each cluster in the ROSAT All Sky Survey. We find that 40% of our clusters have
a marginal X-ray detection or remain undetected in X-rays. These clusters
appear too X-ray faint on average for their velocity dispersion determined
mass, i.e. they do not follow the scaling relation between X-ray luminosity and
virial mass traced by the other clusters. On the other hand, they do follow the
general scaling relation between optical luminosity and virial mass. We refer
to these clusters as the X-ray-Underluminous Abell clusters (AXU clusters, for
short) and designate as 'normal' the X-ray detected Abell systems. We examine
the distributions and properties of the galaxy populations of the normal and
the AXU clusters, separately. The AXU clusters are characterized by leptokurtic
(more centrally concentrated than a Gaussian) velocity distribution of their
member galaxies in the outskirts ($1.5 < r/r_{200} \leq 3.5$), as expected for
the systems in accretion. In addition, the AXU clusters have a higher fraction
of blue galaxies in the external region and show a marginally significant
paucity of galaxies at the center. Our results seem to support the
interpretation that the AXU clusters are systems in formation undergoing a
phase of mass accretion. Their low X-ray luminosity should be due to the still
accreting Intracluster gas or to an ongoing merging process.

comparably massive galaxies with z > 4 among the 2688 galaxies in our K < 23.5
(AB) catalogue within the CDFS/GOODS-South field. This search was conducted
using redshift estimates based on the recently-completed, uniquely-deep 11-band
imaging in this 125 square arcmin field, ~25 times larger than the NICMOS HUDF.
Initial spectral fitting, based on published catalogue SExtractor photometry,
led us to conclude that at least 2669 of the galaxies in our sample lie at z <
4. We carried out a detailed investigation of the 19 remaining z > 4
candidates, performing aperture photometry on all images, and including
marginal detections and formal non-detections in the fitting process. This led
to the rejection of a further 13 galaxies to lower redshift. Moreover,
subjecting HUDF-JD2 to the same analysis, we find that it lies at z ~ 2.2,
rather than the extreme redshift favoured by Mobasher et al. (2005). The 6
remaining candidates appear to be credible examples of galaxies in the redshift
range z = 4 - 6, with plausible stellar ages. However, refitting with allowance
for extreme values of extinction we find that, even for these objects,
statistically acceptable solutions can be found at z < 3. Moreover, the
recently-released Spitzer MIPS imaging in GOODS-South has revealed that 5 of
our 6 final z > 4 candidates are detected at 24 microns. We conclude that there
is no convincing evidence for any galaxy with M > 3 x 10^11 Msun, and z > 4

electrons in the jets. We modelled the observed SEDs of the jet `blobs' with
synchrotron emission alone and with synchrotron emission plus inverse Compton
scattering. The results favor a pure synchrotron origin of the observed jet
emission. Moreover, we found evidence that the shape of the electron spectral
distribution is similar for all jet `blobs' seen. Assuming that this is the
case for the jet as a whole, we then applied the synchrotron model to the radio
spectrum of the total emission and extrapolated the results to higher
frequencies. In spite of significant degeneracy in the fits, it seems clear
that, while the synchrotron radiation from the jets can account for nearly 100%
of the measured radio fluxes, it contributes little to the observed X-ray
emission, when the source is relatively bright. In this case, the X-ray
emission is most likely dominated by emission from the accretion flows. When
the source becomes fainter, however, the jet emission becomes more important,
even dominant, at X-ray energies. We also examined the spectral properties of
the sources during outbursts and the correlation between the observed radio and

regimes have been studied: conservative, or radiatively inefficient, and
nonconservative, in which the heat released in magnetic reconnections is
completely lost. The flows in both regimes are turbulent. They show the
flattened radial density profiles and reduction of the accretion velocities and

clusters with the grand canonical and canonical ensemble approaches in a
multidimensional parameter space of temperature (T), magnetic field (h),
on-site interaction (U) and chemical potential. Our results, near the average
number of electrons <N>=3, strongly suggest the existence of a critical
parameter U_{c}(T) for the localization of electrons and a particle-hole
binding (positive) gap at U>U_{c}(T), with a zero temperature quantum critical
point, U_{c}(0)=4.584. For U<U_{c}(T), particle-particle pair binding is found
with a (positive) pairing gap. The ground state degeneracy is lifted at
U>U_c(T) and the cluster becomes a Mott-Hubbard like insulator due to the
presence of energy gaps at all (allowed) integer numbers of electrons. In
contrast, for U< U_c(T), we find an electron pair binding instability at finite
temperature near <N>=3, which manifests a possible pairing mechanism, a
precursor to superconductivity in small clusters.
  In addition, the resulting phase diagram consisting of charge and spin
pseudogaps, antiferromagnetic correlations, hole pairing with competing
hole-rich (<N>=2), hole-poor (<N>=4) and magnetic (<N>=3) regions in the
ensemble of clusters near 1/8 filling closely resembles the phase diagrams and
inhomogeneous phase separation recently found in the family of doped high T_c
cuprates.

and this limit is evidence for quantum wave-packet spreading in the
center-of-mass. This macroscopic quantum effect cannot be readily observed for
non-interacting particles, due to classical pulse broadening. For this reason,
we also study the evolution of photonic and matter-wave solitons, where
classical dispersion is suppressed. In the photonic case, we show that the
intrinsic quantum diffusion of the mean position can contribute significantly
to uncertainties in soliton pulse arrival times. We also discuss ways in which
the relatively long lifetimes of attractive bosons in matter-wave solitons may
be used to demonstrate quantum interference between massive objects composed of
thousands of particles.

NQR frequency, it was revealed that the NQR frequency is changed by the change
of the electric field gradient (EFG) along the c axis \nu_{zz} rather than the
asymmetry of EFG within the ab-plane. In addition, it is considered that the
change of \nu_{zz} is gaverned mainly by the trigonal distortion of the CoO_2
block layers along the c axis, from the relationships between \nu_{zz} and the
various physical parameters. We found the tendency that samples with \nu_{zz}
larger than 4.2 MHz show magnetic ordering, whereas samples with lower \nu_{zz}
show superconductivity. We measured the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate
1/T_1 in these samples, and found that magnetic fluctuations depend on samples.
The higher-\nu_{zz} sample has stronger magnetic fluctuations at T_c. From the
relationship between \nu_{zz} and T_c or T_M, we suggest that the NQR frequency
can be regarded as a tuning parameter to determine the ground state of the
system, and develop the phase diagram using \nu_{zz}. This phase diagram shows
that the highest-T_c sample is located at the point where T_M is considered to
be zero, which suggests that the superconductivity is induced by quantum
critical fluctuations. We strongly advocate that the hydrate cobaltate
superconductor presents an example of the magnetic-fluctuation-mediated
superconductivity argued in the heavy-fermion compounds. The coexistence of
superconductivity and magnetism observed in the sample with the highest
\nu_{zz} is also discussed on the basis of the results of our experiments.

class constraints occurring in Dirac theory. Further, it is shown that the
modification of the Dirac Lagrangian by a surface term leads to a momentum
transfer between the Dirac field and the gravitational background field,
resulting in a theory that is free of constraints, but not manifestly
hermitian.

study a gauge boson $B_{H}$ production process $\gamma\gamma\to W^{+}W^{-}B_H$.

solution for domain lines -- string-like objects living on the surface of the
domain wall which separate wall I from wall II. The domain line is seen as a
BPS kink in the world-volume effective theory. We expect that the wall with the
domain line on it saturates both the $\{1,0\}$ and the $\{{1/2},{1/2}\}$b
central charges of the bulk theory. The domain line carries the magnetic flux
which is exactly 1/2 of the flux carried by the flux tube living in the bulk on
each side of the wall. Thus, the domain lines on the wall confine charges
living on the wall, resembling Polyakov's three-dimensional confinement.

Since these solutions are obtained for the same coupling constants of the

the model to be a concrete finite setting for applying the old idea of

properties, such as crossing symmetry and mutual locality, expected of a
correlator in a two dimensional CFT. Therefore one may take this to be a
candidate four point function in a worldsheet description of closed strings on

theorem:

f-invariant equivalence classes of irreducible unitary representations. If one
of R(f) and S(f) is finite, then it is equal to the other.

conjugacy classes having a long history and has very serious consequences in
Dynamics, while its proof needs rather fine results from Functional and
Non-commutative Harmonic Analysis. It was proved for finitely generated groups
of type I in a previous paper.
  In the present paper this conjecture is disproved for non-type I groups. More
precisely, an example of a group and its automorphism is constructed such that
the number of fixed irreducible representations is greater than the
Reidemeister number. But the number of fixed finite-dimensional representations
(i.e. the number of invariant finite-dimensional characters) in this example

literature. They are intimately related to Loday's dendriform algebras, and
were extensively used to give explicit constructions of free commutative
Rota-Baxter algebras. In the literature there exist at least two other
Rota-Baxter type algebras, namely, the Nijenhuis algebra and the so-called
TD-algebra. The explicit construction of the free unital commutative Nijenhuis
algebra uses a modified quasi-shuffle product, called the right-shift shuffle.
We show that another modification of the quasi-shuffle product, the so-called
left-shift shuffle, can be used to give an explicit construction of the free
unital commutative TD-algebra. We explore some basic properties of TD-operators
and show that the free unital commutative Nijenhuis algebra is a TD-algebra. We
relate our construction to Loday's unital commutative dendriform trialgebras,
including the involutive case. The concept of Rota-Baxter, Nijenhuis and
TD-bialgebras is introduced at the end and we show that any commutative
bialgebra provides such objects.

truels. A ""truel"" is a generalization of a duel involving three players.
Depending on the rules used for chosing the players, we may distinguish between
the random, sequential and simultaneous truel. A paradoxical result appears in
these games, as the player with the highest marksmanship does not necessarily
possess the highest survival (or winning) probability. In this work we limit
ourselves to the random and sequential truels in which players use their best
possible strategy with no coalitions. Furthermore, we have modified the random
truel and converted it into an opinion model. In this version each of the three
players holds a different opinion on a given topic. We address next the
question of who wins a ""truel league"". We will see that, despite the
paradoxical result mentioned above, still the distribution of winners is peaked
around the players with the higher marksmanship for the random and opinion
versions. In the sequential truel, however, the paradoxical result remains
partially since the distribution of winners is peaked around the intermediate
players.
  If the rules of truels are extended from three to $N$ players, the
paradoxical results shows up even more clearly since as $N$ increases it is
more difficult for the player with the highest marksmanship to win the game.
Finally, we consider the dynamics of the games in a spatial distribution in a
given network of interactions.

typically limited to tens of points, while the number of genes or variables is
potentially in the thousands. As such data sets vastly underdetermine the
biological network, many models may fit the same data and reverse engineering
programs often require the use of methods for choosing parsimonious models.
Grobner bases have recently been employed as a selection tool for polynomial
dynamical systems that are characterized by maps in a vector space over a
finite field.
  While there are numerous existing algorithms to compute Groebner bases, to
date none has been specifically designed to cope with large numbers of
variables and few distinct data points. In this paper, we present an algorithm
for computing Grobner bases of zero-dimensional ideals that is optimized for
the case when the number m of points is much smaller than the number n of
indeterminates. The algorithm identifies those variables that are essential,
that is, in the support of the standard monomials associated to a polynomial
ideal, and computes the relations in the Groebner bases in terms of these
variables. When n is much larger than m, the complexity is dominated by nm^3.
The algorithm has been implemented and tested in the computer algebra system
Macaulay 2. We provide a comparison of its performance to the
Buchberger-Moeller algorithm, as built into the system.

implications to numerical integration of differential equations. We distinguish
between rescriptive and descriptive gauge symmetry. Rescriptive gauge symmetry
is, in essence, re-scaling of the independent variable, while descriptive gauge
symmetry is a Yang-Mills-like transformation of the velocity vector field,
adapted to finite-dimensional systems. We show that a simple gauge
transformation of multiple harmonic oscillators driven by chaotic processes can
render an apparently ""disordered"" flow into a regular dynamical process, and
that there exists a remarkable connection between gauge transformations and
reduction theory of ordinary differential equations. Throughout the discussion,
we demonstrate the main ideas by considering examples from diverse engineering
and scientific fields, including quantum mechanics, chemistry, rigid-body
dynamics and information theory.

  are made",,,,"nlin.AO math-ph math.MP",,"  In the paper we present results to develop an irreducible theory of complex
systems in terms of self-organization processes of prime integer relations.
Based on the integers and controlled by arithmetic only the self-organization
processes can describe complex systems by information not requiring further
explanations. Important properties of the description are revealed. It points
to a special type of correlations that do not depend on the distances between
parts, local times and physical signals and thus proposes a perspective on
quantum entanglement. Through a concept of structural complexity the
description also computationally suggests the possibility of a general
optimality condition of complex systems. The computational experiments indicate
that the performance of a complex system may behave as a concave function of
the structural complexity. A connection between the optimality condition and
the majorization principle in quantum algorithms is identified. A global
symmetry of complex systems belonging to the system as a whole, but not
necessarily applying to its embedded parts is presented. As arithmetic fully
determines the breaking of the global symmetry, there is no further need to
explain why the resulting gauge forces exist the way they do and not even
slightly different.

on the developments in banking regulation that have enforced the interest of
the public in validation techniques. When doing so, we put the main emphasis on
the issues with quantitative validation. The techniques discussed here could be
used in order to meet the quantitative regulatory requirements. However, their
appropriateness will depend on the specific conditions under which they are
applied. In order to have a common ground for the description of the different
techniques, we introduce in Section 3 a theoretical framework that will be the
basis for the further considerations. Intuitively, a good rating system should
show higher probabilities of default for the less creditworthy rating grades.
Therefore, in Section 4, we discuss how this monotonicity property is reflected
in the theoretical framework from Section 3. In Section 5, we study the meaning
of discriminatory power and some tools for measuring it in some detail. We will
see that there are tools that might be more appropriate than others for the
purpose of regulatory validation of discriminatory power. The topic in Section
6 is calibration of rating systems. We introduce some of the tests that can be
used for checking correct calibration and discuss the properties of the
different tests. We then conclude in Section 7 with some comments on the

(1985) to approximate the deformation of the earth under changing ice sheet and
ocean loads. That source considers a single ice stream, but we apply their
underlying model to continent-scale ice sheet simulation. Their model combines
Farrell's (1972) elastic spherical earth with a viscous half-space overlain by
an elastic plate lithosphere. The latter half-space model is derivable from
calculations by Cathles (1975). For the elastic spherical earth we use
Farrell's tabulated Green's function, as do Lingle & Clark. For the half-space
model, however, we propose and implement a significantly faster numerical
strategy, a spectral collocation method (Trefethen 2000) based directly on the
Fast Fourier Transform. To verify this method we compare to an integral formula
for a disc load. To compare earth models we build an accumulation history from
a growing similarity solution from (Bueler, et al.~2005) and and simulate the
coupled (ice flow)-(earth deformation) system. In the case of simple isostasy
the exact solution to this system is known. We demonstrate that the magnitudes
of numerical errors made in approximating the ice-earth system are
significantly smaller than pairwise differences between several earth models,
namely, simple isostasy, the current standard model used in ice sheet
simulation (Greve 2001, Hagdorn 2003, Zweck & Huybrechts 2005), and the Lingle
& Clark model. Therefore further efforts to validate different earth models
used in ice sheet simulations are, not surprisingly, worthwhile.

proton with a heavy atom should exist. On the one hand, the electrons of the
atom screen the proton's field. This decreases the repulsion force between the
proton and the nucleus. On the other hand, the attraction force between the
proton and the electrons is directed towards the gradient of the electron
density, i. e. towards the nucleus. For instance, for Z=80 both forces become
equal at approximately 0.6a where a is the Bohr radius. The corresponding
minimum of the proton potential energy is in the region of negative energies
(attraction) that can be of the order of several tens of eV. We propose to call
such a system a binuclear atom.
  In contrast to the molecules where a coupling with a hydrogen atom is due to
an essential modification of one or several states of the outer electrons the
formation of a binuclear atom is a result of collective response of the whole
system of inner electrons to the screened potential of a proton that is well
inside the electron system of the heavy atom. The variation of the wave
function of each electron can be considered as a small perturbation. The bound
state is formed as a result of joint action of a large number of perturbed
inner electrons. The important problem concerning the accuracy of our

and microtubule as the stalk rotates following nucleotide-state transition.
Thus the enigmatic communication from the ATP binding site in the globular
domain to the far MT-binding site in the tip of the stalk, which is
prerequisite in conventional models, is not required. Using the present model,

arbitrary $2^\nb$ unitary matrix acting on $\nb$ qubits, into a sequence of
elementary operations (SEO). There are many possible ways of decomposing a
unitary matrix into a SEO, and some of these decompositions have shorter length
(are more efficient) than others. Finding an optimum (shortest) decomposition
is a very hard task, and is not our intention here. A less ambitious, more
doable task is to find methods for optimizing small segments of a SEO. Call
these methods piecewise optimizations. Piecewise optimizations involve
replacing a small quantum circuit by an equivalent one with fewer CNOTs. Two
circuits are said to be equivalent if one of them multiplied by some external
local operations equals the other. This equivalence relation between circuits
has its own class functions, which we call circuit invariants. Dressed CNOTs
are a simple yet very useful generalization of standard CNOTs. After discussing
circuit invariants and dressed CNOTs, we give some methods for simplifying
2-qubit and 3-qubit circuits. We include with this paper software (written in
Octave/Matlab) that checks many of the algorithms proposed in the paper.

the pair of statements {BKS is valid; dim H greater than or equal to 3} are
inconsistent. Here we show, more radically, that the pair actually contradicts
the dimensionality of the space itself, by implying that there can exist at
most a single one-dimensional projector acting on H. Our derivation involves
only elementary inner product spaces. It is non-probabilistic, inequality-free,
state independent, does not use entanglement, and is simultaneously valid in
all dimensions three or greater.

systems of differing dimensions along with a corresponding method of
computation. A typical application is to compare the propagator of the actual
(real) process with the propagator of the desired (ideal) process; the former
being of a higher dimension then the latter. The proposed measure has the
advantage of dealing with possibly correlated inputs, but at the expense of
working on the whole space and not just the information bearing part as is
usually the case, i.e., no partial trace operation is explicitly involved. It
is also shown that the distance measure and an average measure of channel
fidelity both depend on the size of the same matrix: as the matrix size
increases, distance decreases and fidelity increases.

paper, we study, for the first time explicitly, space-bounded quantum
algorithms for computational problems where the input is given not as a whole,
but bit by bit. We show that there exist such problems that a quantum computer
can solve using exponentially less work space than a classical computer. More
precisely, we introduce a very natural and simple model of a space-bounded
quantum online machine and prove an exponential separation of classical and
quantum online space complexity, in the bounded-error setting and for a total
language. The language we consider is inspired by a communication problem (the
set intersection function) that Buhrman, Cleve and Wigderson used to show an
almost quadratic separation of quantum and classical bounded-error
communication complexity. We prove that, in the framework of online space
complexity, the separation becomes exponential.
