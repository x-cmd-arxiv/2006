  Hasinger, B. Leibundgut (Springer: Heidelberg 2006)",,"10.1007/978-3-540-74713-0_57",,"astro-ph",,"  Nuclear activity in galaxies is closely connected to galactic mergers and
supermassive black holes (SBH). Galactic mergers perturb substantially the
dynamics of gas and stellar population in the merging galaxies, and they are
expected to lead to formation of supermassive binary black holes (BBH) in the
center of mass of the galaxies merged. A scheme is proposed here that connects
the peak magnitude of the nuclear activity with evolution of a BBH system. The
scheme predicts correctly the relative fractions of different types of active
galactic nuclei (AGN) and explains the connection between the galactic type and
the strength of the nuclear activity. It shows that most powerful AGN should
result from mergers with small mass ratios, while weaker activity is produced
in unequal mergers. The scheme explains also the observed lack of galaxies with
two active nuclei, which is attributed to effective disruption of accretion
disks around the secondary in BBH systems with masses of the primary smaller
than ~10^10 solar masses.

we have used the ``Plank Reference Sky Model''; as for the extragalactic point
sources, our simulations - which comprise all the source populations relevant
in this frequency interval - are based on up-to-date cosmological evolution
models for sources. To consistently compare the capabilities of different
filters for the compilation of the - hopefully - most complete blind catalogue
of point sources, we have obtained three catalogues by filtering the simulated
sky maps with: the Matched Filter (MF), the Mexican Hat Wavelet (MHW1) and the
Mexican Hat Wavelet 2 (MHW2), the first two members of the MHW Family. For the
nine Planck frequencies we show the number of real and spurious detections and
the percentage of spurious detections at different flux detection limits as
well as the completeness level of the catalogues and the average errors in the
estimation of the flux density of detected sources. Allowing a 5 % of spurious
detections, we obtain the following number of detections by filtering with the
MHW2 an area equivalent to half of the sky: 580 (30 GHz), 342 (44 GHz), 341 (70

yield similar results, whereas the MHW1 performs worse in some cases and
especially at very low fluxes. This is a relevant result, because we are able
to obtain comparable results with the well known Matched Filter and with this
specific wavelet, the MHW2, which is much easier to implement and use.

dominant. At this stage the shell tends to fragment creating clumps with

primordial nucleosynthesis free nucleons are transformed into bound nuclides,
primarily helium, and the nuclear binding energies are radiated away, further
reducing the average mass per baryon. In particular, the reduction in the

modeling of Type I X-ray bursts on a rectangular patch on the surface of a
non-rotating neutron star. Because such phenomena involve decidedly subsonic
flows, the timestep increase offered by the LMNA makes routine simulations of
these deflagrations feasible in an environment where strong gravity produces
significant stratification, while allowing for potentially significant lateral
differences in temperature and density. The model is employed to simulate the
heating, peak, and initial cooling stages in the deep envelope layers of a
burst. During the deflagration, Benard-like cells naturally fill up a
vertically expanding convective layer. The Mach number is always less than 0.15
throughout the simulation, thus justifying the low Mach number approximation.
While the convective layer is superadiabatic on average, significant
fluctuations in adiabaticity occur within it on subconvective timescales. Due
to convective layer expansion, significant compositional mixing naturally
occurs, but tracer particle penetration through the convective layer boundaries
on convective timescales is temporary and spatially limited. Thus, mixing
occurs on the relatively slow burst timescale through thermal expansion of the
convective layer rather than from mass penetration of the convective layer
boundary through particle convection. At the convective layer boundaries where
mixing is less efficient, the actual temperature gradient more closely follows
the Ledoux criteria.

galaxies finding that quasar environments systematically avoid high density
regions. Their mean environments correspond to galaxy density enhancements
similar to those of typical galaxies. We have also explored several galaxy
properties in these environments, such as spectral types, specific star
formation rates, concentration indexes, colours and active nuclei activity. We
conclude that low redshift quasar neighbourhoods (r_p < 1 Mpc h^-1, Delta V <

disk-type morphology than galaxies in groups and in the field. Although star
formation activity is thought to be significantly triggered by interactions, we
find that quasar fueling may not require the presence of a close companion
galaxy (r_p < 100 kpc h^-1, Delta V< 350 km/s). As a test of the unified AGN

in the quasar population arises from self-regulating feedback, via an outflow
mechanism. Using a detailed hydrodynamic simulation we calculate the luminosity
function of quasars down to a redshift of z=1 in a large, cosmologically
representative volume. Outflows are included explicitly by tracking halo
mergers and driving shocks into the surrounding intergalactic medium. Our
results are in excellent agreement with measurements of the spatial
distribution of quasars, and we detect an intriguing excess of galaxy-quasar
pairs at very short separations. We also reproduce the anti-hierarchical
turnoff in the quasar luminosity function, however, the magnitude of the
turn-off falls short of that observed as well as that predicted by analogous
semi-analytic models. The difference can be traced to the treatment of gas
heating within galaxies. The simulated galaxy cluster L_X-T relationship is
close to that observed for z~1 clusters, but the simulated galaxy groups at z=1
are significantly perturbed by quasar outflows, suggesting that measurements of
X-ray emission in high-redshift groups could well be a ""smoking gun"" for the
AGN heating hypothesis.

the hot gas morphology has surprisingly little in common with the shape of the
stellar distribution. We observe no correlation between optical and X-ray
ellipticities in the inner regions where stellar mass dominates over dark
matter. A shallow correlation would be expected if the gas had settled into
hydrostatic equilibrium with the gravitational potential. Instead, observed
X-ray ellipticities exceed optical ellipticities in many cases. We exclude
rotation as the dominant factor to produce the gas ellipticities. The gas
appears disturbed, and hydrostatic equilibrium is the exception rather than the
rule. Nearly all hydrostatic models can be ruled out at 99% confidence, based
of their inability to reproduce the optical-X-ray correlation and large X-ray
ellipticities. Hydrostatic models not excluded are those in which dark matter
either dominates over stellar mass inside the inner half-light radius or has a
prominently cigar-shaped distribution, both of which can be ruled out on other
grounds. We conclude that, even for rather X-ray faint elliptical galaxies, the
gas is at least so far out of equilibrium that it does not retain any
information about the shape of the potential, and that X-ray derived radial
mass profiles may be in error by factors of order unity.

postulated theories. This is especially important for lensing and dynamics of
barely virialised galaxy clusters with typical gravity of scale $\sim a_0 \sim
1\AA{\rm s}^{-2}$. The original MOND formula, the classical single field
modification of the Poisson equation, and the multi-field general relativistic
theory of Bekenstein (TeVeS) all lead to different predictions as we stray from
spherical symmetry. In this paper, we study a class of analytical MONDian
models for a system with a semi-Hernquist baryonic profile. After presenting
the analytical distribution function of the baryons in spherical limits, we
develop orbits and gravitational lensing of the models in non-spherical

a weak lensing signal resembling that of the merging galaxy cluster 1E 0657-56

highly non-spherical models to show the subtle differences between the single

gap by presenting new, simultaneous ISOCAM and ISOPHOT observations over the 7
- 200 micron range for half the sample. A measurement of the position of the
synchrotron peak frequency, nu_peak, can provide information about particle
acceleration mechanisms and constrain the inverse Compton radiation that will
be detected by up-coming new gamma-ray missions. We have observed 17 1 Jy BL
Lacertae objects with the camera and the photometer on board the Infrared Space

novel correction, which mitigates the effect of chopping for faint sources.
Using our new ISO data, complemented by nearly-simultaneous radio and optical
observations for 10 and 4 objects respectively, and other multi-frequency data,
we have built the spectral energy distributions of our sources (plus a
previously published one) and derived the rest-frame nu_peak. Its distribution
is centered at 10^13 Hz (30 micron) and is very narrow, with 60% of the BL Lacs
in the 1 - 3 10^13 Hz range. Given our set of simultaneous infrared data, these
represent the best determinations available of the synchrotron peak frequencies

remnants, the radio emission is non-thermal (synchrotron emission), but
asymmetries and multiple emission components clearly demonstrate that contrary

distribution of stars of different masses within clusters as a function of the
cluster age. Results: No significant dependence of the cluster size on location
in the Galaxy is detected for younger clusters (< 200 Myr), whereas older
clusters inside the solar orbit turned out to be, on average, smaller than
outside. Also, small old clusters are preferentially found close to the
Galactic plane, whereas larger ones more frequently live farther away from the
plane and at larger Galactocentric distances. For clusters with (V - M_V) <
10.5, a clear dependence of the apparent radius on age has been detected: the
cluster radii decrease by a factor of about 2 from an age of 10 Myr to an age
of 1 Gyr. A detailed analysis shows that this observed effect can be explained
by mass segregation and does not necessarily reflect a real decrease of cluster
radii. We found evidence for the latter for the majority of clusters older than
30 Myr. Among the youngest clusters (between 5 and 30 Myr), there are some
clusters with a significant grade of mass segregation, whereas some others show
no segregation at all. At a cluster age between 50 and 100 Myrs, the

Maps of the H2 line ratios reveal little spatial variation in the typical

the equilibrium value of 3 attained at the measured gas temperatures. The
non-equilibrium ortho-to-para ratios are characteristic of temperatures as low

with theoretical models in which the conversion of para- to ortho-H2 behind the

two scenarios: the first one where the disk is formed by successive outbursts
of the central star. A low-density region is developing above the star and
slowly grows outward and forms a ring-like structure that will gradually
excavate the disk. The second one, where a slowly decreasing mass loss, for
instance due to a decrease of the radiative force through an opacity change at
the base of the photosphere, may also be responsible for the vanishing of the
circumstellar disk. Results. We obtain that a clear signature of the disk
dissipation following the ring scenario will be the disappearance of the high
velocity tails in the emission lines and a nearly constant peaks separation.
Moreover, we found that following the ring-like scenario the visibilities must
show an increasing second lobe, an increase of the value of the first zero and,
assuming an unresolved central star, a first zero of the visibility curves that
appends at shorter baselines as far as the disk is been excavate. We propose to
use the AMBER instrument on the VLTI to probe if the the ring scenario is the
one that rule the Be phenomenon.

of average columnar cross-sectional areas due to the evaporation rate, the

in experiments where the evaporation rate depended on lamp height and time, in

The key role of planar oxygen vibrations implied by the isotope shift and other

bidisperse disks are studied numerically in small systems. The packings are
created by successively compressing or decompressing a system of soft purely
repulsive disks, followed by energy minimization, until only infinitesimal
particle overlaps remain. For systems of up to 14 particles most of the MS
packings were generated. We find that the packings are not equally probable as
has been assumed in recent thermodynamic descriptions of granular systems.
Instead, the frequency distribution, averaged over each packing-fraction
interval $\Delta \phi$, grows exponentially with increasing $\phi$. Moreover,
within each packing-fraction interval MS packings occur with frequencies $f_k$
that differ by many orders of magnitude. Also, key features of the frequency
distribution do not change when we significantly alter the packing-generation
algorithm--for example frequent packings remain frequent and rare ones remain
rare. These results indicate that the frequency distribution of MS packings is
strongly influenced by geometrical properties of the multidimensional
configuration space. By adding thermal fluctuations to a set of the MS
packings, we were able to examine a number of local features of configuration
space near each packing including the time required for a given packing to
break to a distinct one, which enabled us to estimate the energy barriers that
separate one packing from another. We found a positive correlation between the
packing frequencies and the heights of the lowest energy barriers $\epsilon_0$.
We also examined displacement fluctuations away from the MS packings to
correlate the size and shape of the local basins near each packing to the
packing frequencies.

the flow equation, given by Darcy's law, and assuming that the change in scale
does not imply a change in governing physical principles, a new equation is
obtained, identical in form to the original. Haar wavelets allow us to relate
the pressures to their averages and apply the transformation to the entire

coarse permeabilities.
  Focusing on the mean-field approximation leads to an up-scaling where the

Leading-order (LO) models such as PYTHIA need to be tuned to describe

describe the pt-spectra of strange resonances. More rigorous Next-to-Leading
order pQCD calculations using parameterized fragmentation functions for quarks

released $e^{+}e^{-}$ data from light quark flavor tagged analyses allowing for
the first time to make precise parameterizations of light flavor separated

Furthermore we show that pQCD fails to describe the observed enhancement of
baryon-to-meson ratio at intermediate pt (2-6 GeV/c), which may be a first
indication of other, non-perturbative mechanisms at play in $p+p$ collisions at

for nonstandard interactions (NSI) of neutrinos with matter in the nu_e- nu_tau

oscillation parameters are changed from their standard values. Short and medium
baseline neutrino beams can break this degeneracy by measuring the true vacuum
oscillation parameters with the muon neutrino disappearance mode, for which the
matter effects are negligible or subdominant. These experiments can also search
for the nu_e-nu_tau flavor changing effects directly, by looking for
nu_mu->nu_e conversion caused by the intervening matter. We discuss both of
these methods for the case of MINOS. We find that, while the present MINOS data
on nu_mu disappearance induce only minor changes on the constraints on the NSI
parameters, the situation will improve markedly with the planned increase of
the statistics by an order of magnitude. In that case, the precision will be
enough to distinguish certain presently allowed NSI scenarios from the no-NSI
case. NSI per quark of about 10% the size of the standard weak interaction
could give a nu_mu - nu_e conversion probability of the order ~ 10^{-2},
measurable by MINOS in the same high statistics scenario. In this nu_mu - nu_e
channel, the small effects of NSI could be comparable or larger than the vacuum
contribution of the small angle theta_{13}. The expected theta_{13} bound at
MINOS should be more properly interpreted as a bound in the theta_{13}-NSI
parameter space.

the gauge group U(N_1)\times U(N_2)\times ...\times U(N_m) coupled to matter
fields transforming in the (anti)-fundamental, bi-fundamental and adjoint
representations. We pay particular attention to overall trace-U(1) factors of
the gauge group which are affected by the ultraviolet/infrared mixing.
Typically, these trace-U(1) gauge fields do not decouple sufficiently fast in
the infrared, and lead to sizable Lorentz symmetry violating effects in the
low-energy effective theory. In a 4-dimensional theory on a continuous
space-time making these effects unobservable would require making the effects
of noncommutativity tiny, M_NC>>M_P. This severely limits the phenomenological
prospects of such models. However, adding additional universal extra dimensions
the trace-U(1) factors decouple with a power law and the constraint on the
noncommutativity scale is weakened considerably. Finally, we briefly mention
some interesting properties of the photon that could arise if the
noncommutative theory is modified at a high energy scale.

smoothing of the image followed by a statistical hypothesis testing on the

is said to be a significant edge point if the gradient at this point is larger
than a threshold $s(\eps)$ defined by: if the image $I$ is pure noise, then
$\P(\norm{\nabla I}\geq s(\eps) \bigm| \Delta I = 0) \leq\eps$. In other words,
a significant edge is an edge which has a very low probability to be there
because of noise. We will show that the threshold $s(\eps)$ can be explicitly
computed in the case of a stationary Gaussian noise. In images we are
interested in, which are obtained by tomographic reconstruction from a
radiograph, this method fails since the Gaussian noise is not stationary
anymore. But in this case again, we will be able to give the law of the

spiral turbulence, spatiotemporal chaos and rapid, irregular activation. Thus
spiral-wave activity in cardiac tissue has been studied extensively.
Nevertheless many aspects of such spiral dynamics remain elusive because of the
intrinsically high-dimensional nature of the cardiac-dynamical system. In
particular, the role of tissue heterogeneities in the stability of cardiac
spiral waves is still being investigated. Experiments with conduction blocks in
cardiac tissue yield a variety of results: some suggest that blocks can
eliminate VF partially or completely, leading to VT or quiescence, but others
show that VF is unaffected by obstacles. We propose theoretically that this
variety of results is a natural manifestation of a fractal boundary that must
separate the basins of the attractors associated, respectively, with VF and VT.
We substantiate this with extensive numerical studies of Panfilov and Luo-Rudy
I models, where we show that the suppression of VF depends sensitively on the

  in Brain Dynamics","12 pages, Submitted to Physical Rev. E",,,"PACS No.:87.10.+e","q-bio.NC quant-ph",,"  With an increasing amount of experimental evidence pouring in from
neurobiological investigations, it is quite appropriate to study viable
reductionist models which may explain some of the features of brain activities.
It is now quite well known that the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) Model has been quite
successful in explaining the neural phenomena. The idea of circuit equivalents
and the membrane voltages corresponding to neurons have been remarkable which
is essentially a classical result. In view of some recent results which show
that quantum mechanics may be important at suitable length scales inside the
brain, the question which becomes quite important is to find out a proper
quantum analogue of the HH scheme which will reduce to the well known HH model
in a suitable limit. From the ideas of neuro-manifold and the relevance of
quantum mechanics at some length scales in the ion channels, we investigate
this situation in this paper by taking into consideration the Schr\""odinger
equation in an arbitrary manifold with a metric, which is in some sense a
special case of the heat kernel equation. The next important approach we have
taken in order to bring about it's relevance in brain studies and to make
connection with HH models is to find out a plausible circuit equivalents of it.
What we do realize is that for a proper quantum mechanical description and it's
circuit implementation of the same we need to incorporate the non commutativity
inside the circuit model. It has been realized here that the metric is a
dynamical entity governing space time and for considering equivalent circuits
it plays a very distinct role. We have used the methods of stochastic
quantization and have constructed a specific case here and see that HH model
inductances gets renormalized in the quantum limit.

perform a desired operation as a product of them. The corresponding
computational problem is approximating an arbitrary unitary as a product in a
topological generating set of $SU(d)$. The problem is known to be solvable in
time $polylog(1/\epsilon)$ with product length $polylog(1/\epsilon)$, where the
implicit constants depend on the given generators. The existing algorithms
solve the problem but they need a very slow and space consuming preparatory
stage. This stage runs in time exponential in $d^2$ and requires memory of size
exponential in $d^2$. In this paper we present methods which make the
implementation of the existing algorithms easier. We present heuristic methods
which make a time-length trade-off in the preparatory step. We decrease the
running time and the used memory to polynomial in $d$ but the length of the
products approximating the desired operations will increase (by a factor which
depends on $d$). We also present a simple method which can be used for
decomposing a unitary into a product of group commutators for $2<d<256$, which
