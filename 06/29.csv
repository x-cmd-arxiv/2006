with galaxy clusters, for the first time taking into account the dynamic nature
of the cluster gas and detailed cluster physics. The simulations successfully
reproduce the observed morphologies of radio sources in clusters. We find that
cluster inhomogeneities and large scale flows have significant impact on the
morphology of the radio source and cannot be ignored a-priori when
investigating radio source dynamics. Morphological comparison suggests that the
gas in the centres of clusters like Virgo and Abell 4059 shows significant
shear and/or rotation. We find that shear and rotation in the intra-cluster
medium move large amounts of cold material back into the path of the jet,
ensuring that subsequent jet outbursts encounter a sufficient column density of
gas to couple with the inner cluster gas, thus alleviating the problem of
evacuated channels discussed in the recent literature. The same effects
redistribute the excess energy Delta_E deposited by the jets, making the
distribution of Delta_E at late times consistent with being isotropic.

targets for probing the existence of supernova fallback disks, since
irradiation of a disk by a central X-ray source should lead to an infrared
excess. We used ground-based optical and near-infrared imaging and Spitzer
Space Telescope mid-infrared imaging to search for optical/infrared
counterparts at the X-ray point source positions measured by the Chandra X-Ray
Observatory. We did not detect any counterparts, and hence find no evidence for
fallback disks around any of these sources. In PKS 1209-52, we are able to
exclude a nearby optical/infrared candidate counterpart. In RCW 103, a blend of
3 faint stars at the X-ray source position prevents us from deriving useful
limits. For the other targets, the upper limits on the infrared/X-ray flux
ratio are as deep as (1.0--1.7)$\times 10^{-4}$. Comparing these limits to the
ratio of $\approx 6\times10^{-5}$ measured for 4U 0142+61 (a young pulsar

brane cosmology. In this paper we investigate the viability of this idea by
considering a particular class of brane scenarios in which a large scale
modification of gravity arises due to a gravitational \emph{leakage} into extra
dimensions. To this end, differently from other recent analyses, we combine
\emph{orthogonal} age and distance measurements at intermediary and high

indirect estimates of the age of the Universe from the most recent Large-Scale

recent detection of the baryon acoustic oscillations at $z = 0.35$. In
agreement with other recent analyses we show that, although compatible with
these age and distance measurements, a spatially closed scenario is largely
favoured by the current observational data. By restricting our analysis to a
spatially flat universe, we also find that the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is
favoured over the particular braneworld scenario here investigated.

model-independent constraints on dark energy, it is important to precisely
measure the cosmic expansion history, H(z), in continuous redshift bins from z
\~ 0-2 (the redshift range in which dark energy is important). SNe Ia at z > 1
are not readily accessible from the ground because the bulk of their light has
shifted into the near-infrared where the sky background is overwhelming; hence
a space mission is required to probe dark energy using SNe. Because of its
unique near-infrared wavelength coverage (0.8-4.2 microns), JEDI has the
advantage of observing SNe Ia in the rest frame J band for the entire redshift
range of 0 < z < 2, where they are less affected by dust, and appear to be
nearly perfect standard candles. During the first year of JEDI operations,
spectra and light curves will be obtained for ~4,000 SNe Ia at z < 2. The
resulting constraints on dark energy are discussed, with special emphasis on
the improved precision afforded by the rest frame near-infrared data.

neutral gas density. Over the redshift range $[2.2;5.5]$ we find
$\Omega_{HI}^{(DLA)}=0.97^{+0.08+0.28}_{-0.06-0.15} \cdot 10^{-3}$, where the

apparently entering the luminous blue variable phase, and an eclipsing
companion (star B) that may have already evolved beyond this phase to become a
Wolf-Rayet star. In this paper we present the results from FUSE observations
obtained in 1999, 2000, and 2002 and one far-UV observation obtained by
ORFEUS/BEFS in 1993 shortly before the first eruption of HD 5980. The eight
phase-resolved spectra obtained by FUSE in 2002 are analyzed in the context of
a wind-eclipse model. This analysis shows that the wind of the eruptor obeyed a
very fast velocity law in 2002, which is consistent with the line-driving
mechanism. Large amplitude line-profile variations on the orbital period are
shown to be due to the eclipse of star B by the wind of star A, although the
eclipse due to gas flowing in the direction of star B is absent. This can only
be explained if the wind of star A is not spherically symmetric, or if the
eclipsed line radiation is ""filled-in"" by emission originating from somewhere
else in the system, e.g., in the wind-wind collision region. Except for a
slightly lower wind speed, the ORFEUS/BEFS spectrum is very similar to the
spectrum obtained by FUSE at the same orbital phase: there is no indication of
the impending eruption. However, the trend for decreasing wind velocity
suggests the occurrence of the ""bi-stability"" mechanism, which in turn implies
that the restructuring of the circumbinary environment caused by the transition
from ""fast, rarefied wind"" to ""slow, dense wind"" was observed as the eruptive
event. The underlying mechanism responsible for the long-term decrease in wind
velocity that precipitated this change remains an open issue.

microquasar models for Ultra-Luminous X-ray sources (ULXs), exploring the
possibility that their dominant power-law component is produced by a
relativistic jet, even at near-Eddington mass accretion rates. We do this by
first constructing a generalized disk--jet theoretical framework in which some
fraction of the total accretion power Pa is efficiently removed from the
accretion disk by a magnetic torque responsible for jet formation. Thus, for
different black hole masses, mass accretion rates and magnetic coupling
strength, we self-consistently calculate the relative importance of the
modified disk spectrum, as well as the overall jet emission due to synchrotron
and Compton processes. In general, transferring accretion power to a jet makes
the disk fainter and cooler than a standard disk at the same mass accretion
rate; this may explain why the soft spectral component appears less prominent
than the dominant power-law component in most bright ULXs. We show that the
apparent X-ray luminosity and spectrum predicted by the microquasar model are
consistent with the observed properties of most ULXs. We predict that the radio
synchrotron jet emission is too faint to be detected at the typical threshold
of radio surveys to date. This is consistent with the high rate of
non-detections over detections in radio counterpart searches. Conversely, we
conclude that the observed radio emission found associated with a few ULXs
cannot be due to beamed synchrotron emission from a relativistic jet.

red galaxies in Abell 1185 is adequately described by a Schechter function,

Color-Magnitude Diagrams. The main feature of AL~3 is a prominent blue extended
Horizontal Branch. Its Color-Magnitude Diagrams match those of the intermediate
metallicity cluster M~5. The cluster is projected in a rich bulge field, also
contaminated by the disk main sequence. The globular cluster is located in the
Galactic bulge at a distance from the Sun d$_{\odot}$ = 6.0$\pm$0.5 kpc. The
reddening is E(B-V)=0.36$\pm$0.03 and the metallicity is estimated to be [Fe/H]
$\approx$ -1.3$\pm$0.25. AL~3 is probably one of the least massive globular
clusters of the Galaxy.

processes in these sources, as a function of X-ray state and luminosity. A
global correlation is found between OIR and X-ray luminosity for low-mass black
hole candidate XBs (BHXBs) in the hard X-ray state, of the form L_OIR is
proportional to Lx^0.6. This correlation holds over 8 orders of magnitude in Lx
and includes data from BHXBs in quiescence and at large distances (LMC and
M31). A similar correlation is found in low-mass neutron star XBs (NSXBs) in
the hard state. For BHXBs in the soft state, all the near-infrared (NIR) and
some of the optical emission is suppressed below the correlation, a behaviour
indicative of the jet switching off/on in transition to/from the soft state. We
compare these relations to theoretical models of a number of emission
processes. We find that X-ray reprocessing in the disc and emission from the
jets both predict a slope close to 0.6 for BHXBs, and both contribute to the
OIR in BHXBs in the hard state, the jets producing ~90 percent of the NIR
emission at high luminosities. X-ray reprocessing dominates the OIR in NSXBs in
the hard state, with possible contributions from the jets (only at high
luminosity) and the viscously heated disc. We also show that the optically
thick jet spectrum of BHXBs extends to near the K-band. (abridged)

subtracting the stellar continuum obtained from spectral synthesis. Our
analysis is based on photoionization models computed using the stellar ionizing
radiation predicted by Starburst 99 and, for the AGNs, a broken power-law

such cases exist. We propose a new divisory line between ``pure'' NSF galaxies

classification diagram, the DEW diagram, plotting D_n(4000) vs
max(EW[OII],EW[NeIII]). This diagram can be used with optical spectra for
galaxies with redshifts up to z = 1.3, meaning an important progress over
classifications proposed up to now. Since the DEW diagram requires only a small
range in wavelength, it can also be used at even larger redshifts in suitable
atmospheric windows. It also has the advantage of not requiring stellar
synthesis analysis to subtract the stars and of allowing one to see ALL the
galaxies in the same diagram, including passive galaxies.

core-collapse supernovae and long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), and
quantify a possible metallicity dependence of the efficiency of producing
LGRBs. We use a sample of 16 CC SNe and 16 LGRBs from Fruchter et al. (2006)
which have similar redshift distributions to eliminate galaxy evolution biases.
We make a forward prediction of their host galaxy luminosity distributions from
the overall cosmic metallicity distribution of star formation. This appoach is
supported by the finding that LGRB hosts follow the L-Z relations of
star-forming galaxies. We then compare predictions for metallicity-dependent
event efficiencies with the observed host data. We find that UV-based SFR
estimates predict the hosts distribution of CC SNe perfectly well in a
metallicity-independent form. In contrast, LGRB hosts are fainter on average by
one magnitude, almost as faint as the Large Magellanic Cloud. Assuming this is
a metallicity effect, the present data are insufficient to discriminate between
a sharp metallicity cutoff and a soft decrease in efficiency towards higher
metallicity. For a sharp cut-off, however, we find a best value for the cutoff
metallicity, as reflected in the oxygen abundance, 12+log (O/H)_lim ~ 8.7+/-0.3
at 95% confidence including systematic uncertainties on the calibration of
Kobulnicky & Kewley (2004). This value is somewhat lower than the traditionally
quoted value for the Sun, but is comparable to the revised solar oxygen
abundance (Asplund, Grevesse & Sauval 2005). LGRB models that require sharp
metallicity cutoffs well below ~1/2 the revised solar metallicity appear to be
effectively ruled out (abridged).

increasing the distance the influence of inhomogeneities sharply reduces. The
solitary spectral lines which have the distance to the nearest lines quite
large is slightly changed due to small inhomogeneities. Owing to such selective
influence of inhomogeneities on the spectral lines the effective spectrum
rarefaction appears. Both the shift and broadening of spectral lines as well as

upper bound for the sustainable shear stress, which we analyze using an
optimization procedure inspired by the so-called force network ensemble. We
establish a relation between the maximum possible shear resistance and the
friction coefficient between individual grains, and find that anisotropies of
the contact network (or the fabric tensor) only have a subdominant effect.
These results can be considered the hyperstatic limit of the force network
ensemble and we discuss possible implications for real systems. Finally, we
argue how force anisotropies can be related quantitatively to experimental
measurements of the effective elastic constants.

the assumed duality: The masses of resonances cluster near certain equidistant

(Higgless) Stueckelberg extension of the Standard Model (StSM) gauge group
which naturally leads to a very narrow $Z'$ resonance. Comparison is made to
another class of models, i.e., models based on the warped geometry which also
lead to a narrow resonance via a massive graviton ($G$). Methods of
distinguishing the StSM $Z'$ from the massive graviton at the LHC are analyzed
using the dilepton final state in the Drell-Yan process $pp\to Z'\to l^+l^-$
and $pp\to G \to l^+l^-$. It is shown that the signature spaces in the $\sigma

graviton are distinct. The angular distributions in the dilepton C-M system are

emerges from the analysis is the observation that the StSM model with $Z'$
widths even in the MeV and sub-MeV range for $Z'$ masses extending in the TeV
region can produce detectable cross section signals in the dilepton channel in
the Drell-Yan process with luminosities accessible at the LHC. While the result
is derived within the specific StSM class of models, the capability of the LHC

asymmetry, which stems from the decay of the lightest right-handed neutrino,
are proportional to their respective contributions to the light neutrino mass
matrix. However, in our minimal type II seesaw model, this CP asymmetry is just
given by the one-loop vertex correction involving the triplet Higgs, even
though the contribution of the triplet Higgs does not dominate the light
neutrino masses. For illustration, the Fritzsch-type lepton mass matrices are
considered.

how, for leptonic binary systems, two-angles solutions with discrete values
pi/4 [pi/2] and pi/2 [pi] (in addition to the trivial case 0 [pi]) arise when
weak leptonic currents of mass eigenstates approximately satisfy the two
properties of universality and vanishing of their non-diagonal neutral
components. Charged weak currents are also discussed, which leads to a few
remarks concerning oscillations. We argue that quarks, which cannot be defined
on shell because of the confinement property, are instead more naturally
endowed with unitary Cabibbo-like mixing matrices, involving a single
unconstrained mixing angle. The similarity between neutrinos and neutral kaons
is outlined, together with the role of the symmetry by exchange of families.

show that quantum states in the bulk correspond to multiply-occupied single

the free theory level as well as in the instanton vacuum. We conclude with a

$\mathcal{X}_{i,\ell}=(X_i,...,X_{i+\ell-1}),i\geq 1$, are overlapping blocks
of length $\ell$ and where $f_{in}$ are Borel measurable functions. This paper
establishes valid joint asymptotic expansions of general orders for the joint
distribution of the sums $\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$ and $\sum_{i=1}^nY_{in}$ under weak
dependence conditions on the sequence $\{X_i\}_{i=-\infty}^{\infty}$ when the
block length $\ell$ grows to infinity. In contrast to the classical Edgeworth
expansion results where the terms in the expansions are given by powers of
$n^{-1/2}$, the expansions derived here are mixtures of two series, one in
powers of $n^{-1/2}$ and the other in powers of $[\frac{n}{\ell}]^{-1/2}$.
Applications of the main results to (i) expansions for Studentized statistics
of time series data and (ii) second order correctness of the blocks of blocks

in some energy set T^cM= E^{-1}(c), then there exists an exact $
C^\infty$-perturbation of the 2-form $ \Omega $ such that the new magnetic flow
has positive topological entropy in T^cM. We also prove that if the magnetic
flow has an infinite number of closed orbits in T^cM, then there exists an
exact C^1-perturbation of $ \Omega $ with positive topological entropy in T^cM.
The proof of the last result is based on an analog of Franks' lemma for
magnetic flows on surfaces, that is proven in this work, and Ma\~n\'e's
techniques on dominated splitting. As a consequence of those results, an exact
magnetic flow on S^2 in high energy levels admits a C^1-perturbation with
positive topological entropy. In the appendices we show that an exact magnetic
flow on the torus in high energy levels admits a $ C^\infty $-perturbation with
positive topological entropy.

is bounded from below by the index of the Z_2-space Hom(K_2,G) plus two. We
show that the cohomological index of Hom(K_2,G) is also greater than the
cohomological index of the Z_2-space Hom(C_{2r+1}, G) for r>0. This gives a new
and simple proof of the strong form of the graph colouring theorem by Babson
and Kozlov, which had been conjectured by Lovasz, and at the same time shows
that it never gives a stronger bound than can be obtained by Hom(K_2, G). The
proof extends ideas introduced by Zivaljevic in a previous elegant proof of a
special case. We then generalise the arguments and obtain conditions under
which corresponding results hold for other graphs in place of C_{2r+1}. This
enables us to find an infinite family of test graphs of chromatic number 4
among the Kneser graphs.
  Our main new result is a description of the Z_2-homotopy type of the direct
limit of the system of all the spaces Hom(C_{2r+1}, G) in terms of the
Z_2-homotopy type of Hom(K_2, G). A corollary is that the coindex of Hom(K_2,
G) does not exceed the coindex of Hom(C_{2r+1}, G) by more then one if r is
chosen sufficiently large. Thus the graph colouring bound in the theorem by
Babson & Kozlov is also never weaker than that from Lovasz' proof of the Kneser

studied within a relativistic mean-field hadron model at finite temperature

calculated and the collective modes are obtained. The unstable modes are
discussed and the spinodals, which separate the stable from the unstable
regions, are shown for different values of the momentum transfer at various
temperatures. The critical temperatures are compared with the ones obtained in
a system without electrons. The largest critical temperature, 12.39 MeV, occurs
for a proton fraction y_p=0.47. For y_p=0.3 we get $T_{cr}$ =5 MeV and for
y_p>0.495 $T_cr\lesssim 8$ MeV.
  It is shown that at finite temperature the distillation effect in asymmetric
matter is not so efficient and that electron effects are particularly important
for small momentum transfers.

General Relativity will use optical resonators which are used for laser
frequency stabilization. These devices are used for carrying out tests of the

gravitational redshift. As the resonator frequency not only depends on the
speed of light but also on the resonator length, the quality of these
measurements is very sensitive to elastic deformations of the optical resonator
itself. As a consequence, a detailed knowledge about the deformations of the
cavity is necessary. Therefore in this article we investigate the modeling of
optical resonators in a space environment. Usually for simulation issues the
Finite Element Method (FEM) is applied in order to investigate the influence of
disturbances on the resonator measurements. However, for a careful control of
the numerical quality of FEM simulations a comparison with an analytical
solution of a simplified resonator model is beneficial. In this article we
present an analytical solution for the problem of an elastic, isotropic,
homogeneous free-flying cylinder in space under the influence of a tidal
gravitational force. The solution is gained by solving the linear equations of
elasticity for special boundary conditions. The applicability of using FEM
codes for these simulations shall be verified through the comparison of the
analytical solution with the results gained within the FEM code.

Here in this paper, it is shown that the continuous-time quantum walk on any
arbitrary graph can be investigated by spectral distribution method, simply by
using Krylov subspace-Lanczos algorithm to generate orthonormal bases of
Hilbert space of quantum walk isomorphic to orthogonal polynomials. Also new
type of graphs possessing generalized quantum decomposition have been
introduced, where this is achieved simply by relaxing some of the constrains
imposed on QD graphs and it is shown that both in QD and GQD graphs, the unit
vectors of strata are identical with the orthonormal basis produced by Lanczos
algorithm. Moreover, it is shown that probability amplitude of observing walk
at a given vertex is proportional to its coefficient in the corresponding unit
vector of its stratum, and it can be written in terms of the amplitude of its
stratum. Finally the capability of Lanczos-based algorithm for evaluation of
walk on arbitrary graphs (GQD or non-QD types), has been tested by calculating
the probability amplitudes of quantum walk on some interesting finite
(infinite) graph of GQD type and finite (infinite) path graph of non-GQD type,
