new, deep \chandra and \xmm observations of the cores of three powerful radio
loud quasars: 1136--135, 1150+497 (\chandra), and 0723+679 (\xmm), in the
redshift range $z$=0.3--0.8. These sources are known from our previous \chandra
snapshot survey to have kpc-scale X-ray jets. In 1136--135 and 1150+497,
evidence is found for the presence of diffuse thermal X-ray emission around the
cores, on scales of 40--50 kpc and with luminosity L$_{0.3-2 keV} \sim 10^{43}$
\lum, suggesting thermal emission from the host galaxy or a galaxy group. The
X-ray continua of the cores in the three sources are described by an
upward-curved (concave) broken power law, with photon indices $\Gamma_{soft}
\sim 1.8-2.1$ and $\Gamma_{hard} \sim 1.7$ below and above $\approx 2$ keV,
respectively. There is evidence for an unresolved \feka line with EW $\sim$ 70
eV in the three quasars. The Spectral Energy Distributions of the sources can
be well described by a mix of jet and disk emission, with the jet dominating
the radio and hard X-rays (via synchrotron and external Compton) and the disk
dominating the optical/UV through soft X-rays. The ratio of the jet-to-disk
powers is $\sim 1$, consistent with those derived for a number of gamma-ray
emitting blazars. This indicates that near equality of accretion and jet power
may be common in powerful radio-loud AGN.

plane wave is launched. In the context of the coronal heating problem a new two
stage mechanism of plasma heating is presented by putting emphasis, first, on
the generation of parallel electric fields within an ideal MHD description
directly, rather than focusing on the enhanced dissipation mechanisms of the
Alfv\'en waves and, second, dissipation of these parallel electric fields via
{\it kinetic} effects. It is shown that a single Alfv\'en wave harmonic with
frequency $\nu = 7$ Hz and longitudinal wavelength $\lambda_A = 0.63$ Mm, for a
putative Alfv\'en speed of 4328 km s$^{-1}$, the generated parallel electric
field could account for 10% of the necessary coronal heating requirement. We
conjecture that wide spectrum (10$^{-4}-10^3$ Hz) Alfv\'en waves, based on the
observationally constrained spectrum, could provide the necessary coronal
heating requirement. The exact amount of energy that could be deposited by such
waves through our mechanism of parallel electric field generation can only be
calculated once a more complete parametric study is done. Thus, the
""theoretical spectrum"" of the energy stored in parallel electric fields versus
frequency needs to be obtained.

collisions with ambient nuclei. The resulting pions produce secondary electrons
and positrons, high-energy neutrinos, and gamma-ray photons. We estimate the
cumulative gamma-ray emission from starburst galaxies. We find a total
integrated background above 100 MeV of F_gamma ~ 10^{-6} GeV/cm^2/s/sr and a
corresponding specific intensity at GeV energies of nuI_nu ~ 10^{-7}
GeV/cm^2/s/sr. Starbursts may thus account for a significant fraction of the
extra-galactic $\gamma$-ray background. We show that the FIR-radio correlation
provides a strong constraint on the gamma-ray emission from starburst galaxies
because pions decay into both gamma-rays and radio-emitting electron/positron
pairs. We identify several nearby systems where the potential for observing
gamma-ray emission is the most favorable (M82, NGC 253, and IC 342), predict
their fluxes, and predict a linear FIR-gamma-ray correlation for the densest
starbursts. If established, the FIR-gamma-ray correlation would provide strong
evidence for the ``calorimeter'' theory of the FIR-radio correlation and would
imply that cosmic rays in starburst galaxies interact with gas at approximately
the mean density of the interstellar medium (ISM), thereby providing an
important constraint on the physics of the ISM in starbursts.

absorption features at ~ 8500 A were used to measure the stellar radial

assuming a purely rotating system with circular orbits in a plane was fitted to
the radial velocity data. The turnover of the rotation curve is at only ~ 50 pc

millimeter transitions of 12CO to probe the cold (~20 K) outer disk. We report
no gas line detections from our sample. Line flux upper limits are first
converted to warm and cold gas mass limits using simple approximations allowing

the insensitivity of CO observations to low column densities (up to

understood, especially as far as the connection between observed spectral

degree of complexity compared to stars that is related to anisotropic
emission/obscuration influencing the observed properties in most spectral
ranges. This complicating factor has hampered efforts to define the equivalent
of an Hertzsprung-Russel diagram for quasars. Even if it has recently become
possible to estimate black hole mass and Eddington ratio for sources using
optical and UV broad emission lines, the results are still plagued by large
uncertainties. Nevertheless, robust trends are emerging from multivariate
analysis of large spectral datasets of quasars. A firm observational basis is
being laid out by accurate measurements of broad emission line properties
especially when the source rest-frame is known. We consider the most widely
discussed correlations (i.e. the so-called ""eigenvector 1 parameter space"" and
the ""Baldwin effect"") and analyze how they can be explained in terms of
accretion properties, broad line region structure, and source evolution. We
critically review recent estimates of black hole mass, accretion rate, spin and
possible orientation indicators, stressing that any improvement in these
parameters will provide a much better understanding of the physics and dynamics
of the region producing the optical and UV broad emission lines. More accurate
measurements of Eddington ratio and black hole mass may have a significant

104, for which there exist velocity dispersion measurements outside of the
galactic major axis. The mass distribution model is constructed in two stages.
In the first stage we construct a luminosity distribution model, where only
galactic surface brightness distribution is taken into account. Thereafter, in
the second stage we develop on the basis of the Jeans equations a detailed mass
distribution model and calculate line-of-sight velocity dispersions and the
stellar rotation curve. Here a dark matter halo is added to visible components.
Calculated dispersions are compared with observations along different slit
positions perpendicular and parallel to the galactic major axis. In the
best-fitting model velocity dispersion ellipsoids are radially elongated.
Outside the galactic plane velocity dispersion behaviour is more sensitive to
the dark matter density distribution and allows to estimate dark halo
parameters.

optics is of prime importance in several image restoration techniques such as
deconvolution and astrometric/photometric algorithms. Wavefront-related data
from the adaptive optics real-time computer can be used to accurately estimate
the point-spread function in adaptive optics observations. The only
point-spread function reconstruction algorithm implemented on astronomical
adaptive optics system makes use of particular functions, named $U\_{ij}$.
These $U\_{ij}$ functions are derived from the mirror modes, and their number
is proportional to the square number of these mirror modes. Aims. We present
here two new algorithms for point-spread function reconstruction that aim at
suppressing the use of these $U\_{ij}$ functions to avoid the storage of a
large amount of data and to shorten the computation time of this PSF
reconstruction. Methods. Both algorithms take advantage of the eigen
decomposition of the residual parallel phase covariance matrix. In the first
algorithm, the use of a basis in which the latter matrix is diagonal reduces
the number of $U\_{ij}$ functions to the number of mirror modes. In the second
algorithm, this eigen decomposition is used to compute phase screens that
follow the same statistics as the residual parallel phase covariance matrix,
and thus suppress the need for these $U\_{ij}$ functions. Results. Our
algorithms dramatically reduce the number of $U\_{ij}$ functions to be computed
for the point-spread function reconstruction. Adaptive optics simulations show
the good accuracy of both algorithms to reconstruct the point-spread function.

effect in controlling the location and distribution of hot spots, formed on the

that hot spots are often at mid to low latitudes, in contrast to what is
expected for accretion to dipolar fields, and that particularly for higher mass

single-site anisotropy, such as some amorphous alloys of rare earths and
transition metals. In particular, we consider the strong-anisotropy limit
(SRAM), in which the Hamiltonian can be rewritten as the one of an Ising
spin-glass model with correlated bond disorder: H = - J \sum_{< xy >} j_{xy}
\sigma_x \sigma_y, where j_{xy} = \vec{u}_x \cdot \vec{u}_y and \vec{u}_x is a
random three-component unit vector. We performed Monte Carlo simulations of the
SRAM on simple cubic L^3 lattices, up to L=30, measuring correlation functions
of the replica-replica overlap, which is the order parameter at a glass
transition. The corresponding results show critical behaviour and finite-size
scaling. They provide evidence of a finite-temperature continuous transition
with critical exponents \eta_o=-0.24(4) and \nu_o=2.4(6). These results are
close to the corresponding estimates that have been obtained in the usual Ising
spin-glass model with uncorrelated bond disorder, suggesting that the two
models belong to the same universality class. This is consistent with arguments
that suggest that the disorder correlations present in the SRAM are irrelevant.

and the reported relatively high static dielectric constant at T = 0 (epsilon0

polarization that undergoes transition at T_JT. The frequency dispersion of the
dielectric response at any given temperature, however, reveals that the

LaMnO3. It rises slowly with the decrease in d down to ~100 nm and then jumps
by more than an order of magnitude in between d ~ 100 nm and ~30 nm. Finally, L
falls sharply to zero at a critical particle size d_c ~ 19 nm. The transition
temperature T_JT also exhibits an almost similar trend of variation with the
particle size, near d ~ 30 nm and below, even though the extent of variation is
relatively small. The zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC)
magnetization versus temperature study over a temperature range 10-300 K
reveals that the antiferromagnetic transition temperature decreases with d
while the temperature range, over which the ZFC and FC data diverge, increases
with the drop in d. The FC magnetization also is found to increase sharply with
the drop in particle size. A conjecture of nonmonotonic variation in orbital
domain structure with decrease in particle size - from smaller domains with
large number of boundaries to larger domains with small number of boundaries
due to lesser lattice defects and, finally, down to even finer domain
structures with higher degree of metastability - along with increase in surface
area in core-shell structure, could possibly rationalize the observed L versus

research works appeared on journals for mathematics and theoretical physics on
cosmos. The main purpose of this paper is to survey these thinking and ideas
for mathematics and cosmological physics, such as those of multi-spaces, map
geometries and combinatorial cosmoses, also the combinatorial conjecture for
mathematics proposed by myself in 2005. Some open problems are included for the
21th mathematics by a combinatorial speculation.

intrinsic torsion and characteristic connection of a $G$-structure as unifying

symmetric Levy process with no diffusion part and with a Levy density given by
c|x|^{-d-\alpha} 1_{|x|< 1} for some constant c. In previous paper we have
studied the potential theory of truncated symmetric stable processes. Among
other things, we proved that the boundary Harnack principle is valid for the
positive harmonic functions of a truncated symmetric stable process in any
bounded convex domain and showed that the Martin boundary of any bounded convex
domain with respect to this process is the same as the Euclidean boundary.
However, for truncated symmetric stable processes, the boundary Harnack
principle is not valid in non-convex domains. In this paper, we show that, for
a large class of not necessarily convex bounded open sets called bounded
roughly connected \kappa-fat open sets (including bounded non-convex \kappa-fat
domains), the Martin boundary with respect to any truncated symmetric stable
process is still the same as the Euclidean boundary. We also show that, for

Our focus is the topological mirror symmetry. There are at least three known
ingredients to describe the topological mirror symmetry, namely, integral
vertices in reflexive polytopes, monomials in graded polynomial rings (with
some group actions), and periods (and Picard-Fuchs differential equations).
  In this paper we will introduce Fermat motives associated to these Calabi-Yau
orbifolds and then use them to give motivic interpretation of the topological
mirror symmetry phenomenon between mirror pairs of Calabi-Yau orbifolds. We
establish, at the Fermat (the Landau-Ginzburg) point in the moduli space, the
one-to-one correspondence between the monomial classes and Fermat motives. This
is done by computing the number of ${\bf F}_q$-rational points on our
Calabi-Yau orbifolds over ${\bf F}_q$ in two different ways: Weil's algebraic
number theoretic method involving Jacobi (Gauss) sums, and Dwork's $p$-adic
analytic method involving Dwork characters and Gauss sums. We will discuss

Pauli blocking, nuclear binding, and final-state interactions. They are
implemented by means of the Giessen Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (GiBUU)

namely pion production and nucleon knockout. We find that final-state
interactions modify considerably the distributions through rescattering,
charge-exchange and absorption. Side-feeding induced by charge-exchange
scattering is important in both cases. In the case of pions, there is a strong
absorption associated with the in-medium pionless decay modes of the Delta,
while nucleon knockout exhibits a considerable enhancement of low energy
nucleons due to rescattering. At neutrino energies above 1 GeV, we also obtain
that the contribution to nucleon knockout from Delta excitation is comparable

social herding of economic sentiment. An interactions-driven dynamics of
economic sentiment is modeled by an Ising model on a large (two-dimensional)
square lattice. The individual states are called optimism and pessimism. The
exogenous environment is modeled as a sequence of random events, which might
have a positive or negative influence on economic sentiment. These exogenous
events can be frequent or rare, have a lasting impact or a non-lasting impact.
Impact of events is inhomogeneous over the lattice, as individuals might fail
to perceive particular events. We introduce two notions of social herding:
permanent herding refers to the situation where an ordered state (i.e. a state
with an overwhelming majority of optimists or pessimists) persists over an
infinite time horizon, while temporary herding refers to the situation where
ordered states appear, persist for some time and decay. The parameter of the
inter-agent interaction strength is such as to engender permanent herding
without the influence of the environment. To investigate the impact of an
environment we determine whether an initially ordered state decays. We consider
two cases: in the first case positive and negative events have both the same
empirical frequencies and strengths, while in the second case events have the
same empirical frequencies but different strengths. (In the first case the
environment is ``neutral''in the long term), In the neutral case we find
temporary herding if events are sufficiently ``strong'' and/or perceived by a
sufficiently large proportion of agents, and our results suggest that permanent
herding occurs for small values of the parameters. In the ``non-neutral'' case
we find only temporary herding.

In this approach, the potential difference applied across the gap between two
adjacent GEMs is reversed compared to the standard configuration. In such a gap
structure, called Electric Gate, a signal transfer from the first to second GEM
is presumably provided by the small residual field still existing at small gate
voltages and connecting the holes of the two GEMs. On the other hand, ion
backflow between the GEMs turned out to be substantially reduced. We also
consider another configuration, called Photoelectric Gate, in which in addition
to the Electric Gate configuration, a CsI photocathode is deposited on the
second GEM. In the Photoelectric Gate, ion backflow through the gap is fully
suppressed and the signal transfer through the gap is provided by the
photoelectric mechanism due to either avalanche scintillations in the first GEM
or proportional scintillations in the electroluminescence gap replacing the
first GEM. The idea of the Electric Gate might find applications in the field
of TPC detectors and gas photomultipliers. The idea of the Photoelectric Gate
is more relevant in the field of two-phase avalanche detectors.

so-called medium synchronization of clocks is defined, yielding isotropy solely
in the system at rest and anisotropy in all moving systems. From medium
synchronization the appropriate coordinate transformation is developed, the
so-called medium transformation, a Galilean type of transformation, thus
maintaining simultaneity between all participant systems of reference and
changing the form of Maxwells equations to the extended Maxwell equations.
Despite the fact that medium transformation violates Lorentz invariance and the
principle of relativity, it is demonstrated that the results from medium
transformation and extended Maxwell equations are fully compliant with
observable phenomena. Moreover, it is shown that the concept of a medium, a
preferred frame of reference, is compatible not only with medium
transformation, but also with Lorentz transformation and with theory of special
relativity, so it is quite possible now to consider a realistic medium.
Finally, a discrepancy is exposed within theory of special relativity, giving
rise to assume a preferred frame of reference even in special relativity.

of the medium from the measurements of first arrivals is a typical example of
ill-posed problem. In the framework of Tikhonov regularization theory, in order
to replace an ill-posed problem by a well-posed one and to get a unique and
stable solution, a stabilizing functional (stabilizer) has to be introduced.
The stabilizer selects the desired solution from a class of solutions with a
specific physical and/or geometrical property; e.g., the existence of sharp
boundaries separating media with different petrophysical parameters. Usually
stabilizers based on maximum smoothness criteria are used during the inversion
process; in these cases the solutions provide smooth images which, in many
situations, do not describe the examined objects properly. Recently a new
algorithm of direct minimization of the Tikhonov parametric functional with
minimum support stabilizer has been introduced; it produces clear and focused
images of targets with sharp boundaries. In this research we apply this new
technique to real radar tomographic data and we compare the obtained result
with the solution generated by the more traditional minimum norm stabilizer.

measurements of time-domain intensity modulation are made at speeds of 10 GHz.
We showed experimentally that the ultrafast mechanism of this modulation
functions at the optical frequency through spectral measurements, and that
intensity modulation at frequencies in excess of 1 THz can be obtained in this
device. By integrating optical polymers through evanescent coupling to
high-mode-confinement silicon waveguides, we greatly increase the effective
nonlinearity of the waveguide for cross-phase modulation. The combination of
high mode confinement, multiple integrated optical components, and high
nonlinearities produces all-optical ultrafast devices operating at
continuous-wave power levels compatible with telecommunication systems.
Although far from commercial radio frequency optical modulator standards in
terms of extinction, these devices are a first step in development of
large-scale integrated ultrafast optical logic in silicon, and are two orders

coefficient for various geometries for the case of scalar-field fluctuations
with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Our results facilitate an estimate of the
systematic error induced by the edges of finite plates, for instance, in a
standard parallel-plate experiment. The Casimir edge effects for this case can
be reformulated as an increase of the effective area of the configuration.

are not maximally entangled states. The communication parties utilize decoy
photons to check eavesdropping. After ensuring the security of the quantum
channel, the sender encodes the secret message and transmits it to the receiver
by using Controlled-NOT operation and von Neumann measurement. The protocol is
simple and realizable with present technology. We also show the protocol is
secure for noisy quantum channel.

  arrays","20 pages, 5 figures",,"10.1002/prop.200610326",,"quant-ph",,"  It was recently proposed to use small groups of trapped ions as qubit
carriers in miniaturized electrode arrays that comprise a large number of
individual trapping zones, between which ions could be moved. This approach
might be scalable for quantum information processing with a large numbers of
qubits. Processing of quantum information is achieved by transporting ions to
and from separate memory and qubit manipulation zones in between quantum logic
operations. The transport of ion groups in this scheme plays a major role and
requires precise experimental control and fast transport. In this paper we
introduce a theoretical framework to study ion transport in external potentials
that might be created by typical miniaturized Paul trap electrode arrays. In
particular we discuss the relationship between classical and quantum
descriptions of the transport and study the energy transfer to the oscillatory
motion during near-adiabatic transport. Based on our findings we suggest a
numerical method to find electrode potentials as a function of time to optimize
the local potential an ion experiences during transport. We demonstrate this
method for one specific electrode geometry that should closely represent the
situation encountered in realistic trap arrays.

best quantum mechanical approximation of classical behavior. Here we argue
that, far from being classical, coherent state are in fact highly entangled. We
demonstrate this by showing that a general system of indistinguishable bosons
in a coherent state can be used to entangle, by local interactions, two
spatially separated and distinguishable non-interacting quantum systems.
Entanglement can also be extracted in the same way from number states or any
other nontrivial superpositions of them.
