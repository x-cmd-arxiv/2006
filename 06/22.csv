equations with a time-dependent background state are derived, and a numerical
method based on the approximate projection formalism is presented. We
demonstrate through validation with a fully compressible hydrodynamics code
that this low Mach number model accurately captures the expansion of the
stellar atmosphere as well as the local dynamics due to external heat sources.
This algorithm provides the basis for an efficient simulation tool for studying
the ignition of SNe Ia.

surface brightness ``core'' is the M=20 magnified central 1 kpc of the galaxy
(seen at a spatial resolution of about 200 pc in the source plane), whereas the
fainter ``arc'' is a more strongly magnified peripheral region of the same
galaxy at about a half-light radius, which otherwise appears to be a typical
z=3 Lyman break galaxy.
  The overall shape of the position-velocity diagram resembles the ``rotation
curves'' of the inner few kpcs of nearby L* spiral galaxies. The projected
velocities rise rapidly to 75 km/s within the core. This implies a dynamical
mass of M_dyn = 10^9.3 M_sun within the central kpc, and suggests that in this
system the equivalent of the mass of a present-day L* bulge at the same radius
was already in place by z>=3. Approximating the circular velocity of the halo
by the measured asymptotic velocity of the rotation curve, we estimate a dark
matter halo mass of M_halo = 10^11.7 +/- 0.3, in good agreement with
large-scale clustering studies of Lyman break galaxies. The baryonic collapse
fraction is low compared to actively star-forming ``BX'' and low-redshift
galaxies around z=2, perhaps implying comparatively less gas infall to small
radii or efficient feedback. Even more speculatively, the high central mass
density might indicate highly dissipative gas collapse in very early stages of
galaxy evolution, in approximate agreement with what is expected for
``inside-out'' galaxy formation models.

for direct evidence for such a feedback in the optical emission line gas around
the z=2.16 powerful radio galaxy MRC1138-262, likely a massive galaxy in

gravitational motion or starburst-driven winds. Order-of-magnitude timescale
and energy arguments favor the AGN as the only plausible candidate to
accelerate the gas, with a total energy injection of a few x 10^60 ergs or
more, necessary to power the outflow, and relatively efficient coupling between
radio jet and ISM. Observed outflow properties are in gross agreement with the
models, and suggest that AGN winds might have a similar, or perhaps larger,
cosmological significance than starburst-driven winds, if MRC1138-262 is indeed
archetypal. Moreover, the outflow has the potential to remove significant gas
fractions (<= 50%) from a >L* galaxy within a few 10 to 100 Myrs, fast enough
to preserve the observed [alpha/Fe] overabundance in massive galaxies at low

galaxy formation and evolution. The simulations invoke star formation and
stellar feedback, chemical evolution with non-instantaneous recycling,
metallicity dependent radiative cooling and effects of a meta-galactic UV
field, including simplified radiative transfer.
  At z=0, the simulated and empirical TF relations are offset by about 0.4
magnitudes (1 sigma) in the B and I bands. The origin of these offsets is
somewhat unclear, but it may not necessarily be a problem of the simulations
only.
  As to evolution, we find a brightening of the TF relation between z=0 and z=1
of about 0.85 mag in rest-frame B band, with a non-evolving slope. The
brightening we predict is intermediate between the (still quite discrepant)
observational estimates.
  This evolution is primarily a luminosity effect, while the stellar mass TF
relation shows negligible evolution. The individual galaxies do gain stellar
mass between z=1 and z=0, by a 50-100%; but they also correspondingly increase
their characteristic circular speed. As a consequence, individually they mainly
evolve ALONG the stellar mass TF relation, while the relation as such does not
show any significant evolution.

emission structure seen in all MIPS bands suggests the presence of a near
edge-on dusty torus, the distinct emission structure between the 24 micron map
and the 70/160 micron maps indicates the presence of two distinct emission
components in the central torus. Based on the spatial correlation of these two
far-IR emission components with respect to various optical line emission, we
conclude that the 24 micron emission is largely due to the [O IV] line at 25.9
micron arising from highly ionized regions behind the ionization front, whereas
the 70 and 160 micron emission is due to dust continuum arising from
low-temperature dust in the remnant asymptotic giant branch (AGB) wind shell.
The far-IR nebula structure also suggests that the enhancement of mass loss at
the end of the AGB phase has occurred isotropically, but has ensued only in the
equatorial directions while ceasing in the polar directions. The present data
also show evidence for the prolate spheroidal distribution of matter in this
bipolar PN. The AGB mass loss history reconstructed in this PN is thus
consistent with what has been previously proposed based on the past optical and
mid-IR imaging surveys of the post-AGB shells.

of 2000 and 300 square degrees, respectively, we study the prospects for
probing dark energy clustering from the measured galaxy power spectrum,
assuming the dynamical properties of dark energy are specified in terms of the
equation of state and the effective sound speed c_e in the context of an
adiabatic cold dark matter dominated model. The dark energy clustering adds a
power to the galaxy power spectrum amplitude at spatial scales greater than the
sound horizon, and the enhancement is sensitive to redshift evolution of the
net dark energy density, i.e. the equation of state. We find that the galaxy
survey, when combined with Planck, can distinguish dark energy clustering from
a smooth dark energy model such as the quintessence model (c_e=1), when
c_e<0.04 (0.02) in the case of the constant equation of state w_0=-0.9 (-0.95).
An ultimate full-sky survey of z~1 galaxies allows the detection when c_e<0.08
(0.04) for w_0=0.9 (-0.95). We also investigate a degeneracy between the dark
energy clustering and the non-relativistic neutrinos implied from the neutrino
oscillation experiments, because the two effects both induce a scale-dependent
modification in the galaxy power spectrum shape at largest spatial scales
accessible from the galaxy survey. It is shown that a wider redshift coverage
can efficiently separate the two effects by utilizing the different redshift
dependences, where dark energy clustering is apparent only at low redshifts

characterize their rest-frame UV through optical properties via the mean
spectral energy distribution (SED). To measure evolution we apply the same
selection criteria to a sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey

bluer with increasing redshift but at z<3 the mean SED falls within the range
defined by ``normal'' galaxies in the nearby Universe. We measure stellar
mass-to-light ratios (Mstar/L) by fitting models to the rest-frame UV-optical
SEDs and derive the stellar mass density. The stellar mass density in luminous
galaxies has increased by a factor of 3.5-7.9 from z=3 to z=0.1, including
field-to-field variance uncertainties. After correcting to total, the measured
mass densities at z<2 lie below the integral of the star formation rate (SFR)
density as a function of redshift as derived from UV selected samples. This may
indicate a systematic error in the mass densities or SFR(z) estimates. We find
large discrepancies between recent model predictions for the evolution of the
mass density and our results, even when our observational selection is applied
to the models. Finally we determine that Distant Red Galaxies (selected to have
J_s - K_s>2.3) in our LV selected samples contribute 30% and 64% of the stellar
mass budget at z~2 and z~ 2.8 respectively. These galaxies are largely absent

with a 0.3-10 keV luminosity of 3.3x10^40 erg/s and a line-of-sight absorption
column of 1.2x10^23 cm^-2. Within the 25 mag/arcsec^2 optical B-band isophote
of the galaxy, we detect an additional 4 sources with an accumulated luminosity
of 4.3x10^39 erg/s. The bulk of the unresolved X-ray emission spatially follows
the near-infrared (NIR) K-band surface brightness distribution; the luminosity
ratio L_X/L_K ~ 8x10^-4 is consistent with that inferred from galactic discrete
sources. This X-ray-NIR association and the compatibility of the X-ray spectral
fit with the expected spectrum of a population of discrete sources suggest that
low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are the most likely emitters of the unresolved
emission in the disk region. The remaining unresolved emission is primarily due
to extraplanar hot gas. The luminosity of this gas is at least a factor of 10
less than that predicted by recent simulations of intergalactic gas accretion
by such a massive galaxy with a circular rotation speed V_c ~ 304 km/s^2 (Toft
et al. 2002). Instead, we find that the extraplanar hot gas most likely
represents discrete extensions away from the disk, including two
``bubble-like'' features on either side of the nucleus. These extensions appear
to correlate with radio continuum emission and, energetically, can be easily
explained by outflows from the galactic disk.

regions are controlled in both normal galaxies and in starburst environments.
These parameters are the HII region luminosity function, the time-dependent
size, the covering fraction of molecular clouds, the pressure in the ionized
gas and the ionization parameter. The factors which control them are the
initial mass function of the exciting stars, the cluster mass function, the
metallicity and the mean pressure in the surrounding interstellar medium. We
investigate the sensitivity of the H$\alpha$ luminosity to the IMF, and find
that this can translate to more than a factor two variation in derived star
formation rates. The molecular cloud dissipation timescale is estimated from a
case study of M17 to be $\sim1$ Myr for this object. Based upon HII luminosity
function fitting for nearby galaxies, we suggest that the \HII region cluster
mass function is fitted by a log-normal form peaking at $\sim 100 M_{\odot}$.
The cluster mass function continues the stellar IMF to higher mass. The
pressure in the HII regions is controlled by the mechanical luminosity flux
from the central cluster. Since this is closely related to the ionizing photon
flux, we show that the ionization parameter is not a free variable, and that
the diffuse ionized medium may be composed of many large, faint and old HII
regions. Finally, we derive theoretical probability distributions for the
ionization parameter as a function of metallicity and compare these to those
derived for SDSS galaxies.

elliptical galaxies have revealed structural and kinematical properties of the
outer stellar halo regions. In order to elucidate the origin of the properties
of these planetary nebula systems (PNSs), we consider the merger scenario in
which an elliptical galaxy is formed by merging of spiral galaxies. Using
numerical simulations, we particularly investigate radial profiles of projected
PNe number densities, rotational velocities, and velocity dispersions of PNSs
extending to the outer halo regions of elliptical galaxies formed from major
and unequal-mass merging. We find that the radial profiles of the project
number densities can be fitted to the power-law and the mean number density in
the outer halos of the ellipticals can be more than an order of magnitude
higher than that of the original spiral's halo. The PNSs are found to show a
significant amount of rotation (V/sigma >0.5) in the outer halo regions ($R$
$>$ $5R_{\rm e}$) of the ellipticals. Two-dimensional velocity fields of PNSs
are derived from the simulations and their dependences on model parameters of
galaxy merging are discussed in detail. We compare the simulated kinematics of
PNSs with that of the PNS observed in NGC 5128 and thereby discuss advantages
and disadvantages of the merger model in explaining the observed kinematics of
the PNS. We also find that the kinematics of PNSs in elliptical galaxies are
quite diverse depending on the orbital configurations of galaxy merging, the
mass ratio of merger progenitor spirals, and the viewing angle of the galaxies.
This variation translates directly into possible biases by a factor of more
than two in observational mass estimation (abridged). ~ ~

  Astrophysics",,"10.1051/0004-6361:20040294",,"astro-ph",,"  Aims. The purpose of this study is to investigate the distributions of the
isomeric molecules HCN and HNC and estimate their abundance ratio in the
protostellar core Cha-MMS1 located in Chamaeleon {\sc i}.
  Methods. The core was mapped in the J=1-0 rotational lines of HCN, HNC, and
HN13C. The column densities of H13CN, HN13C, H15NC and NH3 were estimated
towards the centre of the core.
  Results. The core is well delineated in all three maps. The kinetic
temperature in the core, derived from the NH3 (1,1) and (2,2) inversion lines,
is 12.1+/-0.1 K. The HN13C/H13CN column density ratio is between 3 and 4, i.e.
similar to values found in several other cold cores. The HN13C/H15NC column
density ratio is about 7. In case no 15N fractionation occurs in HNC (as
suggested by recent modelling results), the HNC/HN13C abundance ratio is in the
range 30-40, which indicates a high degree of 13C fractionation in HNC.
Assuming no differential 13C fractionation the HCN and HNC abundances are
estimated to be about 7E-10 and about 2E-9, respectively, the former being
nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than that of NH3. Using also previously
determined column densities in Cha-MMS1, we can put the most commonly observed
nitrogenous molecules in the following order according to their fractional
abundances: X(NH3) > X(HC3N) > X(HNC) > X(HCN) > X(N2H+).
  Conclusions. The relationships between molecular abundances suggest that
Cha-MMS1 represents an evolved chemical stage, experiencing at present the
'late-time' cyanopolyyne peak. The possibility that the relatively high HNC/HCN
ratio derived here is only valid for the $^{13}$C isotopic substitutes cannot
be excluded on the basis of the present and other available data.

radiation from massive stars.
  Aims In this paper, we extend our earlier set of data from a small region of

interplay between the radiation field and the molecular and atomic hydrogen.
  Methods We report CO(1-0) observations with the Nobeyama 45 m dish and the
Owens Valley interferometer array of selected regions in the Western spiral arm
of M81.
  Results From our Nobeyama data, we detect CO(1-0) emission at several
locations, coinciding spatially with HI features near a far-UV source. The
levels and widths of the detected CO profiles are consistent with the CO(1-0)
emission that can be expected from several large photo-dissociation regions
with typical sizes of some 50x150 pc located within our telescope beam. We do
not detect emission at other pointings, even though several of those are near
far-UV sources and accompanied by bright HI. This non-detection is likely a
consequence of the marginal area filling factor of photo-dissociation regions
in our observations. We detect no emission in our Owens Valley data, consistent
with the low intensity of the CO emission detected in that field by the
Nobeyama dish.
  Conclusions We explain the lack of CO(1-0) emission at positions farther from
far-UV sources as a consequence of insufficient heating and excitation of the
molecular gas at these positions, rather than as an absence of molecular
hydrogen.

CO lines are tracers of hot (several 100K), dense gas; N+ is a cooling line of
diffuse, ionized gas; the H2D+ line is a non-depleting tracer of cold (~20K),
dense gas. As the THz lines benefit the study of diverse phenomena (from
high-mass star-forming regions to the WIM to cold prestellar cores), we have
built the CO N+ Deuterium Observations Receiver (CONDOR) to further explore the
THz windows by ground-based observations. CONDOR was designed to be used at the
Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) and Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared
Astronomy (SOFIA). CONDOR was installed at the APEX telescope and test
observations were made to characterize the instrument. The combination of
CONDOR on APEX successfully detected THz radiation from astronomical sources.
CONDOR operated with typical Trec=1600K and spectral Allan variance times of
30s. CONDOR's first light observations of CO 13-12 emission from the hot core
Orion FIR4 (= OMC1 South) revealed a narrow line with T(MB) = 210K and
delta(V)=5.4km/s. A search for N+ emission from the ionization front of the
Orion Bar resulted in a non-detection. The successful deployment of CONDOR at
APEX demonstrates the potential for making observations at THz frequencies from
ground-based facilities.

motion. The values of their spin parameters $\lambda$ are near the value
$\lambda=0.22$ of our Galaxy.
  We obtain the distinction between the sets of particles moving in regular and
in chaotic orbits and we show that the spatial distribution of these two sets
of particles is much different. The rotating models are characterized by larger
fractions of mass in chaotic motion ($\thickapprox 65%$) compared with the
fraction of mass in chaotic motion in the non-rotating iso-energetic model
($\thickapprox 32%$). Furthermore, the Lyapunov numbers of the chaotic orbits
in the rotating models become by about one order of magnitude larger than in
the non-rotating model. Chaotic orbits are concentrated preferably in values of
the Jacobi integral around the value of the effective potential at the
corotation radius.
  We find that density waves form a central rotating bar embedded in a thin and
a thick disc with exponential surface density profile. A surprising new result
is that long living spiral arms are exited on the disc, composed almost
completely by chaotic orbits.
  The bar excites an $m=2$ mode of spiral waves on the surface density of the
disc, emanating from the corotation radius. These spiral waves are deformed,
fade, or disappear temporarily, but they grow again re-forming a well developed
spiral pattern. Spiral arms are discernible up to 20 or 30 rotations of the bar
(lasting for about a Hubble time).

the temperature is lowered, phase-slippage in the pores changes its character,
from synchronous to asynchronous. Inspired by these experiments, we construct a
model to address the characteristics of phase-slippage in superflow through
nanopore arrays. We focus on the low-temperature regime, in which the
current-phase relation for a single pore is linear, and thermal fluctuations
may be neglected. Our model incorporates two basic ingredients: (1) each pore
has its own random value of critical velocity (due, e.g., to atomic-scale
imperfections), and (2) an effective inter-pore coupling, mediated through the
bulk superfluid. The inter-pore coupling tends to cause neighbours of a pore
that has already phase-slipped also to phase-slip; this process may cascade,
creating an avalanche of synchronously slipping phases. As the temperature is
lowered, the distribution of critical velocities is expected to effectively
broaden, owing to the reduction in the superfluid healing length, leading to a
loss of synchronicity in phase-slippage. Furthermore, we find that competition
between the strength of the disorder in the critical velocities and the
strength of the inter-pore interaction leads to a phase transition between
non-avalanching and avalanching regimes of phase-slippage.

$h(t)=\exp(t^{1-\mu})$. The exponent $\mu$ is related to the one giving the
length of the plateau. Interestingly $1-\mu$ is quickly very small when one
goes away from the dynamic transition temperature in the glassy phase. This
gives new light on the interpretation of experiments and simulations where
simple aging was found to be a reasonable but not perfect approximation, which
could be attributed to the existence of a small but non-zero stretching

theory, which is formulated in this paper, places conditions on a perturbation
of the Schwarzschild metric that ensure that properties (i)--(iii) of the

general, but it is retained in exceptional situations that are identified in
this paper. Unlike other popular choices of gauge, the light-cone gauge
produces a perturbed metric that is expressed in a meaningful coordinate
system; this is a considerable asset that greatly facilitates the task of
extracting physical consequences. We illustrate the use of the light-cone gauge
by calculating the metric of a black hole immersed in a uniform magnetic field.

the cosmological constant allows triaxial configurations of equilibrium
rotating the minor axis as solutions of the virial equations. The significance
of the result lies in the fact that minor axis rotation is indeed found in

an equilibrium solution is found only for non-zero positive $\Lambda$. Finally,
we solve the tensor virial equation for the angular velocity and display
special effects of the cosmological constant there.

available DY data are useful for improving the precision of parton distribution
functions (PDFs) obtained from a fit to the deep inelastic scattering (DIS)
data. In particular, some inconsistencies between DIS-based parton distribution
functions and DY data for large values of dilepton rapidity are found. However,
by selecting a sample of the DY data that is both representative and consistent
with the DIS data, we are able to perform a combined PDF fit that significantly
improves the precision of non-strange quark distributions at large values of x.
The NNLO QCD corrections to the DY process are crucial for improving the
precision. They reduce the uncertainty of the theoretical prediction, making it
comparable to the experimental uncertainty in DY cross-sections over a broad

when $T<T_{C}$, there is a bag constant $B(T)$ and the soliton solutions are
stable. However, when $T>T_{C}$ the bag constant $B(T)=0$ and there is no
soliton solution, therefore, the confinement of quarks are removed quickly.

inflation, the field rolls down the potential and eventually freezes to a

are ``well behaved''. For such a hypergraph H (and thus, for any simple graph),
we give a lower bound for the regularity of I(H) via combinatorial information
describing H, and an upper bound for the regularity when H = G is a simple
graph. We also introduce triangulated hypergraphs, a properly-connected
hypergraph which is a generalization of chordal graphs. When H is a
triangulated hypergraph, we explicitly compute the regularity of I(H) and show
that the graded Betti numbers of I(H) are independent of the ground field. As a
consequence, many known results about the graded Betti numbers of forests can
now be extended to chordal graphs.

acting on a von Neumann algebra - or more generally a dual operator system - we
show that there is a unique reversible system \alpha: N --> N (i.e., a complete
order automorphism \alpha of a dual operator system N) that captures all of the
asymptotic behavior of L, called the {\em asymptotic lift} of L. This provides
a noncommutative generalization of the Frobenius theorems that describe the
asymptotic behavior of the sequence of powers of a stochastic n x n matrix. In
cases where M is a von Neumann algebra, the asymptotic lift is shown to be a
W*-dynamical system (N,\mathbb Z), whick we identify as the tail flow of the
minimal dilation of L. We are also able to identify the Poisson boundary of L
as the fixed point algebra of (N,\mathbb Z).
  In general, we show the action of the asymptotic lift is trivial iff L is
{\em slowly oscillating} in the sense that $$ \lim_{n\to\infty}\|\rho\circ

on foot, to Chongqing (Chung-King), the wartime Chinese capital, to finish his
high school education. When the Communist party gained power in China, Y. S.
Chow had already followed his university job to Taiwan. In Taiwan, he taught
mathematics as an assistant at National Taiwan University until he came to the
United States in 1954. At the University of Illinois, he studied under J. L.
Doob and received his Ph.D. in 1958. He served as a staff mathematician and
adjunct faculty at the IBM Watson Research Laboratory and Columbia University
from 1959 to 1962. He was a member of the Statistics Department at Purdue
University from 1962 to 1968. From 1968 until his retirement in 1993, Y. S.
Chow served as Professor of Mathematical Statistics at Columbia University. At
different times, he was a visiting professor at the University of California at
Berkeley, University of Heidelberg (Germany) and the National Central
University, Taiwan. He served as Director of the Institute of Mathematics of
Academia Sinica, Taiwan, and Director of the Center of Applied Statistics at
Nankai University, Tianjin, China. He was instrumental in establishing the

diquark Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) matter at zero temperature. We find that
chiral restoration transition is first order and coincides with deconfinement.
We investigate various possible coexistence patterns which may emerge from the
first order deconfinement phase transition by assuming different values for the
critical deconfinement chemical potential. If deconfinement takes place at
higher chemical potential, there exists a mixed phase of nuclear and chirally
restored diquark BEC matter. This coexistence region extends over a large
density region for a bigger diquark BEC or a weaker diquark-diquark
interaction. For model parameters with heavy diquark in vaccum, phase
transition to diquark matter becomes of second-order. We also show that in the
case of precocious deconfinement, droplets of nucleons and droplets of chirally
restored Bose-Einstein condensed diquarks coexist surrounded by non-trivial
vacuum. We show that a early deconfinement and a weak repulsive diquark-diquark
interaction soften the equation of state. We propose a scenario in which
nuclear matter saturates due to the formation of the diquark BEC and
deconfinement phenomena. In this picture, instead of repulsive vector-meson
exchange the compressibility of the equation of state is related to a repulsive
diquark-diquark interaction. In general, we emphasize the importance of a
diquark BEC phase at rather low density before quark BCS-pairing transition.

pions and scattering nucleons. Feynman-diagram amplitudes calculated without
form factors are checked against those derived from dispersion relations. In
this comparison, one notices that a very short-range part of the crossed
diagram, neglected in dispersion-relation calculations of the two-pion-exchange
nucleon-nucleon potential, gives a sizable contribution. In the Feynman-diagram
calculation with form factors the agreement with measured spin-separated cross
sections, as well as amplitudes in the lower part of the energy range
considered, is much better for pion-nucleon pseudo-vector vis \`a vis
pseudo-scalar coupling. While strengths of the box and crossed diagrams are
comparable for laboratory momenta below 2 GeV/c, the crossed diagram dominates
for larger momenta, largely due to the kinematics of the crossed diagram
allowing a smaller momentum transfer in the nucleon center of mass. An
important contribution arises from the principal-value part of the integrals
which is non-zero when form factors are included. It seems that the importance
of the exchange of color singlets may extend higher in energy than expected.

a generalized theory of their numerical stability is proposed. Using the exact
expansion series of subfilter-scale stresses or integration by parts, the terms
describing the interaction between the mean and fluctuation portions in a
statistically steady state are theoretically rewritten into a closed form in
terms of the known filtered quantities. This process involves high-order
derivatives with time-independent coefficients. Detailed stability analyses of
the closed formulas are presented for determining whether a filtered system is
numerically stable when finite difference schemes or others are used to solve
it. It is shown that by the Gaussian filtering operation, second and higher
even-order derivatives are derived that always exhibit numerical instability in
a fixed range of directions; hence, if the filter widths are unsuitably large,
the filtered Navier-Stokes equations can in certain cases be unconditionally
unstable even though there is no error in modeling the subfilter-scale stress
terms. As is proved by a simple example, the essence of the present discussion
can be applied to any other smooth filters; that is, such a numerical
instability problem can arise whenever the dependent variables are smoothed out
by a filter.
