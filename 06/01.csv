surrounded by an axisymmetric structure of dust and gas, which greatly
influences their observed properties according to the direction from which they
are observed. The main aim of this work is to constrain the properties of this
obscuring material using X-Ray observations. The distribution of column
densities observed by Chandra in the Chandra Deep Field South is used to
determine geometrical constraints for already proposed torus models. It is
found that the best torus model is given by a classical `donut shape' with an
exponential angular dependency of the density profile. The opening angle is
strongly constrained by the observed column densities. Other proposed torus
models are clearly rejected by the X-Ray observations.

and the large scale projection noise. We produce a filter for the shear field
which optimizes the signal-to-noise of shape-noise-dominated shear
measurements. Our Fisher-matrix analysis of this projected-mass observable
makes use of the shape of this mass function, and takes into account the
Poisson variance, sample variance, shape noise, and projected-mass noise, and
also the fact that the conversion of the shear signal into mass is
cosmology-dependent. The Fisher analysis is applied to both a nominal 15,000

Assuming a detection threshold of S/N=5, we find both experiments detect

exceeds the shape noise only for clusters at z<=0.1 and has little effect on
the derived dark-energy constraints. Sample variance does not significantly
affect either survey. Finally, we note that all these results are extremely
sensitive to the noise levels and detection thresholds that we impose. They can
be significantly improved if we combine ground and space surveys as independent

distinguish between an untruncated accretion disc and a case in which the
innermost 20-30 gravitational radii are missing. In fact, a partial-covering
plus narrow Fe line scenario is not ruled out statistically. However, the
absorber would have to comprise hundreds/thousands very compact clouds close to
the X-ray source, which seems rather extreme a requirement. The 2-10 keV
intrinsic luminosity of 3C109 is of the order of 2-3x10^45 erg/s which,
combined with a recent black hole mass estimate of ~2x10^8 M_sun, implies an
Eddington ratio greater than unity. If partial covering is excluded, the
observed reflection fraction (of the order of unity), steep photon index
(1.86), and Fe line equivalent width (about 100 eV) all suggest to exclude that
the X-ray continuum is strongly beamed, indicating that the large Eddington
ratio is associated with a radiatively efficient accretion process. We also
confirm previous findings on the detection of low energy absorption in excess
of the Galactic value. The better quality of the XMM-Newton data enables us to
attribute the excess absorption to slightly ionized gas in the line of sight,

find early-type galaxies exhibit significantly different behavior than
late-types at both small and large scales. At large scales (r > 1 h-1 Mpc), we

the GalICS semi-analytic model and a stripped down version without supernova
and AGN feedback. The SPH simulation and the no-feedback GalICS model make
similar predictions for the baryonic mass functions of galaxies and for the
dependence of these mass functions on environment and redshift. The two methods
also make similar predictions for the galaxy content of dark matter haloes as a
function of halo mass and for the gas accretion history of galaxies. Both the
SPH and no-feedback GalICS models predict a bimodal galaxy population at z=0.
The ""red'' sequence of gas poor, old galaxies is populated mainly by satellite
systems while, contrary to observations, the central galaxies of massive haloes
lie on the ""blue'' star-forming sequence as a result of continuing hot gas
accretion at late times. Furthermore, both models overpredict the observed
baryonic mass function, especially at the high mass end. In the full GalICS
model, supernova-driven outflows reduce the masses of low and intermediate mass
galaxies by about a factor of two. AGN feedback suppresses gas cooling in large
haloes, producing a sharp cut-off in the baryonic mass function and moving the
central galaxies of these massive haloes to the red sequence. Our results imply
that the observational failings of the SPH simulation and the no-feedback
GalICS model are a consequence of missing input physics rather than
computational inaccuracies, that truncating gas accretion by satellite galaxies
automatically produces a bimodal galaxy distribution with a red sequence, but
that explaining the red colours of the most massive galaxies requires a
mechanism like AGN feedback that suppresses the accretion onto central galaxies
in large haloes.

their star. The knowledge of their masses and radii allows an estimate of their
composition, but uncertainties on equations of state, opacities and possible
missing energy sources imply that only inaccurate constraints can be derived
when considering each planet separately. Aims: We seek to better understand the
composition of transiting extrasolar planets by considering them as an
ensemble, and by comparing the obtained planetary properties to that of the
parent stars. Methods: We use evolution models and constraints on the stellar
ages to derive the mass of heavy elements present in the planets. Possible
additional energy sources like tidal dissipation due to an inclined orbit or to
downward kinetic energy transport are considered. Results: We show that the
nine transiting planets discovered so far belong to a quite homogeneous
ensemble that is characterized by a mass of heavy elements that is a relatively
steep function of the stellar metallicity, from less than 20 earth masses of
heavy elements around solar composition stars, to up to 100M for three times
the solar metallicity (the precise values being model-dependant). The
correlation is still to be ascertained however. Statistical tests imply a
worst-case 1/3 probability of a false positive. Conclusions: Together with the
observed lack of giant planets in close orbits around metal-poor stars, these
results appear to imply that heavy elements play a key role in the formation of
close-in giant planets. The large masses of heavy elements inferred for planets
orbiting metal rich stars was not anticipated by planet formation models and
shows the need for alternative theories including migration and subsequent
collection of planetesimals.

off-axis collision of equal-mass main sequence stars in order to address the
question of whether stellar mergers can produce a remnant star where the
interior has been replenished with hydrogen due to significant mixing. Each
parent main sequence star is chosen to be found near the turnoff, with hydrogen
depleted in the core, and is modelled with a M=0.8 solar mass realistic stellar
model and as a n=3 polytrope. An ideal fluid description with adiabatic index
gamma=5/3 is used for all hydrodynamic calculations. We found good agreement
between the simulations for the polytropic case, with the remnant showing
strong, non-local mixing throughout. In the interior quarter of the mass, ~35%
is mixed in from larger radii and on average the remnant is ~50% fully mixed.
For the realistic model, we found less mixing, particularly in the interior and
in the SPH simulation. In the inner quarter, ~20% of the contained mass in the
TVD case, but only ~3% in the SPH one is mixed in from outside. The simulations
give consistent results for the overall profile of the merger remnant and the
amount of mass loss, but the differences in mixing suggests that the intrinsic
difference between grid and particle based schemes remains a possible artifact.
We conclude that both the TVD and SPH schemes can be used equally well for
problems that are best suited to their strengths and that care should be taken
in interpreting results about fluid mixing.

compute the Cramer-Rao bound for f_NL and show that for small values of f_NL
the 3-point function estimator saturates the bound and is equivalent to
calculating the full Likelihood of the data. However, for sufficiently large
f_NL, the naive 3-point function estimator has a much larger variance than
previously thought. In the limit in which the departure from Gaussianity is
detected with high confidence, error bars on f_NL only decrease as 1/ln Npix
rather than Npix^-1/2 as the size of the data set increases. We identify the
physical origin of this behavior and explain why it only affects the local type
of non-Gaussianity, where the contribution of the first multipoles is always
relevant. We find a simple improvement to the 3-point function estimator that
makes the square root of its variance decrease as Npix^-1/2 even for large
f_NL, asymptotically approaching the Cramer-Rao bound. We show that using the
modified estimator is practically equivalent to computing the full Likelihood
of f_NL given the data. Thus other statistics of the data, such as the 4-point
function and Minkowski functionals, contain no additional information on f_NL.
In particular, we explicitly show that the recent claims about the relevance of
the 4-point function are not correct. By direct inspection of the Likelihood,
we show that the data do not contain enough information for any statistic to be
able to constrain higher order terms in the relation between the Gaussian field
and the curvature perturbation, unless these are orders of magnitude larger
than the size suggested by the current limits on f_NL.

mass, X-ray temperature and X-ray luminosity of the stacked clusters agree well
with those derived from catalogs of X-ray clusters. Poisson variance in the
number of galaxies occupying halos of a given mass leads to significant
differences between the average richness at fixed mass and the average mass at
fixed richness that we can model relatively easily using a simple model of the
halo occupation distribution. These statistical effects probably explain recent
results in which optically-selected clusters lie on the same X-ray
luminosity-temperature relations as local clusters but have lower optical
richnesses than observed for local clusters with the same X-ray properties.
When we further binned the clusters by redshift, we did not find significant

affect the ability of galaxy clusters to produce strong lensing events, i.e.
gravitational arcs, and how they influence the arc morphologies and fluxes.
This is important for those studies aiming, for example, at constraining
cosmological parameters from statistical lensing, or at determining the inner
structure of galaxy clusters through gravitational arcs. We do so by creating
two-dimensional gradually smoothed, differently elliptical and asymmetric
versions of some numerical models. On average, we find that the contributions
of ellipticity, asymmetries and substructures amount to ~40%, ~10% and ~30% of
the total strong lensing cross section, respectively. However, our analysis
shows that substructures play a more important role in less elliptical and
asymmetric clusters, even if located at large distances from the cluster
centers (~1Mpc/h). Conversely, their effect is less important in highly
asymmetric lenses. The morphology, position and flux of individual arcs are
strongly affected by the presence of substructures in the clusters. Removing
substructures on spatial scales <~50kpc/h, roughly corresponding to mass scales
<~5 10^{10}M_\odot/h, alters the image multiplicity of ~35% of the sources used
in the simulations and causes position shifts larger than 5'' for ~40% of the
arcs longer than 5''. We conclude that any model for cluster lens cannot
neglect the effects of ellipticity, asymmetries and substructures. On the other
hand, the high sensitivity of gravitational arcs to deviations from regular,
smooth and symmetric mass distributions suggests that strong gravitational
lensing is potentially a powerfull tool to measure the level of substructures
and asymmetries in clusters.

statistical significance of both of these trends is only marginal with the
present sample of exoplanets. To account for these trends, we hypothesize that
there are two populations of gaseous planets: the low-mass population forms by
gas accretion onto a rock-ice core in a circumstellar disk and is more abundant
at high metalliticities, and the high-mass population forms directly by
fragmentation of a pre-stellar cloud. Planets of the first population form in
initially circular orbits and grow their eccentricities later, and may have a
mass upper limit from the total mass of the disk that can be accreted by the
core. The second population may have a mass lower limit resulting from
opacity-limited fragmentation. This would roughly divide the two populations in
mass, although they would likely overlap over some mass range. If most objects
in the second population form before the pre-stellar cloud becomes highly
opaque, they would have to be initially located in orbits larger than ~30 AU,
and would need to migrate to the much smaller orbits in which they are
observed. The higher mean orbital eccentricity of the second population might
be caused by the larger required intervals of radial migration, and the brown
dwarf desert might be due to the inability of high-mass brown dwarfs to migrate
inwards sufficiently in radius.

good agreement with the number of M31 satellites, the V-band surface brightness

the bombardment of the satellites heats and thickens the disk by a small

formation of isolated very massive stars at high redshifts in dark matter
dominated halos of 10^5 to 10^6 Msun. These stars photo-ionize their host
primordial molecular clouds, expelling all the baryons from their halos. When
the stars die, a relic HII region is formed within which large amounts of
molecular hydrogen form which will allow the gas to cool efficiently when
gravity assembles it into larger dark matter halos. The filaments surrounding
the first star hosting halo are largely shielded and provide the pathway for
gas to stream into the halo when the star has died. We present the first fully
three dimensional cosmological radiation hydrodynamical simulations that follow
all these effects. A novel adaptive ray casting technique incorporates the time
dependent radiative transfer around point sources. This approach is fast enough
so that radiation transport, kinetic rate equations, and hydrodynamics are
solved self-consistently. It retains the time derivative of the transfer
equation and is explicitly photon conserving. This method is integrated with
the cosmological adaptive mesh refinement code enzo, and runs on distributed
and shared memory parallel architectures. Where applicable the three
dimensional calculation not only confirm expectations from earlier one
dimensional results but also illustrate the multi-fold hydrodynamic
complexities of HII regions. In the absence of stellar winds the circumstellar
environments of the first supernovae and putative early gamma-ray bursts will

instabilities lead to cometary and elephant trunk like small scale structures

an emission component producing strong radiative recombination continua of C VI

that the star formation was triggered by the HI shell whose age was estimated
at 4.3 Myr (Stil & Irwin). The 3-dimensional geometry of SNR shell, molecular
cloud and the embedded cluster, which is inferred from our data, as well as the
cluster age strongly suggest that the star formation in Cloud 2 was triggered
by the SNR shell.

predicted to cover the mass range M=0.4975 to M= 0.4845 Mo, all models igniting
the He-flash with a mass of the H-rich envelope as given by about Me=0.00050.
The ignition mechanism is discussed in some details, showing the occurrence of
a bifurcation in the evolutionary history of stellar structures at the lower
mass limit for He ignition. Below such a critical mass, the structures miss the
He ignition, cooling down as a Hot Flasher-Manque' He White Dwarfs We predict
that these structures will cool down, reaching the luminosity logL/Lo=-1 in a
time at the least five times longer than the corresponding cooling time of a
normal CO White Dwarf. On very general grounds, one expects that old stellar
clusters with a sizeable population of Hot Flasher should likely produce at
least a similar amount of slow-cooling He White Dwarfs. According to this
result, in a cluster where 20% of Red Giants escape the He burning phase, one
expects roughly twice as White Dwarfs than in a normal cluster where all Red

main sequence of a 2 M_sun stellar model. These effects can be extremely
important in the end of the PMS, when the abundances in CNO elements approach
the equilibrium in the centre. We provide a possible physical explanation on
why a moderate amount of overshooting produces, as the star approaches the
ZAMS, an extra loop in the evolutionary tracks on the HR diagram.
  An interesting feature is that there is a very well defined amount of
overshooting (for a given stellar mass and chemical composition) beyond which a
loop is produced. For smaller amounts of overshooting such a loop does not take
place and the evolutionary tracks are similar to the ones obtained by Iben
(1965). The amount of overshooting needed to produce the loop decreases with
stellar mass.

of anion ordering and mysterious structureless transitions. Only in early
2000's their nature became elucidated by discoveries of a huge anomaly in the
dielectric permittivity and by the NMR evidences for the charge ordering
(disproportionation). These observations have been interpreted as the never
expected ferroelectric transition. The phenomenon unifies a variety of
different concepts and observations in quite unusual aspects or conjunctions:
ferroelectricity of good conductors, structural instability towards the
Mott-Hubbard state, Wigner crystallization in a dense electronic system, the
ordered 4K_F density wave, richness of physics of solitons, interplay of
structural and electronic symmetries. The corresponding theory of the ""combined
Mott-Hubbard state"" deals with orthogonal contributions to the Umklapp
scattering of electrons coming from the two symmetry breaking effects: the
build-in nonequivalence of bonds and the spontaneous nonequivalence of sites.
The state gives rise to several types of solitons, all of them showing in
experiments. On this basis we can interpret the complex of existing
experiments, and suggest some future ones, such as optical absorption and
photoconductivity, combined ferroelectric resonance and the phonon
anti-resonance, plasma frequency reduction.

the coupling to the phonons enters only through the self-energy, leaving the

  Graphs","41 pages, full version of a paper that will appear in SPAA`06",,,,"cs.DS cs.DM",,"  Many load balancing problems that arise in scientific computing applications
ask to partition a graph with weights on the vertices and costs on the edges
into a given number of almost equally-weighted parts such that the maximum
boundary cost over all parts is small.
  Here, this partitioning problem is considered for bounded-degree graphs
G=(V,E) with edge costs c: E->R+ that have a p-separator theorem for some p>1,
i.e., any (arbitrarily weighted) subgraph of G can be separated into two parts
of roughly the same weight by removing a vertex set S such that the edges
incident to S in the subgraph have total cost at most proportional to (SUM_e
c^p_e)^(1/p), where the sum is over all edges e in the subgraph.
  We show for all positive integers k and weights w that the vertices of G can
be partitioned into k parts such that the weight of each part differs from the
average weight by less than MAX{w_v; v in V}, and the boundary edges of each
part have cost at most proportional to (SUM_e c_e^p/k)^(1/p) + MAX_e c_e. The
partition can be computed in time nearly proportional to the time for computing
a separator S of G.
  Our upper bound on the boundary costs is shown to be tight up to a constant
factor for infinitely many instances with a broad range of parameters. Previous
results achieved this bound only if one has c=1, w=1, and one allows parts with
weight exceeding the average by a constant fraction.

$\rho\geq 0,$ and the radial- and tangential pressures $p\geq 0$ and $q,$
satisfy $p+q\leq\Omega\rho, \Omega\geq 1,$ were considered in the context of
Buchdahl's inequality. It was proved that static shell solutions of the
spherically symmetric Einstein equations obey a Buchdahl type inequality
whenever the support of the shell, $[R_0,R_1], R_0>0,$ satisfies $R_1/R_0<1/4.$
Moreover, given a sequence of solutions such that $R_1/R_0\to 1,$ then the
limit supremum of $2M/R_1$ was shown to be bounded by
$((2\Omega+1)^2-1)/(2\Omega+1)^2.$ In this paper we show that the hypothesis
that $R_1/R_0\to 1,$ can be realized for Vlasov matter, by constructing a
sequence of static shells of the spherically symmetric Einstein-Vlasov system
with this property. We also prove that for this sequence not only the limit
supremum of $2M/R_1$ is bounded, but that the limit is
$((2\Omega+1)^2-1)/(2\Omega+1)^2=8/9,$ since $\Omega=1$ for Vlasov matter.
Thus, static shells of Vlasov matter can have $2M/R_1$ arbitrary close to
$8/9,$ which is interesting in view of \cite{AR2}, where numerical evidence is
presented that 8/9 is an upper bound of $2M/R_1$ of any static solution of the

  This method, originally proposed for the Wilson gluon action, is extended
here to encompass all possible gluon actions made of closed Wilson loops; any
fermion action can be employed as well. The effect of resummation is to replace
various parameters in the action (coupling constant, Symanzik coefficients,
clover coefficient) by ``dressed'' values; the latter are solutions to certain
coupled integral equations, which are easy to solve numerically.
  Some positive features of this method are: a) It is gauge invariant, b) it
can be systematically applied to improve (to all orders) results obtained at
any given order in perturbation theory, c) it does indeed absorb in the dressed
parameters the bulk of tadpole contributions.
  Two different applications are presented: The additive renormalization of
fermion masses, and the multiplicative renormalization Z_V (Z_A) of the vector
(axial) current. In many cases where non-perturbative estimates of
renormalization functions are also available for comparison, the agreement with

  Jaffe-Witten mass gap in QCD","23 pages, no fugures, no tables, some additional clarification and
  new material are introduced and a new reference is added",,,,"hep-ph hep-th",,"  We propose to realize a mass gap in QCD by not imposing the transversality
condition on the full gluon self-energy, while preserving the color gauge
invariance condition for the full gluon propagator. This is justified by the
nonlinear and nonperturbative dynamics of QCD. None of physical
observables/processes in low-energy QCD will be directly affected by such a
temporary violation of color gauge invariance/symmetry. No
truncations/approximations and no special gauge choice are made for the
regularized skeleton loop integrals, contributing to the full gluon
self-energy, which enters the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the full gluon
propagator. In order to make the existence of a mass gap perfectly clear the
corresponding subtraction procedure is introduced. All this allows one to
establish the general structure of the full gluon propagator and the
corresponding gluon Schwinger-Dyson equation in the presence of a mass gap. It
is mainly generated by the nonlinear interaction of massless gluon modes.The
physical meaning of the mass gap is to be responsible for the large-scale
(low-energy/momentum), i.e., nonperturbative structure of the true QCD vacuum.
In the presence of a mass gap two different types of solutions for the full
gluon propagator are possible. The massive solution leads to an effective gluon
mass, which explicitly depends on the gauge-fixing parameter. This solution
becomes smooth at small gluon momentum in the Landau gauge. The general
iteration solution is always severely singular at small gluon momentum, i.e.,
the gluons remain massless, and this does not depend on the gauge choice. We
also formulate a general method how to restore the transversality of the gluon
propagator relevant for nonperturbative QCD.

the definition of asymptotic ``in'' and ``out'' states of charged particles
problematic in quantum field theory. In particular, the notion of a simple

be replaced by a more complicated branch cut structure describing an electron
interacting with a possibly infinite number of soft photons. Previous work
suggests a Dirac propagator raised to a fractional power dependent upon the
fine structure constant, however the exponent has not been calculated in a
unique gauge invariant manner. It has even been suggested that the fractal
``anomalous dimension'' can be removed by a gauge transformation. Here, a gauge
invariant non-perturbative calculation will be discussed yielding an
unambiguous fractional exponent. The closely analogous case of soft graviton
exponents is also briefly explored.

  Finally, we provide two regimes in which the binding condition is fulfilled,
obtaining the existence of a minimizer in these cases. The first is the weak
coupling regime for which the coupling constant $\alpha$ is small whereas
$\alpha Z$ and the particle number $N$ are fixed. The second is the
non-relativistic regime in which the speed of light tends to infinity (or
equivalently $\alpha$ tends to zero) and $Z$, $N$ are fixed. We also prove that

of trivial type, which are simply defined as inverse images of maximal
subgroups of the corresponding component group under the canonical projection
and whose classification constitutes a problem in finite group theory, (2)
those of normal type, whose connected one-component is a normal subgroup, and
(3) those of normalizer type, which are the normalizers of their own connected
one-component. It is also shown how to reduce the classification of maximal

maximal $\Sigma$-invariant subgroups of center-free connected compact simple
Lie groups and (3) the classification of the $\Sigma$-primitive subalgebras of

maps from spheres to (real, complex, or quaternionic) projective spaces. Our

Randall concerning maps which can be deformed away from themselves but not by
small deformations; in particular, there are close connections to the Strong
Kervaire Invariant One Problem.

universal scaling laws, both for single homogeneous regions (Corral, 2003) and
when averaged over multiple regions (Bak et al.,2002). These unified scaling
laws are characterized by intermediate power law asymptotics. On the other
hand, Molchan (2005) has presented a mathematical proof that, if such a
universal law exists, it is necessarily an exponential, in obvious
contradiction with the data. First, we generalize Molchan's argument to show
that an approximate unified law can be found which is compatible with the
empirical observations when incorporating the impact of the Omori law of
earthquake triggering. We then develop the full theory of the statistics of
inter-event times in the framework of the ETAS model of triggered seismicity
and show that the empirical observations can be fully explained. Our
theoretical expression fits well the empirical statistics over the whole range
of recurrence times, accounting for different regimes by using only the physics
of triggering quantified by Omori's law. The description of the statistics of
recurrence times over multiple regions requires an additional subtle
statistical derivation that maps the fractal geometry of earthquake epicenters
onto the distribution of the average seismic rates in multiple regions. This
yields a prediction in excellent agreement with the empirical data for
reasonable values of the fractal dimension $d \approx 1.8$, the average
clustering ratio $n \approx 0.9$, and the productivity exponent $\alpha \approx
0.9$ times the $b$-value of the Gutenberg-Richter law.

model to extract the radius of curvature of the cross section, based on the
elevation angle of the MC normal distributed over latitude. Application of the
model to Wind observations from 1995 - 1997 (close to solar minimum) shows that
the cross section is bent concavely outward by a structured solar wind with a
radius of curvature of $\sim$ 0.3 AU. Near solar maximum, MCs tend to be convex
outward in the solar wind with a uniform speed; the radius of curvature is
proportional to the heliographic distance of MCs, as demonstrated by Ulysses
observations between 1999 and 2003. These results improve our knowledge of the
global morphology of MCs in the pre-Stereo era, which is crucial for space
weather prediction and heliosphere studies.

the target country, the type of weapon used, and even for short time-scales.

black-box method is used for the synchronization of the clocks and the space
axes between two inertial systems or two accelerated systems and for the
derivation of the transformations between them. There are two consistent ways
of defining the inputs and outputs to describe the transformations and relative
motion between the systems. The standard approach uses a mixture of the two
ways. By formulating the principle of special and general relativity as a
symmetry principle we are able to specify these transformations to depend only
on a constant.
  The transformations become Galilean if the constant is zero. Validity of the
Clock Hypothesis for uniformly accelerated systems implies zero constant. If
the constant is not zero, we can introduce a metric under which the
transformations become self adjoint. In case of inertial systems, the metric is
the Minkowski metric and we obtain a unique invariant maximal velocity. The
ball of the relativistically admissible velocities is a bounded symmetric
domain under projective maps. For uniformly accelerated systems the existence
of an invariant \textit{maximal acceleration} is predicted. This is the only
method of describing transformations between uniformly accelerated systems
without assuming the Clock Hypothesis.

admissible velocities by Einstein velocity addition and rotations. This

derived by introducing a new principle which is analogous to the Einstein's
Equivalence Principle, but can be applied for any force. By this principle, the
relativistic dynamic equation is defined by an element of the Lie algebra of
the above representation. If we introduce a new dynamic variable, called
symmetric velocity, the above representation becomes a representation by
conformal, instead of projective maps. In this variable, the relativistic
dynamic equation for systems with an invariant plane, becomes a non-linear
analytic equation in one complex variable. We obtain explicit solutions for the
motion of a charge in uniform, mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic
fields. By the above principle, we show that the relativistic dynamic equation
for the four-velocity leads to an analog of the electromagnetic tensor. This
indicates that force in special relativity is described by a differential
two-form.

with a sequence of polarized single photons. The single photons are prepared
originally in the same state |0> by the servers on the network, which will
reduce the difficulty for the legitimate users to check eavesdropping largely.
The users code the information on the single photons with two unitary
operations which do not change their measuring bases. Some decoy photons, which
are produced by operating the sample photons with a Hadamard, are used for
preventing a potentially dishonest server from eavesdropping the quantum lines
freely. This scheme is an economical one as it is the easiest way for QSDC
network communication securely.

  box","8 pages no figure",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Wave mechanics of a particle in 1-D box (size $= d$) is critically analyzed
to reveal its untouched aspects. When the particle rests in its ground state,
its zero-point force ($F_o$) produces non-zero strain by modifying the box size
from $d$ to $d' = d + \Delta d$ in all practical situations where the force
($F_a$) restoring $d$ is not infinitely strong. Assuming that $F_a$ originates
from a potential $\propto x^2$ ($x$ being a small change in $d$), we find that:
(i) the particle and strained box assume a mutually bound state (under the
equilibrium between $F_o$ and $F_a$) with binding energy $\Delta{E} =
-\epsilon_o'\Delta{d}/d'$ (with $\epsilon_o' = h^2/8md'^2$ being the ground
state energy of the particle in the strained box), (ii) the box size oscillates
around $d'$ when the said equilibrium is disturbed, (iii) an exchange of energy
between the particle and the strained box occurs during such oscillations, and
(iv) the particle, having collisional motion in its excited states, assumes
collisionless motion in its ground state. These aspects have desired
experimental support and proven relevance for understanding the physics of
widely different systems such as quantum dots, quantum wires, trapped single
particle/ion, clusters of particles, superconductors, superfluids, {\it etc.}
It is emphasized that the physics of such a system in its low energy states can
be truly revealed if the theory incorporates $F_o$ and related aspects.

A 73, 063821 (2006)","10.1103/PhysRevA.73.063821",,"quant-ph",,"  We analyzed the efficiency of coherent population trapping (CPT) in a
superposition of the ground states of three-level atoms under the influence of
the decoherence process induced by a broadband thermal field. We showed that in
a single atom there is no perfect CPT when the atomic transitions are affected
by the thermal field. The perfect CPT may occur when only one of the two atomic
transitions is affected by the thermal field. In the case when both atomic
transitions are affected by the thermal field, we demonstrated that regardless
of the intensity of the thermal field the destructive effect on the CPT can be
circumvented by the collective behavior of the atoms. An analytic expression
was obtained for the populations of the upper atomic levels which can be
considered as a measure of the level of thermal decoherence. The results show
that the collective interaction between the atoms can significantly enhance the
population trapping in that the population of the upper state decreases with
increased number of atoms. The physical origin of this feature was explained by
the semiclassical dressed atom model of the system. We introduced the concept
of multiatom collective coherent population trapping by demonstrating the
existence of collective (entangled) states whose storage capacity is larger
than that of the equivalent states of independent atoms.
