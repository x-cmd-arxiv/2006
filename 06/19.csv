which utilises the expected geometrical features of the luminosity-distance
relation. The important advantage of this scheme is that it does not assume
explicit ansatzes for cosmological parameters but only some very general
cosmological properties via the geometrical features of the reconstructed
luminosity-distance relation. Using the recently released supernovae data by
the Supernova Legacy Survey together with a phase space representation, we show
that the reconstructed luminosity-distance curves best fitting the data
correspond to a slightly varying dark energy density with the Universe
expanding slightly slower than the Lambda CDM model. However, the Lambda CDM
model fits the data at 1 sigma significance level and the fact that our best
fitting luminosity-distance curve is lower than that of the corresponding
Lambda CDM model could be due to systematics. The transition from an
accelerating to a decelerating expansion occurs at a redshift larger than
z=0.35. Interpreting the dark energy as a minimally coupled scalar field we
also reconstruct the scalar field and its potential. We constrain
$\Omega_{m_0}$ using the baryon acoustic oscillation peak in the SDSS luminous
red galaxy sample and find that the best fit is obtained with
$\Omega_{m_0}=0.27$, in agreement with the CMB data.

T dwarfs exhibit the most distinctive positions in these diagrams. In M_5.8
versus [5.8]-[8.0], the IRAC data for T dwarfs are not monotonic in either
magnitude or color, giving the clearest indication yet that the T dwarfs are
not a one parameter family in Teff. Because metallicity does not vary enough in
the solar neighborhood to act as the second parameter, the most likely
candidate then is gravity, which in turn translates to mass. Among objects with
similar spectral type, the range of mass suggested by our sample is about a
factor of five (~70 M_Jup to ~15 M_Jup), with the less massive objects making
up the younger members of the sample. We also find the IRAC 4.5 micron fluxes
to be lower than expected, from which we infer a stronger CO fundamental band
at ~4.67 microns. This suggests that equilibrium CH_4/CO chemistry
underestimates the abundance of CO in T dwarf atmospheres, confirming earlier
results based on M-band observations from the ground. In combining IRAC
photometry with near-IR JHK photometry and parallax data, we find the
combination of Ks, IRAC 3.6 micron, and 4.5 micron bands to provide the best

amplification depends strongly on the ambient Alfven Mach number. We also show
that in the nonlinear model large increases in the magnetic field do not
necessarily translate into a large increase in the maximum particle momentum a
particular shock can produce, a consequence of high momentum particles
diffusing in the shock precursor where the large amplified field converges to
the low ambient value. To deal with the field growth rate in the regime of
strong fluctuations, we extend to strong turbulence a parameterization that is
consistent with the resonant quasi-linear growth rate in the weak turbulence
limit. We believe our parameterization spans the maximum and minimum range of
the fluctuation growth and, within these limits, we show that the nonlinear
shock structure, acceleration efficiency, and thermal particle injection rates
depend strongly on the yet to be determined details of wave growth in strongly

estimate magnetic fields amplified by strong cosmic-ray modified shocks in

to form stars. Second, the same X-rays deposit a certain amount of heat, which

H^- via photodetachment. We also take into consideration the non-equilibrium
level populations of H_2^+, which occur since transitions among the

reviving of the central engine. Flares can be powered by delayed magnetic
dissipation in strongly magnetized (i.e. with initial Poynting to kinetic flux
ratio $\simmore 1$) ejecta during its deceleration due to interaction with the

binaries to almost radial (""loss-cone"") orbits, where they pass near the
central massive black hole (MBH), interact with it at periapse, and are
ultimately destroyed. MPs dominate dynamical relaxation when the ratio of the
2nd moments of the MP and star mass distributions,
mu_2=(N_p*<M_p^2>)/(N_s*<M_s^2>), satisfies mu_2>>1. We compile the MP mass
function from published observations, and show that MPs in the nucleus of the
Galaxy (mainly giant molecular clouds), and plausibly in late type galaxies
generally, have 10^2<mu_2<10^8. MPs thus shorten the relaxation timescale by
10^1-10^7 relative to 2-body relaxation by stars alone. We show this increases
by 10-1000 the rate of \emph{large}-periapse interactions with the MBH, where
loss-cone refilling by stellar 2-body relaxation is inefficient. We extend the
Fokker-Planck loss-cone formalism to approximately account for relaxation by
rare encounters with MPs. We show that binary stars--MBH exchanges driven by
MPs can explain the origin of the young main sequence B stars that are observed
very near the Galactic MBH, and increase by orders of magnitude the ejection
rate of hyper-velocity stars. In contrast, the rate of \emph{small}-periapse
interactions of single stars with the MBH, such as tidal disruption, is only
increased by a factor of a few. We suggest that MP-driven relaxation plays an
important role in the 3-body exchange capture of single stars on very tight
orbits around the MBH. These captured stars may later be disrupted by the MBH
via tidal orbital decay or direct scattering into the loss cone; captured
compact objects may inspiral into the MBH by the emission of gravitational
waves from zero-eccentricity orbits.

quickly obtain estimates of the basic parameters, such as luminosity, size and
dust or gas mass and to predict the flux at yet unobserved wavelengths. The
procedure is simple and consists of finding an element in the library that
matches the observations. The objects may be in the local universe or at high
z.
  We calculate the radiative transfer in spherical symmetry for a stellar
cluster permeated by an interstellar medium with standard (Milky Way) dust
properties. The cluster contains two stellar populations: old bulge stars and
OB stars. Because the latter are young, a certain fraction of them will be
embedded in compact clouds which constitute hot spots that determine the MIR
fluxes.
  We present SEDs for a broad range of luminosities, sizes and obscurations. We
argue that the assumption of spherical symmetry and the neglect of clumpiness
of the medium are not severe shortcomings for computing the dust emission. The
validity of the approach is demonstrated by matching the SED of seven of the
best studied galaxies, including M82 and Arp220, by library elements. In all
cases, one finds an element which fits the observed SED very well, and the
parameters defining the element are in full accord with what is known about the
galaxy from detailed studies. We also compare our method of computing SEDs with
other techniques described in the literature.

  to Light",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Gravitational lensing has now become a popular tool to measure the mass
distribution of structures in the Universe on various scales. Here we focus on
the study of galaxy's scale dark matter halos with galaxy-galaxy lensing
techniques: observing the shapes of distant background galaxies which have been
lensed by foreground galaxies allows us to map the mass distribution of the
foreground galaxies. The lensing effect is small compared to the intrinsic
ellipticity distribution of galaxies, thus a statistical approach is needed to
derive some constraints on an average lens population. An advantage of this
method is that it provides a probe of the gravitational potential of the halos
of galaxies out to very large radii, where few classical methods are viable,
since dynamical and hydrodynamical tracers of the potential cannot be found at
this radii. We will begin by reviewing the detections of galaxy-galaxy lensing
obtained so far. Next we will present a maximum likelihood analysis of
simulated data we performed to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of
constraints that can be obtained on galaxy halo properties. Then we will apply
this method to study the properties of galaxies which stand in massive cluster
lenses at z~0.2. The main result of this work is to find dark matter halos of
cluster galaxies to be significantly more compact compared to dark matter halos
around field galaxies of equivalent luminosity, in agreement with early
galaxy-galaxy lensing studies and with theoretical expectations, in particular
with the tidal stripping scenario. We thus provide a strong confirmation of
tidal truncation from a homogeneous sample of galaxy clusters. Moreover, it is
the first time that cluster galaxies are probed successfully using
galaxy-galaxy lensing techniques from ground based data.

with some good semantic and physical reason, could be called the mass of an
infinitely extended, homogeneously matter-filled and expanding universe. To
answer this question we produce a space-like sum of instantaneous cosmic energy
depositions surrounding equally each spacepoint in the homogeneous universe. We
calculate the added-up instantaneous cosmic energy per volume around an
arbitrary space point in the expanding universe. To carry out this sum we use
as basic metrics an analogy to the inner Schwarzschild metric applied to stars,
but this time applied to the spacepoint-related universe. It is then shown that
this leads to the added-up proper energy within a sphere of a finite outer
critical radius defining the point-related infinity. As a surprise this radius
turns out to be reciprocal to the square root of the prevailing average cosmic
energy density. The equivalent mass of the universe can then also be calculated
and, by the expression which is obtained here, shows a scaling with this
critical radius of this universe, a virtue of the universe which was already
often called for in earlier works by E.Mach, H.Thirring and F.Hoyle and others.
This radius on the other hand can be shown to be nearly equal to the
Schwarzschild radius of the so-defined mass of the universe.

Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). In these bands, the lightcurves are distinguished
by a secondary maximum occurring roughly 20 to 30 days after the initial one.
Using time-dependent multi-group radiative transfer calculations, we calculate
the UBVRIJHK-band lightcurves of model SN Ia ejecta structures. Our synthetic
NIR lightcurves show distinct secondary maxima, and provide favorable fits to
observed SNe Ia. We offer a detailed explanation of the origin of the NIR
secondary maximum, which is shown to relate directly to the ionization
evolution of iron group elements in the ejecta. This understanding provides
immediate intuition into the dependence of the NIR lightcurves on the physical
properties of the ejecta, and in particular explains why brighter supernovae
have a later and more prominent secondary maximum. We demonstrate the
dependence of the NIR lightcurves on the mass of 56Ni, the degree of 56Ni
mixing, the mass of electron caputre elements, the progenitor metallicity, and
the abundance of intermediate mass elements (especially calcium). The secondary
maximum is shown to be a valuable diagnostic of these important physical
parameters. The models further confirm that SNe Ia should be excellent standard
candles in the NIR, with a dispersion < 0.2 mag even when the physical
properties of the ejecta are varied widely. This study emphasizes the
consummate value of NIR observations in probing the structure of SNe Ia and in
furthering their cosmological utility.

winds, can not be reproduced self-consistently in current supernova models. For
that reason, we investigate an alternate model involving the mass ejected by
fallback in a supernova explosion, through hydrodynamic and nucleosynthesis
calculations. The nucleosynthetic products of this ejected material produces
r-process elements, including those in the vicinity of the elusive 3rd peak at
mass number 195. Trans-iron element production beyond the second peak is made
possible by a rapid (<1ms) freezeout of alpha particles which leaves behind a
large nucleon (including protons!) to r-process seed ratio. This rapid phase is
followed by a relatively long (>15 ms) simmering phase at ~2e9 K, which is the
thermodynamic consequence of the hydrodynamic trajectory of the turbulent flows
in the fallback outburst. During the slow phase high mass elements beyond the
second peak are first made through rapid capture of both protons and neutrons.
The flow stays close to valley of stability during this phase. After freeze-out
of protons the remaining neutrons cause a shift out to short-lived isotopes as
is typical for the r-process. A low electron fraction isn't required in this
model, however, the detailed final distribution is sensitive to the electron
fraction. Our simulations suggest that supernova fallback is a viable
alternative scenario for the r-process.

clusters. We propose a single expression for the energy gain of a cluster due
to an encounter with a GMC, valid for all encounter distances and GMC
properties. This relation is verified with N-body simulations of cluster-GMC
encounters and excellent agreement is found. The fractional mass loss from the
cluster is 0.25 times the fractional energy gain. This is because 75% of the
injected energy goes to the velocities of escaping stars, that are higher than
the escape velocity. We derive an expression for the cluster disruption time
(t_dis) based on the mass loss from the simulations, taking into account the
effect of gravitational focusing by the GMC. The disruption time depends on the
cluster mass (M_c) and half-mass radius (r_h) as t_dis=2.0 S (M_c/10^4
M_sun)(3.75 pc/r_h)^3 Gyr, with S=1 for the solar neighbourhood and inversely
proportional to the GMC density. The observed shallow relation between cluster
radius and mass gives t_dis a power-law dependence on the mass with index 0.7,
similar to that found from observations and from simulations of clusters
dissolving in tidal fields (0.62). The constant of 2.0 Gyr is about a factor of
3.5 shorter than found from earlier simulations of clusters dissolving under
the combined effect of galactic tidal field and stellar evolution. It is
somewhat higher than the observationally determined value of 1.3 Gyr. It
suggests, however, that the combined effect of tidal field and encounters with
GMCs can explain the lack of old open clusters in the solar neighbourhood. GMC
encounters can also explain the (very) short disruption time that was observed
for star clusters in the central region of M51, since there rho_n is an order
of magnitude higher than in the solar neighbourhood.

multiband transverse magnetoresistivity in magnesium diboride, by calculating
its analytic expression, assuming a constant anisotropic Fermi surface mass
tensor. The calculation is done for arbitrary orientation of the magnetic field
with respect to the crystalline axes and for the current density either
perpendicular or parallel to the magnetic field. This approach allows to
extract quite univocally the values of the scattering times in the s- and p-
bands by fitting experimental data with a simple analytic expression. We also
extend the analysis to the magnetoresistivity of polycrystalline samples, with
an arbitrary angle between the current density and the magnetic field, taking
into account the anisotropy of each randomly oriented grain. Thereby, we
propose magnetoresistivity as a very powerful characterization tool to explore
the effect of disorder by irradiation or selective doping as well as of phonon
scattering in each one of the two types of bands, in single crystals and
polycrystalline samples, which is a crucial issue in the study of magnesium
diboride.

including constructive, computable, space-bounded, time-bounded, and
finite-state dimension. Using similar techniques, the Kucera-Gacs theorem is
examined from the perspective of decompression, by showing that every infinite
sequence S is Turing reducible to a Martin-Loef random sequence R such that the
asymptotic number of bits of R needed to compute n bits of S, divided by n, is
precisely the constructive dimension of S, which is shown to be the optimal
ratio of query bits to computed bits achievable with Turing reductions. The
extractors and decompressors that are developed lead directly to new
characterizations of some effective dimensions in terms of optimal
decompression by Turing reductions.

(Biology, Psychology, Sociology, Health, Political Science, Economics,
Education, Law, Business, Management). A robot trawls the Web for full-texts

(depending on discipline, year and country) and is slowly climbing annually
(correlation r=.76, sample size N=12, probability p < 0.005). Comparing OA and
NOA articles in the same journal/year, OA articles have consistently more
citations, the advantage varying from 36%-172% by discipline and year.
Comparing articles within six citation ranges (0, 1, 2-3, 4-7, 8-15, 16+

faster than NOA within every citation range (r > .90, N=12, p < .0005) and the
effect is greater with the more highly cited articles (r = .98, N=6, p < .005).
Causality cannot be determined from these data, but our prior finding of a
similar pattern in physics, where percent OA is much higher (and even
approaches 100% in some subfields), makes it unlikely that the OA citation
advantage is merely or mostly a self-selection bias (for making only one's
better articles OA). Further research will analyze the effect's timing, causal
components and relation to other variables.

based on distances between any two valuations. Suppose we are given such a
distance D. This defines an operator |D, called a distance operator, which
transforms any two sets of valuations V and W into the set V |D W of all
elements of W that are closest to V. This operator |D defines naturally the
revision of K by A as the set of all formulas satisfied in M(K) |D M(A) (i.e.
those models of A that are closest to the models of K). This constitutes a
distance-based revision operator. Lehmann et al. characterized families of them
using a loop condition of arbitrarily big size. An interesting question is
whether this loop condition can be replaced by a finite one. Extending the
results of Schlechta, we will provide elements of negative answer. In fact, we
will show that for families of distance operators, there is no ""normal""
characterization. Approximatively, a normal characterization contains only
finite and universally quantified conditions. These results have an interest of
their own for they help to understand the limits of what is possible in this
area. Now, we are quite confident that this work can be continued to show
similar impossibility results for distance-based revision operators, which
suggests that the big loop condition cannot be simplified.

Focus is placed on a sequence of topological excitations that derive from the
same classical soliton or vortex in lower dimensions and it is shown that their
quantum characteristics, such as the spectrum and profile, differ critically
with the dimension of spacetime. In all the examples examined the supercharge
algebra retains its classical form although short-wavelength fluctuations may
modify the operator structure of the central charge, yielding an anomaly. The
central charge, on taking the expectation value, is further affected by
long-wavelength fluctuations, and this makes the BPS-excitation spectra only
approximately calculable in some low-dimensional theories. In four dimensions,
in contrast, holomorphy plays a special role in stabilizing the BPS-excitation
spectra against quantum corrections. The basic tool in our study is the
superfield supercurrent, from which the supercharge algebra with a central
extension is extracted in a supersymmetric setting. A general method is
developed to determine the associated superconformal anomaly by considering
dilatation directly in superspace.

constant in the Robin boundary condition and the reflection probability is
still unclear. In this paper we clarify the issue by finding the relation

underlying It\^o dynamics, which is assumed to have variable drift and
diffusion tensor, with partial reflection at the boundary. Trajectories that
cross the boundary are terminated with a given probability and otherwise are
reflected in a normal or oblique direction. We use boundary layer analysis of

of the probability density function of the numerical scheme to the solution of
the Fokker-Planck equation with the Robin boundary condition, as the time step

from early methods such as linear discriminant analysis through to modern
developments such as neural networks and support vector machines. A large
number of comparative studies have been conducted in attempts to establish the
relative superiority of these methods. This paper argues that these comparisons
often fail to take into account important aspects of real problems, so that the
apparent superiority of more sophisticated methods may be something of an
illusion. In particular, simple methods typically yield performance almost as
good as more sophisticated methods, to the extent that the difference in
performance may be swamped by other sources of uncertainty that generally are
not considered in the classical supervised classification paradigm.

in streamer-type electric breakdown. It is mathematically equivalent to the
motion of a small bubble in a Hele-Shaw cell with a regularization of kinetic
undercooling type, namely a mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary condition for the
Laplacian field on the moving boundary. Using conformal mapping techniques,
linear stability analysis of the uniformly translating disk is recast into a
single PDE which is exactly solvable for certain values of the regularization
parameter. We concentrate on the physically most interesting exactly solvable
and non-trivial case. We show that the circular solutions are linearly stable
against smooth initial perturbations. In the transformation of the PDE to its
normal hyperbolic form, a semigroup of automorphisms of the unit disk plays a
central role. It mediates the convection of perturbations to the back of the
circle where they decay. Exponential convergence to the unperturbed circle
occurs along a unique slow manifold as time $t\to\infty$. Smooth temporal
eigenfunctions cannot be constructed, but excluding the far back part of the
circle, a discrete set of eigenfunctions does span the function space of
perturbations. We believe that the observed behaviour of a convectively
stabilized circle for a certain value of the regularization parameter is
generic for other shapes and parameter values. Our analytical results are
illustrated by figures of some typical solutions.

equations of motion for a system of classical degrees of freedom interacting on
a lattice. Such solutions are investigated for a diatomic Fermi-Pasta-Ulam
chain, i. e., a chain of alternate heavy and light masses coupled by anharmonic
forces. For hard interaction potentials, discrete breathers in this model are
known to exist either as ``optic breathers'' with frequencies above the optic
band, or as ``acoustic breathers'' with frequencies in the gap between the
acoustic and the optic band. In this paper, bifurcations between different
types of discrete breathers are found numerically, with the mass ratio m and
the breather frequency omega as bifurcation parameters. We identify a period
tripling bifurcation around optic breathers, which leads to new breather
solutions with frequencies in the gap, and a second local bifurcation around
acoustic breathers. These results provide new breather solutions of the FPU
system which interpolate between the classical acoustic and optic modes. The
two bifurcation lines originate from a particular ``corner'' in parameter space
(omega,m). As parameters lie near this corner, we prove by means of a center
manifold reduction that small amplitude solutions can be described by a
four-dimensional reversible map. This allows us to derive formally a continuum
limit differential equation which characterizes at leading order the
numerically observed bifurcations.

factors can be used in the calculations directly. The numerical calculation is
done with the form factors extracted by Rosenbluth, as well as by polarization
transfer methods. The dependence of the results on the form factor choice is
small for $Q^2 < 6 GeV^2$, but becomes sizable at higher $Q^2$.

up to the second resonance region with special emphasis on the influence of

Final state interaction is included by considering complete rescattering in the
final $NN$ and $\pi N$ subsystems. Their influence on the structure functions
governing the semi-exclusive differential cross section, where besides the
scattered electron only the produced pion is detected, is investigated in
detail. For charged pion-production the effect of $NN$-rescattering is moderate
whereas $\pi N$-rescattering is almost negligible, except very close to
threshold. $NN$-rescattering appears much stronger in neutral pion production
for which the primary mechanism is the elimination of a significant spurious
coherent contribution in the impulse approximation. Sizeable effects are also
found in some of the polarization structure functions for beam and/or target
polarizations.

stock price changes of ten frequently traded NASDAQ stocks in the year 2002.
Though the influence of the trading frequency on the aggregate return in a
certain time interval is important, it cannot alone explain the heavy tailed
distribution of stock price changes. For this reason, we analyze intervals with
a fixed number of trades in order to eliminate the influence of the trading
frequency and investigate the relevance of other factors for the aggregate
return. We show that in tick time the price follows a discrete diffusion
process with a variable step width while the difference between the number of
steps in positive and negative direction in an interval is Gaussian
distributed. The step width is given by the return due to a single trade and is
long-term correlated in tick time. Hence, its mean value can well characterize
an interval of many trades and turns out to be an important determinant for
large aggregate returns. We also present a statistical model reproducing the
cumulative distribution of aggregate returns. For an accurate agreement with
the empirical distribution, we also take into account asymmetries of the step
widths in different directions together with crosscorrelations between these
asymmetries and the mean step width as well as the signs of the steps.

we address this question by using numerical models in which both structure and
dynamics are controlled systematically. We consider the traffic of information
packets that include driving, searching and queuing. We present the results of
extensive simulations on two classes of networks; a correlated cyclic
scale-free network and an uncorrelated homogeneous weakly clustered network. By
measuring different dynamical variables in the free flow regime we show how the
global statistical properties of the transport are related to the temporal
fluctuations at individual nodes (the traffic noise) and the links (the traffic
flow). We then demonstrate that these two network classes appear as
representative topologies for optimal traffic flow in the regimes of low
density and high density traffic, respectively. We also determine statistical
indicators of the pre-jamming regime on different network geometries and
discuss the role of queuing and dynamical betweenness for the traffic
congestion. The transition to the jammed traffic regime at a critical posting
rate on different network topologies is studied as a phase transition with an
appropriate order parameter. We also address several open theoretical problems
related to the network dynamics.

increasing the field intensity leads to twice the spatial resolution of the
