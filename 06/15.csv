deep multiwavelength imaging in three fields from the MUSYC survey. These are
the first measurements to probe the spatial correlation function of K-selected
galaxies in this redshift range on large scales, allowing for robust
conclusions about the dark matter halos that host these galaxies. K-selected
galaxies with K<21 have a correlation length r_0 ~ 6 h^-1 Mpc, larger than
typical values found for optically-selected galaxies. The correlation length
does not depend on K-band magnitude, but it does increase strongly with color;
the J-K>2.3 distant red galaxies (DRGs) have r_0 ~ 11 h^-1 Mpc. Contrary to
findings for optically-selected galaxies, K-selected galaxies that are faint in
the R-band cluster more strongly than brighter galaxies. These results suggest
that a color-density relation was in place at z>2. Our results indicate that
K-bright blue galaxies and K-bright red galaxies are fundamentally different,
as they have different clustering properties. Using a simple model of one
galaxy per halo, we infer halo masses ~ 5 x 10^12 M_sun for K<21 galaxies and ~
2 x 10^13 M_sun for DRGs. A comparison of the observed space density of DRGs to
the density of their host halos suggests large halo occupation numbers;
however, this result is at odds with the lack of a strong small-scale excess in
the angular correlation function. We find that the z=0 descendants of the
galaxies considered here reside primarily in groups and clusters. [abridged]

energization of solar flare electrons.
  Aims: We study whether stochastic acceleration can reproduce the observed
soft-hard-soft evolution of the spectral features of the hard X-ray emitted by
suprathermal electron. We pay special attention to the effects of particle
trapping and escape.
  Methods: The Fokker-Planck equation for the electron distribution is
integrated numerically using the coefficients derived by Miller et al. for
transit-time damping acceleration. The electron spectra are then converted to
photon spectra for comparison with RHESSI observation of looptop sources.
  Results: The presence of particle escape softens the model spectra computed
in the stochastic acceleration framework. The ratio between the efficiency of
trapping and acceleration controls the spectral evolution which follows a
soft-hard-soft pattern. Furthermore, a pivot point (that is, a common crossing
point of the accelerated particle spectra at different times) is found at
around 10 keV. It can be brought into agreement with the observed value of 20
keV by enhanced trapping through an electric potential.
  Conclusions: The model proposed here accounts for the key features observed
in the spectral evolution of hard X-ray emission from looptop sources.

redshift, the K-band 2MASS magnitudes can be ""predicted"" with an rms scatter of
only 0.2 mag. When a dust content estimate determined from SDSS data by
Kauffmann et al. (2003) is also utilized, this scatter decreases to 0.1 mag. We

a galaxy in the emission-line-based Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagram is
correlated with the optical light concentration index and u-r color determined

observed extrasolar planetary systems, including hypothetical additional
bodies, with a focus on secular perturbations. These interactions cause the
eccentricities of the planets to explore a distribution of values over time
scales that are long compared to observational time baselines, but short
compared to the age of the systems. The same formalism determines the
eccentricity forcing of hypothetical test bodies (terrestrial planets) in these
systems and we find which systems allow for potentially habitable planets. Such
planets would be driven to nonzero orbital eccentricity and we derive the
distribution of stellar flux experienced by the planets over the course of
their orbits. The general relativistic corrections to secular interaction
theory are included in the analysis and such effects are important in systems
with close planets ($\sim$4 day orbits). Some extrasolar planetary systems
(e.g., Upsilon Andromedae) can be used as a test of general relativity, whereas
in other systems, general relativity can be used to constrain the system
parameters (e.g., $\sin i \gta 0.93$ for HD160691). For the case of hot
Jupiters, we discuss how the absence of observed eccentricity implies the

\~ 100 AU) with inhomogeneous structure that is qualitatively different from
that previously reported at 850 microns and longer wavelengths. We attribute
the 350/450 micron emission to a grain population whose characteristic size (~
1 mm) is intermediate between that of the cm-sized grains responsible for
emission longward of 850 microns and the much smaller grains (< 18 microns) in
the extensive halo, visible at 70 microns, discussed by Su et al. (2005). We
have combined our submillimeter images with Spitzer data at 70 microns to
produce 2-d maps of line-of-sight optical depth (relative column density).
These ""tau maps"" suggest that the mm-sized grains are located preferentially in
three symmetrically-located concentrations. If so, then this structure could be
understood in terms of the Wyatt (2003) model in which planetesimals are
trapped in the mean motion resonances of a Neptune-mass planet at 65 AU,
provided allowance is made for the spatial distribution of dust grains to
differ from that of the parent planetesimals. The peaks of the tau maps are, in
fact, located near the expected positions corresponding to the 4:3 resonance.
If this identification is confirmed by future observations, it would resolve an

planetary nebulae (PN) in the Galaxy that descend from single stars and stars
in binary systems. Using the most recent literature results on galactic and
stellar formation as well as stellar evolution, we predict the total number of
galactic PNe with radii <0.9 pc to be (46,000 +/- 13,000). We do not claim this
to be the complete population, since there can be visible PNe with radii larger
than this limit. However, by taking this limit, we make our predicted
population inherently comparable to the observationally-based value of
Peimbert, who determined (7200 +/- 1800) PNe should reside in the Galaxy today.
Our prediction is discrepant with the observations at the 2.9-sigma level, a
disagreement which we argue is meaningful in view of our specific treatment of
the uncertainty. We conclude that it is likely that only a subset of the stars
thought to be capable of making a visible PN, actually do. In the second paper
in this series, an argument will be presented that the bulk of the galactic PN
population might be better explained if only binaries produce PNe.
  The predicted PN formation rate density from single stars and binaries is
(1.1 +/- 0.5) x 10^{-12} PN/yr per cubic pc in the local neighborhood. This
number is lower than the most recent PN birthrate density estimates of 2.1 x
10^{-12} PN/yr per cubic pc, which are based on local PN counts and the PN
distance scale, but more in line with the white dwarf birthrate densities
determined by Liebert et al. ((1.0 +/- 0.25) x 10^{-12} WD/yr per cubic pc).
The predicted PN birthrate density will be revised down, if we assume that only
binaries make PNe. This revision will imply that the PN distance scale has to
be revised to larger values.

slope of galaxies in the rest-frame 3200-5800 AA wavelength range. Galaxies
form a remarkably narrow locus (~0.03 mag) in the resulting color-color
diagram. The Bruzual & Charlot population synthesis models suggest that the
position of a galaxy along this locus is controlled by a degenerate combination
of metallicity and age of the dominant stellar population. Galaxy distribution
along the locus is bimodal, with the local minimum corresponding to an ~1 Gyr
old single stellar population. The position perpendicular to the locus is
independent of metallicity and age, and reflects the galaxy's dust content, as
implied by both the models and the statistics of IRAS detections. A comparison
of this locus with the galaxy locus in the H_delta-D_n(4000) diagram, utilized
by Kauffmann et al. (2003) to estimate stellar masses, reveals a tight
correlation, although the two analyzed spectral ranges barely overlap. Overall,
the galaxy spectral energy distribution in the entire UV to near-IR range can
be described as a single-parameter family with an accuracy of 0.1 mag, or
better. This nearly one-dimensional distribution of galaxies in the
multi-dimensional space of measured parameters strongly supports the conclusion
of Yip et al. (2004), based on a principal component analysis, that SDSS galaxy
spectra can be described by a small number of eigenspectra. Apparently, the
contributions of stellar populations that dominate the optical emission from

variety of plausible past configurations. We find that the (faster rotating)
early Sun was prone to rotational instabilities even if only weak levels of
radial differential rotation were present, while the current Sun is not.
Stability domains are determined by approximate balance between dynamical and
diffusive timescales, allowing generalizations to other stellar contexts.
Depending on the strength and geometry of the weak magnetic field present, the
fastest growing unstable mode can be hydrodynamic or magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD)
in nature. Our results suggest that diffusive MHD modes may be more efficient
at transporting angular momentum than their hydrodynamic
(``Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke'') counterparts because the minimum spatial scale
required for magnetic tension to be destabilizing limits the otherwise very
small scales favored by double-diffusive instabilities. Diffusive
magneto-rotational instabilities are thus attractive candidates for angular
momentum transport in the early Sun's radiative zone.

Halos in high density environments form earlier and a higher fraction of their
mass is assembled in major mergers, compared to low density environments. The
distribution of the present-day specific mass aggregation rate is strongly
dependent on environment. While in low density environments only ~20% of the
halos are not accreting mass at the present epoch, this fraction rises to ~80%
at high densities. At z=1 the median of the specific aggregation rate is ~4
times larger than at z=0 and almost independent on environment. All the
dependences on environment found here are critically enhanced by local
processes associated to subhalos because the fraction of subhalos increases as
the environment gets denser. The distribution of the halo specific mass
aggregation rate as well as its dependence on environment resemble the
relations for the specific star formation rate distribution of galaxies. An
analogue of the morphology-density relation is also present at the level of CDM
halos, being driven by the halo major merging history. Nevertheless, baryonic
processes are necessary in order to explain further details and the evolution
of the star formation rate-, color- and morphology-environment relations.

significant difference between the colors of strongly-interacting and

narrow-line regions (NLRs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), it can be
contaminated by emission from surrounding starbursts. Recently, we have shown
that long-slit spectroscopy provides a valuable alternative approach to probe
the size in terms of AGN photoionisation. Moreover, several parameters of the
NLR can be directly accessed. We here apply the same methods developed and
described for the Seyfert-2 galaxy NGC1386 to study the NLR of five other
Seyfert-2 galaxies by using high-sensitivity spatially-resolved optical
spectroscopy obtained at the VLT and the NTT. We probe the AGN-photoionisation
of the NLR and thus, its ``real'' size using diagnostic line-ratio diagrams.We
derive physical properties of the NLR such as reddening, ionisation parameter,
electron density, and velocity as a function of distance from the nucleus. For
NGC5643, the diagnostic diagrams unveil a similar transition between line
ratios falling in the AGN regime and those typical for HII regions as found for
NGC1386, thus determining the size of the NLR. For the other four objects, all
measured line ratios fall in the AGN regime. In almost all cases, both electron
density and ionisation parameter decrease with radius. Deviations from this
general behaviour (such as a secondary peak) seen in both the ionisation
parameter and electron density can be interpreted as signs of shocks from the
interaction of a radio jet and the NLR gas. In several objects, the gaseous
velocity distribution is characteristic for rotational motion in an (inclined)
emission-line disk in the centre. We compare our results to those of NGC1386

multiple components in their spatially-resolved spectra with average velocity
offsets of ~180km/s across 8kpc in projection. From the ensemble properties
from our survey and the literature, we estimate the typical dynamical masses of
bright sub-mm galaxies as (5+/-3) x10^{11}Mo. This is similar to recent
estimates of their stellar masses -- suggesting that the dynamics of the
central regions of these galaxies are baryon dominated, with a substantial
fraction of those baryons in stars by the epoch of observation. Combining our
dynamical mass estimates with stellar luminosities for this population we
investigate whether submillimetre galaxies can evolve onto the Faber-Jackson
relation for local ellipticals. Adopting a typical lifetime of
tau_{burst}~300Myr for the submillimetre-luminous phase we find that the
stellar populations of sub-mm galaxies should fade to place them on the
Faber-Jackson relation, at M_K ~ -25.1. Furthermore, using the same starburst
lifetime we correct the observed space density of submillimetre galaxies for
the duty cycle to derive a volume density of the progenitors of ~1x10^{-4}
Mpc^{-3}. This is consistent with the space density of local luminous
early-type galaxies with M_K ~ -25.1, indicating that submillimetre galaxies
can evolve onto the scaling relations observed for local early-type galaxies,
and the observed population at z~2 is then sufficient to account for the
formation of the whole population of >~3 L^{*} ellipticals seen at z~0.

nucleosynthesis channels are illustrated in some details. As previously found,
the 13C formed after each third dredge up episode is usually completely
consumed by alpha captures before the onset of the subsequent thermal pulse,
releasing neutrons. This is the most efficient neutron source in low mass AGB
stars and the resulting s-process nucleosynthesis is at the origin of the solar
main component. However, in the solar metallicity model, we find that the
temperature of the first formed 13C pocket remains too low during the
interpulse and the 13C is not completely burnt, being partially engulfed in the
convective zone generated by the following thermal pulse. Due to the rapid
convective mixing in this zone, the 13C is exposed to a larger temperature and
a nucleosynthesis characterized by a relatively high neutron density develops.
The main effect is the strong enhancement of isotopes located beyond some
critical branching in the neutron-capture path, like 60Fe, otherwise only
marginally produced during a standard s-process nucleosynthesis.

separate the spectra of the primary and of the secondary in order to derive the

and leads to very extreme minimum masses, in particular for the primary object.
Minimum masses of the order of 150 \pm 50 and 50 \pm 15 M_\odot are found
respectively for the primary and the secondary. Conclusions: We propose that
HD15558 could be a triple system. This scenario could help to reconcile the
very large minimum mass derived for the primary object with its spectral type.
In addition, considering new and previously published results, we find that the
binary frequency among O-stars in IC1805 has a lower limit of 20%, and that
previously published values (80%) are probably overestimated.

which, when adiabatically varied in an appropriate closed cycle, define a
""$Z_2$ pump"". For an isolated system a single closed cycle of the pump changes
the expectation value of the spin at each end even when spin orbit interactions
violate the conservation of spin. A second cycle, however returns the system to
its original state. When coupled to leads, we show that the $Z_2$ pump
functions as a spin pump in a sense which we define, and transmits a finite,
though non quantized spin in each cycle. We show that the $Z_2$ pump is
characterized by a $Z_2$ topological invariant that is analogous to the Chern
invariant that characterizes a topological charge pump. The $Z_2$ pump is
closely related to the quantum spin Hall effect, which is characterized by a
related $Z_2$ invariant. This work presents an alternative formulation which
clarifies both the physical and mathematical meaning of that invariant. A
crucial role is played by time reversal symmetry, and we introduce the concept
of the time reversal polarization, which characterizes time reversal invariant
Hamiltonians and signals the presence or absence of Kramers degenerate end
states. For non interacting electrons we derive a formula for the time reversal
polarization which is analogous to the Berry's phase formulation of the charge
polarization. For interacting electrons, we show that abelian bosonization
provides a simple formulation of the time reversal polarization. We discuss
implications for the quantum spin Hall effect, and argue in particular that the
$Z_2$ classification of the quantum spin Hall effect is valid in the presence
of electron electron interactions.

that for any distribution of weigths, the distribution of optimal path lengths
has a universal form which is controlled by the scaling parameter
$Z=\ell_{\infty}/A$ where $A$ plays the role of the disorder strength, and
$\ell_{\infty}$ is the length of the optimal path in strong disorder. The
relation for $A$ is derived analytically and supported by numerical

composed of percolation clusters, which we regard as ""super-nodes"", connected
by a scale-free tree. We furthermore show that the MST can be partitioned into
two distinct components. One component the {\it superhighways}, for which the
nodes with high centrality dominate, corresponds to the largest cluster at the
percolation threshold which is a subset of the MST. In the other component,
{\it roads}, low centrality nodes dominate. We demonstrate the significance
identifying the superhighways by showing that one can improve significantly the
global transport by improving a very small fraction of the network.

spin liquids described by 2+1 dimensional conformal field theories (CFT): the
staggered flux (sF) spin liquid, and the deconfined critical point between the
Neel and valence-bond-solid (VBS) states. In these cases, the electric charge
is argued to be an exactly marginal perturbation of the CFT. Consequently, the
impurity susceptibility has a 1/T temperature dependence, with an anomalous
Curie constant which is a universal number associated with the CFT. One
unexpected feature of the CFT of the sF state is that an applied magnetic field
does not induce any staggered spin polarization in the vicinity of the impurity
(while such a staggered magnetization is present for the Neel-VBS case). These
results differ significantly from earlier theories of vacancies in the sF

spin 1/2 constituents, the spinons, as follows from the CP^1 mapping. These
quark spinons are confined in both the Neel ordered phase and quantum
paramagnetic phases. The confinement in the quantum paramagnetic phase is
understood as arising from quantum tunneling events, instantons or hedgehog
monopole events. In the present article, we study the approach to the quantum
critical point, where the quantum paramagnetic phase ceases to exist. We find
that irrespective of the intrinsic spin of the antiferromagnet, instanton
events disappear at the deconfined critical point because instanton tunelling
becomes infinitely costly and have zero probability at the quantum critical
point. Berry phase terms relevant to the paramagnetic phase vanish at the
quantum critical point, but make the confinement length scale diverge more
strongly for half-integer spins, next strongest for odd integer spins, and
weakest for even integer spins. There is an emergent photon at the deconfined
critical point, but the ""semimetallic'' nature of critical spinons screens such
photon making it irrelevant to long distance physics and the deconfined spinons
are strictly free particles. A unique prediction of having critical free
spinons is an anomalous exponent eta for the susceptibility exactly equal to

speed that a procrastinator executes a job increases as the due date

showing that there exist adversaries that force any online scheduling policy to
miss due dates. This impossibility result motivates the problem of minimizing
the maximum interval stretch of any job; the interval stretch of a job is the
job's flow time divided by the job's due date minus release time. We show that
several common scheduling strategies, including the ""hit-the-highest-nail""
strategy beloved by procrastinators, have arbitrarily large maximum interval
stretch. Then we give the ""thrashing"" scheduling policy and show that it is a
\Theta(1) approximation algorithm for the maximum interval stretch.

  Networks",,,,"#2006-01","cs.IT math.IT",,"  In this paper, a downlink scenario in which a single-antenna base station
communicates with K single antenna users, over a time-correlated fading
channel, is considered. It is assumed that channel state information is
perfectly known at each receiver, while the statistical characteristics of the
fading process and the fading gain at the beginning of each frame are known to
the transmitter. By evaluating the random coding error exponent of the
time-correlated fading channel, it is shown that there is an optimal codeword
length which maximizes the throughput. The throughput of the conventional
scheduling that transmits to the user with the maximum signal to noise ratio is
examined using both fixed length codewords and variable length codewords.
Although optimizing the codeword length improves the performance, it is shown
that using the conventional scheduling, the gap between the achievable
throughput and the maximum possible throughput of the system tends to infinity
as K goes to infinity. A simple scheduling that considers both the signal to
noise ratio and the channel time variation is proposed. It is shown that by
using this scheduling, the gap between the achievable throughput and the
maximum throughput of the system approaches zero.

present in a scene. Indeed, the polarimetric images obtained can reveal
polarizing properties of the objects that are not avalaible using conventional
imaging systems. However, when coherent light is used to illuminate the scene,
the images are degraded by speckle noise. The polarization properties of a
scene are characterized by the degree of polarization. In standard polarimetric
imagery system, four intensity images are needed to estimate this degree . If
we assume the uncorrelation of the measurements, this number can be decreased
to two images using the Orthogonal State Contrast Image (OSCI). However, this
approach appears too restrictive in some cases. We thus propose in this paper a
new statistical parametric method to estimate the degree of polarization
assuming correlated measurements with only two intensity images. The estimators
obtained from four images, from the OSCI and from the proposed method, are

to identify what is within the horizon, it is necessary to understand the late

inflation into a terminal vacuum. If the cosmological constant is negative, the
universe crunches. If it is zero, then we find that the observer's fate depends
on the mechanism of eternal inflation. Worldlines emerging from an eternal
inflation phase driven by thermal fluctuations end in a singularity. By
contrast, if eternal inflation ends by bubble nucleation, the observer can
emerge into an asymptotic, locally flat region. As evidence that bubble
collisions preserve this property, we present an exact solution describing the
collision of two bubbles.

minimally coupled to gravity and electromagnetism. The event horizon is a

standard one. The scalar field is regular everywhere except at the origin, and
is supported by the presence of electric charge which is bounded from above by
the AdS radius. In turn, the presence of the real scalar field smooths the
electromagnetic potential everywhere. Regardless the value of the electric
charge, the black hole is massless and has a fixed temperature. The entropy
follows the usual area law. It is shown that there is a nonvanishing
probability for the decay of the hairy black hole into a charged black hole

states of neutral mesons, signalling an intrinsic breakdown of CPT invariance.
One class of models deals with a specific model of foam, initially constructed
in the context of non-critical (Liouville) string theory, but viewed here in
the more general context of effective quantum-gravity models. The relevant
Hamiltonian perturbation, describing the interaction of the meson with the foam
medium, consists of off-diagonal stochastic metric fluctuations, connecting
distinct mass eigenstates (or the appropriate generalisation thereof in the
case of K-mesons), and it is proportional to the relevant momentum transfer
(along the direction of motion of the meson pair). There are two kinds of
CPT-violating effects in this case, which can be experimentally disentangled:
one (termed ``omega-effect'') is associated with the failure of the
indistinguishability between the neutral meson and its antiparticle, and
affects certain symmetry properties of the initial state of the two-meson
system; the second effect is generated by the time evolution of the system in
the medium of the space-time foam, and can result in time-dependent
contributions of the $omega-effect type in the time profile of the two meson
state. Estimates of both effects are given, which show that, at least in
certain models, such effects are not far from the sensitivity of experimental
facilities available currently or in the near future. The other class of
quantum gravity models involves a medium of gravitational fluctuations which
behaves like a ``thermal bath''. In this model both of the above-mentioned

the lightest state in the perturbative multiplet. This state is non trivial

problems. If the moduli fields are fixed during inflation, as is usually
assumed, it appears that viable slow-roll inflation can then be obtained with
just one fine-tuning of the moduli sector parameters. However, we show this is
not a reasonable assumption, and that the small variation of the moduli fields
during inflation gives a significant contribution to the effective inflaton
potential. This typically implies that eta is approximately -6, although it may
be possible to obtain smaller values with heavy fine-tuning.

build fractals in the large which are modeled on lacunary Fourier series and

+Lq_{x}=0, -q_{xx} + Rq +G\cdot u_{x}=0,$ where $u\in\R^{n}$, $q\in\R$ and
$R>0$, $G$, $L\in\R^{n}$. The flux function $f : \R^n\to\R^n$ is smooth and
such that $\nabla f$ has $n$ distinct real eigenvalues for any $u$. The problem
of existence of admissible radiative shock wave is considered, i.e. existence
of a solution of the form $(u,q)(x,t):=(U,Q)(x-st)$, such that
$(U,Q)(\pm\infty)=(u_\pm,0)$, and $u_\pm\in\R^n$, $s\in\R$ define a shock wave
for the reduced hyperbolic system, obtained by formally putting L=0. It is
proved that, if $u_-$ is such that $\nabla\lambda_{k}(u_-)\cdot r_{k}(u_-)\neq

corresponding right eigenvector) and $(\ell_{k}(u_{-})\cdot L) (G\cdot

that for any $u_+\in{\mathcal U}$, $s\in\R$ such that the triple
$(u_{-},u_{+};s)$ defines a shock wave for the reduced hyperbolic system, there
exists a (unique up to shift) admissible radiative shock wave for the complete
hyperbolic--elliptic system. Additionally, we are able to prove that the
profile $(U,Q)$ gains smoothness when the size of the shock $|u_+-u_-|$ is
small enough, as previously proved for the Burgers' flux case. Finally, the
general case of nonconvex fluxes is also treated, showing similar results of
existence and regularity for the profiles.

with dense singularities were introduced, motivated by the so called space-time
foam structures in General Relativity with dense singularities, and by Quantum
Gravity. A variety of applications of these algebras has been presented, among
them, a global Cauchy-Kovalevskaia theorem, de Rham cohomology in abstract
differential geometry, and so on. So far the space-time foam algebras have only
been constructed on Euclidean spaces. In this paper, owing to their relevance
in General Relativity among others, the construction of these algebras is
extended to arbitrary finite dimensional smooth manifolds. Since these algebras
contain the Schwartz distributions, the extension of their construction to
manifolds also solves the long outstanding problem of defining distributions on
manifolds, and doing so in ways compatible with nonlinear operations. Earlier,
similar attempts were made in the literature with respect to the extension of
the Colombeau algebras to manifolds, algebras which also contain the
distributions. These attempts have encountered significant technical
difficulties, owing to the growth condition type limitations the elements of
Colombeau algebras have to satisfy near singularities. Since in this paper no
any type of such or other growth conditions are required in the construction of
space-time foam algebras, their extension to manifolds proceeds in a
surprisingly easy and natural way. It is also shown that the space-time foam
algebras form a fine and flabby sheaf, properties which are important in
securing a considerably large class of singularities which generalized
functions can handle.

Schmidt, by appealing to the direct finiteness of the algebra $\ell^1(\Gamma)$.
We give simple examples to show that in general one cannot replace
$\ell^{\infty}$ with $\ell^p$, $1\leq p< \infty$, nor with $L^{\infty}(G)$ for
nondiscrete G. Finally, we consider the problem of extending the main result to
the case of weighted convolution operators on $\Gamma$, and give some partial
results.

particles are trapped inside a cluster. Here, we investigate some properties of
the trapping/untrapping mechanism of a single particle into/outside the
cluster. Since the single particle dynamics of the HMF model resembles the one
of a simple pendulum, each particle can be identified as a high-energy particle
(HEP) or a low-energy particle (LEP), depending on whether its energy is above
or below the separatrix energy. We then define the trapping ratio as the ratio
of the number of LEP to the total number of particles and the
``fully-clustered'' and ``excited'' dynamical states as having either no HEP or
at least one HEP. We analytically compute the phase-space average of the
trapping ratio by using the Boltzmann-Gibbs stable stationary solution of the
Vlasov equation associated with the $N \to \infty$ limit of the HMF model. The
same quantity, obtained numerically as a time average, is shown to be in very
good agreement with the analytical calculation. Another important feature of
the dynamical behavior of the system is that the dynamical state changes
transitionally: the ``fully-clustered'' and ``excited'' states appear in turn.
We find that the distribution of the lifetime of the ``fully-clustered'' state
obeys a power law. This means that clusters die hard, and that the excitation
of a particle from the cluster is not a Poisson process and might be controlled
by some type of collective motion with long memory. Such behavior should not be
specific of the HMF model and appear also in systems where {\it itinerancy}
among different ``quasi-stationary'' states has been observed. It is also
possible that it could mimick the behavior of transient motion in molecular
clusters or some observed deterministic features of chemical reactions.

purpose we define a weighted network where the consonants are the nodes and an
edge between two nodes (read consonants) signify their co-occurrence likelihood
over the consonant inventories. Through this network we identify communities of
consonants that essentially reflect their patterns of co-occurrence across
languages. We test the goodness of the communities and observe that the
constituent consonants frequently occur in such groups in real languages also.
Interestingly, the consonants forming these communities reflect strong
correlations in terms of their features, which indicate that the principle of
feature economy acts as a driving force towards community formation. In order
to measure the strength of this force we propose an information theoretic
definition of feature economy and show that indeed the feature economy
exhibited by the consonant communities are substantially better than those if
the consonant inventories had evolved just by chance.

oscillation of (G+C)-content of cycle length of hundreds kilobases (500 kb near
the right telomere). We aim at establishing the existence of similar
periodicity in structure-related sequence features in order to relate this
(G+C)% oscillation to other biological phenomena. The following quantities are
shown to oscillate with the same 500kb periodicity in human chromosome 21:
binding energy calculated by two sets of dinucleotide-based thermodynamic
parameters, AA/TT and AAA/TTT bi-/tri-nucleotide density, 5'-TA-3' dinucleotide
density, and signal for 10/11-base periodicity of AA/TT or AAA/TTT. These
intrinsic quantities are related to structural features of the double helix of
DNA molecules, such as base-pair binding, untwisting/unwinding, stiffness, and
a putative tendency for nucleosome formation.

data (light intensity) by a logarithmic transformation, and the justification
for this transformation is to make the distribution more symmetric and
Gaussian-like. Since this transformation is not universally practiced in all
microarray analysis, we examined whether the discrepancy of this treatment of
raw data affect the ""high level"" analysis result. In particular, whether the
differentially expressed genes as obtained by $t$-test, regularized t-test, or
logistic regression have altered rank orders due to presence or absence of the
transformation. We show that as much as 20%--40% of significant genes are
""discordant"" (significant only in one form of the data and not in both),
depending on the test being used and the threshold value for claiming
significance. The t-test is more likely to be affected by logarithmic
transformation than logistic regression, and regularized $t$-test more affected
than t-test. On the other hand, the very top ranking genes (e.g. up to top
20--50 genes, depending on the test) are not affected by the logarithmic
transformation.

algebra, in 5-dimensional spacetime. The choice of this space is given the
character of first principle, justified solely by the consequences that can be
derived from such choice and their consistency with experimental results. Given
a metric space of any dimension, one can define monogenic functions, the
natural extension of analytic functions to higher dimensions; such functions
have null vector derivative and have previously been shown by other authors to
play a decisive role in lower dimensional spaces. All monogenic functions have
null Laplacian by consequence; in an hyperbolic space this fact leads
inevitably to a wave equation with plane-like solutions. This is also true for
5-dimensional spacetime and we will explore those solutions, establishing a
parallel with the solutions of the Dirac equation. For this purpose we will
invoke the isomorphism between the complex algebra of 4x4 matrices, also known
as Dirac's matrices. There is one problem with this isomorphism, because the
solutions to Dirac's equation are usually known as spinors (column matrices)
that don't belong to the 4x4 matrix algebra and as such are excluded from the
isomorphism. We will show that a solution in terms of Dirac spinors is
equivalent to a plane wave solution. Just as one finds in the standard
formulation, monogenic functions can be naturally split into positive/negative
energy together with left/right ones. This split is provided by geometric
projectors and we will show that there is a second set of projectors providing
an alternate 4-fold split. The possible implications of this alternate split
are not yet fully understood and are presently the subject of profound
research.

system when the period of the kicks corresponds to the regime of quantum
resonance. In the classical analogue, a spatial-temporal symmetry should be
broken to obtain a net directed current. It was recently discovered that in
quantum resonance the temporal symmetry can be kept, and we prove that breaking
the spatial symmetry is a necessary condition to find this effect.
  Moreover, we show numerically and analytically how the direction of the
motion is dramatically influenced by the strength of the kicking potential and
the value of the period. By increasing the strength of the interaction this
direction changes periodically, providing us with a non-expected source of
current reversals in this quantum model. These reversals depend on the kicking
period also, though this behavior is theoretically more difficult to analyze.
Finally, we generalize the discussion to the case of a non-uniform initial
condition.

also be used to purify any stabilizer state. We further specify which classes

can be efficiently computed using a message passing algorithm. We compare the
performance of the message passing algorithm to that of the widespread
blockwise hard decoding technique. Our Monte Carlo results using the 5 qubit
and Steane's code on a depolarizing channel demonstrate significant advantages
of the message passing algorithms in two respects. 1) Optimal decoding
increases by as much as 94% the error threshold below which the error
correction procedure can be used to reliably send information over a noisy
channel. 2) For noise levels below these thresholds, the probability of error
after optimal decoding is suppressed at a significantly higher rate, leading to
a substantial reduction of the error correction overhead.

Aharonov and Susskind [Phys. Rev. 155, 1428 (1967)], explicitly violates the
commonly-accepted superselection rule that forbids coherent superpositions of
eigenstates of differing atom number. This interference experiment makes use of
a Bose-Einstein condensate as a reference frame with which to perform the
coherent operations analogous to Ramsey pulses. We also investigate an
analogous gedanken experiment to exhibit a coherent superposition of a single
boson and a fermion, violating the commonly-accepted superselection rule
forbidding coherent superpositions of states of differing particle statistics;
in this case, the reference frame is realized by a multi-mode state of many
fermions. This latter case reproduces all of the relevant features of Ramsey
interferometry, including Ramsey fringes over many repetitions of the
experiment. However, the apparent inability of this proposed experiment to
produce well-defined relative phases between two distinct systems each
described by a coherent superposition of a boson and a fermion demonstrates
that there are additional, outstanding requirements to fully ``lift'' the
univalence superselection rule.
