within the partially screened inner gap model, in which the

that relates the thermal X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm x}$ from the spark-heated
polar cap and the \EB subpulse periodicity $\hat{P}_3$ (polar cap carousel
time). For PSRs B0943+10 and B1133+16, the only two pulsars for which both
$\hat{P}_3$ and $L_{\rm x}$ are known observationally, this formula holds well.
For a few other pulsars, for which only one quantity is measured

relevant observations that can confirm or discard the model. Then we further
study the detailed physical conditions that allow such partially screened inner

c}$ is the critical temperature above which the surface delivers a thermal flow
to adequately supply the corotation charge density, and $T_{\rm s}$ is the

to be 7-50 times stronger than those from OI but there is only marginal
evidence of CI in the spectra and none of CII. We deduce that for these three

MgII is also detected in a velocity range similar to that of OI. The presence

preheating, a highly non-thermal phase of evolution during which the inflaton
pumps energy into a specific set of momentum modes of field(s) to which it is
coupled. This necessarily induces large, transient density inhomogeneities
which can source a significant spectrum of gravitational waves. In this paper,
we consider the generic properties of gravitational waves produced during
preheating, perform detailed calculations of the spectrum for several specific
inflationary models, and identify problems that require further study. In
particular, we argue that if these gravitational waves exist they will
necessarily fall within the frequency range that is feasible for direct
detection experiments -- from laboratory through to solar system scales. We
extract the gravitational wave spectrum from numerical simulations of
preheating after $\lambda \phi^4$ and $m_{\phi}^2 \phi^2$ inflation, and find
that they lead to a gravitational wave amplitude of around $\Omega_{gw}h^2\sim
10^{-10}$. This is considerably higher than the amplitude of the primordial
gravitational waves produced during inflation. However, the typical wavelength
of these gravitational waves is considerably shorter than LIGO scales, although
in extreme cases they may be visible at scales accessible to the proposed BBO
mission. We survey possible experimental approaches to detecting any
gravitational wave background generated during preheating.

less favored than amorphous water ice at low temperatures, suggesting that
resurfacing processes may be taking place. The near infrared color of the

fractions can account for the entire bright quasar luminosity function and
buildup of the red sequence at all but the highest masses at low redshift

supports a necessary prediction of theories where mergers between gas-rich

transition mass, possibly reflecting the mass above which the elliptical
population is mostly (>~50%) assembled at a given redshift, which increases

local short GRB rate in early-type galaxies may be comparable to that in
late-type galaxies. This suggests that, unlike Type Ia supernovae, at least
half of the short GRB progenitors that can outburst within a Hubble time have
lifetimes greater than about 7 Gyr. Models of the probability distribution of
time delays, here parametrized as P(\tau) \propto \tau^n, with n > -1 are
favored. This apparent long time delay and the fact that early-type galaxies in
clusters make a substantial contribution to the local stellar mass inventory
can explain the observed preponderance of short GRBs in galaxy clusters.

with measured gas surface densities, spanning from normal spirals to
starbursts. We show that the ratio of the minimum energy magnetic pressure to
the total pressure in the ISM decreases substantially with increasing surface
density; for Arp 220 this ratio is ~10^-4. Therefore, if the minimum energy
estimate is applicable, magnetic fields in starbursts are dynamically weak
compared to gravity, in contrast to normal spiral galaxies. We argue, however,
that rapid cooling of relativistic electrons in starbursts invalidates the
minimum energy estimate. We critically assess a number of independent
constraints on the magnetic field strength in starbursts. In particular, we
argue that the existence of the FIR-radio correlation implies that the
synchrotron cooling timescale for cosmic ray electrons is much shorter than
their escape time from the galactic disk; this in turn implies that the true
magnetic field in starbursts is significantly larger than B_min. The strongest
argument against such large fields is that one might expect starbursts to have
steep radio spectra indicative of strong synchrotron cooling, which is not
observed. We show, however, that ionization and bremsstrahlung losses can
flatten the nonthermal spectra of starburst galaxies even in the presence of
rapid cooling, providing much better agreement with observed spectra. We
further demonstrate that ionization and bremsstrahlung losses are likely to be
important in shaping the radio spectra of most starbursts at GHz frequencies,
thereby preserving the linearity of the FIR-radio correlation. We thus conclude
that magnetic fields in starbursts are significantly larger than B_min. We
highlight several observations that can test this conclusion.

in all of the available observations, from the near-IR H band to the optical U
band. The SED is completely different from that of Seyfert galaxies and QSO, as
it appears basically ``flat'' in the IR-optical region, with a small drop-off

extended NLR must exist in this object. This may be interpreted in the
framework of two different scenarios: i) the radiation from ADAFs is sufficient
to give rise to high ionization emission-line regions through photoionization,
or ii) the nuclear source has recently ``turned-off'', switching from a
high-efficiency accretion regime to the present low-efficiency state.

These are thus exposed to the most important star-formation feedback
mechanisms: photoionization and the cluster wind. The models show how the two
feedback mechanisms compete in the disruption of clouds and lead to two
different hydrodynamic solutions: The storage of clouds into a long lasting
ragged shell that inhibits the expansion of the thermalized wind, and the
steady filtering of the shocked wind gas through channels carved within the
cloud stratum. Both solutions are claimed to be concurrently at work in giant
HII regions and HII galaxies, causing their detailed inner structure. This
includes multiple large-scale shells, filled with an X-ray emitting gas, that
evolve to finally merge with each other, giving the appearance of shells within
shells. The models also show how the inner filamentary structure of the giant
superbubbles is largely enhanced with matter ablated from clouds and how cloud
ablation proceeds within the original cloud stratum. The calculations point at
the initial contrast density between the cloud and the intercloud media as the
factor that defines which of the two feedback mechanisms becomes dominant
throughout the evolution. Animated version of the models can be found at

Australia Telescope Compact Array data with resolution matching Chandra. We
have searched for optical emission with Magellan, with sub-arcsecond
resolution. The radio to X-ray spectral energy distribution for most of the
individual regions indicates against synchrotron radiation from a
single-component electron spectrum. We therefore explore the consequences of
assuming that the X-ray emission is the result of inverse Compton scattering on
the cosmic microwave background. If particles and magnetic fields are near
minimum energy density in the jet rest frames, then the emitting regions must
be relativistically beamed, even at distances of order 500 kpc from the quasar.
We estimate the magnetic field strengths, relativistic Doppler factors, and
kinetic energy flux as a function of distance from the quasar core for two or
three distinct regions along each jet. We develop, for the first time,
estimates in the uncertainties in these parameters, recognizing that they are
dominated by our assumptions in applying the standard synchrotron minimum
energy conditions. The kinetic power is comparable with, or exceeds, the quasar
radiative luminosity, implying that the jets are a significant factor in the
energetics of the accretion process powering the central black hole. The
measured radiative efficiencies of the jets are of order 10^(-4).

emission escapes the dense, cold envelope of young protostars. The mid-infrared
emission of the protostars can be fit by two temperatures of 150 and 400 K; the
hot core region is probably optically thin in the mid-infrared regime, and the
size of hot core is much smaller than that of the cold envelope. The presence
of multiple protostars within the cold cores of Class 0 objects implies that
clustering occurs at this early stage of star formation. The TC3 cluster shows
that the most massive star is located at the center of the cluster and at the

three are tantalizingly close to, or a one day alias of, the three strongest
periodicities found in the concurrent photometric campaign. We further
attempted to detect pulsational variations in the Balmer line amplitudes. The
single detected periodicity of 7209 s, although weak, is consistent with
theoretical expectations as a function of wavelength.Furthermore, it allows us
to rule out a degree index of l= 3 or l= 5 for that mode. Given the extreme
weakness of g-mode pulsations in these stars,we conclude that anything beyond
simply detecting their presence will require larger telescopes,higher
efficiency spectral monitoring over longer time baselines,improved longitude
coverage, and increased radial velocity precision.

solution to the Riemann problem is approximated by two constant states bounded
by two fast shocks and separated by a tangential wave. The scheme is
Jacobian-free, in the sense that it avoids the expensive characteristic

which is not based on the presence of disorder potentials. Instead, a
quantization of the electronic drift current in the presence of crossed
electric and magnetic fields is employed to construct a non-linear transport
theory. Another important ingredient of the alternative theory is the coupling
of the two-dimensional electron gas to the leads and the applied voltages. By
working in a picture, where the external voltages fix the chemical potential in
the 2D subsystem, the experimentally observed linear relation between the
voltage and the location of the quantum Hall plateaus finds an natural
explanation. Also, the classical Hall effect emerges as a natural limit of the
quantum Hall effect.
  For low temperatures (or high currents), a non-integer substructure splits
higher Landau levels into sublevels. The appearence of substructure and
non-integer plateaus in the resistivity is NOT linked to electron-electron
interactions, but caused by the presence of a (linear) electric field. Some of

one minimizes a linear functional, with coefficients related to log-likelihood

performance of the error-correction scheme at moderate and large
Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNR), it is important to study the relaxed polytope to
understand better its vertexes, so-called pseudo-codewords, especially those
which are neighbors of the zero codeword. In this manuscript we propose a
technique to heuristically create a list of these neighbors and their
distances. Our pseudo-codeword-search algorithm starts by randomly choosing the
initial configuration of the noise. The configuration is modified through a
discrete number of steps. Each step consists of two sub-steps. Firstly, one
applies an LP decoder to the noise-configuration deriving a pseudo-codeword.
Secondly, one finds configuration of the noise equidistant from the pseudo
codeword and the zero codeword. The resulting noise configuration is used as an
entry for the next step. The iterations converge rapidly to a pseudo-codeword
neighboring the zero codeword. Repeated many times, this procedure is
characterized by the distribution function (frequency spectrum) of the
pseudo-codeword effective distance. The effective distance of the coding scheme
is approximated by the shortest distance pseudo-codeword in the spectrum. The
efficiency of the procedure is demonstrated on examples of the Tanner
$[155,64,20]$ code and Margulis $p=7$ and $p=11$ codes (672 and 2640 bits long
respectively) operating over an Additive-White-Gaussian-Noise (AWGN) channel.

gravity scenarios, their functional forms are quantum gravity model dependent.
Since both string theory and loop quantum gravity give more reliable solution
of the black hole thermodynamics, one can use their results to test approximate
results of GUP and MDRs. In this paper, we find quantum corrected black hole
thermodynamics in the framework of GUP and MDR and then we compare our results

indeed the case. It is now widely admitted that models of Lorentz symmetry
violation (LSV) at the Planck scale based on power-like extrapolations down to
cosmic-ray scales and able to account for a possible absence of the
Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff exist and require the existence of a privileged
inertial rest frame, as we proposed in 1997 (paper physics/9704017 and
subsequent work). The favoured energy dependence of the LSV parameter will then
be quadratic rather than linear. This approach (weak doubly special relativity,
WDSR) is different from the version of doubly special relativity defended by
several authors, where the laws of Physics are required to be exactly identical
in all inertial reference frames (strong doubly special relativity, SDSR). To
date, WDSR patterns based on a deformation of special relativity with a
privileged (vacuum) rest frame are the only clear and consistent candidate to
explain a possible absence of the GZK cutoff invoking deviations from standard
relativity. It is also to be emphasized, as in hep-ph/0510361, that the usual
hypothesis of a power-like dependence of the LSV effective parameters not being
altered by any intermediate energy scale is not the only possible one.
Therefore, experiments sensitive to UHCR energies as high as possible become
necessary irrespective of AUGER results.

variational approximation to determine the lowest bound state in the scalar
Wick-Cutkosky model where two equal-mass constituents interact via the exchange
of mesons. Self-energy and vertex corrections are included approximately in a
consistent way as well as crossed diagrams. Only vacuum-polarization effects of
the heavy particles are neglected. In a path integral description of an
appropriate current-current correlator an effective, retarded action is
obtained by integrating out the meson field. As in the polaron problem we
employ a quadratic trial action with variational functions to describe
retardation and binding effects through multiple meson exchange.The variational
equations for these functions are derived, discussed qualitatively and solved
numerically. We compare our results with the ones from traditional approaches
based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation and find an enhanced binding contrary to
some claims in the literature. For weak coupling this is worked out
analytically and compared with results from effective field theories. However,
the well-known instability of the model, which usually is ignored, now appears
at smaller coupling constants than in the one-body case and even when
self-energy and vertex corrections are turned off. This induced instability is

about to eleven degrees of deviation in the observed solar angle seems less
simple. We suggest that such a deviation could be due to a light sterile

the effect has to be smaller than atmospheric scale, and it would introduce a
new mass squared difference which should be smaller than the solar scale. We
present a toy model that exemplifies these features.

themselves through continuous transformations associated with specific discrete

studied. The position and the momentum operators (PM-operators) of the system
do not satisfy the canonical commutation relations (CCRs). Instead they obey
the weaker postulates for the oscillator to be a Wigner quantum system. In
particular the PM-operators fulfil the main postulate, which is due to Wigner:
they satisfy the equations of motion (the Hamiltonian's equations) and the
Heisenberg equations. One of the relevant features is that the coordinate (the
momentum) operators do not commute, but instead their squares do commute. As a
result the space structure of the basis states corresponds to pictures when
each oscillating particle is measured to occupy with equal probability only
finite number of points, typically the eight vertices of a parallelepiped. The
state spaces are finite-dimensional, the spectrum of the energy is finite with
equally spaced energy levels. An essentially new feature is that the angular
momenta of all particles are aligned. Therefore there exists a strong
interaction or correlation between the particles, which is not of dynamical,
but of statistical origin. Another relevant feature is that the standard
deviations of, say, the $k$-th coordinate and the momenta of $\alpha$-th is $
\Delta \hat R_{\alpha k} \Delta \hat P_{\alpha k} \le {p \hbar/{|N-3|}}~(~N\ne
3,~ p -$fixed positive integer), namely instead of uncertainty relations one
has ""certainty"" relations. The underlying Lie superalgebraic structure of the
oscillator is also relevant and will be explained in the context.

  Graph",,,,,"math.CO",,"  We show a simple explicit construction of an $2^{\Tilde{O}(\sqrt{\log n})}$
Ramsey graph. That is, we provide a $\poly(n)$-time algorithm to output the
adjacency matrix of an undirected $n$-vertex graph with no clique or
independent set of size $2^{\e \sqrt{\log n}\log\log n}$ for every $\e>0$.
  Our construction has the very serious disadvantage over the well-known
construction of Frankl and Wilson \cite{FranklWi81} that it is only explicit
and not very explicit, in the sense that we do \emph{not} provide a
poly-logarithmic time algorithm to compute the neighborhood relation. The main
advantage of this construction is its extreme simplicity. It is also somewhat
surprising that even though we use a completely different approach we get a
bound which essentially equals the bound of \cite{FranklWi81}. This
construction is quite simple and was obtained independently by others as
well\footnote{P.~Pudlak, personal communications, July 2004.} but as far as we
know has not been published elsewhere.

  proof; v. 2 corrects metadata only","Acta Arithmetica 120, No. 2, (2005) 159--184",,,"math.NT math.FA",,"  This paper studies the local spacings of deformations of the Riemann zeta
function under certain averaging and differencing operations. For real h it
considers A_h(s)= 1/2(xi(s+h)+ xi(s-h)) and B_h(s)=1/(2i)(xi(s+h)-xi(s-h)),
where xi(s) is the Riemann xi-function. For |h|\ge 1/2 all zeros of these
functions lie on the critical line and are simple zeros. Assuming the Riemann
hypothesis, the same holds for all nonzero h. The number of zeros to height T
has the same asymptotics as for the zeta function in its main terms, so one can
define normalized zero spacings as for the xi-function. It is shown that the
first k normalized zero spacings have a limiting distribution as T goes to
infinity, and it is the ""trivial"" distribution with all spacings equal to 1.
This is shown unconditionally for |h|> 1/2 and conditionally on RH for 0< |h|<
1/2. Similar results are indicated for Dirichlet L-functions. The results are
interpreted in terms of de Branges's theory of Hilbert spaces of entire
functions.

In particular, we show that it is always the case when G contains A_4, S_4 or

geometrisation conjecture together imply that any arithmetic Kleinian group G

of producing strong absolute stability criteria for steady flows. In those
fluids the kinetic energy naturally defines a norm in which perturbations decay
monotonically in time at sufficiently low (but non-zero) Reynolds numbers.
There are, however, at least two obstructions to the generalization of such
methods to Oldroyd-B fluids. One previously recognized problem is the fact that
the natural energy does not correspond to a proper functional norm on
perturbations. Another problem, original to this work, is the fact that
fluctuations in Oldroyd-B fluids may be subject to non-normal amplification at
arbitrarily low Reynolds numbers (albeit at sufficiently large Weissenberg
numbers). Such transient growth, occuring even when the base flow is linearly
stable, precludes the uniform monotonic decay of any reasonable measure of the
disturbance's amplitude.

the collective dynamics of biochemical networks that determine how cells
respond to environmental signals. For example, protein phosphorylation and
nitrosylation are well-known to play a pivotal role in the intracellular
transduction of activation and death signals. A protein can have multiple sites
where chemical groups can reversibly attach in processes such as
phosphorylation or nitrosylation. A microscopic description of these processes
must take into account the intrinsic probabilistic nature of the underlying
reactions. We apply combinatorial considerations to standard enzyme kinetics
and in this way we extend to the dynamic regime a simplified version of the
traditional models on the allosteric regulation of protein functions. We link a
generic modification chain to a downstream Michaelis-Menten enzymatic reaction
and we demonstrate numerically that this accounts both for thresholds and long
time delays in the conversion of the substrate by the enzyme. The proposed
mechanism is stable and robust and the higher the number of modification sites,
the greater the stability. We show that a high number of modification sites
converts a fast reaction into a slow process, and the slowing down depends on
the number of sites and may span many orders of magnitude; in this way
multisite modification of proteins stands out as a general mechanism that
allows the transfer of information from the very short time scales of enzyme
reactions (milliseconds) to the long time scale of cell response (hours).

mechanics, the former theory is marked by its relative economy and apparent
explanatory simplicity. A number of theorists have thus been led to search for
a small number of postulates - essentially information theoretic in nature -
that would play the role in quantum mechanics that the relativity principle and
the light postulate jointly play in Einstein's 1905 special relativity theory.
The purpose of the present paper is to resist this idea, at least in so far as
it is supposed to reveal the fundamental form of the theory. It is argued that
the methodology of Einstein's 1905 theory represents a victory of pragmatism
over explanatory depth; and that its adoption only made sense in the context of
the chaotic state state of physics at the start of the 20th century - as
Einstein well knew.
