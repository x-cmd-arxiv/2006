afterglow of the short gamma-ray burst 051221a obtained with Gemini, Swift/XRT,
and the Very Large Array, as well as optical spectra from which we measure the
redshift of the burst, z=0.5464. At this redshift the isotropic-equivalent
prompt energy release was about 1.5 x 10^51 erg, and using the standard
afterglow synchrotron model we find that the blastwave kinetic energy is
similar, E_K,iso ~ 8.4 x 10^51 erg. An observed jet break at t ~ 5 days
indicates that the opening angle is ~ 7 degrees and the total beaming-corrected
energy is therefore ~ 2.5 x 10^49 erg, comparable to the values inferred for
previous short GRBs. We further show that the burst experienced an episode of
energy injection by a factor of 3.4 between t=1.4 and 3.4 hours, which was
accompanied by reverse shock emission in the radio band. This result provides
continued evidence that the central engines of short GRBs may be active
significantly longer than the duration of the burst and/or produce a wide range
of Lorentz factors. Finally, we show that the host galaxy of GRB051221a is
actively forming stars at a rate of about 1.6 M_solar/yr, but at the same time
exhibits evidence for an appreciable population of old stars (~ 1 Gyr) and near
solar metallicity. The lack of bright supernova emission and the low
circumburst density (n ~ 10^-3 cm^-3) continue to support the idea that short
bursts are not related to the death of massive stars and are instead consistent
with a compact object merger. Given that the total energy release is a factor
of ~ 10 larger than the predicted yield for a neutrino annihilation mechanism,
this suggests that magnetohydrodynamic processes may be required to power the
burst.

image topographies and equations of the caustics and critical curves are also
studied. We derive the fully analytic expressions for precaustics, which are
the loci of non-critical points that map to the caustics under the lens
mapping. They constitute boundaries of the region in the image domain that maps
onto the interior of the caustics. The areas under the critical curves,
caustics and precaustics are all evaluated, which enables us to calculate the
mean magnification of the source within the caustics. Additionally, the exact
analytic expression for the magnification distribution for the source in the
triangular caustics is derived, as well as a useful approximate expression.
Finally, we find that the Chang-Refsdal lens with the convergence greater than
unity can exhibit third-order critical behaviour, if the reduced shear is
exactly equal to \sqrt{3}/2, and that the number of images for N-point masses
with non-zero constant shear cannot be greater than 5N-1.

MOND posits a breakdown of Newton's law of gravity (or inertia) below a0, after
which the dependence with distance became linear. Despite many attempts, MOND

solid state physics, can be seen as a discrete (i.e. particle) generalization
of the perturbative solution in the Lagrangian formalism of a self-gravitating
fluid. Working to linear order, we show explicitly that this fluid evolution is
recovered in the limit that the initial perturbations are restricted to modes
of wavelength much larger than the lattice spacing. The full spectrum of
eigenvalues of the simple cubic lattice contains both oscillatory modes and
unstable modes which grow slightly faster than in the fluid limit. A detailed
comparison of our perturbative treatment, at linear order, with full numerical
simulations is presented, for two very different classes of initial

perturbations from the tachyon field can become larger than the
inflaton-generated first-order perturbations, leading to stronger constraints
than those coming from nongaussianity. The width of the excluded region in
terms of the logarithm of the dimensionless coupling g, grows linearly with the
log of the ratio of the Planck mass to the tachyon VEV, \log(M_p/v); hence very
large regions are ruled out if the inflationary scale v is small. We apply
these results to string-theoretic brane-antibrane inflation, and find a
stringent upper bound on the string coupling, g_s < 10^{-4.5}.

around M dwarf stars. While the frequency of gas giant planets around M dwarfs
so far appears to be lower than that around G dwarfs, it is clearly not zero.
Previous work has shown that the core accretion mechanism does not seem to be
able to form gas giant planets around M dwarfs, because the time required for
core formation scales with the orbital period, which lengthens for lower mass
stars, resulting in failed (gas-poor) cores unless the gaseous protoplanetary
disk survives for > 10 Myr. Disk instability, on the other hand, is rapid
enough (~ 1000 yrs) that it should be able to form gas giant protoplanets
around even low mass stars well before the gaseous disk disappears. A new suite
of three dimensional radiative, gravitational hydrodynamical models is
presented that calculates the evolution of initially marginally gravitationally
unstable disks with masses of 0.021 to 0.065 solar masses orbiting around stars
with masses of 0.1 and 0.5 solar masses, respectively. The models show that gas
giant planets are indeed likely to form by the disk instability mechanism in
orbit around M dwarf stars, the opposite of the prediction for formation by the
core accretion mechanism. This difference offers another observational test for
discriminating between these two theoretical end members for giant planet
formation. Ongoing and future extrasolar planet searches around M dwarfs by
spectroscopy, microlensing, photometry, and astrometry offer the opportunity to
help decide between the dominance of the two mechanisms.

friction. We address the problem of these timescales having been variously
estimated in the literature as much shorter than a Hubble time. Using
self-consistent two-component (dark matter and stars) models, we explore
mechanisms which may yield extended dynamical friction timescales in such
systems in order to explain why dwarf galaxies often show globular cluster
systems. As a general rule, dark matter and stars both give a comparable
contribution to the dynamical drag. By exploring various possibilities for
their gravitational make-up, it is shown that these studies help constrain the
parameters of the dark matter haloes in these galaxies, as well as to test
alternatives to dark matter. Under the assumption of a dark haloes having a
constant density core, dynamical friction timescales are naturally extended
upwards of a Hubble time. Cuspy dark haloes yield timescales $\lesssim$ 4.5
Gyr, for any dark halo parameters in accordance with observations of stellar
line-of-sight velocity dispersion in dwarf spheroidal galaxies. We find that
under the hypothesis of MOND dynamics, due to the enhanced dynamical drag of
the stars, the dynamical friction timescales would be extremely short. Taking
the well-measured structural parameters of the Fornax dSph and its globular
cluster system as a case study, we conclude that requiring dynamical friction
timescales comparable to the Hubble time strongly favours dark haloes with a

tubes. We also compare the shear stress and deformation of lamellar mesophases
with and without amphiphile when subjected to the same shear flow applied
normal to the lamellae. We find that the presence of amphiphile allows (a) the
shear stress at late times to be higher than in the case without amphiphile,
and (b) the formation of rich patterns on the sheared interface, characterised
by alternating regions of high and low curvature.

spherically-symmetric sector of metric perturbations around an evaporating
black hole background geometry. For macroscopic black holes we find that those
fluctuations grow and eventually become important when considering sufficiently
long periods of time (of the order of the evaporation time), but well before
the Planckian regime is reached. In addition, the assumption of a simple
correlation between the fluctuations of the energy flux crossing the horizon
and far from it, which was made in earlier work on spherically-symmetric
induced fluctuations, is carefully analyzed and found to be invalid. Our
analysis suggests the existence of an infinite amplitude for the fluctuations
of the horizon as a three-dimensional hypersurface. We emphasize the need for
understanding and designing operational ways of probing quantum metric
fluctuations near the horizon and extracting physically meaningful information.

physical effects. The CS-term locks the KK-mode parity to the parity of
space-time, leaving a single parity symmetry. It leads to new processes amongst
KK-modes, eg, the decay of a KK-mode to a 2-body final state of KK-modes. A
formalism for the effective interaction amongst KK-modes is constructed, and
the decay of a KK-mode to KK-mode plus zero mode is analyzed as an example. We
elaborate the general KK-mode current and anomaly structure of these theories.

``consistent anomalies'' for Weyl spinors on the boundary branes. We also
develop the non-abelian formalism. We illustrate this by showing in a simple

proposed viscosity bound appears to be saturated in all computations done

of a stack of M2-branes in the grand canonical ensemble at finite R-charge
densities, corresponding to non-zero angular momentum in the bulk. The
corresponding four-dimensional R-charged black hole in Anti-de Sitter space
provides a holographic dual in which various transport coefficients can be
calculated. We find that the shear viscosity increases as soon as a background
R-charge density is turned on. We numerically compute the few first corrections
to the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio $\eta/s$ and surprisingly
discover that up to fourth order all corrections originating from a non-zero
chemical potential vanish, leaving the bound saturated. This is a sharp signal
in favor of the saturation of the viscosity bound for event horizons even in
the presence of some finite background field strength. We discuss implications

basis for $W_0$ if and only if $ g(W_0) \subseteq W_0 $ for every $g$ in

a cancellation theorem of Dixmier to adapt this to the non-abelian case.
Corresponding results for the frame case and the biorthogonal case are also
obtained.

complex objects and along irregular boundaries is presented. This is motivated
by the application of metal foams in compact heat-transfer devices, or as
catalyst substrates in process-engineering. The flow-consequences of such
complicated objects are incorporated by adding explicit multiscale forcing to
the Navier-Stokes equations. The forcing represents the simultaneous agitation
of a wide spectrum of length-scales when flow passes through the complex
object. It is found that a considerable modulation of the traditional energy
cascading can be introduced with a specific forcing strategy. In spectral
space, forcing yields strongly localized deviations from the common Kolmogorov
scaling law, directly associated with the explicitly forced scales. In
addition, the accumulated effect of forcing induces a significant non-local
alteration of the kinetic energy including the spectrum for the large scales.
Consequently, a manipulation of turbulent flow can be achieved over an extended
range, well beyond the directly forced scales. The turbulent mixing of a
passive scalar field is also investigated, in order to quantify the
physical-space modifications of transport processes in multiscale forced
turbulence. The surface-area and wrinkling of level-sets of the scalar field
are monitored as measures of the influence of explicit forcing on the local and
global mixing efficiency.

assumed valid for non-Markovian master equations consisting in Lindblad
superoperators with memory kernels. Our considerations are based on a
generalized Born-Markov approximation, which allows us to obtain our results
from an underlying Hamiltonian description. We demonstrate that a non-Markovian
quantum regression theorem can only be granted in a stationary regime if the
dynamics satisfies a quantum detailed balance condition. As an example we study
the correlations of a two level system embedded in a complex structured
reservoir and driven by an external coherent field.

dopands in crystals are many order of magnitudes wider than the homogeneous
linewidths. Several ways have been proposed to use ions with different
inhomogeneous shifts as qubit registers, and to perform gate operations between
such registers by means of the static dipole coupling between the ions.
  In this paper we show that in order to implement high-fidelity quantum gate
operations by means of the static dipole interaction, we require the
participating ions to be strongly coupled, and that the density of such
strongly coupled registers in general scales poorly with register size.
Although this is critical to previous proposals which rely on a high density of
functional registers, we describe architectures and preparation strategies that
will allow scalable quantum computers based on rare-earth-ion doped crystals.
