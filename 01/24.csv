extragalactic object CSL-1, suspected to be the result of gravitational lensing
by a cosmic string. The high resolution image shows that the object is actually
a pair of interacting giant elliptical galaxies. In spite of the weird
similarities of the energy and light distributions and of the radial velocities
of the two components, CSL-1 is not the lensing of an elliptical galaxy by a

turbulence are discussed. These include mainly the inverse cascade that
produces fields on progressively larger scales. Magnetic helicity also
restricts the evolution of the large scale field: the field decays less rapidly
than a non-helical field, but it also saturates more slowly, i.e. on a
resistive time scale if there are no magnetic helicity fluxes. The former
effect is utilized in primordial field scenarios, while the latter is important
for successfully explaining astrophysical dynamos that saturate faster than
resistively. Dynamo action is argued to be important not only in the galactic
dynamo, but also in accretion discs in active galactic nuclei and around
protostars, both of which contribute to producing a strong enough seed magnetic
field. Although primordial magnetic fields may be too weak to compete with
these astrophysical mechanisms, such fields could perhaps still be important in
producing polarization effects in the cosmic background radiation.

so-obtained integral provides an exact expression that solves the longitudinal

motion double-lined binary system HD 9939, with an orbital period of
approximately 25 days. By combining our radial-velocity and visibility
measurements we estimate the system physical orbit and derive dynamical masses
for the components of $M_A = 1.072 \pm 0.014$ M$_{\sun}$ and $M_B = 0.8383 \pm
0.0081$ M$_{\sun}$; fractional errors of 1.3% and 1.0%, respectively. We also
determine a system distance of $42.23 \pm 0.21$ pc, corresponding to an orbital
parallax of $\pi_{\rm orb} = 23.68 \pm 0.12$ mas. The system distance and the
estimated brightness difference between the stars in $V$, $H$, and $K$ yield
component absolute magnitudes in these bands. By spectroscopic analysis and
spectral energy distribution modeling we also estimate the component effective
temperatures and luminosities as $T_{\rm eff}^A = 5050 \pm 100$ K and $T_{\rm
eff}^B = 4950 \pm 200$ K and $L_A$ = 2.451 $\pm$ 0.041 $L_{\sun}$ and $L_B$ =
0.424 $\pm$ 0.023 $L_{\sun}$.
  Both our spectral analysis and comparison with stellar models suggest that HD
9939 has elemental abundances near solar values. Further, comparison with
stellar models suggests the HD 9939 primary has evolved off the main sequence
and appears to be traversing the Hertzsprung gap as it approaches the red giant
phase of its evolution. Our measurements of the primary properties provide new
empirical constraints on stellar models during this particularly dynamic
evolutionary phase. That HD 9939 is currently in a relatively short-lived
evolutionary state allows us to estimate the system age as 9.12 $\pm$ 0.25 Gyr.
In turn the age and abundance of the system place a potentially interesting, if
anecdotal, constraint on star formation in the galactic disk.

captured, emitting gravitational waves as the orbit decays, 2) tidally
disrupted, leaving a disc of baryonic material, 3) scattered to a large radius,
where they may thereafter avoid encounters with the black hole or 4) swallowed
whole, contributing to black hole growth. These processes occur on a dynamical
time, which implies that for a static spherically symmetric stellar system, the
loss cone is quickly emptied. However, most elliptical galaxies and spiral
bulges are thought to be triaxial in shape. The centrophilic orbits comprising
the backbone of a triaxial galaxy have been suggested as one way to keep the
loss cone around a supermassive black hole filled with stars, stellar remnants,
and intermediate mass black holes. We investigate the evolution of the loss
cone population in a triaxial galaxy model with high resolution N-body

question will help shed light on the triggering process of quasar activity. We
use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to study the environment of quasars and
compare it directly with the environment of galaxies. We find that quasars (M_i
< -22, z < 0.4) are located in higher local overdensity regions than are
typical L* galaxies. The enhanced environment around quasars is a local
phenomenon; the overdensity relative to that around L* galaxies is strongest
within 100 kpc of the quasars. In this region, the overdensity is a factor of
1.4 larger than around L* galaxies. The overdensity declines monotonically with
scale to nearly unity at ~1 Mpc, where quasars inhabit environments comparable
to those of L* galaxies. The small-scale density enhancement depends on quasar
luminosity, but only at the brightest end: the most luminous quasars reside in
higher local overdensity regions than do fainter quasars. The mean overdensity
around the brightest quasars (M_i < -23.3) is nearly three times larger than
around L* galaxies while the density around dimmer quasars (M_i = -22.0 to
-23.3) is ~1.4 times that of L* galaxies. By ~0.5 Mpc, the dependence on quasar
luminosity is no longer significant. The overdensity on all scales is
independent of redshift to z = 0.4. The results suggest a picture in which
quasars typically reside in L* galaxies, but have a local excess of neighbors
within ~0.1 - 0.5 Mpc; this local density excess likely contributes to the
triggering of quasar activity through mergers and other interactions.

We can easily track the host galaxy of the quasar close to image D because
microlensing has provided a natural coronograph that suppresses the flux of the

uncorrelated variability between the four quasar images due to microlensing,
but no correlated variations that could be used to measure a time delay. Monte
Carlo models of the microlensing variability provide estimates of the mean
stellar mass in the lens galaxy (0.02 Msun < M < 1.0 Msun), the accretion disk
size (the disk temperature is 5 x 10^4 K at 3.0 x 10^14 cm < rs < 1.4 x 10^15

suffers from reduced temperature sensitivity in the high-temperature limit. In
theory, the ratio of far-IR, submillimeter, or millimeter continuum to that of
a 13CO (or C18O) rotational line can place reliable upper limits on the
temperature of the dust and molecular gas. Consequently, far-infrared continuum
data from the {\it COBE}/{\it DIRBE} instrument and Nagoya 4-m $\cOone$
spectral line data were used to plot 240$\um$/13CO J=1-0 intensity ratios
against 140$\um$/240$\um$ dust color temperatures, allowing us to constrain the
multiparsec-scale physical conditions in the Orion$ $A and B molecular clouds.
  The best-fitting models to the Orion clouds consist of two components: a
component near the surface of the clouds that is heated primarily by a very
large-scale (i.e. $\sim 1 $kpc) interstellar radiation field and a component
deeper within the clouds. The former has a fixed temperature and the latter has
a range of temperatures that varies from one sightline to another. The models
require a dust-gas temperature difference of 0$\pm 2 $K and suggest that 40-50%
of the Orion clouds are in the form of dust and gas with temperatures between 3
and 10$ $K. These results have a number implications that are discussed in
detail in later papers. These include stronger dust-gas thermal coupling and
higher Galactic-scale molecular gas temperatures than are usually accepted, an
improved explanation for the N(H$_2$)/I(CO) conversion factor, and ruling out

sufficient to overcome radiation pressure of the central massive protostars. We

known of this class of objects is GRS 1915+105, the brightest accreting source

be linked to black hole spin. If so, the high spin should also be evident in
accretion disc spectra. We search the RXTE archive to find disc-dominated X-ray
spectra from this object, as these are the only ones which can give reliable
spin determinations by this method. Finding these is complicated by the rapid,
unique limit cycle variability, but we are able to identify such spectra by
going to the shortest possible time resolution (16 s). We fit them with a
simple multicolour disc blackbody diskbb, and with the best current model which
include full radiative transfer as well as relativistic effects bhspec. Both
these models show that the spin is intermediate, neither zero nor maximal.
bhspec, the most physical model, gives a value for the dimensionless spin of a*
\~ 0.7 for a distance of 12.5 kpc and inclination of 66 deg. This, together
with the range of spins 0.1 < a* < 0.8 derived using this method for other

gravity rather than spin, and implies that high-to-maximal spin is not a
pre-requisite for powerful relativistic jets.

automatically incorporated. In the clean limit we establish the connection
between the spin-Hall conductivity and the Berry phase in momentum space. For

addition to the usual two-electron ones in a strongly-interacting many-electron

this, Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) theory has been generalized to include
not boson-boson interactions (also neglected in BCS theory) but rather
boson-fermion (BF)interaction vertices reminiscent of the Frohlich
electron-phonon interaction in metals. Unlike BCS theory, the GBEC model is not
a mean-field theory restricted to weak-coupling as it can be diagonalized
exactly. In weak coupling it reproduces the BCS condensation energy. Each kind
of CP is responsible for only half the condensation energy. The GBEC theory
reduces to all the old known statistical theories as special cases including
the so-called ""BCS-Bose crossover"" picture which in turn generalizes BCS theory
by not assuming that the electron chemical potential equals the Fermi energy.
Indeed, a BCS condensate is precisely the weak-coupling limit of a GBE
condensate with equal numbers of both types of CPs. With feasible Cooper/BCS
model interelectonic interaction parameter values, and even without BF
interactions, the GBEC theory yields transition temperatures [including
room-temperature superconductivity (RTSC)] substantially higher than the BCS
ceiling of around 45K, without relying on non-phonon dynamics involving
excitons, plasmons, magnons or otherwise purely-electronic mechanisms.

proportional to the square of the conductance of the QDD for the Breit-Wigner
model, showing that the dephasing is completely different from the shot noise
of the detector. The measurement rate, on the other hand, shows a dip near the
resonance. Our findings are peculiar especially for a symmetric detector in the
following aspect: The dephasing rate is maximum at resonance of the QDD where
the detector conductance is insensitive to the charge state of the mesoscopic
system. As a result, the efficiency of the detector shows a dip and vanishes at
resonance, in contrast to the single-channel symmetric non-resonant detector
that has always a maximum efficiency. We find that this difference originates
from a very general property of the scattering matrix: The abrupt phase change
exists in the scattering amplitudes in the presence of the symmetry, which is
insensitive to the detector current but {\em stores} the information of the
quantum state of the mesoscopic system.

  Diego, La Jolla, CA, February 6 - 10, 2006",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  The energy-delay tradeoffs in wireless networks are studied using a
game-theoretic framework. A multi-class multiple-access network is considered
in which users choose their transmit powers, and possibly transmission rates,
in a distributed manner to maximize their own utilities while satisfying their
delay quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. The utility function considered
here measures the number of reliable bits transmitted per Joule of energy
consumed and is particularly useful for energy-constrained networks. The Nash
equilibrium solution for the proposed non-cooperative game is presented and
closed-form expressions for the users' utilities at equilibrium are obtained.
Based on this, the losses in energy efficiency and network capacity due to
presence of delay-sensitive users are quantified. The analysis is extended to
the scenario where the QoS requirements include both the average source rate
and a bound on the average total delay (including queuing delay). It is shown
that the incoming traffic rate and the delay constraint of a user translate
into a ""size"" for the user, which is an indication of the amount of resources
consumed by the user. Using this framework, the tradeoffs among throughput,
delay, network capacity and energy efficiency are also quantified.

while the defender counters using various resilience mechanisms. Examples
include a music industry body attempting to close down a peer-to-peer
file-sharing network; medics attempting to halt the spread of an infectious
disease by selective vaccination; and a police agency trying to decapitate a
terrorist organisation. Albert, Jeong and Barabasi famously analysed the static

networks. We extend this work to the dynamic case by developing a framework
based on evolutionary game theory to explore the interaction of attack and
defence strategies. We show, first, that naive defences don't work against
vertex-order attack; second, that defences based on simple redundancy don't
work much better, but that defences based on cliques work well; third, that
attacks based on centrality work better against clique defences than
vertex-order attacks do; and fourth, that defences based on complex strategies
such as delegation plus clique resist centrality attacks better than simple
clique defences. Our models thus build a bridge between network analysis and
evolutionary game theory, and provide a framework for analysing defence and
attack in networks where topology matters. They suggest definitions of
efficiency of attack and defence, and may even explain the evolution of
insurgent organisations from networks of cells to a more virtual leadership
that facilitates operations rather than directing them. Finally, we draw some

masses can be below the two-meson threshold for sufficiently high quark masses.
A simple model calculation shows the b q bbar ubar and b q cbar qbar
tetraquarks below the B Bbar and B Dbar thresholds. Some of these states have
exotic electric charge and their decays might have striking signatures
involving monoenergetic photons and/or pions.

  Chiral Perturbation Theory","16 pages, 1 EPS figure",,,,"hep-ph",,"  Chiral symmetry breaking (ChSB) is reviewed to some extent within the
quark-level-linear-sigma-model (QLL$\sigma$M) theory and standard chiral
perturbation theory (ChPT). It is shown, on the basis of several examples
related to the pion, as a well-known Goldstone boson of chiral symmetry
breaking, that even the non-unitarized QLL$\sigma$M approach accounts, to a
good approximation, for a rather simple, self-consistent, linear, and very
predictive description of Nature. On the other hand, ChPT -- even when
unitarized -- provides a highly distorted, nonlinear, hardly predictive picture
of Nature, which fits experiment only at the price of a lot of parameters, and
requires a great deal of unnecessary theoretical effort. As the origin of this
distortion, we identify the fact that ChPT, reflecting only direct ChSB by
nonvanishing, current-quark-mass values, does not -- contrary to Quantum
Chromodynamics (QCD) and the QLL$\sigma$M -- contain any mechanism for the
spontaneous generation of the dynamical component of the constituent quark
mass. This leads to a very peculiar picture of Nature, since the strange
current quark mass has to compensate for the absence of nonstrange dynamical
quark masses. We thus conclude that standard ChPT -- contrary to common wisdom
-- is unlikely to be the low-energy limit of QCD. On the contrary, a chiral
perturbation theory derived from the QLL$\sigma$M, presumably being the true
low-energy limit of QCD, is expected instead to provide a distortion-free
description of Nature, which is based on the heavy standard-model Higgs boson
as well as light scalar mesons, as the source of spontaneous generation of
current and dynamical quark masses, respectively.

a quantum field theory with two vector fields (gauge fields). In order to
properly define the quantum field degrees of freedom we re-derive the classical
wave equations on light-front gauge. This is needed because the usual scalar
potential of electromagnetism is, in quantum field theory, not a physical
degree of freedom that renders negative energy eigenstates. We also consider a
background local fluid metric that allows for a covariant treatment of the
problem. The different masses for the longitudinal (plasmon) and transverse
photons are in our framework due to the local fluid metric. We apply the
mechanism of mass generation by gauge symmetry breaking recently proposed by
the authors by giving a non-trivial vacuum-expectation-value to the second
vector field (gauge field). The Debye length $\lambda_D$ is interpreted as an
effective compactification length and we compute an explicit solution for the
large gauge transformations that correspond to the specific mass eigenvalues
derived here. Using an usual quantum field theory canonical quantization we
obtain the usual results in the literature. Although none of these ingredients
are new to physicist, as far as the authors are aware it is the first time that
such constructions are applied to Plasma Physics. Also we give a physical
interpretation (and realization) for the second vector field in terms of the
plasma background in terms of known physical phenomena.

space, without exponentiating the propagators, making use of the Cluster
Convergence Theorem presented previously. The first theorem proves the absolute
convergence of arbitrary BPHZ-renormalized Feynman diagrams, when counterterms
are allowed for one-line-reducible subdiagrams, as well as for
one-line-irreducible subdiagrams. The second theorem proves the conditional
convergence of arbitrary BPHZ-renormalized Feynman diagrams, when counterterms
are allowed only for one-line-irreducible subdiagrams. Although the convergence
in this case is only conditional, there is only one natural way to approach the
limit, namely from propagators smoothly regularized at short distances, so that
the integrations by parts needed to reach an absolutely convergent integrand
can be carried out, without picking up short-distance surface terms. Neither
theorem requires translation invariance, but the second theorem assumes a much
weaker property, called ""translation smoothness"". Both theorems allow the
propagators in the counterterms to differ, at long distances, from the
propagators in the direct terms. For massless theories, this makes it possible
to eliminate all the long-distance divergences from the counterterms, without
altering the propagators in the direct terms. Massless theories can thus be
studied directly, without introducing a regulator mass and taking the limit as
it tends to zero, and without infra-red subtractions.

$C^{2+\eta}$ (any $\eta>0$) unimodal maps with non--flat critical points. We do
not require any `Schwarzian--like' condition.
  For two intervals $J \subset T$, the cross--ratio is defined as the value
$$B(T,J):=\frac{|T||J|}{|L||R|}$$ where $L,R$ are the left and right connected
components of $T\setminus J$ respectively. For an interval map $g$ \st $g_T:T
\to \RRR$ is a diffeomorphism, we consider the cross--ratio distortion to be
$$B(g,T, J):=\frac{B(g(T),g(J))}{B(T,J)}.$$

critical point \st for any intervals $J \subset T$, if $f^n|_T$ is a
diffeomorphism and $f^n(T) \subset I_0$ then $$B(f^n, T, J)> K.$$ Then the
distortion of derivatives of $f^n|_J$ can be estimated with the Koebe Lemma in

topological, geometric and ergodic properties of $f$. This extends a result of
Kozlovski.

  As an immediate consequence we show that if B in Z/pZ is a set of cardinality
(p-1)/2 then the algebra norm ||1_B||_A is >> (log p)^{1/3 - eps}. This gives a
result on a ``mod p'' analogue of Littlewood's well-known problem concerning
the smallest possible L^1-norm of the Fourier transform of a set of n integers.
  Another application is to answer a question of Gowers. If B in Z/pZ is a set

depend on $\frac 12(N-1)$ parameters. For order $r$, $N$ eigenvalues consitute
the trace and the remaining $(N^r-N)$ eigenvalues involving the full range of
parameters come in zero-sum multiplets formed by the $r$-th roots of unity, or
lower dimensional multiplets corresponding to factors of the order $r$ when $r$
is not a prime number. The modulus of any eigenvalue is of the form
$e^{\mu\theta}$, where $\mu$ is a linear combination of the free parameters,
$\theta$ being the spectral parameter. For $r$ a prime number an amusing
relation of the number of multiplets with a theorem of Fermat is pointed out.
Chain Hamiltonians and potentials corresponding to factorizable $S$-matrices
are constructed starting from our braid matrices. Perspectives are discussed.

Mexican wave during which the spectators in a stadium leap to their feet with
their arms up and then sit down again following those to their left (right)
with a small delay. Here we use a simple, but realistic model to explain how
the combination of the local and global interactions of the spectators produces
a breaking of the symmetry resulting in the replacement of the symmetric
solution -- containing two propagating waves -- by a single wave moving in one
of the two possible directions. Our model is based on and compared to the
extensive observations of volunteers filling out the related questionnaire we
have posted on the Internet. We find that, as a function of the parameter
controlling the strength of the global interactions, the transition to the
single wave solution has features reminiscent of discontinuous transitions.
After the spontaneous symmetry breaking the two directions of propagation are
still statistically equivalent. We investigate also how this remaining symmetry
is broken in real stadia by a small asymmetrical term in the perception of
spectators.

single-molecule experiments have used shorter molecules, with contour lengths

biology. Current modeling approaches such as the constraint-based flux balance
analyses (FBA) have proved highly successful in analyzing the capabilities of
cellular metabolism, including its capacity to predict deletion phenotypes, the
ability to calculate the relative flux values of metabolic reactions and the
properties of alternate optimal growth states. Here, we use FBA to thoroughly
assess the activity of the Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori, and
Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism in 30,000 diverse simulated environments.
We identify a set of metabolic reactions forming a connected metabolic core
that carry non-zero fluxes under all growth conditions, and whose flux
variations are highly correlated. Furthermore, we find that the enzymes
catalyzing the core reactions display a considerably higher fraction of
phenotypic essentiality and evolutionary conservation than those catalyzing
non-core reactions. Cellular metabolism is characterized by a large number of
species-specific conditionally-active reactions organized around an
evolutionary conserved always active metabolic core. Finally, we find that most
current antibiotics interfering with the bacterial metabolism target the core
enzymes, indicating that our findings may have important implications for

probability theory was incorporated into the beginnings of noncommutative
measure theory by von Neumann in the early thirties, as well. To precisely this
end, von Neumann initiated the study of what are now called von Neumann
algebras and, with Murray, made a first classification of such algebras into
three types. The nonrelativistic quantum theory of systems with finitely many
degrees of freedom deals exclusively with type I algebras. However, for the
description of further quantum systems, the other types of von Neumann algebras
are indispensable. The paper reviews quantum probability theory in terms of
general von Neumann algebras, stressing the similarity of the conceptual
structure of classical and noncommutative probability theories and emphasizing
the correspondence between the classical and quantum concepts, though also
indicating the nonclassical nature of quantum probabilistic predictions. In
addition, differences between the probability theories in the type I, II and
III settings are explained. A brief description is given of quantum systems for
which probability theory based on type I algebras is known to be insufficient.
These illustrate the physical significance of the previously mentioned
differences.

space, and (2) to show that the rigged Hilbert space incorporates particle
localization in a natural manner.

  (2005) added. B)Sentence rewritten: We routinely capture more than 10^6 atoms
  in a micro-MOT on a magnetized pattern. C) The magnetic field strengths are
  now given in Teslas. D) The second sentence in the fourth paragraph has been
  rewritten in order to more clearly describe the geometry and purpose of the
  compensation coils.E) In the seventh paragraph we have rewritten the sentence
  about the creation of the external magnetic field for the magnetic-domain
  patterning. F) In the ninth paragraph, we clarify the way to shift the trap
  center. G) Caption of Fig. 4 changed. H) We have modified paragraph 12 to
  improve the description on the guiding of the trap center along a toroidal
  pattern. I) The last two sentences of the manuscript have been rewritten",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.73.051401",,"quant-ph",,"  We describe experiments on trapping of atoms in microscopic magneto-optical
traps on an optically transparent permanent-magnet atom chip. The chip is made
of magnetically hard ferrite-garnet material deposited on a dielectric
substrate. The confining magnetic fields are produced by miniature magnetized
patterns recorded in the film by magneto-optical techniques. We trap Rb atoms
on these structures by applying three crossed pairs of counter-propagating
laser beams in the conventional magneto-optical trapping (MOT) geometry. We
demonstrate the flexibility of the concept in creation and in-situ modification
of the trapping geometries through several experiments.
