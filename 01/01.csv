we construct 3D models of vertically stratified gas stirred by discrete
supernova explosions, including vertical gravitational field and parametrized
heating and cooling. The models reproduce many observed characteristics of the
Galaxy such as global circulation of gas (i.e., galactic fountain) and the
existence of cold dense clouds in the galactic disk. Global quantities of the
model such as warm and hot gas filling factors in the midplane, mass fraction
of thermally unstable gas, and the averaged vertical density profile are
compared directly with existing observations, and shown to be broadly
consistent. We find that energy injection occurs over a broad range of scales.
There is no single effective driving scale, unlike the usual assumption for
idealized models of incompressible turbulence. However, >90% of the total
kinetic energy is contained in wavelengths shortward of 200 pc. The shape of
the kinetic energy spectrum differs substantially from that of the velocity
power spectrum, which implies that the velocity structure varies with the gas
density. Velocity structure functions demonstrate that the phenomenological
theory proposed by Boldyrev is applicable to the medium. We show that it can be
misleading to predict physical properties such as the stellar initial mass
function based on numerical simulations that do not include self-gravity of the
gas. Even if all the gas in turbulently Jeans unstable regions in our
simulation is assumed to collapse and form stars in local freefall times, the
resulting total collapse rate is significantly lower than the value consistent
with the input supernova rate. Supernova-driven turbulence inhibits star
formation globally rather than triggering it.

high-energy hadrons collide; in particular this almost certainly must be true
in the astrophysical accelerators of cosmic rays, which thus could be
identified unambiguously by sky observations in ""neutrino light"". On the one
hand, neutrinos are ideal messengers for astrophysical observations since they
are not deflected by electromagnetic fields and interact so weakly that they
are able to escape even from very dense production regions and traverse large
distances in the universe without attenuation. On the other hand, their weak
interaction poses a significant problem for detecting neutrinos. Huge target
masses up to gigatons must be employed, requiring to instrument natural
abundances of media such as sea water or antarctic ice. The first generation of
such neutrino telescopes is taking data or will do so in the near future, while
the second-generation projects with cubic-kilometre size is under construction

form a gravitationally unstable layer within 2x10^3 - 4x10^4 yr at 1 - 30 AU,
which is in good agreement with an analytic calculation by Nakagawa, Sekiya, &
Hayashi (1986) although they did not take into account the particle size

of the gas and most particles become large enough to move inward very rapidly

Barrat-Mezard model with its entropic barriers we obtain exact results at zero

extended to nonzero $T$, where the qualitative scaling behaviour and all

transition rates (Glauber versus Metropolis) affects not just prefactors but
also some exponents. In the limit of slow decorrelation even complete scaling
functions are accessible in closed form. The results show that slowly
decorrelating observables detect persistently slow out-of-equilibrium dynamics,

structure of 1/N-corrections, we first use the effective action approach and
then confirm the results by solving the loop equation. The results obtained
give some new representations of the mathematical objects related to the
Dirichlet boundary value problem, complex analysis and spectral geometry of

on Riemann surfaces, gravitational anomalies and topological field theories.

$K$ single FIFO servers and $M$ arrival processes. The customers from a given
arrival process can be served only by servers from a certain subset of all

length. The arrival processes are assumed to obey a large deviation principle
while the service is exponential. A large deviation principle is established
for the queue-length process. The action functional is expressed in terms of
solutions to mathematical programming problems. The large deviation limit point
is identified as a weak solution to a system of idempotent equations.
Uniqueness of the weak solution is proved by establishing trajectorial
uniqueness.

for a modular tensor category in terms of its twist. The first one is a
categorical generalization of an analogous result by Kashina, Sommerhauser, and
Zhu for Hopf algebras, and the second one extends Bantay's 2nd indicator
formula for a conformal field theory to higher degree. These formulae imply the
sequence of higher indicators of an object in these categories is periodic. We
define the notion of Frobenius-Schur (FS-)exponent of a pivotal category to be
the global period of all these sequences of higher indicators, and we prove
that the FS-exponent of a spherical fusion category is equal to the order of
the twist of its center. Consequently, the FS-exponent of a spherical fusion
category is a multiple of its exponent, in the sense of Etingof, by a factor
not greater than 2. As applications of these results, we prove that the
exponent and the dimension of a semisimple quasi-Hopf algebra H have the same
prime divisors, which answers two questions of Etingof and Gelaki affirmatively
for quasi-Hopf algebras. Moreover, we prove that the FS-exponent of H divides
dim(H)^4. In addition, if H is a group-theoretic quasi-Hopf algebra, the
FS-exponent of H divides dim(H)^2, and this upper bound is shown to be tight.

two or more, concentrating on those which map an elliptic curve onto itself,
necessarily by an expanding map. We describe relatively simple examples with a
rich variety of exotic dynamical behaviors which are perhaps familiar to the
applied dynamics community but not to specialists in several complex variables.
For example, we describe smooth attractors with riddled or intermingled
attracting basins, and we observe ``blowout'' bifurcations when the transverse
Lyapunov exponent for the invariant curve changes sign. In the complex case,
the elliptic curve (a topological torus) can never have a trapping
neighborhood, yet it can have an attracting basin of large measure (perhaps
even of full measure). We also describe examples where there appear to be
Herman rings (that is topological cylinders mapped to themselves with
irrational rotation number) with open attracting basin. In some cases we
provide proofs, but in other cases the discussion is empirical, based on
numerical computation.

  experiments: expected degradation",,,,,"physics.ins-det hep-ph",,"  There exists an enormous interest for the study of very high energy domain in
particle physics, both theoretically and experimentally, in the aim to
construct a general theory of the fundamental constituents of matter and of
their interactions. Until now, semiconductor detectors have widely been used in
modern high energy physics experiments. They are elements of the high
resolution vertex and tracking system, as well as of calorimeters. The main
motivation of this work is to discuss how to prepare some possible detectors -
only silicon option being considered, for the new era of HEP challenges because
the bulk displacement damage in the detector, consequence of irradiation,
produces effects at the device level that limit their long time utilisation,
increasing the leakage current and the depletion voltage, eventually up to
breakdown, and thus affecting the lifetime of detector systems. In this paper,
physical phenomena that conduce to the degradation of the detector are
discussed and effects are analysed at the device level (leakage current and
effective carrier concentration) in the radiation environments expected in the
next generation of hadron colliders after LHC, at the next lepton and
gamma-gamma colliders, as well as in astroparticle experiments, in conditions
of long time continuum irradiations, for different technological options. The
predicted results permit a better decision to obtain devices with harder
parameters to radiation.

a common mechanism for enhancing the sensitivity of biological signaling

generally, there is a component of the noise in such systems that can be traced
to the random arrival of the signaling molecules at their receptor sites, and
this diffusive noise is not reduced by cooperativity. Cooperativity makes it
easier for real systems to reach this physical limit, but cannot reduce the

also show that this representation yields useful diagnostic tools for guiding
the selection of classifier parameters, thus leading to improved performance.
