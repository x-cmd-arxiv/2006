flash convection. Specifically, we investigate the properties of shell
convection at a time immediately before the He- luminosity peak during the 15th
thermal pulse of a stellar evolution track with initially two solar masses and
metallicity Z=0.01. This choice is a representative example of a low-mass
asymptotic giant branch thermal pulse. We construct the initial vertical
stratification with a set of polytropes to resemble the stellar evolution
structure. Convection is driven by a constant volume heating in a thin layer at
the bottom of the unstable layer. We calculate a grid of 2D simulations with
different resolutions and heating rates. Our set of simulations includes one
low-resolution 3D run. The computational domain includes 11.4 pressure scale
heights. He-shell flash convection is dominated by large convective cells that
are centered in the lower half of the convection zone. Convective rolls have an
almost circular appearance because focusing mechanisms exist in the form of the
density stratification for downdrafts and the heating of localized eddies that
generate upflows. Nevertheless, downdrafts appear to be somewhat more focused.
The He-shell flash convection generates a rich spectrum of gravity waves in
both stable layers above and beneath the convective shell. The magnitude of the
convective velocities from our 1D mixing-length theory model and the
rms-averaged vertical velocities from the hydrodynamic model are consistent
within a factor of a few. However, the velocity profile in the hydrodynamic
simulation is more asymmetric, and decays exponentially inside the convection
zone. [abbreviated]

redshift z~1.2, using near-infrared images of three X-ray luminous clusters at
z=1.11,1.24,1.27. The composite LF was derived down to M*+4, by means of
statistical background subtraction, and is well described by a Schechter
function with K*=20.5 AB mag and alpha=-1.
  From the K band composite LF we derived the stellar mass function of cluster
galaxies. Using available X-ray mass profiles we determined the M/L ratios of
these three clusters, which tend to be lower than those measured in the local
universe.
  With these data, no significant difference can be seen between the shapes of
the cluster galaxies LF and the LF of field galaxies at similar redshift.
  We also found no significant evolution out to z ~1.2 in the bright (<M*+4)
part of the cluster galaxies LF probed in this study, apart from a brightening
of ~1.3 mag of the characteristic magnitude of the high redshift LF. We
confirm, and extend to higher redshift, the result from previous work that the
redshift evolution of the characteristic magnitude M* is consistent with
passive evolution of a stellar population formed at z>2.
  The results obtained in this work support and extend previous findings that
most of the stars in bright galaxies were formed at high redshift, and that
K-bright (M>10^11 Msun) galaxies were already in place at z ~ 1.2, at least in
the central regions of X-ray luminous clusters. Together with recent results on
the field galaxies stellar mass function, this implies that most of the stellar
mass is already assembled in massive galaxies by z ~ 1, both in low and high
density environments.

that the timing effect is caused by two scenarios: the motion of the planet and
the moon around the barycenter. Which one dominates depends on the parameters
of the system. Already planned missions (Kepler, COROT) may be able to detect
the moon in transiting extrasolar Earth-Moon-like systems with a 20%

expected. All such systems orbit far from the central star, with the orbital
periods at least 200 and 10 days for the planet and the moon, while they
contain K- and M-dwarf stars. Finally we estimate that a few number of real

globular cluster NGC 6266 (M62). The extensive photometric data set allows us
to determine the center of gravity and to construct the most extended radial
profile ever published for this cluster including, for the first time, detailed
star counts in the very inner region. The star density profile is well
reproduced by a standard King model with an extended core ($\sim 19''$) and a
modest value of the concentration parameter ($c=1.5$), indicating that the
cluster has not-yet experienced core collapse.
  The millisecond pulsar population (whose members are all in binary systems)
and the X-ray emitting population (more than 50 sources within the cluster half
mass radius) suggest that NGC 6266 is in a dynamical phase particularly active
in generating binaries through dynamical encounters. UV observations of the
central region have been used to probe the population of blue straggler stars,
whose origin might be also affected by dynamical interactions. The comparison
with other globular clusters observed with a similar strategy shows that the
blue straggler content in NGC 6266 is relatively low, suggesting that the
formation channel that produces binary systems hosting neutron stars or white
dwarfs is not effective in significantly increasing the blue straggler
population. Moreover, an anticorrelation between millisecond pulsar content and
blue straggler specific frequency in globular cluster seems emerging with
increasing evidence.

  Astrophysical Journal","Astrophys.J.643:266-275,2006","10.1086/502796",,"astro-ph",,"  The recent association of several short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with early
type galaxies with low star formation rate demonstrates that short bursts arise
from a different progenitor mechanism than long bursts. However, since the
duration distributions of the two classes overlap, membership is not always
easily established. The picture is complicated by the occasional presence of
softer, extended emission lasting tens of seconds after the initial spike-like
emission. We show that the fundamental defining characteristic of the short
burst class is that the initial spike exhibits negligible spectral evolution at
energies above ~ 25 keV. This behavior is nearly ubiquitous for the 260 bursts
with T90 < 2 s, where the BATSE TTE data completely included the initial spike.
The same signature obtains for one HETE-2 and six Swift/BAT short bursts.
Analysis of a small sample of ""short"" BATSE bursts with the most intense
extended emission shows that the same lack of evolution on the pulse timescale
obtains for the extended emission. The dynamic range in the ratio of peak
intensities, spike : extended, is ~ 10^4. For some bursts, the extended
emission is only a factor of 2-5 less intense. A high Lorentz factor, ~
500-1000, might explain the negligible lags observed in short bursts.

cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. It has been revealed that cosmic baryon
fluid in the nonlinear regime behaves like Burgers turbulence, i.e. the fluid
field consists of shocks. Like turbulence in incompressible fluid, the Burgers
turbulence plays an important role in converting the kinetic energy of the
fluid to thermal energy and heats the gas. We show that the simulation sample
of the $\Lambda$CDM model without adding extra heating sources can fit well the
observed distributions of X-ray luminosity versus temperature ($L_{\rm x}$ vs.
$T$) of galaxy groups and is also consistent with the distributions of X-ray
luminosity versus velocity dispersion ($L_{\rm x}$ vs. $\sigma$). Because the
baryonic gas is multiphase, the $L_{\rm x}-T$ and $L_{\rm x}-\sigma$
distributions are significantly scattered. If we describe the relationships by
power laws $L_{\rm x}\propto T^{\alpha_{LT}}$ and $L_{\rm x}\propto
\sigma^{\alpha_{LV}}$, we find $\alpha_{LT}>2.5$ and $\alpha_{LV}>2.1$. The
X-ray background in the soft $0.5-2$ keV band emitted by the baryonic gas in
the temperature range $10^5<T<10^7$ K has also been calculated. We show that of
the total background, (1) no more than 2% comes from the region with
temperature less than $10^{6.5}$ K, and (2) no more than 7% is from the region
of dark matter with mass density $\rho_{\rm dm}<50 \bar{\rho}_{\rm dm}$. The
region of $\rho_{\rm dm}>50\bar{\rho}_{\rm dm}$ is generally clustered and
discretely distributed. Therefore, almost all of the soft X-ray background
comes from clustered sources, and the contribution from truly diffuse gas is
probably negligible. This point agrees with current X-ray observations.

\equiv B_{\ast}^2 R_{\ast}^{2} / \dot{M} V_{\infty} = 600$. The magnetic field
channels and torques the wind outflow into an equatorial, rigidly rotating disk
extending from near the Kepler corotation radius outwards. Even with
fine-tuning at lower magnetic confinement, none of the MHD models produce a
stable Keplerian disk. Instead, material below the Kepler radius falls back on
to the stellar surface, while the strong centrifugal force on material beyond
the corotation escape radius stretches the magnetic loops outwards, leading to
episodic breakout of mass when the field reconnects. The associated dissipation
of magnetic energy heats material to temperatures of nearly $10^{8}$K, high
enough to emit hard (several keV) X-rays. Such \emph{centrifugal mass ejection}
represents a novel mechanism for driving magnetic reconnection, and seems a

spectrum of the quasar HE 0515-4414 obtained using the High Accuracy Radial
velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) mounted on the ESO 3.6 m telescope at the La
Silla observatory. The HARPS spectrum, of very high wavelength calibration
accuracy (better than 1 m\AA), is used to search for possible systematic
inaccuracies in the wavelength calibration of the UV Echelle Spectrograph
(UVES) mounted on the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT). We have carried out
cross-correlation analysis between the Th-Ar lamp spectra obtained with HARPS
and UVES. The shift between the two spectra has a dispersion around zero of
\sigma\simeq 1 m\AA. This is well within the wavelength calibration accuracy of
UVES (i.e \sigma\simeq 4 m\AA). We show that the uncertainties in the
wavelength calibration induce an error of about, \Delta\alpha/\alpha\le
10^{-6}, in the determination of the variation of the fine-structure constant.
Thus, the results of non-evolving \Delta\alpha/\alpha reported in the
literature based on UVES/VLT data should not be heavily influenced by problems
related to wavelength calibration uncertainties. Our higher resolution spectrum
of the z_{abs}=1.1508 damped Lyman-\alpha system toward HE 0515-4414 reveals
more components compared to the UVES spectrum. Using the Voigt profile
decomposition that simultaneously fits the high resolution HARPS data and the
higher signal-to-noise ratio UVES data, we obtain,
\Delta\alpha/\alpha=(0.05\pm0.24)x10^{-5} at z_{abs}=1.1508. This result is
consistent with the earlier measurement for this system using the UVES spectrum
alone.

kept pace with the process of galaxy assembly. For this purpose, we first
searched the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) for ""tadpole galaxies"", which have
a knot at one end and an extended tail. They appear dynamically unrelaxed --
presumably early-stage mergers -- and make up ~6% of the field galaxy
population. Their redshift distribution follows that of field galaxies,
indicating that -- if tadpole galaxies are indeed dynamically young -- the
process of galaxy assembly generally kept up with the reservoir of field
galaxies as a function of epoch. Next, we present a search for HUDF objects
with point-source components that are optically variable (at the >~3.0 sigma
level) on timescales of weeks--months. Among 4644 objects to i_AB=28.0 mag (10
sigma), 45 have variable point-like components, which are likely weak AGN.
About 1% of all field objects show variability for 0.1 < z < 4.5, and their
redshift distribution is similar to that of field galaxies. Hence supermassive
black-hole growth in weak AGN likely also kept up with the process of galaxy
assembly. However, the faint AGN sample has almost no overlap with the tadpole
sample, which was predicted by recent hydrodynamical numerical simulations.
This suggests that tadpole galaxies are early-stage mergers, which likely
preceded the ``turn-on'' of the AGN component and the onset of visible
point-source variability by >~1 Gyr.

with the COSMOSOMAS experiment at the Teide Observatory (Tenerife). Three maps
have been obtained at 12.7, 14.7 and 16.3 GHz covering 9000 square degrees each
with a resolution of ~1 degree and with sensitivities 49, 59 and 115 muK per
beam respectively. These data in conjuction with the WMAP first year maps have
revealed that the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is the dominant
astronomical signal at high galatic latitude in the three COSMOSOMAS channels
with an average amplitude of 29.7+/- 1.0 \muK (68% c.l. not including
calibration errors). This value is in agreement with the predicted CMB signal
in the COSMOSOMAS maps using the best fit Lambda-CDM model to the WMAP power
spectrum. Cross-correlation of COSMOSOMAS data with the DIRBE map at 100 \mu m
shows the existence of a common signal with amplitude 7.4+/- 1.1, 7.5+/- 1.1,
and 6.5+/-2.3 muK in the 12.7, 14.7 and 16.3 GHz COSMOSOMAS maps at
|b|>30^\deg. Using the WMAP data we find this DIRBE correlated signal rises
from high to low frequencies flattening below ~20 GHz. At higher galactic
latitudes the average amplitude of the correlated signal with the DIRBE maps
decreases slightly. The frequency behaviour of the COSMOSOMAS/WMAP correlated
signal with DIRBE is not compatible with the expected tendency for thermal
dust. A study of the H-alpha emission maps do not support free-free as a major
contributor to that signal. Our results provide evidence of a new galactic
foreground with properties compatible with those predicted by the spinning dust

(to our knowledge) the first mid-IR spectra of X-ray selected QSO2s taken. The
objects have been selected according to their high intrinsic luminosities and
column densities in the X-rays. Their spectra strongly differ from template
spectra of Type 2 AGN at lower luminosities. They do not exhibit strong PAH
dust emission features from circum-nuclear star forming regions, typical for
lower luminosity Type 2 Seyfert galaxies or other previously used QSO2
templates, such as the (Ultra)luminous Infrared Galaxy ((U)LIRG) NGC 6240. They
also do not show the ice and silicate absorption features of highly luminous
but deeply embedded compact nuclei seen in some ULIRGs. Instead they reveal a
relatively featureless, rising continuum similar to luminous Type 1 AGN. We
also find evidence for a 10 micron silicate feature in emission. Models of
dusty tori in the AGN unification scenario predict this only for Type 1 AGN.
The ratio of the AGN continuum luminosity at 6 micron to the absorption
corrected 2-10keV X-ray AGN luminosity is very similar to that found in Seyfert
galaxies. X-ray selected QSO2s are thus characterized by powerful AGN in hosts
with a luminosity due to star formation < 1e11 L_sol. The dominance of the AGN
light in the mid-IR spectra of QSO2s together with their flatter spectral
energy distributions (SEDs) places important constraints on models of the
cosmic infrared background and of the star formation history of the universe.

possibility of the existence of a central black hole in M15 via several runs
that utilize the radial velocity data set which offers kinematic measurements
closer to the centre of the cluster than the proper motion data. These runs are
distinguished from each other in the choice of the initial seed for the cluster
characteristics; however, the profiles identified by the algorithm at the end
of each run concur with each other, within error bars, thus confirming the
robustness of CHASSIS. The recovered density profiles are noted to exhibit
unequivocal flattening, inner to about 0.0525pc. Also, the enclosed mass
profile is very close to being a power-law function of radius inside 0.1pc and
is not horizontal. Simplistically speaking, these trends negate the possibility
of the central mass to be concentrated in a black hole, the lower bound on the
radius of the sphere of influence of which would be $\gtrsim$0.041pc, had it
existed. However, proper analysis suggests that the mass enclosed within the
inner 0.01pc could be in the form of a black hole of mass
$\sim{10^3}$M$_{\odot}$, under two different scenarios, which are discussed.
The line-of-sight velocity dispersion is visually found to be very similar to
the observed dispersion profile. The enclosed mass and velocity dispersion
profiles calculated from runs done with the proper motion data are found to be
consistent with the profiles obtained with the radial velocity data.

of 23 sources are selected on the basis of low X-ray-to-optical flux ratio
logfx/fopt<-2, soft X-ray spectral properties and optical spectra, when
available, consistent with stellar than AGN processes. This sample is combined
with similarly selected systems from the Needles in the Haystack Survey

normal galaxies, the largest low-z sample yet available. This is first used to
constrain the normal galaxy logN-logS at bright fluxes (>1e-15cgs). We estimate
a slope of -1.46\pm0.13 for the cumulative number counts consistent with the
euclidean prediction. We further combine our sample with 23 local (z<0.2)
galaxies from the CDF North and South to construct the local X-ray luminosity
function of normal galaxies. A Schechter form provides a good fit to the data
with a break at logL*~41.02cgs and a slope of -1.76\pm0.10. Finally, for the
sample of 46 systems we explore the association between X-ray luminosity and
host galaxy properties, such as SFR and stellar mass. We find that the L_X of
the emission-line systems correlates with Ha luminosity and 1.4GHz radio power,
both providing an estimate of the current star-formation rate. In the case of
early type galaxies with absorption line optical spectra we use the K-band as
proxy to stellar mass and find a correlation of the form L_X~L_K^1.5. This is
flatter than the L_X-L_B relation for local ellipticals. This may be due to
either L_K providing a better proxy to galaxy mass or selection effects biasing
our sample against very luminous early-type galaxies.

First we followed the evolution of gas and solids from the moment where all
solids are in the form of small grains to the stage when most of them are in
the form of planetesimals for a set of different initial masses and sizes of
protoplanetary disks. Based on that we performed Monte Carlo calculations
describing the formation of giant places at different locations. We included
the effects of type II migration and growth of the mass of the planet after the
gap opened. We discuss how these effects influence the final distribution of
giant planets. We show that when the giant planets are not able to migrate or
grow in mass after the gap opens, their distribution is mainly determined by
the properties of the gaseous disk. However, with those two effects included,
reproducing the parameters of the gaseous disks from the distribution of
planets becomes difficult. We also checked the roles of both the material of
which the solids consist and the mass of the central star. The main result is
that, in disks around less massive stars, giant planets at the given location
tend to be less massive. At the same time, the giant planets with the given
mass tend to form closer to the less massive stars.

region of the high-T$_c$ cuprate superconductors. We analyze and compare the
formation of the so-called resonance peak, in three different ordered states:
the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconducting (DSC) phase, the $d$-density wave (DDW)
state, and a phase with coexisting DDW and DSC order. An analysis of the
resonance's frequency and momentum dependence in all three states reveals
significant differences between them. In particular, in the DDW state, we find
that a nearly dispersionless resonance excitation exists only in a narrow
region around ${\bf Q}=(\pi,\pi)$. At the same time, in the coexisting DDW and
DSC state, the dispersion of the resonance peak near ${\bf Q}$ is significantly
changed from that in the pure DSC state. Away from $(\pi,\pi)$, however, we
find that the form and dispersion of the resonance excitation in the coexisting
DDW and DSC state and pure DSC state are quite similar. Our results demonstrate
that a detailed experimental measurement of the resonance's dispersion allows
one to distinguish between the underlying phases - a DDW state, a DSC state, or
a coexisting DDW and DSC state - in which the resonance peak emerges.

doped into the half-filled Mott insulator. To explicitly capture the interplay
between the hole dynamics and local spin correlations we derive a new

instead of the original electron operators. This ``doped carrier'' formulation
provides a new starting point to address doped spin systems and we use it to
develop a new, fully fermionic, mean-field description of doped Mott insulators
This mean-field approach reveals a new mechanism for superconductivity, namely
spinon-dopon mixing, and we apply it to the tt't''J model as of interest to
high-temperature superconductors. In particular, we use model parameters
borrowed from band calculations and from fitting ARPES data to obtain a
mean-field phase diagram that reproduces semi-quantitatively that of hole and
electron doped cuprates. The mean-field approach hereby presented accounts for
the local antiferromagnetic and d-wave superconducting correlations which, we
show, provide a rational for the role of t' and t'' in strengthening
superconductivity as expected by experiments and other theoretical approaches.
As we discuss how t, t' and t'' affect the phase diagram, we also comment on
possible scenarios to understand the differences between as-grown and oxygen

the equilibrium position) and a distortion (change in the vibrational

symmetry between the excitation spectra of the two charge states. This gives
rise to new transport effects which map out changes in the current-induced
non-equilibrium vibrational distribution with increasing bias voltage.
Secondly, the distortion modifies the Franck-Condon factors for electron
tunneling. Together with the spectral asymmetry this gives rise to pronounced
nuclear wave function interference effects on the electron transport. For
instance nuclear-parity forbidden transitions lead to differential conductance
anti-resonances, which are stronger than those due to allowed transitions. For
special distortion and shift combinations a coherent suppression of transport

the intermediate-density electron gas confined to a circular disc, where the

angular modulation, without any signature of a sharp transition in this density

in most cases segregate. If the larger particles accumulate at the top of the
sample, this is called the Brazil-nut effect (BNE); if they accumulate at the
bottom, the reverse Brazil-nut effect (RBNE). While this process is of great
industrial importance in the handling of bulk solids, it is not well
understood. In recent years ten different mechanisms have been suggested to
explain when each type of segregation is observed. However, the dependence of
the mechanisms on driving conditions and material parameters and hence their
relative importance is largely unknown. In this paper we present experiments
and simulations where both types of particles are made from the same material
and shaken under low air pressure, which reduces the number of mechanisms to be
considered to seven. We observe both BNE and RBNE by varying systematically the
driving frequency and amplitude, diameter ratio, ratio of total volume of small
to large particles, and overall sample volume. All our results can be explained
by a combination of three mechanisms: a geometrical mechanism called void
filling, transport of particles in sidewall-driven convection rolls, and
thermal diffusion, a mechanism predicted by kinetic theory.

the solvent accessible surface is an output of our model. The presented

crossover, the PE time remains constant, the expansion of the fluid in the BL
drops down and the PE ultimately fades away.

Hubbard models (HM) for densities slightly away from half-filling through the
behavior of two central quantities of a system: the uniform charge and spin
susceptibilities. We point out that a consistent renormalization group
treatment of them can only be achieved within a two-loop approach or beyond. In
the 1D HM, we show that this scheme reproduces correctly the metallic behavior
given by the well-known Luttinger liquid fixed-point result. Then, we use the
same approach to deal with the more complicated 2D HM. In this case, we are
able to show that both uniform susceptibilities become suppressed for moderate
interaction parameters as one take the system towards the Fermi surface.
Therefore, this result adds further support to the interpretation that those
systems are in fact insulating spin liquids. Later, we perform the same
calculations in 2D using the conventional random phase approximation, and
establish clearly a comparison between the two schemes.

capacity of the forbidden patterns, which is given by the logarithm of the
joint spectral radius of a set of matrices constructed from the forbidden

approximation, in exponential time, of the capacity with arbitrary high degree
of accuracy. We also provide a polynomial time algorithm for the problem of
determining if the capacity of a set is positive, but we prove that the same
problem becomes NP-hard when the sets of forbidden patterns are defined over an

invariant, the interaction with a gravitational antenna of the gravitational
wave which carries that energy is. It therefore has to be possible to make some
statements which involve the energy which are in fact gauge invariant, and it
is the objective of this paper to provide them. In order to develop a gauge
invariant treatment of the issues involved, we construct a specific action for
gravitational fluctuations which is gauge invariant to second perturbative
order. Then, via variation of this action, we obtain an energy-momentum tensor
for perturbative gravitational fluctuations around a general curved background
whose covariant conservation condition is also fully gauge invariant to second
order. Contraction of this energy-momentum tensor with a Killing vector of the
background conveniently allows us to convert this covariant conservation
condition into an ordinary conservation condition which is also gauge invariant
through second order. Then, via spatial integration we are able to obtain a
relation involving the time derivative of the total energy of the fluctuation
and its asymptotic spatial momentum flux which is also completely gauge
invariant through second order. It is only in making the simplification of
setting the asymptotic momentum flux to zero that one would actually lose
manifest gauge invariance, with only invariance under those particular gauge
transformations which leave the asymptotic momentum flux zero then remaining.
However, if one works in an arbitrary gauge where the asymptotic momentum flux
is non-zero, the gravitational wave will then deliver both energy and momentum
to a gravitational antenna in a completely gauge invariant manner, no matter
how badly behaved at infinity the gauge function might be.

internal viscosity and strain distributions originated by defects in the
texture. A Lagrangian modeled on the one valid for simple dissipative phenomena
in fluids is built and used for empty spacetime. The internal ""viscosity"" is
shown to correspond to a four-vector field. The vector field is shown to be
connected with the displacement vector field induced by a point defect in a
four-dimensional continuum. Using the known symmetry of the universe, assuming
the vector field to be divergenceless and solving the corresponding
Euler-Lagrange equation, we directly obtain inflation and a phase of
accelerated expansion of spacetime. The only parameter in the theory is the
""strength"" of the defect. We show that it is possible to fix it in such a way

finally verified that the addition of ordinary matter does not change the

model for emergent relativistic inertia a la Mach's principle with m playing
the role of inertial mass, and also of analog gravity where it is also the
passive gravitational mass. m depends on the particle type and intrinsic
structure, while L is universal: For D dimensional particles L is proportional
to the hypergeometric function F(1,1/2;D/2;U^2/c^2). Particles fall in the same
way in the analog gravitational field independent of their internal structure,
thus satisfying the weak equivalence principle. For D less or equal 5 they all
have a relativistic limit with the acquired energy and momentum diverging as U
approaches c. For D less or equal 7 the null geodesics of the standard acoustic
metric solve our equation of motion. Interestingly, for D=4 the dynamics is
very nearly Lorentzian. The particles can be said to follow the geodesics of a
generalized acoustic metric of a Finslerian type that shares the null geodesics
with the standard acoustic metric. In vortex geometries, the ergosphere is
automatically the static limit. As in the real world, in ``black hole''
geometries circular orbits do not exist below a certain radius that occurs
outside the horizon. There is a natural definition of antiparticles; and I
describe a mock particle vacuum in whose context one can discuss, e.g.,
particle Hawking radiation near event horizons.

hadronic W pair production at LEP.
  Bose-Einstein correlations between identical particles from the decay of
different W's are studied by comparing the particle correlation in hadronic W
pair decays to those in events which are constructed from the combination of
the hadronic parts of two events where one of the Ws decays leptonicaly. The
LEP combined result of the strength of the effect is consistent with zero and
can be used to limit the systematic uncertainty due to Bose-Einstein
correlations on the W mass measurements.
  Color reconnection is expected to affect the production of particles in
hadronic decays of W pairs. Measurements of inclusive charged particle
multiplicities, and of their angular distribution with respect to the four jet
axes of the events, are used to test models of color reconnection.
  The results are both consistent with models without color reconnection and
models with moderate color reconnection. They can be used to exclude more
extreme models of color reconnection and thereby limit the uncertainty due to
color reconnection on the W mass measurement.

expected event rates are extremely low we consider some additional signatures
of the neutralino nucleus interaction, such as the periodic behavior of the
rates due to the motion of Earth (modulation effect), which, unfortunately, is
characterized by a small amplitude. This leads us to examine the possibility of
suggesting directional experiments, which measure not only the energy of the
recoiling nuclei but their direction as well. In these, albeit hard,
experiments one can exploit two very characteristic signatures: a)large
asymmetries and b) interesting modulation patterns. Furthermore we extended our

The same unitary transformation that defines the correlated interaction is used

We consider the possibility of deep kaon optical potential and find that the
composition of matter is very sensitive to the interaction strength of kaons
with matter. The onset densities of the kaon condensation are studied in detail
by varying the kaon optical potentials. We find that the MQMC model produces
the kaon condensation at lower densities than QHD. The presence of kaon
condensation changes drastically the population of octet baryons and leptons.
Once the kaon condensation takes place, the population of kaons builds up very
quickly, and kaons become the dominant component of the matter. We find that
the $\omega$-meson plays an important role in increasing the kaon population

deal of attention recently. Most authors seem to equate this issue with the one
of finding the maximum value of the modularity, as defined by Newman. Since the
problem formulated this way is NP-hard, most effort has gone into the
construction of search algorithms, and less to the question of other measures
of community structures, similarities between various partitionings and the
validation with respect to external information. Here we concentrate on a class
of computer generated networks and on three well-studied real networks which
constitute a bench-mark for network studies; the karate club, the US college
football teams and a gene network of yeast. We utilize some standard ways of
clustering data (originally not designed for finding community structures in
networks) and show that these classical methods sometimes outperform the newer
ones. We discuss various measures of the strength of the modular structure, and
show by examples features and drawbacks. Further, we compare different
partitions by applying some graph-theoretic concepts of distance, which
indicate that one of the quality measures of the degree of modularity
corresponds quite well with the distance from the true partition. Finally, we
introduce a way to validate the partitionings with respect to external data
when the nodes are classified but the network structure is unknown. This is
here possible since we know everything of the computer generated networks, as
well as the historical answer to how the karate club and the football teams are
partitioned in reality. The partitioning of the gene network is validated by
use of the Gene Ontology database, where we show that a community in general
corresponds to a biological process.

is a purely classical event without operator counterpart. However, a classical
irreversible system cannot be consistently decomposed into a finite number of
reversible quantum particles (and, vice versa), thus establishing that the
origin of irreversibility is basically unknown at the dawn of the 21-th
century. To resolve this problem, we adopt the historical an- alytic
representation of irreversibility by Lagrange and Hamilton with external terms
in their analytic equations; we show that, when properly written, the brackets
of the time evolution characterize covering Lie-admissible algebras; we show
that the for- malism has a fully consistent operator counterpart given by the
Lie-admissible branch of hadronic mechanics; we identify catastrophic
mathematical and physical inconsis- tencies when irreversible formulations are
treated with the conventional mathematics used for reversible systems; and show
that, when the dynamical equations are treated with a novel irreversible
mathematics, Lie-admissible formulations are fully consistent because invariant
at both the classical and operator level. The case of closed-isolated systems
verifying conventional total conservation laws, yet possessing an irreversible
structure, is treated via the Lie-isotopic subclass of Lie-admissible
formulations. The analysis is conducted for both matter and antimatter at the
classical and operator levels to prevent insidious inconskistenmcies occurring
for the sole study of matter or, separately, antimatter, as known known for the
problem of grand unificationsr.

dominates the excitable dynamics, we find the phenomenon of intrinsic coherence
resonance. In this case, the relatively regular spiking behavior is practically
independent of the applied external driving; therefore no synchronization
occurs. Synchronization takes place, however, only for sufficiently large ion
channel assemblies. The neuronal signal processing is thus likely rooted in the
collective properties of optimally large assemblies of ion channels.

approximation of perturbation and our improved scheme of perturbation theory,
the improved form of the perturbed solution of open systems absorbing the

deduced. Moreover, only under the factorizing initial condition, the exact

crossings in the spectrum gives rise to Bloch oscillations of the atomic

variety of different level crossings are obtained by changing the magnitude of
the detuning, and the behaviour of the atomic motion is strongly affected due
to this. I also consider the situation in which the detuning is oscillating in

is that quantum dissipation helps to ensure the validity of the Third Law. For
the quantum oscillator, finite damping replaces the zero-coupling result of an
exponential suppression of the specific heat at low temperatures by a power-law
behavior. Rather intriguing is the behavior of the free quantum Brownian
particle. In this case, quantum dissipation is able to restore the Third Law:
Instead of being constant down to zero temperature, the specific heat now
vanishes proportional to temperature with an amplitude that is inversely
proportional to the ohmic dissipation strength. A distinct subtlety of finite
quantum dissipation is the result that the various thermodynamic functions of
the sub-system do not only depend on the dissipation strength but depend as
well on the prescription employed in their definition.
