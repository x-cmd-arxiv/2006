likely to be turbulent and is certainly magnetized. The properties of this
magnetized turbulence are determined both by fundamental nonlinear
magnetohydrodynamic interactions and by the plasma physics of the ICM, which
has very low collisionality. Cluster plasma threaded by weak magnetic fields is
subject to firehose and mirror instabilities. These saturate and produce
fluctuations at the ion gyroscale, which can scatter particles, increasing the
effective collision rate and, therefore, the effective Reynolds number of the
ICM. A simple way to model this effect is proposed. The model yields a
self-accelerating fluctuation dynamo whereby the field grows explosively fast,
reaching the observed, dynamically important, field strength in a fraction of
the cluster lifetime independent of the exact strength of the seed field. It is
suggested that the saturated state of the cluster turbulence is a combination
of the conventional isotropic magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, characterized by
folded, direction-reversing magnetic fields and an Alfv\'en-wave cascade at
collisionless scales. An argument is proposed to constrain the reversal scale
of the folded field. The picture that emerges appears to be in qualitative
agreement with observations of magnetic fields in clusters.

many methanol transitions which produce observed masers. This allows to use
pumping analysis for estimation of the physical parameters in the maser
formation regions and its environment, for the study of their evolution.
Extensive surveys in different masing transitions allow to conclude on the
values of the temperatures, densities, dust properties, etc. in the bulk of
masing regions. Variability of the brightest masers is monitored during several
years. In some cases it is probably caused by the changes of the dust
temperature which follow variations in the brightness of the central YSO
reflecting the character of the accretion process. A unified catalogue of the
class II methanol masers consisting of more than 500 objects is compiled.

small-N stellar systems as expected from the embryo ejection scenario. We model
a cluster of several hundred stars grouped into 'cores' of a few stars/brown
dwarfs. These cores decay, preferentially ejecting their lowest-mass members.
Brown dwarfs are found to have a wider spatial distribution than stars, however
once the effects of limited survey areas and unresolved binaries are taken into
account it can be difficult to distinguish between clusters with many or no
ejections. A large difference between the distributions probably indicates that
ejections have occurred, however similar distributions sometimes arise even
with ejections. Thus the spatial distribution of brown dwarfs is not
necessarily a good discriminator between ejection and non-ejection scenarios.

constant or a negative pressure fluid with a constant equation of state $w <

use the Type Ia Supernovae Hubble diagram and the data on the gas mass fraction

a significant fraction of dark matter in the form of a fluid of strings and
show that this mechanism makes it possible to reduce the need for the elusive

eliminates the need of phantom dark energy thus representing a viable candidate

three-dimensional semi microscopic XY model with two-component vectors that
involve phase variables and adjustable parameters representing microscopic
phase stiffnesses. The model captures characteristic energy scales present in

ordering. Applying spherical closure relation we have solved the phase XY model

Relying on experimental data unveiling that oxygen doping of YBCO may introduce
significant charge imbalance between CuO2 planes and other sites, we show that
simultaneously the former are underdoped, while the latter -- strongly
overdoped almost in the whole region of oxygen doping in which YBCO is
superconducting. As a result, while oxygen content is increased, this provides
two counter acting factors, which possibly lead to rise of 60K plateau.

for harmonic mixing consists of a first signal with a basic frequency $\Omega$
and a second, superimposed signal oscillating at twice the basic frequency
$2\Omega$. By variation of the phase difference between these two components
and the amplitude ratios of the driving the phenomenon of SR becomes a priori
controllable. The harmonic mixing dynamically breaks the symmetry so that the
time- and ensemble-average assumes a non-vanishing value. Independently of the
noise level, the response can be suppressed by adjusting the phase difference.
Nonlinear SR then exhibits resonances at higher harmonics with respect to the
applied noise strength and relative phase. The scheme of nonlinear SR via
harmonic mixing can be used to steer the nonlinear response and to sensitively
measure the internal noise strength. We further demonstrate that the full

systems by asymptotically matching the 4-metrics of two tidally perturbed
Schwarzschild solutions in isotropic coordinates to a resummed post-Newtonian
4-metric in ADMTT coordinates. The specific matching procedure used here
closely follows the calculation in gr-qc/0503011, and is performed in the so
called buffer zone where both the post-Newtonian and the perturbed
Schwarzschild approximations hold. The result is that both metrics agree in the
buffer zone, up to the errors in the approximations. However, since isotropic
coordinates are very similar to ADMTT coordinates, matching yields better
results than in the previous calculation, where harmonic coordinates were used
for the post-Newtonian 4-metric. In particular, not only does matching improve
in the buffer zone, but due to the similarity between ADMTT and isotropic
coordinates the two metrics are also close to each other near the black hole
horizons. With the help of a transition function we also obtain a global smooth
4-metric which has errors on the order of the error introduced by the more
accurate of the two approximations we match. This global smoothed out 4-metric
is obtained in ADMTT coordinates which are not horizon penetrating. In
addition, we construct a further coordinate transformation that takes the
4-metric from global ADMTT coordinates to new coordinates which are similar to
Kerr-Schild coordinates near each black hole, but which remain ADMTT further
away from the black holes. These new coordinates are horizon penetrating and
lead, for example, to a lapse which is everywhere positive on the t=0 slice.
Such coordinates may be more useful in numerical simulations.

two-dimensional Minkowski space is discussed. In this program, models are
obtained from a prescribed factorizing S-matrix in two steps. At first, quantum
fields which are localized in infinitely extended, wedge-shaped regions of
Minkowski space are constructed explicitly. In the second step, local
observables are analyzed with operator-algebraic techniques, in particular by
using the modular nuclearity condition of Buchholz, d'Antoni and Longo.
  Besides a model-independent result regarding the Reeh-Schlieder property of
the vacuum in this framework, an infinite class of quantum field theoretic
models with non-trivial interaction is constructed. This construction completes
a program initiated by Schroer in a large family of theories, a particular
example being the Sinh-Gordon model. The crucial problem of establishing the
existence of local observables in these models is solved by verifying the
modular nuclearity condition, which here amounts to a condition on analytic
properties of form factors of observables localized in wedge regions.
  It is shown that the constructed models solve the inverse scattering problem
for the considered class of S-matrices. Moreover, a proof of asymptotic
completeness is obtained by explicitly computing total sets of scattering
states. The structure of these collision states is found to be in agreement
with the heuristic formulae underlying the Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra.

analyzes the statistics of series r(n) (n=4,6,8,...). The familiar 3 period

also find r(n) series could be divided into different levels period oscillation
series. The series in the same or different levels are all very similar, which
presents the obvious fractal phenomenon. Moreover, symmetry between the

it will reach large deviations from the base values-- of the order of the

stochastic generator of time series of the total energy of the system.
Statistical inference of extreme values is applied to yearly maxima sequences
of the time series, in the rigorous setting provided by extreme value theory.
In particular, the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) family of distributions is
used here. Several physically realistic values of the parameter $T_E$,
descriptive of the forced equator-to-pole temperature gradient and responsible
for setting the average baroclinicity in the atmospheric model, are examined.
The location and scale GEV parameters are found to have a piecewise smooth,
monotonically increasing dependence on $T_E$. This is in agreement with the
similar dependence on $T_E$ observed in the same system when other dynamically
and physically relevant observables are considered. The GEV shape parameter
also increases with $T_E$ but is always negative, as \textit{a priori} required

increase their lifetimes when they are stretched by mechanical force, while the
force increase beyond some thresholds their lifetimes decrease. Several
specific chemical kinetic models have been developed to explain the intriguing
transitions from the ""catch-bonds"" to the ""slip-bonds"". In this work we suggest
that the counterintuitive forced dissociation of the complexes is a typical
rate process with dynamic disorder. An uniform one-dimension force modulating
Agmon-Hopfield model is used to quantitatively describe the transitions
observed in the single bond P-selctin glycoprotein ligand

that the novel catch-slip bond transition arises from a competition of the two
components of external applied force along the dissociation reaction coordinate
and the complex conformational coordinate: the former accelerates the
dissociation by lowering the height of the energy barrier between the bound and
free states (slip), while the later stabilizes the complex by dragging the
system to the higher barrier height (catch).

length $\xi_0$ and a correlation time $\tau_0$. For small perturbation
strengths or rapid fluctuating perturbations, the Loschmidt echo decays
exponentially with a rate predicted by the Fermi Golden Rule, $1/\tilde{\tau}=

In this paper we study the notion of entanglement of particles introduced by
Wiseman and Vaccaro [Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 097902 (2003)] in several specific
physical systems, including some that occur in condensed matter physics. The
entanglement of particles is relevant when the identical particles are
itinerant and so not distinguished by their position as in spin models. We show
that entanglement of particles can behave differently to other approaches that
have been used previously, such as entanglement of modes (occupation-number
entanglement) and the entanglement in the two-spin reduced density matrix. We
argue that the entanglement of particles is what could actually be measured in
most experimental scenarios and thus its physical significance is clear. This
suggests entanglement of particles may be useful in connecting theoretical and
experimental studies of entanglement in condensed matter systems.
