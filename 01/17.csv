cluster of galaxies at redshift z = 1.106. Cluster members were selected from
HST ACS images, combined with ground--based near--IR imaging and optical
spectroscopy. The observed early--type color--magnitude relation (CMR) in
(i_775 -z_850) versus z_850 shows intrinsic scatters in color of 0.042 +/-
0.010 mag and 0.044 +/- 0.020 mag for ellipticals and S0s, respectively. From
the scatter about the CMR, a mean luminosity--weighted age t > 3.3 Gyr (z > 3)
is derived for the elliptical galaxies.
  Strikingly, the S0 galaxies in RDCS J0910+5422 are systematically bluer in
(i_775 - z_850) by 0.07 +/- 0.02 mag, with respect to the ellipticals. The
ellipticity distribution as a function of color indicates that the face-on S0s
in this particular cluster have likely been classified as elliptical. Thus, if
anything, the offset in color between the elliptical and S0 populations may be
even more significant.
  The color offset between S0 and E corresponds to an age difference of ~1 Gyr,
for a single-burst solar metallicity model. A solar metallicity model with an
exponential decay in star formation will reproduce the offset for an age of 3.5
Gyr, i.e. the S0s have evolved gradually from star forming progenitors.
  The early--type population in this cluster appears to be still forming. The
blue early-type disk galaxies in RDCS J0910+5422 likely represent the direct
progenitors of the more evolved S0s that follow the same red sequence as
ellipticals in other clusters.
  Thirteen red galaxy pairs are observed and the galaxies associated in pairs
constitute ~40% of the CMR galaxies in this cluster.

very narrow range of shapes (m=3+/-1). The total density profile of Es cannot
be NFW-like because the predicted local M/L and aperture velocity dispersion
within an effective radius (Re) are much lower than observed. Stars must then
dominate Es out to a few Re. Fitting an NFW model to the total density profile
of Sersic+NFW (stars+dark matter [DM]) Es results in very high concentration
parameters, as found by X-ray observers. Kinematical modeling of Es assuming an
isotropic NFW DM model underestimates M/L at the virial radius by a factor of
1.6 to 2.4, because dissipationless LCDM halos have slightly different density
profiles and slightly radial velocity anisotropy. In N-body+gas simulations of
Es as merger remnants of spirals embedded in DM halos, the slope of the DM
density profile is steeper when the initial spiral galaxies are gas-rich. The
Hansen & Moore (2006) relation between anisotropy and the slope of the density
profile breaks down for gas and DM, but the stars follow an analogous relation
with slightly less radial anisotropies for a given density slope. Using
kurtosis (h_4) to infer anisotropy in Es is dangerous, as h_4 is also sensitive
to small levels of rotation. The stationary Jeans equation provides accurate
masses out to 8 Re. The discrepancy between the modeling of Romanowsky et al.
(2003), indicating a dearth of DM in Es, and the simulations analyzed by Dekel
et al. (2005), which match the spectroscopic observations of Es, is partly due
to radial anisotropy and to observing oblate Es face-on. However, one of the 15
solutions to the orbit modeling of Romanowsky et al. is found to have an amount
and concentration of DM consistent with LCDM predictions.

populating halos of N-body simulations with galaxies. Extensive tests with
these mock catalogs show that no combination of perpendicular and line-of-sight
linking lengths is able to yield groups and clusters that simultaneously
recover the true halo multiplicity function, projected size distribution, and
velocity dispersion. We adopt a linking length combination that yields, for
galaxy groups with ten or more members: a group multiplicity function that is
unbiased with respect to the true halo multiplicity function; an unbiased
median relation between the multiplicities of groups and their associated
halos; a spurious group fraction of less than ~1%; a halo completeness of more

July 2000, Bastille Day. Near-Earth spacecraft measured the proton flux
directly and ground-based observatories measured the secondary responses to
higher energy protons. We have modelled the arrival of these relativistic
protons at Earth using a technique which deduces the spectrum, arrival
direction and anisotropy of the high-energy protons that produce increased
responses in neutron monitors. To investigate the acceleration processes
involved we have employed theoretical shock and stochastic acceleration
spectral forms in our fits to spacecraft and neutron monitor data. During the
rising phase of the event (10:45 UT and 10:50 UT) we find that the spectrum
between 140 MeV and 4 GeV is best fitted by a shock acceleration spectrum. In
contrast, the spectrum at the peak (10:55 UT and 11:00 UT) and in the declining
phase (11:40 UT) is best fitted with a stochastic acceleration spectrum. We
propose that at least two acceleration processes were responsible for the

(ISO) and 12 micron (IRAS), and classified on the basis of their optical
spectra. Local templates of type-1 and type-2 AGN have been used to derive the
intrinsic 15 micron luminosities. We adopted an evolving smooth two-power law
shape of the LF, whose parameters have been derived using an un-binned maximum
likelihood method. We find that the LF of type-1 AGN is compatible with a pure
luminosity evolution (L(z)=L(0)(1+z)^k_L) model where k_L~2.9. A small
flattening of the faint slope of the LF with increasing redshift is favoured by
the data. A similar evolutionary scenario is found for the type-2 population
with a rate k_L ranging from ~1.8 to 2.6, depending significantly on the
adopted mid-infrared spectral energy distribution. Also for type-2 AGN a
flattening of the LF with increasing redshift is suggested by the data,
possibly caused by the loss of a fraction of type-2 AGN hidden within the
optically classified starburst and normal galaxies. The type-1 AGN contribution
to the CIRB at 15 micron is (4.2-12.1) x 10e-11 W m^-2 sr^-1, while the type-2
AGN contribution is (5.5-11.0) x 10e-11 W m^-2 sr^-1. We expect that Spitzer
will observe, down to a flux limit of S_24 = 0.01 mJy, a density of ~1200
deg^-2 type-1 and ~1000 deg^-2 type-2 optically classified AGN. The derived
total contribution of the AGN galaxies to the CIRB (4-10%) and Spitzer counts
should be considered as lower limits, because of a possible loss of type-2

of the standard wide-field method (homothetic mapping) which is not applicable
when the aperture is highly diluted; for this reason imaging with
non-homothetic arrays is being extensively studied [1], [2]. The field of view
of a pupil plane interferometer or a densified array consists only of a few
resolution elements; in order to improve these systems, we developed a new
method consisting of a Michelson pupil-plane combination scheme where a wide
field of view can be achieved in one shot. This technique, called ""staircase
mirror"" approach, has been described in a previous paper [3] and uses a
stair-shaped mirror in the intermediate image plane of each telescope in the
array, allowing for simultaneous correction of the differential delay for both
the on- and off-axis image positions. Experimental results have been obtained
showing the simultaneous recovering of the fringes of off-axis stars with an
appreciable angular separation, and with a contrast similar to that of the
on-axis reference star. With this example, we demonstrate an increase of the
field of view by a factor of five, with no need of extra observation time. In
this article, we present a further analysis of the method. We investigate how
to retrieve the visibility when a star is focused on the edge of a step of the
stair-shaped mirror. Even though the Optical Pathlength Difference (OPD)
correction is discontinuous, we show both numerically and analytically that the
visibility can be completely recovered, so that no information is lost. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the visibility can be retrieved to within

Circinus is compact and obscured by a substantial column of cool silicate dust.
Weak extended emission to the east and west coincides with the coronal line
region and arises from featureless dust grains which are probably heated by
line emission in the coronal emission zone. The extended emission on the east
side of the nucleus displays a much deeper silicate absorption than that on the
west, indicating significant columns of cool material along the line of sight
and corresponding to an additional extinction of A(V) 25 mag. Emission bands
from aromatic hydrocarbons are not subject to this additional extinction, are
relatively weak in the core and in the coronal line region, and are much more
spatially extended than the continuum dust emission; they presumably arise in
the circumnuclear star-forming regions. These data are interpreted in terms of
an inclined disk-like structure around the nucleus extending over tens of
parsecs and possibly related to the inner disk found from observations of water
masers by Greenhill et al (2003).

interpolation methods to deal with these irregularly sampled data, we produced
maps of the polarized diffuse Galactic radio emission with pixel size of 0.92
deg. We derived the angular power spectrum (APS) (PI, E, and B modes) of the
synchrotron dominated radio emission as function of the multipole, l. We
considered the whole covered region and some patches at different Galactic
latitudes. By fitting the APS in terms of power laws (C_l = k l^a), we found
spectral indices that steepen with increasing frequency: from a = -(1-1.5) at
408 MHz to a = -(2-3) at 1411 MHz for 10 < l < 100 and from a = -0.7 to a =
-1.5 for lower multipoles (the exact values depending on the considered sky
region and polarization mode). The bulk of this steepening can be interpreted
in terms of Faraday depolarization effects. We then considered the APS at
various fixed multipoles and its frequency dependence. Using the APSs of the
Leiden surveys at 820 MHz and 1411 MHz, we determined possible ranges for the
rotation measure, RM, in the simple case of an interstellar medium slab model.
Taking also into account the polarization degree at 1.4 GHz, we could break the
degeneracy between the identified RM intervals. The most reasonable of them

  Computing Systems",,,,,"cond-mat.other",,"  We demonstrate that an $n^+/i/n^+$ junction is the most suitable candidate
for electronic control and readout of qubit states in quantum computing systems

$n^+-$regions serve as metallic electrodes separated form the $i-$region by a
self-induced barrier (internal workfunction). The $n^+/i/n^+$ system mimics the
properties of a metal-vacuum-metal junction with the qubit (impurity atom)
placed in a ``vacuum'' $i$-region between two ``metallic'' $n^+$ electrodes. We
will show that the self-induced barrier exists in a sufficiently wide range of
the concentration of dopants in the $n^+$-semiconductor (e.g. up to $10^{21}$
cm$^{-3}$ for Si) and its height can be controlled by tuning the doping level.
A shallow donor placed in a vacuum $i$-region will be populated with one
electron in equilibrium. In the case of Li donor in Si the $n^+$-electrodes
will be used for a precision placement of the Li atom during the growth
process; for voltage control and manipulation of the qubit states; and for a
qubit readout by means of the optically stimulated resonant tunnelling. Another
important feature of our system is that the qubit states (first two lowest
energy levels of Li in Si) are separated by an energy gap from a continuum of
the many-body states of the controlling electrodes.

between the vacua with the same symmetry but which belong to different
universality classes. Different types of quantum phase transitions governed by
topology in momentum space are discussed in this Chapter. They involve Fermi
surfaces, Fermi points, Fermi lines, and also the topological transitions
between the fully gapped states. The consideration based on the momentum space
topology of the Green's function is general and is applicable to the vacua of
relativistic quantum fields. This is illustrated by the possible quantum phase
transition governed by topology of nodes in the spectrum of elementary
particles of Standard Model.

orbital-degenerate transition metal oxides with different multiplet structure.
For each case we derive the magnetic exchange constants, which determine the
spin wave dispersions, as well as the partial optical sum rules. The magnetic
and optical properties of early transition metal oxides with degenerate
$t_{2g}$ orbitals (titanates and vanadates with perovskite structure) are shown
to depend only on two parameters, viz. the superexchange energy $J$ and the
ratio $\eta$ of Hund's exchange to the intraorbital Coulomb interaction, and on
the actual orbital state. In $e_g$ systems important corrections follow from
charge transfer excitations, and we show that KCuF$_3$ can be classified as a
charge transfer insulator, while LaMnO$_3$ is a Mott insulator with moderate
charge transfer contributions. In some cases orbital fluctuations are quenched
and decoupling of spin and orbital degrees of freedom with static orbital order
gives satisfactory results for the optical weights. On the example of cubic
vanadates we describe a case where the full quantum spin-orbital physics must

in a network for any given routing strategy, 2) We are able to identify ""good""
routing strategies depending on the evolution of its effective radius as the

study the properties of UDMs in general and then we discuss an explicit

sense to be made more precise later on, unique. Moreover, the structure of this
class of UDMs allows us to answer some open conjectures by Tavildar, Viswanath,

decoding algorithm for this class of UDMs. It turns out that our construction
yields a coding scheme that is essentially equivalent to a class of codes that
was proposed by Rosenbloom and Tsfasman. Moreover, we point out connections to

attractive approach to reducing communication costs by using available
bandwidth effectively. Over the last decade there has been an unprecedented
explosion in the amount of digital data transmitted via the Internet,
representing text, images, video, sound, computer programs, etc. With this
trend expected to continue, it makes sense to pursue research on developing
algorithms that can most effectively use available network bandwidth by
maximally compressing data. This research paper is focused on addressing this

have developed highly sophisticated approaches, such as Huffman encoding,
arithmetic encoding, the Lempel-Ziv family, Dynamic Markov Compression (DMC),
Prediction by Partial Matching (PPM), and Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) based
algorithms. However, none of these methods has been able to reach the
theoretical best-case compression ratio consistently, which suggests that
better algorithms may be possible. One approach for trying to attain better
compression ratios is to develop new compression algorithms. An alternative
approach, however, is to develop intelligent, reversible transformations that
can be applied to a source text that improve an existing, or backend,
algorithm's ability to compress. The latter strategy has been explored here.

attempt to account for some of the missing ingredients discussed recently, such
as correlations, discreteness in gluon emission and Pomeron loops. The
evolution is numerically performed using the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation on
individual configurations defined by a given initial value of the saturation
scale, for reduced rapidities $y=(\alpha_s N_c/\pi) Y<10$. We consider the
effects of averaging over configurations as a way to implement correlations,
using three types of Gaussian averaging around a mean saturation scale.
Further, we heuristically mimic discreteness in gluon emission by considering a
modified evolution in which the tails of the gluon distributions are cut-off.
The approach to scaling and the behavior of the saturation scale with rapidity
in these modified evolutions are studied and compared with the standard
mean-field results. For the large but finite values of rapidity explored, no
strong quantitative difference in scaling for transverse momenta around the
saturation scale is observed. At larger transverse momenta, the influence of
the modifications in the evolution seems most noticeable in the first steps of
the evolution. No influence on the rapidity behavior of the saturation scale
due to the averaging procedure is found. In the cut-off evolution the rapidity
evolution of the saturation scale is slowed down and strongly depends on the
value of the cut-off. Our results stress the need to go beyond simple
modifications of evolution by developing proper theoretical tools that
implement such recently discussed ingredients.

Algebraicity of a random matrix sequence is shown to act as a certificate of

systematically such varieties as Bruhat cells in G and their convolution
products and, on the other hand, to give a new construction of many normal
Kashiwara crystals including those for G^\vee-modules, where G^\vee is the
Langlands dual groups. In fact, our analogues of crystal bases (which we refer
to as crystals associated to G^\vee-modules) are associated to G^\vee-modules
directly, i.e., without quantum deformations.
  One of the main results of the present paper is an explicit construction of
the crystal B_0 for the coordinate ring of the (Langlands dual) flag variety
based on the positive unipotent bicrystal on the open Bruhat cell.
  Our general tropicalization procedure assigns to each strongly positive
unipotent bicrystal a normal Kashiwara crystal B equipped with the multiplicity
erasing homomorphism B--> B_0 and the combinatorial central charge B--> Z which
is invariant under all crystal operators.

wavenumber $k_1\leq (p^2-1)\mu_1$, where $p>1$ and $\mu_1$ is the smallest
eigenvalue of Poincar\'{e}'s problem. Second, we find a new upper bound for the
imaginary part of the complex phase velocity $c_i \leq k_1 \Delta

bound is finite for all $k>0$ similar to the Howard's semicircle theorem, while
the previous ones by Craik and Banerjee et al would be infinity as
$k\rightarrow 0$. Third, we find a new upper bound of growth rate $\omega_i

also extend the inverse energy cascade theory by Kraichnan. As shear
instability is due to long-wave instability, it implies that the truncation of
long-waves may change the instability of shear flows.

variability observed in the NH on different spectral sub-domains. Only two
high-resolution GCMs have a good agreement with reanalyses. Large biases, in
most cases larger than 20%, are found between the wave climatologies of most
GCMs and the reanalyses, with a relative span of around 50%. The travelling
baroclinic waves are usually overestimated, while the planetary waves are
usually underestimated, in agreement with previous studies performed on global
weather forecasting models. When comparing the results of various versions of
similar GCMs, it is clear that in some cases the vertical resolution of the
atmosphere and, somewhat unexpectedly, of the adopted ocean model seem to be
critical in determining the agreement with the reanalyses. The GCMs ensemble is
biased with respect to the reanalyses but is comparable to the best 5 GCMs.
This study suggests serious caveats with respect to the ability of most of the
presently available GCMs in representing the statistics of the global scale
atmospheric dynamics of the present climate and, a fortiori, in the perspective
of modelling climate change.

transmitting a pathogen can be a superior competitor to a more vulnerable
resident species, is one of the principle driving forces influencing
biodiversity in nature. Using an experimental system of bacteriophage-mediated
competition in bacterial populations and a deterministic model, we have shown
in [Joo et al 2005] that the competitive advantage conferred by the phage
depends only on the relative phage pathology and is independent of the initial
phage concentration and other phage and host parameters such as the
infection-causing contact rate, the spontaneous and infection-induced lysis
rates, and the phage burst size. Here we investigate the effects of stochastic
fluctuations on bacterial invasion facilitated by bacteriophage, and examine
the validity of the deterministic approach. We use both numerical and
analytical methods of stochastic processes to identify the source of noise and
assess its magnitude. We show that the conclusions obtained from the
deterministic model are robust against stochastic fluctuations, yet deviations
become prominently large when the phage are more pathological to the invading
bacterial strain.

distribution of the output of an interferometer, as a function of phase delay.
As inputs we use coherent states with mean photon number up to seven. The
postselection of a specific Fock (photon-number) state effectively induces
high-order optical non-linearities. Following a scheme by Bentley and Boyd
[S.J. Bentley and R.W. Boyd, Optics Express 12, 5735 (2004)] we explore this
effect to demonstrate interference patterns a factor of five smaller than the
Rayleigh limit.

Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm [D. Deutsch and R. Jozsa, Proc. R. Soc. London A {\bf
493}, 553 (1992)] is presented. The proposal uses Stark shifts in an ensemble
of atoms and degenerate sources of photons. The photons interact dispersively
with an atomic ensemble, leading to an effective Hamiltonian in atom-field
basis, which is useful for performing the required two-qubit operations.
Combining these with a set of one-qubit operations, the algorithm can be
implemented. A discussion of the experimental feasibility of the proposal is
given.

addressed. In particular, I focus on the task of effectively switching off
environmental couplings responsible for unwanted decoherence and dissipation
effects. After revisiting the standard framework for dynamical decoupling via
deterministic controls, I describe a different approach whereby the controller
intentionally acquires a random component. An explicit error bound on
worst-case performance of stochastic decoupling is presented.

Bell inequality is derived, for the scenario in which many parties make
measurements on two-level systems. This generalizes and unifies some previous
results. Moreover, a necessary and sufficient condition for the violation of
this inequality is presented. It turns out that the class of non-separable
states which do not admit local realistic description is extended when compared
to the two-setting inequalities. However, supporting the conjecture of Peres,
quantum states with positive partial transposes with respect to all subsystems
do not violate the inequality. Additionally, we follow a general link between
Bell inequalities and communication complexity problems, and present a quantum
protocol linked with the inequality, which outperforms the best classical
protocol.
