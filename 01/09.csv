perturbations as induced say by a tidal interaction. We calculate the
self-gravitational potential corresponding to a non-axisymmetric,
self-consistent density response of the disc using the Green's function method.
The response potential is shown to oppose the perturbation potential because
the self-gravity of the disc resists the imposed potential, and this resistence
is stronger in the inner parts of a galactic disc. For the m=1 azimuthal
wavenumber, the disc response opposes the imposed perturbation upto a radius
that spans a range of 4-6 disc scale-lengths, so that the disc shows a net warp
only beyond this region. This physically explains the well-known but so far
unexplained observation (Briggs 1990) that warps typically set in beyond this
range of radii. We show that the inclusion of a dark matter halo in the
calculation only marginally changes (by ~ 10 %) the radius for the onset of
warps. For perturbations with higher azimuthal wavenumbers, the net signature
of the vertical perturbations can only be seen at larger radii - for example
beyond 7 exponential disc scale-lengths for m=10. Also, for high m cases, the
magnitude of the negative disc response due to the disc self-gravity is much
smaller. This is shown to result in corrugations of the mid-plane density,
which explains the puzzling scalloping with m=10 detected in HI in the
outermost regions ~ 30 kpc in the Galaxy by Kulkarni et al. (1982).

holes (MBHs) where the stellar orbits are nearly Keplerian and so do not
precess significantly. The resulting coherent torques efficiently change the
magnitude of the angular momenta and rotate the orbital inclination in all
directions. As a result, many of the tightly bound stars very near the MBH are
rapidly destroyed by falling into the MBH on low-angular momentum orbits, while
the orbits of the remaining stars are efficiently randomized. We solve
numerically the Fokker-Planck equation in energy for the steady state
distribution of a single mass population with a RR sink term. We find that the
steady state current of stars, which sustains the accelerated drainage close to
the MBH, can be up to ~10 times larger than that due to non-coherent 2-body
relaxation alone. RR mostly affects tightly bound stars, and so it increases
only moderately the total tidal disruption rate, which is dominated by stars
originating from less bound orbits farther away. We show that the event rate of
gravitational wave (GW) emission from inspiraling stars, originating much
closer to the MBH, is dominated by RR dynamics. The GW event rate depends on
the uncertain efficiency of RR. The efficiency indicated by the few available
simulations implies rates ~10 times higher than those predicted by 2-body
relaxation, which would improve the prospects of detecting such events by
future GW detectors, such as LISA. However, a higher, but still plausible RR
efficiency can lead to the drainage of all tightly bound stars and strong
suppression of GW events from inspiraling stars. We apply our results to the
Galactic MBH, and show that the observed dynamical properties of stars there
are consistent with RR.

ApJ accepted","Astrophys.J.647:1-7,2006","10.1086/505384",,"astro-ph",,"  Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the galaxy power spectrum allows us to
extract the scale of the comoving sound horizon at recombination, a
cosmological standard ruler accurately determined by the cosmic microwave
background anisotropy data. We examine various issues important in the use of
BAO to probe dark energy. We find that assuming a flat universe, and priors on
Omega_m, Omega_m h^2, and Omega_b h^2 as expected from the Planck mission, the
constraints on dark energy parameters (w_0,w') scale much less steeply with
survey area than (area)^{-1/2} for a given redshift range. The constraints on
the dark energy density rho_X(z), however, do scale roughly with (area)^{-1/2}
due to the strong correlation between H(z) and Omega_m (which reduces the
effect of priors on Omega_m). Dark energy constraints from BAO are very
sensitive to the assumed linear scale of matter clustering and the redshift
accuracy of the survey. For a BAO survey with 0.5<= z <= 2, sigma(R)=0.4
(corresponding to k_{max}(z=0)=0.086 h Mpc^{-1}), and sigma_z/(1+z)=0.001,
(sigma_{w_0},sigma_{w'})=(0.115, 0.183) and (0.069, 0.104) for survey areas of
1000 (deg)^2 and 10000 (deg)^2 respectively. We find that it is critical to
minimize the bias in the scale estimates in order to derive reliable dark
energy constraints. For a 1000 (10000) square degree BAO survey, a 1-sigma bias
in ln H(z) leads to a 2-sigma (3-sigma) bias in w'. The bias in w' due to the
same scale bias from ln D_A(z) is slightly smaller and opposite in sign. The
results from this paper will be useful in assessing different proposed BAO
surveys and guiding the design of optimal dark energy detection strategies.

Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) is investigated by combining two different types of
numerical simulation. First, star-cluster simulations are performed to model
the stellar dynamics of the ONC, the results of which are used to investigate
the frequency of encounters, the mass ratio and separation of the stars
involved, and the eccentricity of the encounter orbits. The results show that
interactions that could influence the star-surrounding disc are more frequent
than previously assumed in the core of the ONC, the so-called Trapezium
cluster. Second, a parameter study of star-disc encounters is performed to
determine the upper limits of the mass loss of the discs in encounters. For
simulation times of $\sim$ 1-2 Myr (the likely age of the ONC) the results show
that gravitational interaction might account for a significant disc mass loss
in dense clusters. Disc destruction is dominated by encounters with high-mass
stars, especially in the Trapezium cluster, where the fraction of discs
destroyed due to stellar encounters can reach 10-15%. These estimates are in
accord with observations of (Lada et al. 2000) who determined a stellar disc
fraction of 80-85%. Thus, it is shown that in the ONC - a typical star-forming
region - stellar encounters do have a significant effect on the mass of
protoplanetary discs and thus affect the formation of planetary systems.

increase with redshift of the fraction of blue galaxies in clusters.
Considering a representative cluster sample made of seven group/clusters at

outskirts and the field mainly using wide field CTIO images. This sample
represents a random selection of a volume complete x-ray selected cluster
sample, selected so that there is no physical connection with the studied
quantity (blue fraction), to minimize observational biases. In order to
statistically assess the significance of the Butcher-Oemler effect, we
introduce the tools of Bayesian inference. Furthermore, we modified the blue
fraction definition in order to take into account the reduced age of the
universe at higher redshifts, because we should no longer attempt to reject an
unphysical universe in which the age of the Universe does depend on redshift,
whereas the age of its content does not. We measured the blue fraction from the
cluster center to the field and we find that the cluster affects the properties
of the galaxies up to two virial radii at z~0.35. Data suggest that during the
last 3 Gyrs no evolution of the blue fraction, from the cluster core to the
field value, is seen beyond the one needed to account for the varying age with
redshift of the Universe and of its content. The agreement of the radial
profiles of the blue fraction at z=0 and z~0.35 implies that the pattern infall
did not change over the last 3 Gyr, or, at least, its variation has no
observational effect on the studied quantity.

corroborated by our N-band spectrum showing a crystallinity fraction of more
than 50 % for both objects, pointing to a stable environment where dust
processing can occur. Surprisingly, the dust surrounding SX Cen is not resolved
in the interferometric observations providing an upper limit of 11 mas (or 18
AU at the distance of this object) on the diameter of the dust emission. This
confirms the very compact nature of its circumstellar environment. The dust
emission around HD 52961 originates from a very small but resolved region,

superluminal velocities and `acausal' distance to the horizon are in fact a
direct consequence of special-relativistic phenomenon of time dilation, as well

showing a flare in its X-ray light curve. During this flare, which peaks at
t_peak ~210s after the BAT trigger, a flux variation of (delta F)/F~6 in a very
short time (delta t)/t_peak<<1 was observed. Its measured fluence in the 0.2-10
keV band was ~1.4x10^-8 erg cm^-2, which corresponds to 1-15% of the prompt
fluence. We present indications of spectral variations during the flare. We
argue that the producing mechanism is late internal shocks, which implies that
the central engine is still active at 210s, though with a reduced power with
respect to the prompt emission. The X-ray light curve flattens to a very
shallow slope with decay index of ~0.5 after ~4400s, which also supports
continued central engine activity at late times. This burst is classified as an
X-ray flash, with a relatively low fluence (~10^-7 erg cm^-2 in the 15-350 keV
band, E_iso~10^51 erg), a soft spectrum (photon index 2.65), no significant
flux above ~50 keV and a peak energy E_p<15 keV. XRF 050406 is one of the first
examples of a well-studied X-ray light curve of an XRF. We show that the main
afterglow characteristics are qualitatively similar to those of normal GRBs. In
particular, X-ray flares superimposed on a power-law light curve have now been

0.573+-0.009 : 0.331+-0.004 and E(J-H)/E(H-Ks) = 1.72+-0.04, and we find that
the power law A(lambda) \propto lambda^{-1.99+-0.02} is a good approximation
over these wavelengths. Moreover, we find a small variation in A(Ks)/E(H-Ks)
across our survey. This suggests that the infrared extinction law changes from
one line of sight to another, and the so-called ``universality'' does not
necessarily hold in the infrared wavelengths.

objects out of the 18 with available data. In 4 galaxies we detected nuclear
X-ray absorption at a level of about N_H= (0.2-6)e22 cm-2. X-ray absorbed
sources are associated with the presence of highly inclined dusty disks (or
dust filaments projected onto the nuclei) seen in the HST images. This suggests
the existence of a flattened X-ray absorber, but of much lower optical depth
than in classical obscuring tori. We thus have an un-obstructed view toward
most FR~I nuclei while absorption plays only a marginal role in the remaining
objects. Three pieces of evidence support an interpretation for a jet origin
for the X-ray cores: i) the presence of strong correlations between the nuclear
luminosities in the radio, optical and X-ray bands, extending over 4 orders of
magnitude and with a much smaller dispersion (about 0.3 dex) when compared to
similar trends found for other classes of AGNs, pointing to a common origin for
the emission in the three bands; ii) the close similarity of the broad-band
spectral indices with the sub-class of BL Lac objects sharing the same range of
extended radio-luminosity, in accord with the FRI/BL Lacs unified model; iii)
the presence of a common luminosity evolution of spectral indices in both FRI
and BL Lacs. The low luminosities of the X-ray nuclei, regardless of their
origin, strengthens the interpretation of low efficiency accretion in low
luminosity radio-galaxies.

massive cluster lens Abell 1835 (z=0.25). We present new Keck (LRIS) and
Spitzer Space Telescope (IRAC) observations of the z=10 candidate (hereafter

that have been taken of an XRF optical counterpart. Combining the early -time
optical temporal and spectral properties with \gamma- and simultaneous X-ray
data taken with the BAT and XRT telescopes on-board Swift, we are able to
constrain possible origins of the XRF. The prompt emission had a FRED profile
(fast-rise, exponential decay) with a duration of T_90 = 5.7\pm 0.2s, putting
it at the short end of the long-burst duration distribution. The absence of
photoelectric absorption red-ward of 4000 \AA in the UV/optical spectrum
provides a firm upper limit of z\leq 3.1 on the redshift, thus excluding a high
redshift as the sole reason for the soft spectrum. The optical light curve is
consistent with a power-law decay with slope alpha = -0.75\pm 0.26
(F_{\nu}\propto t^{\alpha}), and a maximum occurring in the first 200s after
the initial gamma-ray emission. The softness of the prompt emission is well
described by an off-axis structured jet model, which is able to account for the
early peak flux and shallow decay observed in the optical and X-ray bands.

combines bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. The impurity spin states are
described by Abrikosov pseudofermions, and we make use of a method initiated by
Popov and Fedotov which allows a proper handling of the fermionic constraint.
The partition function is derived within a path integral approach. We use
renormalization group techniques to calculate the $\beta$ scaling function
perturbatively in powers of the Kondo coupling constant, which is justified in
the weak coupling limit. The truncated expansion is valid in the overscreened
(Nozieres-Blandin) regime, for an arbitrary SU(N) group and any value of the
parameters characterizing the impurity spin representation. The intermediate
coupling fixed point is identified. We derive the temperature dependence of
various physical quantities at low T, controlled by a unique critical exponent,
and show that the physics of the system in the overscreened regime governed by
the intermediate coupling fixed point is characterized by a non-Fermi liquid
behavior. Our results are in accordance with those obtained by other methods,
as Bethe ansatz and boundary conformal field theory, in the case of various
impurity spin symmetries. We establish in a unified way that the Kondo models
in which the impurity spin is described successively by a fundamental,
symmetric, antisymmetric and mixed symmetry representation yield all the same
low-energy physics in the overscreened regime. Possible generalizations of the

Beck and E.G.D.
Cohen, Physica A 322, 267 (2003)] is a formalism that aims to deal in a
unifying way with a large variety of complex nonequilibrium systems, for which
spatio-temporal fluctuations of one intensive variable (the ""temperature"" 1/b)
are supposed to exist. The intuitive explanation provided by Beck for
superstatistics is based on the ansatz that the system under consideration,
during its evolution, travels within its phase space which is partitioned into
cells. Within each cell, the system is described by ordinary Maxwell-Boltzmann
statistical mechanics, i.e., its statistical distribution is the canonical one,
but b varies from cell to cell, with its own probability density f(b). In this
work we first address that the explicit inclusion of the density of states in
this description is essential for its correctness. The correction is not
relevant for developments of the theory, but points to the fact that its
correct starting point, as well its meaning, must be found at a more basic
level: the pure probability product rule involving the intensive variable b and
its conjugate extensive one. The question therefore arises how to assign a
meaning to these probabilities for each specific problem. We will see that it
is easily answered through Bayesian analysis. This way, we are able to provide
an interpretation for f(b), that was not fully elucidated till now.

the driving mechanism of the confinement-deconfinement phase transition at
nonzero chemical potential mu. The arguments are based on the picture that
instantons at very large chemical potential in the weak coupling regime are
localized configurations with finite size \rho\sim\mu^{-1}. At the same time,
the same instantons at smaller chemical potential in the strong coupling regime
are well represented by the so-called instanton-quarks with fractional
topological charge 1/N_c. We estimate the critical chemical potential mu_c(T)
where transition between these two regimes takes place. We identify this
transition with confinement- deconfinement phase transition.
  We also argue that the instanton quarks carry magnetic charges. As a
consequence of it, there is a relation between our picture and the standard
t'Hooft and Mandelstam picture of the confinement. We also comment on possible
relations of instanton-quarks with ""periodic instantons"", "" center vortices"",
and ""fractional instantons"" in the brane construction. We also argue that the
variation of the external parameter mu, which plays the role of the vacuum
expectation value of a ""Higgs"" field at mu >> \Lambda_{QCD}, allows to study
the transition from a ""Higgs -like"" gauge theory (weak coupling regime, mu>>
\Lambda_{QCD}) to ordinary QCD (strong coupling regime, mu<< \Lambda_{QCD}). We
also comment on some recent lattice results on topological charge density
distribution which support our picture.

continuum theories. The calculus begins at a single point and is extended to
chains of finitely many points by linearity, or superposition. It converges to
the smooth continuum with respect to a norm on the space of ``pointed chains,''
culminating in the chainlet complex. Through this complex, we discover a broad
theory of coordinate free, multivector analysis in smooth manifolds for which
both the classical Newtonian calculus and the Cartan exterior calculus become
special cases. The chainlet operators, products and integrals apply to both
symmetric and antisymmetric tensor cochains. As corollaries, we obtain the full
calculus on Euclidean space, cell complexes, bilayer structures (e.g., soap
films) and nonsmooth domains, with equal ease. The power comes from the
recently discovered prederivative and preintegral that are antecedent to the
Newtonian theory. These lead to new models for the continuum of space and time,

analysis for perturbative inversion of specific operators on Banach spaces.
However, operators that appear in signal processing (e.g. folding and
convolution of probability density functions), in general, do not satisfy the
usual convergence condition of that series expansion. This article provides
some theorems on the convergence criteria of a similar series expansion for
this more general case, which is not covered yet by the literature.
  The main result is that a series expansion provides a robust unbiased
unfolding and deconvolution method. For the case of the deconvolution, such a
series expansion can always be applied, and the method always recovers the
maximum possible information about the initial probability density function,
thus the method is optimal in this sense. A very significant advantage of the
presented method is that one does not have to introduce ad hoc frequency
regulations etc., as in the case of usual naive deconvolution methods. For the
case of general unfolding problems, we present a computer-testable sufficient
condition for the convergence of the series expansion in question.
  Some test examples and physics applications are also given. The most
important physics example shall be (which originally motivated our survey on
this topic) the case of pi^0 --> gamma+gamma particle decay: we show that one
can recover the initial pi^0 momentum density function form the measured single

(Cd)^{\frac{c}{d}}\left\Vert f\right\Vert_{h}$ where $C,c$ are constants, $h$
is the Gaussian function, $% s$ is the interpolating function, and d is called
fill distance which, roughly speaking, measures the spacing of the points at
which interpolation occurs. This error bound gets small very fast as $d\to 0$.
The constants $C$ and $c$ are very sensitive. A slight change of them will
result in a huge change of the error bound. The number $c$ can be calculated as
shown in [9]. However, $C$ cannot be calculated, or even approximated. This is
a famous question in the theory of radial basis functions. The purpose of this
paper is to answer this question.

  note: text overlap with arXiv:math/0601158",,,,"math.NA",,"  Radial function interpolation of scattered data is a frequently used method
for multivariate data fitting. One of the most frequently used radial functions
is called shifted surface spline, introduced by Dyn, Levin and Rippa in
\cite{Dy1} for $R^{2}$. Then it's extended to $R^{n}$ for $n\geq 1$. Many
articles have studied its properties, as can be seen in
\cite{Bu,Du,Dy2,Po,Ri,Yo1,Yo2,Yo3,Yo4}. When dealing with this function, the
most commonly used error bounds are the one raised by Wu and Schaback in
\cite{WS}, and the one raised by Madych and Nelson in \cite{MN2}. Both are
$O(d^{l})$ as $d\to 0$, where $l$ is a positive integer and $d$ is the
fill-distance. In this paper we present an improved error bound which is
$O(\omega^{1/d})$ as $d\to 0$, where $0<\omega <1$ is a constant which can be
accurately calculated.

  Mathematics and Statistics, University of Sydney. Can also be downloaded as a
  pdf file from www.maths.usyd.edu.au",,,,"math.QA math.GT",,"  The general method of Reshetikhin and Turaev is followed to develop
topological invariants of closed, connected, orientable 3-manifolds from a new
class of algebras called pseudo-modular Hopf algebras. Pseudo-modular Hopf
algebras are a class of Z_2-graded ribbon Hopf algebras that generalise the
concept of a modular Hopf algebra.
  The quantum superalgebra U_q(osp(1|2n)) over C is considered with q a
primitive N^th root of unity for all integers N >= 3. For such a q, a certain
left ideal I of U_q(osp(1|2n)) is also a two-sided Hopf ideal, and the quotient
algebra U_q^(N)(osp(1|2n)) = U_q(osp(1|2n)) / I is a Z_2-graded ribbon Hopf
algebra.
  For all n and all N >= 3, a finite collection of finite dimensional
representations of U_q^(N)(osp(1|2n)) is defined. Each such representation of
U_q^(N)(osp(1|2n)) is labelled by an integral dominant weight belonging to the
truncated dominant Weyl chamber. Properties of these representations are
considered: the quantum superdimension of each representation is calculated,
each representation is shown to be self-dual, and more importantly, the
decomposition of the tensor product of an arbitrary number of such
representations is obtained for even N.
  It is proved that the quotient algebra U_q^(N)(osp(1|2n)), together with the
set of finite dimensional representations discussed above, form a
pseudo-modular Hopf algebra when N >= 6 is twice an odd number.
  Using this pseudo-modular Hopf algebra, we construct a topological invariant
of 3-manifolds. This invariant is shown to be different to the topological
invariants of 3-manifolds arising from quantum so(2n+1) at roots of unity.

parallel flow is obtained analytically. First, a sufficient criterion for
stability is found as either $-\mu_1<\frac{U''}{U-U_s}<0$ or
$0<\frac{U''}{U-U_s}$ in the flow, where $U_s$ is the velocity at inflection
point, $\mu_1$ is the eigenvalue of Poincar\'{e}'s problem. Second, this
criterion is generalized to barotropic geophysical flows in $\beta$ plane.
Based on the criteria, the flows are are divided into different categories of
stable flows, which may simplify the further investigations. And the
connections between present criteria and Arnol'd's nonlinear criteria are
discussed. These results extend the former criteria obtained by Rayleigh,
Tollmien and Fj{\o}rtoft and would intrigue future research on the mechanism of
hydrodynamic instability.

relativistic regime, we introduce the concept of {\it apparent reflection
point} (ARP). It appears to an external observer that the radiation electric
field is zero at the ARP. The relativistic dynamics of the ARP completely
defines the generation of high harmonics and attosecond pulses. The ARP
velocity is a smooth function of time. The corresponding $\gamma$-factor,
however, has sharp spikes at the times when the tangential vector potential
vanishes and the surface velocity becomes close to the speed of light. We show
that managing the laser polarization, one can efficiently control the ARP
dynamics, e.g., to gate a single (sub-)attosecond pulse out of the short pulse
train generated by a multi-cycle driver. This relativistic control is
demonstrated numerically by particle-in-cell simulations.

regime beyond the restraining limits of weak driving (linear response) and/or
weak noise. The scheme is carefully tested and yields excellent agreement with
three different numerical methods based on the Langevin equation, the
Fokker-Planck equation and an integral equation.

phenomenon of sleep. Motivated by Crick's suggestion that sleep is the brain's
way of ``taking out the trash,'' a suggestion that is supported by emerging
evidence, we consider the problem of the filling and emptying of a tank. At any
given time, the tank may take in external resource, or fill, if resource is
available at that time, or it may empty. The filling phases correspond to
information input from the environment, or input of some material in general,
while the emptying phases correspond to the processing of the resource. Given a
resource-availablility profile over some time interval $ T $, we develop a
canonical algorithm for determining the fill-empty profile that produces the
maximum quantity of processed resource at the end of the time interval. From
this algorithm, it readily follows that for a periodically oscillating
resource-availability profile, the optimal fill-empty strategy is given by a
fill period when resource is available, followed by an empty period when
resource is not. This cycling behavior is analogous to the wake-sleep cycles in
organismal life, where the generally nocturnal sleep phase is a period where
the information collected from the day's activities may be processed. The sleep
cycle is then a mechanism for the organism to process a maximal amount of
information over a daily cycle. Our model can exhibit phenomena analogous to
``microsleeps,'' and other behavior associated with breakdown in sleep
patterns.

organization of plasma membranes. However, there are some limitations to its
use. For example, it was recently observed, using numerical simulation, that
time-averaging effects inherent to the exposure time of detectors are likely to
bias the apparent motion of molecules confined in microdomains. Here, we solve
this apparently limiting issue analytically. We explore this phenomenon by
calculating its effects on the observed diffusion coefficients and domain
sizes. We demonstrate that the real parameters can be easily recovered from the
measured apparent ones. Interestingly, we find that single-molecule tracking
can be used to explore events occurring at a timescale smaller than the
exposure time.

attributed to the characteristic nontrivial symmetry $S={P}^{-1} {P}^\dagger

$T\approx 7.78\times 10^{-5}$ K and below, but not too low to lie in the
quantum reflection regime, should be automatically repelled from the surface of
a conductor without the need of an evanescent field, as in a typical atom
mirror, to counteract the van der Waals attraction. The repulsive potential
arises naturally outside the conductor and is effective at distances from the
conductor surface of about 400nm, intermediate between the van der Waals and
the Casimir-Polder regions of variation. We propose that such a field-free
reflection capability should be useful as a component in cold atom traps. It
should be practically free of undesirable field fluctuations and would be
operative at distances for which surface roughness, dissipative effects and
other finite conductivity effects should be negligibly small.
