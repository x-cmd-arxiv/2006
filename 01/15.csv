stellar populations. Here we analyse stars observed as part of surveys of local
dwarf spheroidal galaxies, but which from their kinematics are highly probable
to be non-members. The selection function -- designed to target metal-poor
giants in the dwarf galaxies, at distances of ~100kpc -- includes F-M dwarfs in
the Milky Way, at distances of up to several kpc. Thestars whose motions are
analysed here lie in the cardinal directions of Galactic longitude l ~ 270 and
l ~ 90, where the radial velocity is sensitive to the orbital rotational
velocity. We demonstrate that the faint F/G stars contain a significant
population with V_phi ~ 100km/s, similar to that found by a targeted, but
limited in areal coverage, survey of thick-disk/halo stars by Gilmore, Wyse &
Norris (2002). This value of mean orbital rotation does not match either the
canonical thick disk or the stellar halo. We argue that this population,
detected at both l ~ 270 and l ~ 90, has the expected properties of `satellite
debris' in the thick-disk/halo interface, which we interpret as remnants of the
merger that heated a pre-existing thin disk to form the thick disk.

$(m-M)_{0} = 24.291 \pm 0.014$ (random error) mag, with an additional
systematic uncertainty smaller than 2%. From our multiwavelength approach, we
find for the total (average) reddening to the IC 1613 Cepheids $E(B-V) = 0.090
\pm 0.007$ mag,which is significantly higher than the foreground reddening of
about 0.03 mag,showing the presence of appreciable dust extinction inside the

the galactic one.Our distance result agrees, within the uncertainties, with two
earlier infrared Cepheid studies in this galaxy of Macri et al. (from HST data

Cepheids), but our result has reduced the total uncertainty on the distance to
IC 1613 (relative to the LMC) to less than 3%. With distances to nearby
galaxies from Cepheid infrared photometry at this level of accuracy, which are
currently being obtained in our Araucaria Project, it seems possible to
significantly reduce the systematic uncertainty of the Hubble constant as
derived from the HST Key Project approach, by improving the calibration of the
metallicity effect on PL relation zero points, and by improving the distance
determination to the LMC.

spatial resolution. This review summarizes the major nucleosynthesis results
obtained with INTEGRAL so far. Positron annihilation in our Galaxy is being
studied in unprecented detail. SPI observations yield the first sky maps in
both the 511 keV annihilation line and the positronium continuum emission, and
the most accurate spectrum at 511 keV to date, thereby imposing new constraints
on the source(s) of Galactic positrons which still remain(s) unidentified. For
the first time, the imprint of Galactic rotation on the centroid and shape of
the 1809 keV gamma-ray line due to the decay of 26Al has been seen, confirming
the Galactic origin of this emission. SPI also provided the most accurate
determination of the gamma-ray line flux due to the decay of 60Fe. The combined
results for 26Al and 60Fe have important implications for nucleosynthesis in
massive stars, in particular Wolf-Rayet stars. Both IBIS and SPI are searching
the Galactic plane for young supernova remnants emitting the gamma-ray lines
associated with radioactive 44Ti. None have been found so far, which raises
important questions concerning the production of 44Ti in supernovae, the
Galactic supernova rate, and the Galaxy's chemical evolution.

interaction in $p$-type two-dimensional semiconductors in the presence of a
perpendicular magnetic field. For a highly confined quantum well, the system is
described by a $k$-cubic Rashba term for two-dimensional heavy holes.
  The eigenstates of the system can be described by
  Landau spinor states. First we consider the conventional spin Hall
conductivity. The contribution of the interband transitions to the
Kubo-Greenwood formula gives the density dependent intrinsic spin Hall
conductivity, which approaches its universal value $\sigma^z_{xy}=9e/8\pi$ for
weak spin-orbit coupling and low Fermi energies, in agreement with previous
work.
  However two intraband contribution terms cancel this effect leading to zero
conventional spin Hall conductivity. Adding the torque dipole contribution to
the definition of spin current, we also study the {\it effective} spin
conductivity. This is shown to be proportional to the total magnetization plus
surface terms which exactly cancel it for small spin-orbit coupling. If in low
magnetic field the intraband transitions evolve to vertex corrections, the fact
that both {effective} and conventional spin Hall conductivities vanish is
unexpected. This suggests that the zero magnetic field limit of the model is
singular.

`constants' and scalar fields are detectable on the surface of local
gravitationally-bound systems, such as planets, in non-spherically symmetric
background spacetimes. The method of matched asymptotic expansions is used to
deal with the large range of length scales that appear in the problem. We
derive a sufficient condition for the local time variation of the scalar fields
driving variations in 'constants' to track their large-scale cosmological
variation and show that this is consistent with our earlier conjecture derived
from the spherically symmetric problem. We perform our analysis with spacetime
backgrounds that are of Szekeres-Szafron type. They are approximately
Schwarzschild in some locality and free of gravitational waves everywhere. At
large distances, we assume that the spacetime matches smoothly onto a Friedmann
background universe. We conclude that, independent of the details of the
scalar-field theory describing the varying `constant', the condition for its
cosmological variations to be measured locally is almost always satisfied in
physically realistic situations. The very small differences expected to be
observed between different scales are quantified. This strengthens the proof
given in our previous paper that local experiments see global variations by
dropping the requirement of exact spherical symmetry. It provides a rigorous
justification for using terrestrial experiments and solar system observations
to constraint or detect any cosmological time variations in the traditional
`constants' of Nature in the case where non-spherical inhomogeneities exist.

matter. Rather than fixing either of them, we present a detailed study of
theoretical relationships among these quantities and cosmological parameters as
well as observational constraints in a very general formalism. In particular,
we argue that the ratio of dark matter to dark energy density depends on the
choice of these two quantities, thus providing a mechanism to change the
evolution history of the ratio from that in standard cosmology such that the
coincidence problem may be solved. We investigate this problem in detail and
construct explicit models to demonstrate that it may be alleviated provided
that the interacting term and the characteristic size of holographic bound are
appropriately specified. Furthermore, these models are well fitted with the
current observation at least in the low red-shift region.

  random phase approximation with vacuum polarization","RevTex4",,,,"nucl-th",,"  The isoscalar and isovector collective multipole excitations in stable nuclei
are studied in the framework of relativistic random-phase approximation with
the vacuum polarization arising from the nucleon-antinucleon field. A fully
self-consistent calculation which guarantees the decoupling of the spurious
state and the conservation of the multipole-transition current is carried out
by using the derivative-expansion method for the description of the vacuum
contribution. A remarkable effect of the inclusion of the vacuum polarization
is the increase of the effective mass, $m^*/m_N \sim 0.8$; for all multipole
modes, the energy-weighted sum rule values with the vacuum polarization are
smaller than those of the relativistic model without the vacuum polarization,
which typically has the effective mass $m^*/m_N \sim 0.6$. Also, the present
model can give an excellent agreement with experimental data on the excitation
energy, in particular, for the isoscalar quadrupole resonances in which it was
previously reported that the calculated energies in the relativistic model are
about 1-2 MeV above the experimental values. It is shown, further, that the
change of the shell structure due to the inclusion of the vacuum polarization
plays an important role in the improvement of the discrepancies seen in the
dipole compression modes. On the other hand, the isoscalar monopole resonance
has a similar peak whether or not the vacuum polarization is taken into
account, if the compression modulus is kept the same in the analysis.
