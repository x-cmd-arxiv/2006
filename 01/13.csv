  physics","Submitted to ApJ","Astrophys.J.649:118-128,2006","10.1086/505928",,"astro-ph",,"  We show how to place constraints on cluster physics by stacking the weak
lensing signals from multiple clusters found through the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ)
effect. For a survey that covers about 200 sq. deg. both in SZ and weak lensing
observations, the slope and amplitude of the mass vs. SZ luminosity relation
can be measured with few percent error for clusters at z~0.5. This can be used
to constrain cluster physics, such as the nature of feedback. For example, we
can distinguish a pre-heated model from a model with a decreased accretion rate
at more than 5sigma. The power to discriminate among different
non-gravitational processes in the ICM becomes even stronger if we use the
central Compton parameter y_0, which could allow one to distinguish between
models with pre-heating, SN feedback and AGN feedback, for example, at more
than 5sigma. Measurement of these scaling relations as a function of redshift
makes it possible to directly observe e.g., the evolution of the hot gas in
clusters. With this approach the mass-L_SZ relation can be calibrated and its
uncertainties can be quantified, leading to a more robust determination of
cosmological parameters from clusters surveys. The mass-L_SZ relation
calibrated in this way from a small area of the sky can be used to determine
masses of SZ clusters from very large SZ-only surveys and is nicely
complementary to other techniques proposed in the literature.

be helium and nitrogen rich. Almost all of the ~80 massive stars now known in
the central parsec (central arcsecond excluded) reside in one of two somewhat
thick (<|h|/R>~0.14) rotating disks. These stellar disks have fairly sharp
inner edges (R~1"") and surface density profiles that scale as R^{-2}. We do not

on its stellar surface density distribution and dynamics we propose that IRS
13E is an extremely dense cluster (core density > 3x10^8 sunmass/pc^3), which
has formed in the counter-clockwise disk. The stellar contents of both systems
are remarkably similar, indicating a common age of ~6+/-2 Myr. The K-band
luminosity function of the massive stars suggests a top-heavy mass function and
limits the total stellar mass contained in both disks to ~1.5x10^4 sunmass. Our
data strongly favor in situ star formation from dense gas accretion disks for
the two stellar disks. This conclusion is very clear for the clockwise disk and
highly plausible for the counter-clockwise system.

Normalized, composite spectra were derived, for abundance measurements, for the

matching samples of QSOs without absorbers in their spectra. There is clear
evidence for the presence of dust in the intervening absorbers. The 2175 A
feature is not present in the extinction curves, for any of the sub-samples.
The extinction curves are similar to the SMC extinction curve with a rising UV
extinction below 2200 A. The absorber rest frame colour excess, E(B-V), derived
from the extinction curves, depends on the absorber properties and ranges from
< 0.001 to 0.085 for various sub-samples. The column densities of several ions

similar to halo clouds in the Galaxy. Assuming an SMC gas-to-dust ratio we find
a trend of increasing abundance with decreasing extinction; systems with N_H I

strong Mg II systems seems to be mimicked by weak lines of other elements. The
ionization of the absorbers, in general appears to be low. QSOs with absorbers

understanding of various properties of quantum chromodynamics, like asymptotic
freedom and chiral symmetry restoration, which is otherwise very difficult to
prove in laboratory experiments. Strange star properties were calculated using
large $N_c$ approximation with built-in chiral symmetry restoration. A
relativistic Hartree Fock calculation was performed using the Richardson
potential as an interquark interaction. This potential has the asymptotic
freedom and a confinement-deconfinement mechanism built into it and the present
calculation employs an application of this potential with modified two scale
parameters $\Lambda$ and $\Lambda^{\prime}$, to find a new set of equations of
state for strange quark matter. The linear confinement string tension from
lattice calculations is 350 $MeV$ and the Coulomb -like part has the parameter
100 $MeV$ from deep inelastic scattering experiments. We also consider the
effect of temperature, $T$, on gluon mass in a simple way, in addition to the
usual density dependence, and find that the transition $T$ from hadronic matter
to strange matter is at 80 MeV, close to the 100 MeV estimated in litarature.
Therefore formation of strange stars may be the only signal for formation of
quark-gluon plasma with asymptotic freedom and chiral symmetry restoration and
this may be observable through many processes -such as for example through
delayed $\gamma$ ray afterglow.

appears; often all three components are present simultaneously. This 1:2:3
frequency suite is similar to what has been seen in some neutron star and black
hole X-Ray binaries, but has not previously been seen in a cataclysmic
variable. When studied in detail the fundamental and 2nd harmonic vary
similarly in phase, but the 1st harmonic behaves independently, though keeping
close to twice the frequency of the fundamental. The fundamental period of the
DNOs, as directly observed or inferred from the harmonics, increases to ~100 s
before the oscillation disappears as the star reaches quiescence. Its maximum
period is close to that of the `longer period' DNOs observed in VW Hyi. The

(RLAGNs) can cease shortly after ignition and that perhaps even a majority of
very compact sources may be short-lived phenomena because of a lack of stable
fuelling from the black hole. Thus, they can fade out before having evolved to
large, extended objects. Re-ignition of the activity in such objects is not
ruled out. With the aim of finding more examples of these objects and to
investigate if they could be RLAGNs switched off at very early stages of their
evolution, multifrequency VLBA observations of six sources with angular sizes
significantly less than an arcsecond, yet having steep spectra, have been made.
Observations were initially made at 1.65 GHz using the VLBA with the inclusion
of Effelsberg telescope. The sources were then re-observed with the VLBA at 5,
8.4 and 15.4 GHz. All the observations were carried out in a snapshot mode with
phase referencing. One of the sources studied, 0809+404, is dominated by a
compact component but also has diffuse, arcsecond-scale emission visible in VLA
images. The VLBI observations of the ""core"" structure have revealed that this
is also diffuse and fading away at higher frequencies. Thus, the inner
component of 0809+404 could be a compact fading object. The remaining five
sources presented here show either core-jet or edge-brightened double-lobed
structures indicating that they are in an active phase. The above result is an
indication that the activity of the host galaxy of 0809+404 may be
intermittent. Previous observations obtained from the literature and those
presented here indicate that activity had ceased once in the past, then
restarted, and has recently switched off again.

milli-magnitude precision photometry of bright stars (V < 9.0) with the 1-meter
Swope telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. The test targets were the main
sequence stars HD205739 and HD135446. The results show that, by placing a
concentric diaphragm in front of the aperture of the telescope, it is possible
to avoid saturation and to achieve a photometric precision of 0.0008-0.0010 mag
per data point with a cadence of less than 4 minutes. It is also possible to
reach an overall precision of less that 0.0015 mags for time series of 6 hours
or more. The photometric precision of this setup is only limited by
scintillation. Scintillation could be reduced, and therefore the photometric
precision could be further improved, by using a neutral density filter instead
of the aperture stop. Given that the expected median depth of extrasolar planet
transits of about 0.01 mags, and their typical duration of several hours, the
results of this paper show that 1-m telescopes equipped with standard CCDs can
be used to detect planet transits as shallow as 0.002 mags around bright stars.

that the excessive flux from the Outer Galaxy can be due to the location of the

superfluidity become identical, while a spin gap and a gap against the
formation of phase slips are formed. As a result of these gaps, charge density
wave correlations decay exponentially in contrast with the phases where only
bosons or only fermions are present. We find a Luther-Emery point where the
phase slips and the spin excitations can be described in terms of
pseudofermions. This allows us to provide closed form expressions of the
density-density correlations and the spectral functions. The spectral functions
of the fermions are gapped, whereas the spectral functions of the bosons remain
gapless. The application of a magnetic field results in a loss of coherence
between the bosons and the fermion and the disappearance of the gap. Changing
the detuning has no effect on the gap until either the fermion or the boson
density is reduced to zero. Finally, we discuss the formation of a Mott

associated with the emergence of non-Fermi liquid properties, $R_H$ is
anomalously enhanced. We found that the restoration of the Fermi liquid state
with applied pressure leads to a gradual suppression of this dramatic
enhancement. Moreover, the enhancement in $R_H$ was found to be confined to an
intermediate temperature window, where inelastic electron-electron scattering
is dominant. Our results strongly support the presence of cold and hot spots on
the Fermi surface probably due to anisotropic scattering by antiferromagnetic
fluctuations, which may also prove relevant for the debate on the anomalous
normal-state properties of high-$T_c$ cuprates.

considerations. A large variety of interface critical behavior is obtained
which is checked numerically on the example of two-dimensional q-state Potts
models with q=2 to 4. Weak interface couplings are generally irrelevant,
resulting in the same critical behavior at the interface as for a free surface.
With strong interface couplings, the interface remains ordered at the bulk
transition temperature. More interesting is the intermediate situation, the
special interface transition, when the critical behavior at the interface
involves new critical exponents, which however can be expressed in terms of the
bulk and surface exponents of the two subsystems. We discuss also the smooth or

still carry a fraction $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$ of their failure load. The value
of $\alpha$ interpolates between the perfectly brittle failure $(\alpha = 0)$
and perfectly plastic behavior $(\alpha=1)$ of fibers. We show that the finite
load bearing capacity of broken fibers has a substantial effect on the failure
process of the bundle. In the case of global load sharing it is found that for
$\alpha \to 1$ the macroscopic response of the bundle becomes perfectly plastic
with a yield stress equal to the average fiber strength. On the microlevel, the
size distribution of avalanches has a crossover from a power law of exponent
$\approx 2.5$ to a faster exponential decay. For localized load sharing,
computer simulations revealed a sharp transition at a well defined value
$\alpha_c$ from a phase where macroscopic failure occurs due to localization as
a consequence of local stress enhancements, to another one where the disordered
fiber strength dominates the damage process. Analysing the microstructure of
damage, the transition proved to be analogous to percolation. At the critical
point $\alpha_c$, the spanning cluster of damage is found to be compact with a
fractal boundary. The distribution of bursts of fiber breakings shows a power
law behaviour with a universal exponent $\approx 1.5$ equal to the mean field
exponent of fiber bundles of critical strength distributions. The model can be
relevant to understand the shear failure of glued interfaces where failed
regions can still transmit load by remaining in contact.

The optimization is a trade off between accurately fitting the data and
avoiding too many frequency changes; this way the analysis is able to find fits
which ignore the noise. Classical dynamic programming algorithms are limited by
memory and efficiency requirements, which can be a problem when dealing with
long streams. This suggests to explore alternative search methods which allow
for some degree of uncertainty to achieve tractability. Experiments have shown
that the designed evolutionary algorithm is able to reach the same solution

of these particles. Previous analysis by other authors were done at collider
energies equal to the new gauge boson mass $M_{A_H}$. In this paper we show
that asymmetries in fermion anti-fermion production can display model
differences in the case $M_{A_H} > \sqrt{s}$. For $M_{A_H} < \sqrt{s}$ we show
that the hard photon energy distribution in $e^+ + e^- \lra \gamma + f + \bar
f$ can present a model dependence. New bounds for the new neutral gauge boson
masses are also presented.

specific texture of lepton mass matrices with vanishing (1,1) elements:
$\tan\theta_l = \sqrt{m_e/m_\mu}$ and $\tan\theta_\nu = \sqrt{m_1/m_2}$. The
latter relation, together with solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillation data,
predicts 0.0030 eV $\lesssim m_1 \lesssim$ 0.0073 eV, 0.009 eV $\lesssim m_2

regularized and finite for black hole geometries in diverse situations. Black

ill-conditioned matrices $A$ is to use variational regularization. This leads
to solving the equation $(A^*A+aI)u=A^*f_\d$, where $a$ is a regularization
parameter, and $f_\d$ are noisy data, $||f-f_\d||\leq \d$. Numerically it
requires to calculate products of matrices $A^*A$ and inversion of the matrix
$A^*A+aI$ which is also ill-conditioned if $a>0$ is small. We propose a new
method for solving (*) stably, given noisy data $f_\d$. This method, the DSM
(Dynamical Systems Method) is developed in this paper for selfadjoint $A$. It
consists in solving a Cauchy problem for systems of ordinary differential
equations.

acceleration dependent (radiation) terms into the resultant magnetic field.

conceived for an idealized magnetic dipole. The use of multi-section antennas
is fully justified by a substantial rise of the ratio of bound-to-radiation
field strength. Finally, we effected numerical calculations taking into account
particular experimental settings and compared them with experimentally obtained
data that unambiguously indicate on the non-applicability of the standard
retardation condition to bound magnetic fields. In addition, experimental
observations show a striking coincidence with the predictions of a new

prevent a rear-end collision. To this end, the ACC sensors detect and track the
vehicle ahead for measuring the actual distance and speed difference. Together
with the own velocity, these input variables are exactly the same as in
car-following models. The focus of this contribution is: What will be the
impact of a spreading of ACC systems on the traffic dynamics? Do automated
driving strategies have the potential to improve the capacity and stability of
traffic flow or will they necessarily increase the heterogeneity and
instability? How does the result depend on the ACC equipment level?
  We discuss microscopic modeling aspects for human and automated (ACC)
driving. By means of microscopic traffic simulations, we study how a variable
percentage of ACC-equipped vehicles influences the stability of traffic flow,
the maximum flow under free traffic conditions until traffic breaks down, and
the dynamic capacity of congested traffic. Furthermore, we compare different
percentages of ACC with respect to travel times in a specific congestion
scenario. Remarkably, we find that already a small amount of ACC equipped cars
and, hence, a marginally increased free and dynamic capacity, leads to a
drastic reduction of traffic congestion.

distant phylogenetic relationships and for predicting protein functions.
Estimating the rate matrix of residue substitutions from amino acid sequences
is also important because the rate matrix can be used to develop scoring
matrices for sequence alignment. Here we use a continuous time Markov process
to model the substitution rates of residues and develop a Bayesian Markov chain
Monte Carlo method for rate estimation. We validate our method using simulated
artificial protein sequences. Because different local regions such as binding
surfaces and the protein interior core experience different selection pressures
due to functional or stability constraints, we use our method to estimate the
substitution rates of local regions. Our results show that the substitution
rates are very different for residues in the buried core and residues on the
solvent exposed surfaces. In addition, the rest of the proteins on the binding
surfaces also have very different substitution rates from residues. Based on
these findings, we further develop a method for protein function prediction by
surface matching using scoring matrices derived from estimated substitution
rates for residues located on the binding surfaces. We show with examples that
our method is effective in identifying functionally related proteins that have
overall low sequence identity, a task known to be very challenging.

lifetime of stored energy or stored probability escaping through both ends of
the barrier. Because it is a lifetime associated with both forward
(transmitted) and backward (reflected) fluxes, it cannot be used to define a
group velocity for forward transit in cases where a wavepacket is mostly
reflected. For photonic tunneling barriers the group delay is identical to the
dwell time which is also a property of an entire wave function with reflected
and transmitted components. Theoretical predictions and experimental reports of
superluminal group velocities in barrier tunneling are re-interpreted.

photon-pairs with improved quality and efficiency, which has been integrated
with off-the-shelf telecom components and is, therefore, well suited for
quantum communication applications in the 1550 nm telecom band. Polarization
entanglement is produced by simultaneously pumping a loop of standard
dispersion-shifted fiber with two orthogonally-polarized pump pulses, one
propagating in the clockwise and the other in the counter-clockwise direction.
We characterize this source by investigating two-photon interference between
the generated signal-idler photon-pairs under various conditions. The
experimental parameters are carefully optimized to maximize the generated
photon-pair correlation and to minimize contamination of the entangled
photon-pairs from extraneously scattered background photons that are produced
by the pump pulses for two reasons: i) spontaneous Raman scattering causes
uncorrelated photons to be emitted in the signal/idler bands and ii) broadening
of the pump-pulse spectrum due to self-phase modulation causes pump photons to
leak into the signal/idler bands. We obtain two-photon interference with
visibility $>90$% without subtracting counts caused by the background photons
(only dark counts of the detectors are subtracted), when the mean photon number
in the signal (idler) channel is about 0.02/pulse, while no interference is
observed in direct detection of either the signal or the idler photons.

surprisingly harder than the classical counterpart. A typical example is
cloning; making a copy of digital information is straightforward but it is not
possible exactly for quantum information. The question in this paper is whether
or not quantum network coding is possible. Its classical counterpart is another
good example to show that digital information flow can be done much more
efficiently than conventional (say, liquid) flow.
  Our answer to the question is similar to the case of cloning, namely, it is
shown that quantum network coding is possible if approximation is allowed, by
using a simple network model called Butterfly. In this network, there are two
flow paths, s_1 to t_1 and s_2 to t_2, which shares a single bottleneck channel
of capacity one. In the classical case, we can send two bits simultaneously,
one for each path, in spite of the bottleneck. Our results for quantum network
coding include: (i) We can send any quantum state |psi_1> from s_1 to t_1 and
|psi_2> from s_2 to t_2 simultaneously with a fidelity strictly greater than
1/2. (ii) If one of |psi_1> and |psi_2> is classical, then the fidelity can be
improved to 2/3. (iii) Similar improvement is also possible if |psi_1> and
|psi_2> are restricted to only a finite number of (previously known) states.
(iv) Several impossibility results including the general upper bound of the
fidelity are also given.
