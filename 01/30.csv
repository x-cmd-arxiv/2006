accretion discs, by taking proper account of the thermal properties of the
disc. Because the degree of variability in the King et al. (2004) model depends
sensitively on the ratio of disc thickness to radius, H/R, it is important to
follow the time-dependence of the local disc structure as the variability
proceeds. In common with previous authors, we develop a one-zone model for the
local disc structure. We agree that radial heat advection plays an important
role in determining the inner disc structure, and also find limit-cycle
behaviour. When the stochastic magnetic dynamo model of King et al. (2004) is
added to these models, we find similar variability behaviour to before.
  We are now better placed to put physical constraints on model parameters. In
particular, we find that in order to be consistent with the low degree of
variability seen in the thermal disc component of black hole binaries, we need
to limit the energy density of the poloidal field that can be produced by local
dynamo cells in the disc to less than a few percent of the energy density of
the dynamo field within the disc itself.

result is that the Cl0024 galaxies are marginally underluminous (0.50 +/- 0.23
mag), given their rotation velocities, as compared to the local Tully-Fisher

systematic differences between local and distant velocity and luminosity
measurements. Our result is particularly striking considering the Cl0024
members have very strong emission lines, and local galaxies with similar Halpha
equivalent widths tend to be overluminous on the Tully-Fisher relation. Cl0024
Tully-Fisher residuals appear to be correlated most strongly with galaxy
rotation velocities, indicating a possible change in the slope of the
Tully-Fisher relation. However, we caution that this result may be strongly

However, if the intrinsic SNeIa magnitude dispersion is unknown one needs an
even higher number of SNeIa (an order of magnitude more) to reach a similar
level of statistical significance. Moreover, the ability to separate the
lensing contribution from the intrinsic scatter depends sensitively on the
amplitude of the latter. Using a Kolmogorov - Smirnov (K-S) test we check how
the required number of SNeIa changes with level of significance. Our model
incorporates a completely analytical description of weak lensing which has been
tested extensively against numerical simulations. Thus, future missions such as
SNAP may be able to detect non-Gaussianity at a lower significance level of 10%
(through the K-S test) only if the intrinsic scatter is known from external
data (e.g. from low redshift observations) whereas ALPACA with 100,000 SNe will
definitely detect non-Gaussianity with a very high confidence even if the
intrinsic magnitude dispersion is not known a priori.

and were characterized by very high velocities in the Ca II H and K lines, but
very low velocities in the Si II 6355 A line. The optical photometry showed a
slow rise to peak brightness but, quite peculiarly, was followed by a more
rapid decline from maximum. Thus, the B- and V-band light curves cannot be
characterized by a single stretch factor. We argue that the best measure of the
nature of this object is not the decline rate parameter Delta m_15 (B). The B-V
colors were unusual from 30 to 90 days after maximum light in that they evolved
to bluer values at a much slower rate than normal Type Ia supernovae. The

The energy feedback from AGN acts effectively only in massive galaxies when
supermassive black holes have been formed in the central bulges. Compared with
previous models without black hole formation, our model predicts more massive
and luminous galaxies at high redshift, agreeing with the observations of K20
up to $z\sim 3$. Also the predicted stellar mass density from massive galaxies
agrees with the observations of GDDS. Because of the energy feedback from AGN,
the formation of new stars is stopped in massive galaxies with the termination
of gas cooling and these galaxies soon become red with color $R-K>$5 (Vega
magnitude), comparable to the Extremely Red Objects (EROs) observed at redshift
$z\sim$1-2. Still the predicted number density of very EROs is lower than
observed at $z\sim 2$, and it may be related to inadequate descriptions of dust
extinction, star formation history and AGN feedback in those luminous galaxies.

explains why we can still observe the primary star in the UV despite the large
optical extinction -- it is due to the presence of an intrinsic coronagraph in
the Eta Carinae system, and to the extension of the UV emitting region. It is
not due to peculiar dust properties alone. We have computed the spectrum of the
purported companion star, and show that it could only be directly detected in
the UV spectrum preferentially in the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer
(FUSE) spectral region (912-1175 Ang.). However, we find no direct evidence for
a companion star, with the properties indicated by X-ray studies and studies of
the Weigelt blobs, in UV spectra. This might be due to reprocessing of the
companion's light by the dense stellar wind of the primary. Broad FeII and
[FeII] emission lines, which form in the stellar wind, are detected in spectra
taken in the SE lobe, 0.2"" from the central star. The wind spectrum shows some
similarities to the spectra of the B & D Weigelt blobs, but also shows some
marked differences in that high excitation lines, and lines pumped by Ly-alpha,

be semipositive and finite. Susceptibilities are known to be related to the
fluctuations of extensive observable quantities. This relation becomes
nontrivial, when the operator of an observable quantity is represented as a sum
of operators corresponding to the extensive system parts. The association of
the dispersions of the partial operator terms with the total dispersion is
analyzed. A special attention is paid to the dependence of dispersions on the
total number of particles N in the thermodynamic limit. An operator dispersion
is called thermodynamically normal, if it is proportional to N at large values
of the latter. While, if the dispersion is proportional to a higher power of N,
it is termed thermodynamically anomalous. The following theorem is proved: The
global dispersion of a composite operator, which is a sum of linearly
independent self-adjoint terms, is thermodynamically anomalous if and only if
at least one of the partial dispersions is anomalous, the power of N in the
global dispersion being defined by the largest partial dispersion. Conversely,
the global dispersion is thermodynamically normal if and only if all partial
dispersions are normal. The application of the theorem is illustrated by
several examples of statistical systems. The notion of representative ensembles
is formulated. The relation between the stability and equivalence of
statistical ensembles is discussed.

increases the magnetic susceptibility and it becomes ferromagnetic in

phenomenon, performing in additional nonlinear cavity (NC). The NC is installed
in the output of interferometer before photodetector, so that optical signal
emerging interferometer incidents on the NC and passes through it. Under
appropriate circumstances a specific transformation of noisy signal inside the
NC takes place, which results in the increase of output signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR). As a result optical noisy signal of interferometer becomes less noisy
after passing through the NC. The improvement of SNR is especially effective in
bistable NC for wideband (several hundreds Hz) detection, when chirp GW signal
is detected. Then SNR gain reaches amount ~ 10. When detection bandwidth is
narrowed, the influence of SR mechanism gradually disappears, and SNR gain
tends to 1. SNR gain also tends to 1 when the NC is gradually transformed to
linear cavity. Proposed enhancement of SNR due to the SR is not dependent of
noise type, which is prevalent in interferometer. Particularly proposed
approach is capable to increase signal-to-displacement noise ratio.

integrating out N quarks. The model is a caricature of 2d QCD coupled to
adjoint scalars, which are the transversely polarized gluons in a dimensional
reduction. nu is a dimensionless ratio of quark mass to coupling constant. The
model interpolates between gluons in the vacuum (nu=infinity), gluons weakly
coupled to heavy quarks (large nu) and strongly coupled to light quarks in a
baryon (nu to 0). It's solution in the large-N limit exhibits a phase
transition from a weakly coupled 1-cut phase to a strongly coupled 2-cut phase

discontinuous in their third and second derivatives at nu_c. The transition to

The
setup is strongly asymmetric, with only one black hole in the bulk. The
radiation emitted by this bulk black hole can be reflected, absorbed or
transmitted through the brane. Radiation pressure accelerates the brane,
behaving as dark energy. Absorption however generates a competing effect: the
brane becomes heavier and gravitational attraction increases. We analyse the
model numerically, assuming a total absorbtion on the brane for k=1. We
conclude that due to the two competing effects, in this asymmetric scenario the
Hawking radiation from the bulk black hole is not able to change the
recollapsing fate of this brane-world universe. We show that for light branes
and early times the radiation pressure is the dominant effect. In contrast, for
heavy branes the self-gravity of the absorbed radiation is a much stronger
effect. We find the critical value of the initial energy density for which
these two effects roughly cancel each other.

is also shown that in $3+1$-dimensions these dualities are only possible for
