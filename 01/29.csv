the VLA at five frequencies between 1.365 and 5 GHz with resolutions between
1.5 and 45 arcsec FWHM. Within 15 arcsec of the nucleus, the spectral index of
the jets is 0.61. Further from the nucleus, the spectrum is flatter, with
significant transverse structure. Between 15 and 70 arcsec from the nucleus,
the spectral index varies from 0.55 on-axis to 0.44 at the edge. This spectral
structure suggests a change of dominant particle acceleration mechanism with
distance from the nucleus and the transverse gradient may be associated with
shear in the jet velocity field. Further from the nucleus, the spectral index
has a constant value of 0.47. We derive the distribution of Faraday rotation
over the inner +/-400 arcsec of the radio source and show that it has three
components: a constant term, a linear gradient (both probably due to our
Galaxy) and residual fluctuations at the level of 1 - 2 rad/m^2. These residual
fluctuations are smaller in the brighter (approaching) jet, consistent with the
idea that they are produced by magnetic fields in a halo of hot plasma that
surrounds the radio source. We model this halo, deriving a core radius of
approximately 225 arcsec and constraining its central density and
magnetic-field strength. We also image the apparent magnetic-field structure
over the first +/-200 arcsec from the nucleus.

supermassive compact object in the Galaxy centre relates to a class of objects
without event horizon are examined. The possibility of the existence of such
objects was substantiated by the author earlier. It is shown that accretion of
a surrounding gas can cause nuclear combustion in the surface layer which, as a
result of comptonization of the superincumbent hotter layer, may give a
contribution to the observed Sgr A* radiation in the range $10^{15} \div
10^{20} Hz$.
  It is found a contribution of the possible proper magnetic moment of the
object to the observed synchrotron radiation on the basis of Boltzmann's
equation for photons which takes into account the influence of gravity to their
motion and frequency. We arrive at the conclusion that the hypothesis of the
existence in the Galaxy centre of the object with such extraordinary
gravitational properties at least does not contradict observations.

  differential equations","Revised",,,,"math.DS math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Constructing discrete models of stochastic partial differential equations is
very delicate. Stochastic centre manifold theory provides novel support for
coarse grained, macroscale, spatial discretisations of nonlinear stochastic
partial differential or difference equations such as the example of the
stochastically forced Burgers' equation. Dividing the physical domain into
finite length overlapping elements empowers the approach to resolve fully
coupled dynamical interactions between neighbouring elements. The crucial
aspect of this approach is that the underlying theory organises the resolution
of the vast multitude of subgrid microscale noise processes interacting via the
nonlinear dynamics within and between neighbouring elements. Noise processes
with coarse structure across a finite element are the most significant noises
for the discrete model. Their influence also diffuses away to weakly correlate
the noise in the spatial discretisation. Nonlinear interactions have two
further consequences: additive forcing generates multiplicative noise in the
discretisation; and effectively new noise processes appear in the macroscale
discretisation. The techniques and theory developed here may be applied to
soundly discretise many dissipative stochastic partial differential and
difference equations.

generalized models. In these models the processes that are taken into account
are not restricted to specific functional forms. Therefore a single generalized
models can describe a class of systems which share a similar structure. Despite
this generality, the proposed approach allows us to study the dynamical
properties of generalized models efficiently in the framework of local
bifurcation theory. The approach is based on a normalization procedure that is
used to identify natural parameters of the system. The Jacobian in a steady
state is then derived as a function of these parameters. The analytical
computation of local bifurcations using computer algebra reveals conditions for
the local asymptotic stability of steady states and provides certain insights
on the global dynamics of the system. The proposed approach yields a close
connection between modelling and nonlinear dynamics. We illustrate the
investigation of generalized models by considering examples from three
different disciplines of science: a socio-economic model of dynastic cycles in
china, a model for a coupled laser system and a general ecological food web.

applications such as optical switches and solar rocket assist. The micro-balls
are covered with a thin spherical shell of lubricating liquid so that they are

method and apparatus are presented for producing the preferred embodiment of a
close-packed monolayer of the array of mirrored micro-balls.

pathways, whereas the 'new view' sees protein folding as a highly parallel
stochastic process on funnel-shaped energy landscapes. We have analyzed
parallel and sequential processes on a large number of Molecular Dynamics
unfolding trajectories of the protein CI2 at high temperatures. Using rigorous
statistical measures, we quantify the degree of sequentiality on two structural
levels. The unfolding process is highly parallel on the microstructural level
of individual contacts. On a coarser, macrostructural level of contact
clusters, characteristic parallel and sequential events emerge. These
characteristic events can be understood from loop-closure dependencies between
the contact clusters. A correlation analysis of the unfolding times of the
contacts reveals a high degree of substructural cooperativity within the
contact clusters.

  predicts the folding rates of two-state proteins with and without crosslinks","13 pages, 2 tables, and 2 figures",,,,"q-bio.BM cond-mat.soft",,"  The folding rates of two-state proteins have been found to correlate with
simple measures of native-state topology. The most prominent among these
measures is the relative contact order (CO), which is the average CO or
'localness' of all contacts in the native protein structure, divided by the
chain length. Here, we test whether such measures can be generalized to capture
the effect of chain crosslinks on the folding rate. Crosslinks change the chain
connectivity and therefore also the localness of some of the the native
contacts. These changes in localness can be taken into account by the
graph-theoretical concept of effective contact order (ECO). The relative ECO,
however, the natural extension of the relative CO for proteins with crosslinks,
overestimates the changes in the folding rates caused by crosslinks. We suggest
here a novel measure of native-state topology, the relative logCO, and its
natural extension, the relative logECO. The relative logCO is the average value
for the logarithm of the CO of all contacts, divided by the logarithm of the
chain length. The relative log(E)CO reproduces the folding rates of a set of 26
two-state proteins without crosslinks with essentially the same high
correlation coefficient as the relative CO. In addition, it also captures the
folding rates of 8 two-state proteins with crosslinks.

""run-and-tumble"" strategy in response to environmental cues. Here we derive
macroscopic equations for the more complex type of behavioral response
characteristic of crawling cells, which detect a signal, extract directional
information from a scalar concentration field, and change their motile behavior
accordingly. We present several models of increasing complexity for which the
derivation of population-level equations is possible, and we show how
experimentally-measured statistics can be obtained from the transport equation
formalism. We also show that amoeboid cells that do not adapt to constant
signals can still aggregate in steady gradients, but not in response to
periodic waves. This is in contrast to the case of cells that use a
""run-and-tumble"" strategy, where adaptation is essential.

of charged superfluids is considered. One example of such a ""charged
superfluid"" consists of a pair of Planck-mass-scale, ultracold ""Millikan oil

drop is replaced by superfluid helium. When levitated in a magnetic trap, and
subjected to microwave-frequency electromagnetic radiation, a pair of such
""Millikan oil drops"" separated by a microwave wavelength can become an
efficient quantum transducer between quadrupolar electromagnetic and
gravitational radiation. This leads to the possibility of a Hertz-like
experiment, in which the source of microwave-frequency gravitational radiation
consists of one pair of ""Millikan oil drops"" driven by microwaves, and the
receiver of such radiation consists of another pair of ""Millikan oil drops"" in
the far field driven by the gravitational radiation generated by the first
pair. The second pair then back-converts the gravitional radiation into
detectable microwaves. The enormous enhancement of the conversion efficiency
for these quantum transducers over that for electrons arises from the fact that
there exists macroscopic quantum phase coherence in these charged superfluid
systems.

intense laser light, or generation of high order harmonics from molecules.
Starting from the first quantum mechanical principles, we derive an appropriate
molecular Hamiltonian suitable for description of the center of mass,
rotational, vibrational and electronic molecular motions driven by the field
within the electric dipole approximation. Consequently, the concept of the
Born-Oppenheimer separation between the electronic and the nuclear degrees of
freedom in the presence of an electromagnetic field is introduced. Special
cases of the dc/ac field limits are then discussed separately. Finally, we
consider a perturbative regime of a weak dc/ac field, and obtain simple
analytic formulas for the associated Born-Oppenheimer
translational/rotational/vibrational molecular Hamiltonian.
