a single year of observation of their gravitational waves can measure the

coupled to feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs), as predicted by Dekel &
Birnboim (2006). After a critical epoch z=3, only haloes below a critical
shock-heating mass 10^12MSun enjoy gas supply by cold flows and form stars,
while cooling and star formation are shut down abruptly above this mass. The
shock-heated gas is kept hot because being dilute it is vulnerable to feedback
from energetic sources such as AGNs in their self-regulated mode. The shutdown
explains in detail the bright-end truncation of the blue sequence at ~L*, the
appearance of luminous red-and-dead galaxies on the red sequence starting
already at z~2, the colour bimodality, its strong dependence on environment
density and its correlations with morphology and other galaxy properties.
Before z~2-3, even haloes above the shock-heating mass form stars by cold
streams penetrating through the hot gas. This explains the bright star-forming

intrinsic difficulties and uncertainties. Moreover, observations of these lines

Uncertainties in inclination and extinction and the effects of star formation
on the luminosity can be accounted for. The largest remaining uncertainty is
the line width / rotation curve velocity measurement. We show that high
resolution, excellent seeing integral field spectroscopy will improve the

replace the dense core of the newly formed neutron star (NS) by a contracting
inner grid boundary, and trigger neutrino-driven explosions by systematically
varying the neutrino fluxes emitted at this boundary. Confirming more idealized
studies as well as supernova simulations with spectral transport, we find that
random seed perturbations can grow by hydrodynamic instabilities to a globally
asymmetric mass distribution, leading to a dominance of dipole (l=1) and
quadrupole (l=2) modes in the explosion ejecta. Anisotropic gravitational and
hydrodynamic forces are found to accelerate the NS on a timescale of 2-3
seconds. Since the explosion anisotropies develop chaotically, the magnitude of
the corresponding kick varies stochastically in response to small differences
in the fluid flow. Our more than 70 models separate into two groups, one with
high and the other with low NS velocities and accelerations after 1s of
post-bounce evolution, depending on whether the l=1 mode is dominant in the
ejecta or not. This leads to a bimodality of the distribution when the NS
velocities are extrapolated to their terminal values. The fast group has an
average velocity of about 500 km/s and peak values in excess of 1000 km/s.
Establishing a link to the measured distribution of pulsar velocities, however,
requires a much larger set of calculations and ultimately 3D modeling.

nearby AGNs based on emission-line reverberation mapping. The mass-scaling
relationship based on the Hbeta line luminosity allows mass estimates for
low-redshift sources with strong contamination of the optical continuum
luminosity by stellar or non-thermal emission, while that based on the C IV

dispersion (as opposed to the FWHM) can be reliably determined. We estimate

the tongue and tail as delineating the termination shock and the post-shock

physical association between G189.22+2.90 and IC 443. We resolve the stand-off
distance between the star and the head of the bow shock, which allows us to
estimate a space velocity for the neutron star of ~230 km/s, independent of

Language (IDL). The functional form of the kernel can be varied (top-hat,
Gaussian etc.) to allow different weighting of the event counts registered
within the smoothing region. For each individual pixel the algorithm increases
the smoothing scale until the signal-to-noise ratio (s.n.r.) within the kernel
reaches a preset value. Thus, noise is suppressed very efficiently, while at
the same time real structure, i.e. signal that is locally significant at the
selected s.n.r. level, is preserved on all scales. In particular, extended
features in noise-dominated regions are visually enhanced. The ASMOOTH
algorithm differs from other AKS routines in that it allows a quantitative
assessment of the goodness of the local signal estimation by producing
adaptively smoothed images in which all pixel values share the same
signal-to-noise ratio above the background.
  We apply ASMOOTH to both real observational data (an X-ray image of clusters

using the framework of non-equilibrium surface growth. When the communication
topology mimics that of the short-range interacting underlying system, the
virtual time horizon exhibits Kardar-Parisi-Zhang-like kinetic roughening.
Although the virtual times, on average, progress at a nonzero rate, their
statistical spread diverges with the number of processing elements, hindering
efficient data collection. We show that when the synchronization topology is
extended to include quenched random communication links (small-world links)
between the processing elements, they make a close-to-uniform progress with a
nonzero rate, without global synchronization. We also provide a coarse-grained

molecules weakly coupled to one ferromagnetic and one nonmagnetic lead. We find
that the current is suppressed over wide voltage ranges due to spin blockade.
In this system, spin blockade is associated with successive spin flips of the
molecular spins and depends on the anisotropy energy barrier. This leads to the
appearance of a window of bias voltages between the Coulomb blockade and spin
blockade regimes where the current is large and to negative differential
conductance at low temperatures. Remarkably, negative differential conductance
is also present close to room temperature. Spin-blockade behavior is
accompanied by super-Poissonian shot noise, like in nonmagnetic quantum dots.
Finally, we show that the charge transmitted through the molecule between
initial preparation in a certain spin state and infinite time very strongly
depends on the initial spin state in certain parameter ranges. Thus the
molecule can act as a spin-charge converter, an effect potentially useful as a
read-out mechanism for molecular spintronics.

  (2005)",,,"cs.RO",,"  There is a belief that complexity and chaos are essential for adaptability.
But life deals with complexity every moment, without the chaos that engineers
fear so, by invoking goal-directed behaviour. Goals can be programmed. That is
why living organisms give us hope to achieve adaptability in robots. In this
paper a method for the description of a goal-directed, or programmed,
behaviour, interacting with uncertainty of environment, is described. We
suggest reducing the structural (goals, intentions) and stochastic components
(probability to realise the goal) of individual behaviour to random variables
with nominal values to apply probabilistic approach. This allowed us to use a
Normalized Entropy Index to detect the system state by estimating the
contribution of each agent to the group behaviour. The number of possible group
states is 27. We argue that adaptation has a limited number of possible paths
between these 27 states. Paths and states can be programmed so that after
adjustment to any particular case of task and conditions, adaptability will
never involve chaos. We suggest the application of the model to operation of
robots or other devices in remote and/or dangerous places.

  (2005)",,,"cs.RO",,"  This paper presents a new concept of a mobile robot speed control by using
two degree of freedom gear transmission. The developed intelligent speed
controller utilizes a gear box which comprises of epicyclic gear train with two
inputs, one coupled with the engine shaft and another with the shaft of a
variable speed dc motor. The net output speed is a combination of the two input
speeds and is governed by the transmission ratio of the planetary gear train.
This new approach eliminates the use of a torque converter which is otherwise
an indispensable part of all available automatic transmissions, thereby
reducing the power loss that occurs in the box during the fluid coupling. By
gradually varying the speed of the dc motor a stepless transmission has been
achieved. The other advantages of the developed controller are pulling over and
reversing the vehicle, implemented by intelligent mixing of the dc motor and
engine speeds. This approach eliminates traditional braking system in entire
vehicle design. The use of two power sources, IC engine and battery driven DC
motor, utilizes the modern idea of hybrid vehicles. The new mobile robot speed
controller is capable of driving the vehicle even in extreme case of IC engine
failure, for example, due to gas depletion.

can be written in a Post-Post-Newtonian (PPN) framework: i.e., the metric is
static and spherically symmetric, and can be written as a Taylor series in m/r,
where m is the gravitational radius of the compact object. Working invariantly,
we compute corrections to standard weak-deflection lensing observables at first
and second order in the ratio of the angular gravitational radius to the
angular Einstein ring radius of the lens. We show that the first-order
corrections to the total magnification and centroid position vanish universally
for gravity theories that can be written in the PPN framework. This arises from
some surprising, fundamental relations among the lensing observables in PPN
gravity models. We derive these relations for the image positions,
magnifications, and time delays. A deep consequence is that any violation of
the universal relations would signal the need for a gravity model outside the
PPN framework (provided that some basic assumptions hold). In practical terms,
the relations will guide observational programs to test general relativity,
modified gravity theories, and possibly the Cosmic Censorship conjecture. We
use the new relations to identify lensing observables that are accessible to
current or near-future technology, and to find combinations of observables that
are most useful for probing the spacetime metric. We give explicit applications
to the Galactic black hole, microlensing, and the binary pulsar J0737-3039.

are generically suppressed by the Planck scale, as expected. However, for a
modified brane spectrum possessing enhanced symmetry, production can be finite
and significant. We stress that this effect could not be anticipated given only
a knowledge of the low-energy effective theory. Once on-shell, inclusion of
these states leads to an attractive force pulling the dilaton towards a fixed
point of S-duality, namely $g_s=1$. Although the SUGRA description breaks down
in this regime, inclusion of the enhanced states suggests that the center of

conceptual problems arise that are the subject of this paper. Confinement
arises through averaging of phase factors which are gauge-group center elements
raised to the power of the Gauss linking numbers of vortices. The simplest
approach to confinement counts this link number by counting the number of
vortices, considered in d=3 as infinitely-long closed self-avoiding random
walks on a cubical lattice, piercing any surface spanning the Wilson loop. A
given vortex, however, may pierce the spanning surface multiply with a link
number smaller than the number of piercings. We call such vortices inert
(although they may be only partially-inert). We estimate the dilution factor
from inert vortices that reduces the ratio of fundamental string tension to
vortex areal piercing density as roughly 0.6. Next we show how inert vortices
resolve the old problem that the link number of a given vortex configuration is
the same for any choice of spanning surface, yet only one such surface appears
in the Wilson loop expectation value. Third, we discuss semi- quantitatively a
configuration of two distinct Wilson loops separated by a variable distance,
and show how inert vortices govern the transition between two allowed forms of
the area law, one at small separation and one at large. The result is a
finite-range Van der Waals force between the loops. Finally, in a problem
related to the double-loop problem, we argue that inert vortices do not affect
the fact that in the SU(3) baryonic area law, the mesonic string tension
appears.

case of one degree of freedom nonlinear oscillator with non symmetric
potential. We propose an efficient method of chaos control stabilizing these
orbits by a pulsive feedback technique. Discrete set of pulses enable us to
transfer the system from one periodic state to another.

  includes lightning (NLDN) data",,,,"physics.ao-ph",,"  During the afternoon of 15 June 2005, convective storms developed along and
west of the dryline over eastern Colorado and New Mexico. One such storm
tracked eastward into Cimarron County, Oklahoma and produced a strong downburst
at Kenton. The dryline, as it tracked eastward over the western Oklahoma
Panhandle, established favorable conditions for hybrid microbursts by enhancing
vertical circulation west of the dryline and hence, the depth of the convective
boundary layer (CBL). Prior to convective initiation, the Geostationary
Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) Hybrid Microburst Index (HMI) and
Wet Microburst Severity Index (WMSI) products indicated elevated values over
the western Oklahoma Panhandle. In addition, lightning data imagery, from the
National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN), was compared to radar and
satellite imagery and surface observations of downburst winds. It was observed
that suppressed cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning flash rates accompanied
downburst occurrence with this storm. This paper will examine the environmental
factors that resulted in downburst generation and associated storm
electrification. Use of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite
(GOES) Wet Microburst Severity Index (WMSI) and Hybrid Microburst Index (HMI)
products will be highlighted to demonstrate effectiveness in the assessment of
downburst potential. Radar reflectivity and NLDN imagery will be presented to
describe convective morphology and electrical behavior with this dryline
convective storm event.

  left-handed materials","11 Pages. 4 Figures",,,,"physics.optics",,"  We show that the finite-difference frequency-domain method is well-suited to
study subwavelength lensing effects in left-handed materials (LHM's) and
related problems. The method is efficient and works in the frequency domain,
eliminating the need for specifying dispersion models for the permeability and
permittivity as required by the popular finite-difference time-domain method.
We show that ""superlensing"" in a LHM slab with refractive index n = -1 can be
approached by introducing an arbitrarily small loss term. We also study a thin
silver slab, which can exhibit subwavelength imaging in the electrostatic
limit.

the weighted Delaunay triangulation, and the alpha shapes. These geometric
constructs enable fast and analytical computaton of shapes of biomoleculres
(including features such as voids and pockets) and metric properties (such as
area and volume). The algorithms of Delaunay triangulation, computation of
voids and pockets, as well volume/area computation are also described. In
addition, applications in packing analysis of protein structures and protein
function prediction are also discussed.

follows by the universal property of tensor products from the case in which all

equivalent to a canonical teleportation-type form. Some philosophical issues
concerning quantum information are also touched upon.

cylinder-plate configuration induced by scalar-field fluctuations with
Dirichlet boundary conditions. Based on a high-precision calculation using
worldline numerics, we quantitatively determine the validity bounds of the
proximity force approximation (PFA) on which the comparison between all
corresponding experiments and theory are based. We observe the quantitative
failure of the PFA on the 1% level for a curvature parameter a/R > 0.00755.
Even qualitatively, the PFA fails to predict reliably the correct sign of
genuine Casimir curvature effects. We conclude that data analysis of future
experiments aiming at a precision of 0.1% must no longer be based on the PFA.
