statistical properties of a sample of eclipsing binaries that is detectable by
an idealised extrasolar planet transit survey with specifications broadly
similar to those of the SuperWASP (Wide Angle Search for Planets) project. In
this idealised survey the total number of detectable single stars in the
Galactic disc is of the order of 10^6-10^7, while, for a flat initial mass
ratio distribution, the total number of detectable eclipsing binaries is of the
order of 10^4-10^5. The majority of the population of detectable single stars
is made up of main-sequence stars (60%), horizontal-branch stars (20%), and
giant-branch stars (10%). The largest contributions to the population of
detectable eclipsing binaries stem from detached double main-sequence star
binaries (60%), detached giant-branch main-sequence star binaries (20%), and
detached horizontal-branch main-sequence star binaries (10%). The ratio of the
number of eclipsing binaries to the number of single stars detectable by the
idealised SuperWASP survey varies by less than a factor of 2.5 across the sky,
and decreases with increasing Galactic latitude. It is found to be largest in
the direction of the Galactic longitude l=-7.5deg and the Galactic latitude
b=-22.5deg. We also show that the fractions of systems in different subgroups
of eclipsing binaries are sensitive to the adopted initial mass ratio
distribution, which is one of the poorest constrained input parameters in
present-day binary population synthesis calculations. This suggests that once
statistically meaningful results from transit surveys are available, they will
be able to significantly improve the predictive power of population synthesis
studies of interacting binaries and related objects. (abridged)

range of O4 to O9 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We compare predicted
basic wind properties, i.e. the terminal velocity and the mass-loss rate with
values derived from observation. We found relatively good agreement between
theoretical and observed terminal velocities. On the other hand, predicted
mass-loss rates and mass-loss rates derived from observation are in a good
agreement only for higher mass-loss rates. Theoretical mass-loss rates lower
than approximately 10^{-7} M_o/year are significantly higher than those derived
from observation. These results confirm the previously reported problem of weak
winds, since our calculated mass-loss rates are in a fair agreement with
predictions of Vink et al. (2001). We study multicomponent models for these
winds. For this purpose we develop a more detailed description of wind
decoupling. We show that the instability connected with the decoupling of
individual wind elements may occur for low-density winds. In the case of winds
with very low observed mass-loss rate the multicomponent effects are important
for the wind structure, however this is not able to consistently explain the
difference between predicted mass-loss rate and mass-loss rate derived from
observation for these stars. Similar to previous studies, we found the
dependence of wind parameters on the metallicity. We conclude that the wind
mass-loss rate significantly increases with metallicity as dM/dt ~ Z^0.67,
whereas the wind terminal velocity on average depends on metallicity only
slightly, namely v_infty ~ Z^0.06 (for studied stars).

respectively. The analysis is based on spectral synthesis of the forbidden [C
I] line at 872.7 nm using spectra of very high resolution (R~220000)and high
signal-to-noise (S/N>300) that were obtained with the CES spectrograph on the
ESO 3.6-m telescope on La Silla in Chile. We find that [C/Fe] versus [Fe/H]
trends for the thin and thick disks are totally merged and flat for sub-solar
metallicities. The thin disk that extends to higher metallicities than the
thick disk,shows a shallow decline in [C/Fe] from [Fe/H]=0 and up to
[Fe/H]=+0.4. The [C/O] versus [O/H] trends are well separated between the two
disks (due to differences in the oxygen abundances)and bear a great resemblance
to the [Fe/O] versus [O/H] trends. Our interpretation of our abundance trends
is that the sources that are responsible for the carbon enrichment in the
Galactic thin and thick disks have operated on a time-scale very similar to
those that are responsible for the Fe and Y enrichment (i.e., SNIa and AGB
stars, respectively)...... For the Galaxy we hence conclude that the carbon
enrichment at metallicities typical of the disk is mainly due to low and
intermediate mass stars, while massive stars are still the main carbon
contributor at low metallicities (halo and metal-poor thick disk).

the inflaton potential consistent with the data is V(phi) = N M^4

energy scale, and N ~ 50 the number of efolds. The dimensionless function
w(chi) and field chi are O(1). This form of the potential encodes the slow-roll
expansion as an expansion in 1/N.A The Hubble parameter, inflaton mass and
non-linear couplings are of the see-saw form in terms of M/M_{Pl}. The quartic
coupling is lambda~1/N (M/M_{Pl})^4. The smallness of the non-linear couplings
is not a result of fine tuning but a natural consequence of the validity of the
effective field theory and slow roll approximation. Quantum corrections to slow
roll inflation are computed and turn to be an expansion in powers (H/M_{Pl})^2.
The corrections to the inflaton effective potential and its equation of motion
are computed, as well as the quantum corrections to the observable power
spectra. The near scale invariance of the fluctuations introduces a strong
infrared behavior naturally regularized by Delta=(n_s -1)/2+r/8. We consider
scalar curvature and tensor perturbations as well as light scalars and Dirac
fermions coupled to the inflaton.The subhorizon part is completely specified by
the trace anomaly of the fields with different spins and is solely determined
by the space-time geometry. This inflationary effective potential is strikingly
different from the usual Minkowski space-time result.Quantum corrections to the
power spectra are expressed in terms of the CMB observables. Trace anomalies
(especially the graviton part) dominate these quantum corrections in a definite
direction: they enhance the scalar curvature fluctuations and reduce the tensor

affect SZE observables? We investigate the signature of these important cluster

half-luminosity radius $r_{SZ}$ provides a measure of the potential energy of
the cluster gas, and thus we can deduce the total energy content of the ICM. We
caution that any systematic variation of the ICM mass fraction will distort the

of the Blazhko phenomenon (at least 27.6%), including unprecedentedly many
frequency triplets, which we attribute to our sensitive search method. We find
that the minimum light V-I color (useful as a reddening indicator) grows slowly
redder with increasing period and exhibits a star-to-star scatter of
approximately 0.07 mag. We use this color to evaluate the zero-point accuracy
of the reddening map of the Galactic bulge derived from OGLE data, and find
that in addition to low-level random errors or resolution effects (responsible
for much of the scatter), the map may systematically over-represent E(V-I) by
approximately 0.05 mag in most fields. We present reasonably robust evidence
that the RR Lyrae-to-red clump color separation is larger by 0.05--0.08 mag in
the bulge than locally, which argues for caution in the use of these stars for
reddening determinations. We consider the RR Lyrae constraint on the
Galactocentric distance, but uncertainty about the absolute magnitude
calibration leaves significant flexibility in the result. In contrast to

dark-matter halo using N-body simulations. We make direct comparisons to our
analytic theory (Weinberg & Katz 2005) to demonstrate the great difficulty that
an N-body simulation has representing these dynamics for realistic astronomical
interactions. In a dark-matter halo, the bar's angular momentum is coupled to
the central density cusp (if present) by the Inner Lindblad Resonance. Owing to
this angular momentum transfer and self-consistent re-equilibration, strong
realistic bars WILL modify the cusp profile, lowering the central densities
within about 30% of the bar radius in a few bar orbits. Past results to the
contrary (Sellwood 2006, McMillan & Dehnen 2005) may be the result of weak bars
or numerical artifacts. The magnitude depends on many factors and we illustrate
the sensitivity of the response to the dark-matter profile, the bar shape and
mass, and the galaxy's evolutionary history. For example, if the bar length is
comparable to the size of a central dark-matter core, the bar may exchange
angular momentum without changing its pattern speed significantly. We emphasise
that this apparently simple example of secular evolution is remarkably subtle
in detail and conclude that an N-body exploration of any astronomical scenario
requires a deep investigation into the underlying dynamical mechanisms for that
particular problem to set the necessary requirements for the simulation
parameters and method (e.g. particle number and Poisson solver). Simply put,
N-body simulations do not divinely reveal truth and hence their results are not
infallible. They are unlikely to provide useful insight on their own,
particularly for the study of even more complex secular processes such as the
production of pseudo-bulges and disk heating.

range in absorption column densities similar to other radio galaxies. We
therefore find no evidence that GPS galaxies reside in significantly more dense
circumnuclear environment, such that they could be hampered in their expansion.
2) The ratio of radio to X-ray luminosity is significantly higher than for
classical radio sources. This is consistent with an evolution scenario in which
young radio sources are more efficient radio emitters than large extended
objects at a constant accretion power. 3) Taking the X-ray luminosity of radio

the central object. The flow is assumed to be vertical, and the gas pressure is
ignored, while internal heating is assumed to be proportional to the gas
density. The basic equations were numerically solved as a function of the
optical depth, and the flow velocity, the height, the radiative flux, and the
radiation pressure were obtained for a given radius, an initial optical depth,
and initial conditions at the flow base (disk ``inside''), whereas the
mass-loss rate was determined as an eigenvalue of the boundary condition at the
flow top (disk ``surface''). For sufficiently luminous cases, the flow
resembles the case without gravity. For less-luminous cases, however, the flow
velocity decreases, and the flow would be impossible due to the existence of
gravity in the case that the radiative flux is sufficiently small. Application
to a supercritical accretion disk with mass loss is briefly discussed.

techniques, we are able to infer the true distribution of the parent GRB
population's luminosity function and density distributions in a way that
accounts for detector selection effects. We find that after accounting for data
truncation, there still exists a significant correlation between the average
luminosity and redshift, indicating that distant GRBs are on average more
luminous than nearby counterparts. This is consistent with previous studies
showing strong source evolution and also recent observations of under luminous
nearby GRBs. We find no evidence for beaming angle evolution in the current
sample of GRBs with known redshift, suggesting that this increase in luminosity
can not be due to an evolution of the collimation of gamma-ray emission. The
resulting luminosity function is well fit with a single power law of index
$L'^{-1.5}$, which is intermediate between the values predicted by the
power-law and Gaussian structured jet models. We also find that the GRB
comoving rate density rises steeply with a broad peak between $1<z<2$ followed
by a steady decline above $z> 3$. This rate density qualitatively matches the
current estimates of the cosmic star formation rate, favoring a short lived
massive star progenitor model, or a binary model with a short delay between the

longer tails at the higher end of the probability distribution, and larger
model uncertainties. The ratios of time delays slightly depend on the slope
\alpha. Among others, time delays between images C and A (or B) have little
dependence on the inner slope, particularly when the time delays are short. The
dependence of time delays on \alpha is well fitted by a linear form, which
reflects well-known degeneracy between the mass profile and time delays. We
perform a Monte-Carlo simulation to illustrate how well the inner slope can be
constrained from measurements of time delays. We find that measurements of more

a subset of the orbital vibrational modes from the rest of the
necessarily-coupled system of orbitals and ions. Recent work (J. Chem. Phys.

that remains once adiabatic-decoupling has been achieved, a large value of the
fictitious mass $\mu$ can lead to systematic errors in the computed forces in

those parts of these errors that are not corrected simply by rescaling the
masses of the ions. It is suggested that any comparison of the efficiencies of
Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) and CPMD should be performed at a
similar level of accuracy. If accuracy is judged according to the average

communication when optimizing pure quantum states for communicating in bosonic
quantum channels, i.e. find optimal channel input states maximizing the pure

optimum and the maximizers itself are in general difficult find, numerically

important which will be provided by this contribution. Based on a result due to

insurance policies to early cyber-risk insurance policies to current

security risk in combination with the need for compliance with recent corporate
legislation has contributed significantly to the demand for cyberinsurance.
Cyberinsurance policies have become more comprehensive as insurers better
understand the risk landscape and specific business needs. More specifically,
cyberinsurers are addressing what used to be considered insurmountable problems
(e.g., adverse selection/asymmetric information, moral hazard, etc.) that could
lead to a failure of this market solution. Although some implementation issues

introduces a critical dependence on the gluon topological susceptibility. In
this paper, we revisit our earlier theoretical analysis of radiative
pseudoscalar decays and the DGMOR relations and extract explicit experimental
values for the decay constants. This is our main result. The flavour singlet
DGMOR relation is the generalisation of the Witten-Veneziano formula beyond

accommodate SU(3) flavour breaking and the implications of a more precise

chiral symmetry for the pseudoscalar (P), scalar (S) and vector (V) nonets
involved. The characteristic feature is derivative coupling for the SPP
interaction. In an initial approximation which models all the scalar nonet
radiative processes together with the help of a point like vertex, it is noted
that the derivative coupling prevents the a0 and f0 resonance peaks from
getting washed out (by falling phase space). However, the shapes of the two
final PP mass distributions do not agree well with the experimental ones. For
improving the situation we verify that the inclusion of the charged K meson
loop diagrams in the model does reproduce the experimental spectrum shapes in
the resonance region. The derivative coupling introduces quadratic as well as
logaritmic divergneces in this calculation. Using dimensional regularization we
show that these divergences actually cancel out among the four diagrams, as
expected from gauge invariance. We point out the features which are expected to
be important for further work on this model and for learning more about the

efficient and flexible for the enumeration of constrained families of maps. In
this article, the method is applied to count unrooted 2-connected maps and,

thin molecular films and long biomolecules, can be modeled by stochastic
versions of the Discrete Self-Trapping equation of Eilbeck, Lomdahl and Scott,
and this can be approximated by continuum limits in the form of stochastic
nonlinear Schroedinger equations.
  Previous studies directed at the SNLS approximations have indicated that the
self-focusing of wave energy to highly localized states can be inhibited by
phase noise (modeling thermal effects) and can be restored by phase damping
(modeling heat radiation).
  We show that the continuum limit is probably ill-posed in the presence of
spatially uncorrelated noise, at least with little or no damping, so that
discrete models need to be addressed directly. Also, as has been noted by other
authors, omission of damping produces highly unphysical results.
  Numerical results are presented for the first time for the discrete models
including the highly nonlinear damping term, and new numerical methods are
introduced for this purpose. Previous conjectures are in general confirmed, and
the damping is shown to strongly stabilize the highly localized states of the
discrete models. It appears that the previously noted inhibition of nonlinear
wave phenomena by noise is an artifact of modeling that includes the effects of
heat, but not of heat loss.

using the relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov approach within the framework of the
RMF theory for isotopic chains of rare-earth nuclei in the r-process region.
The Lagrangian model NL-SV1 with the inclusion of the vector self-coupling of
omega meson has been employed. The RMF results show that the shell effects at
N=126 remain strong and exhibit only a slight reduction in the strength in
going from the r-process path to the neutron drip line. This is in striking
contrast to a systematic weakening of the shell effects at N=82 in the
r-process region predicted earlier in the similar approach. In comparison the
shell effects with microscopic-macroscopic mass formulae show a near constancy
of shell gaps leading to strong shell effects in the region of r-process path
to the drip line. A recent analysis of solar-system r-process abundances in a
prompt supernova explosion model using various mass formulae including the
recently introduced mass tables based upon HFB approach shows that whilst mass
formulae with weak shell effects at N=126 give rise to a spread and an
overproduction of nuclides near the third abundance peak at A~190, mass tables
with droplet models showing stronger shell effects are able to reproduce the
abundance features near the third peak appropriately. In comparison, several
analyses of the second r-process peak at A~130 have required weakened shell
effects at N=82. Our predictions in the RMF theory with NL-SV1, which exhibit
weaker shell effects at N=82 and stronger one at N=126 in the r-process region,
support the conjecture that a different nature of the shell effects at the
magic numbers may be at play in r-process nucleosynthesis of heavy nuclei.

input signals into spike-trains in individual sensory neuronal systems. The
spike-train could be described as the waveform sample of the input signal which
locks sample points to wave crests with randomness. Based on simulations of the
Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neuron responding to periodic inputs, we demonstrate that
the random sampling is a proper encoding method in medium frequency region
since power spectra of the reconstructed spike-trains are identical to that of
neural signals.

"quant-ph/0601040","John Klauder","John R. Klauder","Infinite Divisibility in Euclidean Quantum Mechanics","17 pages, no figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  In simple -- but selected -- quantum systems, the probability distribution
determined by the ground state wave function is infinitely divisible. Like all
simple quantum systems, the Euclidean temporal extension leads to a system that
involves a stochastic variable and which can be characterized by a probability
distribution on continuous paths. The restriction of the latter distribution to
sharp time expectations recovers the infinitely divisible behavior of the
ground state probability distribution, and the question is raised whether or
not the temporally extended probability distribution retains the property of
being infinitely divisible. A similar question extended to a quantum field
theory relates to whether or not such systems would have nontrivial scattering
behavior.

explicitly as a convex combination of product states, which is different from
the convex combination obtained by Wootters' method. The Werner state in a
two-qubit system has a single real parameter and varies from inseparable state
to separable state according to the value of its parameter. We derive a hidden
variable model that is induced by our decomposed form for the separable Werner
state. From our explicit form of the convex combination of product states, we
understand the following: The critical point of the parameter for separability
of the Werner state comes from positivity of local density operators of the
qubits.

  Carr, quant-ph/0512148/2005","Romanian Journal of Physics 48, 727-741 (2003)",,,"quant-ph",,"  We propose a reliable entanglement measure for a two-mode squeezed thermal
state of the quantum electromagnetic field in terms of its Bures distance to
the set of all separable states of the same kind. The requisite Uhlmann
fidelity of a pair of two-mode squeezed thermal states is evaluated as the
maximal transition probability between two four-mode purifications. By applying
the Peres-Simon criterion of separability we find the closest separable state.
This enables us to derive an insightful expression of the amount of
entanglement. Then we apply this measure of entanglement to the study of the
Braunstein-Kimble protocol of teleportation. We use as input state in
teleportation a mixed one-mode Gaussian state. The entangled state shared by
the sender (Alice) and the receiver (Bob) is taken to be a two-mode squeezed
thermal state. We find that the properties of the teleported state depend on
both the input state and the entanglement of the two-mode resource state. As a
measure of the quality of the teleportation process, we employ the Uhlmann
fidelity between the input and output mixed one-mode Gaussian states.
