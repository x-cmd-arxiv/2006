galaxy Mrk1239. The spectrum is outstanding because the nuclear continuum
emission in the near-infrared is dominated by a strong bump of emission peaking
at 2.2 micron, with a strength not reported before in an AGN. A comparison of
the Mrk1239 spectrum to that of Ark564 allowed us to conclude that the
continuum is strongly reddened by E(B-V)=0.54. The excess of emission,
confirmed by aperture photometry and additional NIR spectroscopy, follows a
simple blackbody curve at T=1200 K. This suggest that we may be observing
direct evidence of dust heated near to the sublimation temperature, likely
produced by the putative torus of the unification model. Although other
alternatives are also plausible, the lack of star formation, the strong
polarization and low extinction derived for the emission lines support the
scenario where the hot dust is located between the narrow line region and the
broad line region.

This morphology is well represented by a composite of two logarithmic spiral
arms and a circular ring (radius ~10 kpc) of star formation offset from the
nucleus. The two spiral arms appear to start at the ends of a bar in the
nuclear region and extend beyond the star forming ring. As has been found in
previous work, the spiral arms are not continuous but composed of spiral
segments. The star forming ring is very circular except for a region near M32
where it splits. The lack of well defined spiral arms and the prominence of the
nearly circular ring suggests that M31 has been distorted by interactions with
its satellite galaxies. Using new dynamical simulations of M31 interacting with
M32 and NGC 205 we find that, qualitatively, such interactions can produce an
offset, split ring like that seen in the MIPS images.

galaxy formation and comparison with observations would not have been possible
without N-Body simulations. Given the importance of this tool, it is essential
to understand its limitations as ignoring these can easily lead to interesting
but unreliable results. In this paper we study the limitations due to the
finite size of the simulation volume. We explicitly construct the correction
term arising due to a finite box size and study its generic features for
clustering of matter and also on mass functions. We show that the correction to
mass function is maximum near the scale of non-linearity, as a corollary we
show that the correction to the number density of haloes of a given mass
changes sign at this scale; the number of haloes at small masses is over
estimated in simulations. This over estimate results from a delay in mergers
that lead to formation of more massive haloes. The same technique can be used
to study corrections to other physical quantities. The corrections are
typically small if the scale of non-linearity is much smaller than the
box-size. However, there are some cases of physical interest in which the
relative correction term is of order unity even though a simulation box much
larger than the scale of non-linearity is used. Within the context of the
concordance model, our analysis suggests that it is very difficult for present
day simulations to resolve mass scales smaller than 100 solar masses accurately
and the level of difficulty increases as we go to even smaller masses, though
this constraint does not apply to multi-scale simulations.

model. Our results suggest that the observed abundance patterns in the
metal-poor star BD +80 245 and the pair of stars HD 134439/40 agree strongly
with the theoretical possibility that these stars inherited their heavy element
abundance patterns from SNe initiated by thermonuclear runaways in the

SNe could be originated from metal-free stars in the intermediate mass range.
On the other hand, intermediate mass stars containing some metals would end
their lives as white dwarfs after expelling their envelopes in the wind due to
intense momentum transport from outgoing photons to heavy elements. This new
pathway for the formation of SNe requires that stars are formed from the
primordial gas. Thus, we suggest that stars of a few solar masses were formed
from the primordial gas and that some of them caused thermonuclear explosions

spectral index $\Gamma \approx 1$) with a sharp cutoff at $\approx 6$ keV. Disk

the spectrum is better described, with a lower reduced $\chi^2$, as emission
due to nearly saturated Comptonization of photons in an optically thick ($\tau

\approx 2$ keV. This is in contrast to the high energy spectra of other black
hole systems, which are relatively steeper ($\Gamma > 1.5$) and hence are

Iron line emission which is marginally resolved ($\sigma \sim 0.2$ keV) is
required to fit the data. We argue that the standard geometries for the X-ray
producing region, which are an optically thin inner disk or an uniform/patchy
corona on top of a cold disk, are not applicable to this source. Alternatively,
the geometry of the X-ray producing region could be a large sphere surrounding
a cold accretion disk or an optically thick inner disk region which cools by
bremsstrahlung self-Comptonization. For the latter scenario, such an inner disk
region, whose effective optical depth to absorption is less than unity, is
expected in the standard accretion disk theory for near Eddington accretion

that a fraction of them originate in the local universe. These systems may well
be the result of giant flares from soft gamma-repeaters (highly magnetized
neutron stars commonly known as magnetars). However, if these neutron stars are
formed via the core collapse of massive stars then it would be expected that
the bursts should originate from predominantly young stellar populations, while
correlating the positions of BATSE short bursts with structure in the local
universe reveals a correlation with all galaxy types, including those with
little or no ongoing star formation. This is a natural outcome if, in addition
to magnetars formed via the core collapse of massive stars they also form via
Accretion Induced Collapse following the merger of two white dwarfs, one of
which is magnetic. We investigate this possibility and find that the rate of
magnetar production via WD-WD mergers in the Milky Way is comparable to the
rate of production via core-collapse. However, while the rate of production of
magnetars by core collapse is proportional to the star formation rate, the rate
of production via WD-WD mergers (which have long lifetimes) is proportional to
the stellar mass density, which is concentrated in early-type systems.
Therefore magnetars produced via WD-WD mergers may produce SGR giant flares
which can be identified with early type galaxies. We also comment on the
possibility that this mechanism could produce a fraction of the observed short
duration burst population at higher redshift.

can shift the turnover in the matter power spectrum even without changing the

the solar core and this variability is provided by the variability of the solar
neutrino flux from the solar neutrino detectors i.e., Homestake,
Superkamiokande, SAGE and GALLEX-GNO. The solar neutrino flux in the standard
solar model (SSM) was calculated on the assumption of L_nu (neutrino
luminosity) = L_gamma (optical luminosity) which implies that if there is a
change in optical luminosity then solar neutrino flux data will also be
changed. An internal dynamo due to the cyclic variation of nuclear energy
generation inside the core of the sun is responsible for the solar activity
cycle was suggested and thus the internal magnetic field is also variable.
Again the changes in the nuclear energy generation induce structural changes
that result in variations of the global solar parameters i.e., luminosity,
radius and temperatures etc. From the analysis of total solar irradiance (TSI)
data during the year from 1970 to 2003 we have found five phases within the
solar activity cycle. The first phase (I) starts before two years from the
sunspot minimum. The second phase (II) starts at the time of sunspot minimum
and phase (III) starts before 2/3 years from sunspot maximum whereas phase (IV)
starts at sunspot maximum and fifth phase (V) starts at after 2-3 years from

accurately and its properties studied extensively using an approximation-free

SP method is a direct numerical simulation of particulate flows and provides a
coupling scheme between the continuum fluid dynamics and rigid-body dynamics
through utilization of a smoothed profile for the colloidal particles.
Moreover, the improved formulation includes an extension to incorporate
multi-component fluids, allowing systems such as charged colloids in

are solved with the same computational cost as required for solving
non-particulate flows. Numerical results which assess the hydrodynamic

measured by applying a constant stretching force f_s from which the apparent

landscape requires additional probes that can incorporate the dynamics of
tension propagation and relaxation of the polypeptide chain upon force quench.
We introduce a theory of force correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to map the
parameters of the energy landscape of proteins. In the FCS the joint
distribution, P(T,t) of folding and unfolding times is constructed by repeated
application of cycles of stretching at constant fs, separated by release
periods T during which the force is quenched to f_q<f_s. During the release
period, the protein can collapse to a manifold of compact states or refold. We
show that P(T,t) can be used to resolve the kinetics of unfolding as well as
formation of native contacts and to extract the parameters of the energy
landscape using chain extension as the reaction coordinate and P(T,t). We
illustrate the utility of the proposed formalism by analyzing simulations of
unfolding-refolding trajectories of a coarse-grained protein S1 with beta-sheet
architecture for several values of f_s, T and f_q=0. The simulations of
stretch-relax trajectories are used to map many of the parameters that
characterize the energy landscape of S1.

generates a time independent ergodic equilibrium state with two conjugate pairs
of Lyapunov exponents. Each conjugate pair sums to zero. The fluctuation
relations are tested numerically both near and far from equilibrium. As
expected from previous work, near equilibrium the ESFR is verified by the
simulation data while the GCFR is not confirmed by the data. Far from
equilibrium where a positive exponent in one of these conjugate pairs becomes
negative, we test a conjecture regarding the GCFR made by Gallavotti and
co-workers. They conjectured that where the number of nontrivial Lyapunov
exponents that are positive becomes less than the number of such negative
exponents, then the form of the GCFR needs to be corrected. We show that there
is no evidence for this conjecture in the empirical data. In fact as the field
increases, the uncorrected form of the GCFR appears to become more accurate.
The real reason for this observation is likely to be that as the field
increases, the argument of the GCFR more and more accurately approximates the
argument of the ESFR. Since the ESFR works for arbitrary field strengths, the
uncorrected GCFR appears to become ever more accurate as the field increases.
The final point of evidence against the conjecture is that when the smallest
positive exponent changes sign, the conjecture predicts a discontinuous change
in the ""correction factor"" for GCFR. We see no evidence for a discontinuity at
this field strength; only a gradual improvement of degree of agreement as the
field increases.

bring about nontrivial effects of spin-orbit coupling for the $d$ electrons in

light doping and extends around this point forming an arc as the carrier
density increases, where the spectra for light doping grow continuously to be

fit experimental stretching measurements carried out on DNA and single-stranded

background (IGWB) in the Randall-Sundrum single-brane model. In the braneworld
cosmology, in which three-dimensional space-like hypersurface that we live in
is embedded in five-dimensional anti de Sitter (AdS_5) space-time, the
evolution of gravitational wave (GW) modes is affected by the non-standard
expansion of the universe and the excitation of the Kaluza-Klein modes
(KK-modes), which are significant in the high-energy regime of the universe. We
numerically evaluate these two effects by solving the evolution equation for
GWs propagating through the AdS_5 space-time. Using a plausible initial
condition from inflation, we find that the excitation of KK-modes can be
characterized by a simple scaling relation above the critical frequency f_crit
determined from the length scale of the fifth dimension \ell. The remarkable
point is that this relation generally holds as long as the matter content of
the universe is described by the perfect fluid with the EOS p=w\rho for 0\leq
w\leq 1. The resultant scaling relation is translated into the energy spectrum
of the IGWB as \Omega_GW\propto f^{(3w-1)/(3w+2)} for f>f_crit. This indicates
that, in the radiation dominant case (w=1/3), the two high-energy effects
accidentally compensate each other and the spectrum becomes almost the same as
the one predicted in the four-dimensional theory, i.e., \Omega_GW\propto f^0.

about facets of the cut polytope of the complete graph, very little is known

central tool to prove certain inequalities are facet inducing for the cut
polytope. In this paper we introduce a lifting operation, named triangular
elimination, applicable to the cut polytope of a wide range of graphs.
Triangular elimination is a specific combination of zero-lifting and
Fourier-Motzkin elimination using the triangle inequality. We prove sufficient
conditions for the triangular elimination of facet inducing inequalities to be
facet inducing. The proof is based on a variation of the lifting lemma adapted
to general graphs. The result can be used to derive facet inducing inequalities
of the cut polytope of various graphs from those of the complete graph. We also
investigate the symmetry of facet inducing inequalities of the cut polytope of
the complete bipartite graph derived by triangular elimination.

  system","45 pages, 18 figures",,,,"nucl-th",,"  A theory of the competition between fusion and quasi-fission in a heavy
fusing system is proposed, which is based on a master equation and the
two-center shell model. Fusion and quasi-fission arise from a diffusion process
in an ensemble of nuclear shapes, each of which evolves towards the thermal
equilibrium. The master equation describes the diffusion of the nuclear shapes
due to quantum and thermal fluctuations. Other crucial physical effects like
dissipation, ground-state shell effects, diabatic effects and rotational
effects are also incorporated into the theory. The fusing system moves in a
dynamical (time-dependent) collective potential energy surface which is
initially diabatic and gradually becomes adiabatic. The microscopic ingredients
of the theory are obtained with a realistic two-center shell model based on
Woods-Saxon potentials. Numerical calculations for several reactions leading to
$^{256}$No are discussed. Among other important conclusions, the results
indicate that (i) the diabatic effects play a very important role in the onset
of fusion hindrance for heavy systems, and (ii) very asymmetric reactions
induced by closed shell nuclei seem to be the best suited to synthesize the
heaviest compound nuclei.

the hyperon energy gaps including the temperature dependence are presented.
These are meant to serve as physical inputs for $Y$-cooling calculations of

soon as they appear although the magnitude of the critical temperature and the
density region where superfluidity exists depend considerably on the $YY$
