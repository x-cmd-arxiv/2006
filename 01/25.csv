coupled to matter. In these models the mass of the scalar field is much larger
than the expansion rate of the Universe. We find models in which this
instability is absent, and show that these models generically predict an
apparent equation of state for dark energy smaller than -1, i.e.,
superacceleration. These models have no acausal behavior or ghosts.

dominated by molecular bands, changes dramatically when irradiated even by a
low-luminosity AGN ($L_{\rm X} = 10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$), becoming dominated by
atomic lines in absorption. We study the changes in the spectrum of low-mass
carbon- and oxygen-rich giant stars as they are irradiated by a modest AGN,
similar to the one at the Galactic center (GC). The resulting spectra are
similar to those of the faintest S-cluster stars observed in the GC. The
spectrum of a star irradiated by a much brighter AGN, like that powered by a
tidally disrupted star, is very different from that of any star currently
observed near the GC. For the first time we have discovered that the structure
of the atmosphere of an irradiated giant changes dramatically and induces a
double inversion layer. We show that irradiation at the current level can
explain the observed trend of CO band intensities decreasing as a function of
increasing proximity to Sg $A^{*}$. This may indicate that (contrary to
previous claims) there is no paucity of old giants in the GC, which coexist
simultaneously with young massive stars.

E0102 is a member of the oxygen-rich class of SNRs showing strong oxygen, neon
, and other metal-line emissions in its optical and X-ray spectra, and an
absence of H and He. The progenitor of E0102 may have been a Wolf-Rayet star
that underwent considerable mass loss prior to exploding as a Type Ib/c or
IIL/b SN. The ejecta in this SNR are fast-moving (V > 1000 km/s) and emit as
they are compressed and heated in the reverse shock. In 2003, we obtained
optical [O III], H-alpha, and continuum images with the ACS Wide Field Camera.
The [O III] image captures the full velocity range of the ejecta, and shows
considerable high-velocity emission projected in the middle of the SNR that was
Doppler-shifted out of the narrow F502N bandpass of a previous Wide Field and
Planetary Camera 2 image from 1995. Using these two epochs separated by ~8.5
years, we measure the transverse expansion of the ejecta around the outer rim

the bright ejecta of ~2000 km/s and an inferred kinematic age for the SNR of

inferred by Hughes et al.(2000) from X-ray data, though our 1-sigma error bars
overlap. Our proper-motion age is consistent with an independent optical
kinematic age derived by Eriksen et al.(2003) using spatially resolved [O III]

X-ray and radio hotspots, which could indicate the presence of a compact

continuum to that of a $\cO$ (or $\Co$) rotational line can place reliable
upper limits on the temperature of the dust and molecular gas on multi-parsec
scales; on such scales, both the line and continuum emission are optically
thin, resulting in a continuum-to-line ratio that suffers no loss of
temperature sensitivity in the high-temperature limit as occurs for ratios of
CO rotational lines or ratios of continuum emission in different wavelength

fixed-temperature and the other has a spatially varying temperature. The former
represents gas and dust towards the surface of the clouds that are heated
primarily by a very large-scale (i.e. $\sim 1 $kpc) interstellar radiation
field. The latter represents gas and dust at greater depths into the clouds and
are shielded from this interstellar radiation field and heated by local stars.

previously observed maps of $\COone$ and $\Jtwo$ that cover the entire Orion$

However, we do see significant differences in coronal abundance patterns.
Coronal abundance anomalies are generally associated with the first ionization

the corona relative to high-FIP elements, the so-called ""FIP effect."" Different
levels of FIP effect are seen for our stellar sample, ranging from 70 Oph A,

difference exhibited by the two 70 Oph stars is unexpected considering how
similar these stars are in all other respects (spectral type, age, rotation
period, X-ray flux). It will be difficult for any theoretical explanation for
the FIP effect to explain how two stars so similar in all other respects can
have coronae with different degrees of FIP bias. Finally, for the stars in our

light curves of the very bright short Gamma-Ray Burst GRB 051221A and compare
the arrival times of photons at different energies with the expected time delay

in 18 massive star-forming regions previously presented in a companion paper.
The OH masers often arise in the shocked neutral gas surrounding ultracompact
Hii regions. Magnetic fields as deduced from OH maser Zeeman splitting are
highly ordered, both on the scale of a source as well as the maser clustering
scale of ~10^15 cm. Results from our large sample show that this clustering
scale appears to be universal to these masers. OH masers around ultracompact
Hii regions live ~10^4 years and then turn off abruptly, rather than weakening
gradually with time. These masers have a wide range of polarization properties.
At one extreme (e.g., W75 N), pi-components are detected and the polarization
position angles of maser spots show some organization. At the other extreme
(e.g., W51 e1/e2), almost no linear polarization is detected and total
polarization fractions can be substantially less than unity. A typical source
has properties intermediate to these two extremes. In contrast to the well
ordered magnetic field inferred from Zeeman splitting, there is generally no
clear pattern in the distribution of polarization position angles. This can be
explained if Faraday rotation in a typical OH maser source is large on a maser
amplification length but small on a single (e-folding) gain length. Increasing
or decreasing Faraday rotation by a factor of ~5 among different sources can
explain the observed variation in polarization properties. We suggest that
almost all pi-components acquire a signficant amount of circular polarization
from low-gain stimulated emission of a sigma-component from OH appropriately
shifted in velocity and lying along the propagation path.

SDSS dwarfs by ~0.13 mag in g-r, which is consistent with the color evolution
over ~2 Gyr of star formation histories involving moderate starbursts and long
periods of continuous star formation. The full color range of the samples
cannot be reproduced by single starbursts of different masses or long periods
of continuous star formation alone. Furthermore, an estimate of the mechanical
luminosities needed for the gas in the GEMS dwarfs to be completely removed
from the galaxies shows that a significant number of low luminosity dwarfs are
susceptible to such a complete gas loss, if they would experience a starburst.
On the other hand, a large fraction of more luminous dwarfs is likely to retain
their gas. We also estimate the star formation rates per unit area for the GEMS
dwarfs and find good agreement with the values for local dwarfs.

common stars in our Galaxy), this model favours the formation of Earth-mass to
Neptune-mass planets with orbital radii of 1 to 10 astronomical units (AU),
which is consistent with the small number of gas giant planets known to orbit
M-dwarf host stars. More than 170 extrasolar planets have been discovered with
a wide range of masses and orbital periods, but planets of Neptune's mass or
less have not hitherto been detected at separations of more than 0.15 AU from
normal stars. Here we report the discovery of a 5.5 (+5.5/-2.7) M_earth

inhomogeneous electric field created by the thin electron layer at the surface
of quark stars (the electrosphere). As suggested earlier, due to the low photon
emissivity of the quark-gluon plasma and of the electrosphere,
electron-positron pair emission could be the main observational signature of
quark stars. To obtain the electron-positron pair creation rate we use the
tunnelling approach. Explicit expressions for the fermion creation rate per
unit time per unit volume are derived, which generalize the classical Schwinger
result. The finite size effects in pair production, due to the presence of a
boundary (the surface of the quark star), are also considered in the framework
of a simple approach. It is shown that the boundary effects induce large
quantitative and qualitative deviations of the particle production rate from
what one deduces with the Schwinger formula and its generalization for the
electric field of the electrosphere. The electron-positron pair emissivity and
flux of the electrosphere of quark stars due to pair creation is considered,
and the magnitude of the boundary effects for this parameters is estimated. Due
to the inhomogeneity of the electric field distribution in the electrosphere
and of the presence of the boundary effects, at high temperatures ($T\geq
T_{cr}\approx 0.1 $ MeV) we find a lower electron-positron flux as previously
estimated. The numerical value of the critical temperature $T_{cr}$ depends on
the surface potential of the star. We briefly consider the effect of the
magnetic field on the pair creation process and show that the magnetic field
can enhance drastically the pair creation rate.

show a prominent early-type morphology. However, low-surface-brightness
exponential disks are detected on large scale in at least 4 of these sources.
The hosts of 'warm' AGN-like systems are of early type and have less pronounced
merger-induced morphological anomalies than the hosts of cool systems with
LINER or HII region-like nuclear optical spectral types. The host sizes and
luminosities of the 7 PG~QSOs in our sample are statistically indistinguishable
from those of the ULIRG hosts. In comparison, highly luminous quasars, such as
those studied by Dunlop et al. (2003), have hosts which are larger and more
luminous. The hosts of ULIRGs and PG QSOs lie close to the locations of
intermediate-size (about 1 -- 2 L*) spheroids in the photometric projection of
the fundamental plane of ellipticals, although there is a tendency in our
sample for the ULIRGs with small hosts to be brighter than normal spheroids.
Excess emission from a young stellar population in the ULIRG/QSO hosts may be
at the origin of this difference. Our results provide support for a possible
merger-driven evolutionary connection between cool ULIRGs, warm ULIRGs, and
PG~QSOs although this sequence may break down at low luminosity. (abridged)

(thermodynamic anomaly) and an increase of the diffusion coefficient upon
isothermal compression (dynamic anomaly) for $0\leq\lambda<6/7$. As in water,
the regions where these anomalies occur are nested domes in the ($T, \rho$) or

the dynamic anomaly dome. We calculate translational and orientational order
parameters ($t$ and $Q_6$), and project equilibrium state points onto the ($t,
Q_6$) plane, or order map. The order map evolves from water-like behavior to
hard-sphere-like behavior upon varying $\lambda$ between 4/7 and 6/7. Thus, we
traverse the range of liquid behavior encompassed by hard spheres ($\lambda=1$)

Water-like anomalies in structure, dynamics and thermodynamics arise solely due
to the existence of two length scales, orientation-dependent interactions being

constraints are introduced such that the low energy, long wavelength modes of a

years due to the advent of nano technology and the growing use of nanometer
scale devices and structures. In a small system, the size limits the scale of
the fluctuations and makes it imperative for us to understand how the response
of the system is altered in such a situation. In this thesis, this question is
answered for the special case of interfacial fluctuations in two dimensions
(2d). The energy of an interface between two phases in equilibrium is invariant
with respect to translations perpendicular to the plane (or line in 2d) of the
interface. We study the consequence of breaking this symmetry explicity using
an external field gradient. One expects that since low energy excitations are
suppressed, the interface would be flat and inert at all times. We show that
surprisingly there are novel fluctuations and phenomena associated with such
constrained interfaces which have static as well as dynamic consequences. The
Ising interface on a square lattice is shown to undergo a multitude of
structural transitions as a function of velocity and the orientation. Liquid
solid interfaces show coherent addition and removal of atomic layers providing
novel mechanisms of stress relaxation in a nanosized single crystal without
defects. We study momentum and energy transfer across the liquid solid

displacement waves (DW). The regime of the DW initial excitation is rigid. DW
have the frequencies ~$10^{10} sec^{-1}$ from the hypersound band and the
amplitudes providing the level of deformation ~$10^{-3}$. The conditions that

analyzed.

involve a solving of the Poisson equation for Coulomb potential and the
Schroedinger equation for single-particle orbitals. Due to nonlinearity and
complexity this set of equations, one believes in the iterative method for the
solution that should consist in consecutive improvement of the potential and
the electron density until the self-consistency is attained. Though this
approach exists for a long time there are two grave problems accompanying its
implementation to infinitely extended systems. The first of them is related
with the Poisson equation and lies in possible incompatibility of the boundary
conditions for the potential with the electron density distribution. The
analysis of this difficulty and suggested resolution are presented for both
infinite conducting systems in jellium approximation and periodic solids. It
provides the existence of self-consistent solution for the potential at every
iteration step due to realization of a screening effect. The second problem
results from the existence of continuous spectrum of Hamiltonian eigenvalues
for unbounded systems. It needs to have a definition of Hilbert space basis
with eigenfunctions of continuous spectrum as elements, which would be
convenient in numerical applications. The definition of scalar product
specifying the Hilbert space is proposed that incorporates a limiting
transition. It provides self-adjointness of Hamiltonian and, respectively, the
orthogonality of eigenfunctions corresponding to the different eigenvalues. In
addition, it allows to normalize them effectively to delta-function and to
prove in the general case the orthogonality of the 'right' and 'left'

methods, and by mapping total energies onto a Heisenberg model. The stability
of the different phases is found to depend mainly on the volume and on the
amount of magnetic order, confirming previous experimental findings and
phenomenological models. It is generally found that for large lattice constants
the ferromagnetic state is favored, whereas for small lattice constants
different antiferromagnetic states can be stabilized. In the ferromagnetic
state the structure with minimal energy is always hexagonal, whereas it becomes
orthorhombically distorted if there is an antiferromagnetic component in the
hexagonal plane. For the paramagnetic state the stable cell is found to be
orthorhombic up to a critical lattice constant of about 3.7 Angstrom, above
which it remains hexagonal. This leads to the second order structural phase
transition between paramagnetic states at about 400 K, where the lattice
parameter increases above this critical value with rising temperature due to
the thermal expansion. For the paramagnetic state an analytic approximation for
the magnitude of the orthorhombic distortion as a function of the lattice
constant is given. Within the mean field approximation the dependence of the
Curie temperature on the volume and on the orthorhombic distortion is
calculated. For orthorhombically distorted cells the Curie temperature is much
smaller than for hexagonal cells. This is mainly due to the fact that some of
the exchange coupling constants in the hexagonal plane become negative for
distorted cells. With these results a description of the susceptibility as
function of temperature is given.

fluxless solutions of arbitrary mass. A holographic description supports this
finding. We speculate thus that the presence of constant (yet very small)

quantum-mechanically unstable). The spontaneous Lorentz violation given by

the recent cosmic acceleration as well as determines the feature of future
evolution of the universe. In this paper, we discuss the dark energy of the
universe in the framework of scalar-tensor cosmology. In the very early
universe, the gravitational scalar field $\phi$ plays the roll of the inflaton
field and drives the universe to expand exponentially. In this period the field
$\phi$ acts as a cosmological constant and dominates the energy budget, the
equation of state (EoS) is $w=-1$. The universe exits from inflation gracefully
and with no reheating. Afterwards, the field $\phi$ appears as a cold dark
matter and continues to dominate the energy budget, the universe expands
according to 2/3 power law, the EoS is $w=0$. Eventually, by the epoch of
$z\sim O(1)$, the field $\phi$ contributes a significant component of dark
energy with negative pressure and accellerates the late universe. In the future
the universe will expand acceleratedly according to $a(t)\sim t^{1.31}$.

observations can be made and used to test BBN models and/or to further
constrain abundances of isotopes with weak observational limits. To push the

  A complete fit was performed in energy and angle to both angular distribution

parameters for experimental variables in the fit, error correlations between
detectors, reactions, and reaction energies were accurately tabulated by
computational methods. With uncertainties around 2% +/- 1% scale error, these
new measurements significantly improve on the existing data set. At relevant
temperatures, using the data of the present work, both reaction rates are found
to be about 7% higher than those in the widely used Nuclear Astrophysics

reduced uncertainties, but also to modifications in the BBN abundance

Solar flares are often used as precursors of geomagnetic storms. In
particular, Howard and Tappin (2005) recently published in A&A a dependence
between X-ray class of solar flares and Ap and Dst indexes of geomagnetic
storms which contradicts to early published results.
  Aims. We compare published results on flare-storm dependences and discuss
possible sources of the discrepancy.
  Methods. We analyze following sources of difference: (1) different intervals
of observations, (2) different statistics and (3) different methods of event
identification and comparison.
  Results. Our analysis shows that magnitude of geomagnetic storms is likely to
be independent on X-ray class of solar flares.

Rayleigh-B\'enard convection and aims at testing the applicability of
Kolmogorov (1941) and Bolgiano (1959) theories for this flow. Particular
emphasis is laid on anisotropic and inhomogeneous effects: the SO(3)
decomposition of structure functions (Arad et al 1999) and a method of
description of inhomogeneities proposed by Danaila et al (2001) are used to
derive inhomogeneous and anisotropic generalizations of Kolmogorov and Yaglom
equations applying to RB convection. The various terms in these equations are
computed using data from a DNS of turbulent Boussinesq convection at
$\rayleigh=10^6$ and $\prandtl=1$ with aspect ratio A=5. The analysis of the
isotropic component demonstrates that the shape of the third-order velocity
structure function is significantly influenced by buoyancy forcing and
large-scale inhomogeneities, while the mixed third-order structure function
appearing in Yaglom equation exhibits a clear scaling exponent 1 in a small
range of scales. The magnitudes of the various low $\ell$ degree anisotropic
components of the equations are also estimated and are shown to be comparable
to their isotropic counterparts at moderate to large scales. Finally, a
qualitative analysis shows that the influence of buoyancy forcing at scales
smaller than the Bolgiano scale is likely to remain important up to
$\rayleigh=10^9$, thus preventing Kolmogorov scalings from showing up in
convective flows at lower Rayleigh numbers.

initio Quantum Mechanics calculations including electron correlation at the MP2
level to describe the system, and we measure the conformational dependence of
all the correcting terms to the naive CED based in the Potential Energy Surface
(PES) that appear when the constraints are considered. These terms are related
to mass-metric tensors determinants and also occur in the Fixman's compensating
potential. We show that some of the corrections are non-negligible if one is
interested in the whole Ramachandran space. On the other hand, if only the
energetically lower region, containing the principal secondary structure
elements, is assumed to be relevant, then, all correcting terms may be
neglected up to peptides of considerable length. This is the first time, as far
as we know, that the analysis of the conformational dependence of these
correcting terms is performed in a relevant biomolecule with a realistic
potential energy function.

receiver making a measurement on the system so as to distinguish as well as
possible the alphabet of states used by the sender. We consider the situation
in which this measurement takes an appreciable time. In this case the
measurement must be described by a continuous measurement process. We consider
a continuous implementation of the optimal measurement for distinguishing
between two non-orthogonal states, and show that feedback control can be used
during this measurement to increase the rate at which the information regarding
the initial preparation is obtained. We show that while the maximum obtainable
increase is modest, the effect is purely quantum mechanical in the sense that
the enhancement is only possible when the initial states are non-orthogonal. We
find further that the enhancement in the rate of information gain is achieved
at the expense of reducing the total information which the measurement can
extract in the long-time limit.

In particular, we concentrate on relaxation of time evolving quantum state in
terms of W(x), starting from a coherent state. We have shown that for a
classically chaotic quantum counterpart the distribution P(w) in the
semi-classical limit becomes a Gaussian distribution that is fully determined
by the first two moments. Numerical simulations have been performed for the
quantum sawtooth map and the quantized kicked top. In a quantum system with
Hilbert space dimension N (similar 1/hbar) the transition of P(w) to a Gaussian
distribution was observed at times t proportional to log N. In addition, it has
been shown that the statistics of Wigner functions of propagator eigenstates is
Gaussian as well in the classically fully chaotic regime. We have also studied
the structure of the nodal cells of the Wigner function, in particular the
distribution of intersection points between the zero manifold and arbitrary
straight lines.

spin and one conduction electron spin is given by a Werner state. We find that
the impurity spin is not entangled with one conduction electron spin even

approach to improve dramatically both the security and the performance of
practical QKD set-ups. Recently, many theoretical efforts have been made on
this topic and have theoretically predicted the high performance of decoy
method. However, the gap between theory and experiment remains open. In this
paper, we report the first experiments on decoy state QKD, thus bridging the
gap. Two protocols of decoy state QKD are implemented: one-decoy protocol over
15km of standard telecom fiber, and weak+vacuum protocol over 60km of standard
telecom fiber. We implemented the decoy state method on a modified commercial
QKD system. The modification we made is simply adding commercial acousto-optic
modulator (AOM) on the QKD system. The AOM is used to modulate the intensity of
each signal individually, thus implementing the decoy state method. As an
important part of implementation, numerical simulation of our set-up is also
performed. The simulation shows that standard security proofs give a zero key
generation rate at the distance we perform decoy state QKD (both 15km and
60km). Therefore decoy state QKD is necessary for long distance secure
communication. Our implementation shows explicitly the power and feasibility of
decoy method, and brings it to our real-life.
