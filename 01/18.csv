for studying the interplay between propagation effects, which are extrinsic to
the source and source intrinsic variability. On the basis of VLBI experiments
performed at 1.6, 5, 8, 15, 22, and 43GHz between 1992-2003 and parallel
multi-frequency monitoring of the total flux density, we investigated the
variability of total flux density and source structure. Below 8 GHz, the
point-like VLBI source is affected by scatter-broadening of the turbulent
interstellar medium, which is located along the line of sight and likely
associated with the Cygnus region. We present and discuss the measured
frequency dependence of the source size, which shows a power-law with slope of
-1.91+/-0.05. From the measured scattering angle at 1GHz of 77.1+/-4.0mas a
SM=0.43+/-0.04 m^{-20/3} kpc is derived, consistent with the general properties
of the ISM in this direction. The decreasing effect of angular broadening
towards higher frequencies allows to study the internal structure of the
source. Above 8GHz new VLBI observations reveal a one-sided slightly
south-bending core-jet structure, with stationary and apparent superluminally
moving jet components. The jet components move on non-ballistic trajectories.
In AGN, total flux density variations are often related to the emergence of new
VLBI components. However, during almost eleven years no new component was
ejected in B2005+403. In the flux density variability a trough is observed at
5-37 GHz between 1996 and 2001. This can be explained as a blending effect of
jet component fluxes. Dense in time sampled flux density monitoring
observations reveal intra-day variability at 1.6GHz impling a second, less
dense or turbulent scattering screen at few to hundred parsec distance.

compact groups from the distant DPOSS survey that extends the available surveys
of compact groups of galaxies to z ~0.2 in redshift, mainly Hickson Compact
Groups and Southern Compact Groups. The goal of our survey was to confirm group
membership via redshift information and to measure the characteristic
parameters of a representative, albeit small, sample of DPOSS survey groups.
  Of the 18 candidates observed, seven are found to be indeed isolated compact
groups, i.e. groups with 3 or more concordant members and with no neighbouring
known cluster, while 7 are chance projection configurations on the sky. Three
remaining candidates, despite having 3 or more concordant member galaxies, are
located in the neighbourhood of known clusters, while another candidate turned
out to be a dense sub-condensation within Abell 0952.
  The median redshift of our 7 confirmed groups is z ~0.12, to be compared with
a median redshift of 0.03 for the local sample of compact groups by Hickson.
The typical group size is r~ 50 kpc, and the median radial velocity dispersion
is 167 km/s, while typical crossing times range from 0.005 H$_{0}^{-1}$ to 0.03
H$_{0}^{-1}$ with a median value of 0.018 H$_{0}^{-1}$, all similar to the
values usually found in the literature for such structures in the local
universe. The average mass-to-light ratio for our groups, M/L(B), is 92h,
higher than the value found for nearby Hickson compact groups but lower than
that found for loose groups. Our results suggest that, once full redshift
information for its members becomes available, the DPOSS sample will provide a
reference sample to study the properties of compact groups beyond the local
universe.

presented, which takes full advantage of the assets of a system of Atmospheric
Cherenkov Telescopes combining stereoscopy and fine-grain imaging like the High
Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.). The rich information collected by the
cameras allows to select electromagnetic showers on the basis of their
rotational symmetry with respect to the incident direction, as well as of their
relatively small lateral spread. In the framework of a 3D-model of the shower,
its main parameters -- incident direction, shower core position on the ground,
slant depth of shower maximum, average lateral spread of Cherenkov photon
origins (or ``photosphere 3D-width'') and primary energy -- are fitted to the
pixel contents of the different images. For gamma-ray showers, the photosphere
3D-width is found to scale with the slant depth of shower maximum, an effect
related to the variation of the Cherenkov threshold with the altitude; this
property allows to define a dimensionless quantity omega (the ``reduced
3D-width''), which turns out to be an efficient and robust variable to
discriminate gamma-rays from primary hadrons. In addition, the omega
distribution varies only slowly with the gamma-ray energy and is practically
independent of the zenith angle. The performance of the method as applied to
H.E.S.S. is presented. Depending on the requirements imposed to reconstructed
showers, the angular resolution at zenith varies from 0.04 to 0.1 degrees and
the spectral resolution in the same conditions from 15% to 20%.

study intergalactic HeII absorption. Together with another newly discovered QSO

of which 4 are located within the redshift region 2.76<=z<=3.28 covered by the

forest spectra with the locations of known quasars. There is no significant
proximity effect in the HI Lyman alpha forest for any of the QSOs, except for
the well-known line of sight effect for Q0302-003 itself. By comparing the
absorption properties in HI and HeII, we estimated the fluctuating hardness of
the extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that
close to each foreground quasar, the ionizing background is considerably harder
than on average. In particular, our newly discovered QSO03027-0010 shows such a
hardness increase despite being associated with an overdensity in the HI Lyman
forest. We argue that the spectral hardness is a sensitive physical measure to
reveal the influence of QSOs onto the UV background even over scales of several
Mpc, and that it breaks the density degeneracy hampering the traditional
transverse proximity effect analysis. We infer from our sample that there is no
need for significantly anisotropic UV radiation from the QSOs. From the
transverse proximity effect detected in the sample we obtain minimum quasar
lifetimes in the range ~10-30 Myr.

subtending an angle of 130$^\circ$ with an X-ray tail extending $\sim$ 70 kpc
in the opposite direction. The temperature of the gas inside and outside the
discontinuity is 0.79$\pm$0.03 and 0.81$\pm$0.07 keV, respectively. There is
marginal evidence for a discontinuous change in the elemental abundance

several scenarios for the origin of the edge and the tail including a radio

possibility that NGC 7618 is falling into UGC 12491, or that both groups are

additional constraint arises from the limits on Omega_nr from the relative

prefers a region of parameter space that has a significant overlap with the

time varying dark energy, we show that constraints on evolution of dark energy
density are almost independent of the type of variation assumed for the
equation of state parameter. This makes it easy to get approximate constraints

is considered. The metastable states reached by such dynamics are atypical of
such states as a whole, in that the probability density of site energies,
$p(\lambda)$, is small at $\lambda=0$. Since virtually all metastable states
have a much larger $p(0)$, this behavior demonstrates a qualitative failure of
the Edwards hypothesis. We look for its origins by modelling the changes in the
site energies during the dynamics as a Markov process. We show how the small
$p(0)$ arises from features of the Markov process that have a clear physical
basis in the spin-glass, and hence explain the failure of the Edwards
hypothesis.

levels. The leads are modeled using non-interacting tight-binding Hamiltonians.
The ground state at time zero is calculated at zero bias. Then, a small bias is
applied between the two leads, the wave-function is DMRG evolved in time, and
currents are measured as a function of time. Typically, the current is expected
to present periodicities over long times, involving intermediate well-defined
plateaus that resemble steady states. The conductance can be obtained from
those steady-state-like currents. To test this approach, several cases of
interacting and non-interacting systems have been studied. Our results show
excellent agreement with exact results in the non-interacting case. More
importantly, the technique also reproduces quantitatively well-established
results for the conductance and local density-of-states in both the cases of
one and two coupled interacting QD's. The technique also works at finite bias
voltages, and it can be extended to include interactions in the leads.

possibility of a re-entrant regime of the superconducting transition
temperature, $T_c$, in heavy fermion superconductors in a narrow range of model
parameters and concentration of f-electrons. Suppression of $T_c$ in mixed
valence superconductors is much weaker. Our theory has most validity in the
low-temperature Fermi liquid regime, without re-entrant behavior of $T_c$. To
check its applicability, we performed the fit for the $x$-dependence of $T_c$
in Ce$_{1-x}$La$_x$Ru$_3$Si$_2$ and obtained an excellent agreement with the
experimental data, although no re-entrance was found in this case. Other
experimental data are discussed in the light of our theoretical analysis. In
particular, we compare temperatures of the superconducting transition for some
known homologs, i.e., the analog periodic lattice compounds with and without
f-elements. For a few pairs of homologs superconductivity exists only in the
heavy fermion materials, thus confirming uniqueness of superconductivity
mechanisms for the latter. We suggest that for some other compounds the value
of $T_c$ may remain of the same order in the two homologs, if superconductivity
originates mainly on some light Fermi surface, but induces sizable
superconducting gap on another Fermi surface,for which hybridization or other
heavy fermion effects are more significant.

mass. In this paper we begin a model independent analysis of the phenomenology

under a parity which is responsible for the stability of a WIMP dark matter
candidate, N. We focus on three questions to be explored at the LHC: discovery
opportunities, mass determination, and spin determination of this top partner.

easily discovered in the t\bar{t}+2N decay with the tops decaying fully
hadronically. We show that without having to rely on other channels for new
physics that for a a given t' spin the masses of t' and N can be measured using
kinematic information (e.g. average MET or H_T) and total cross section. A
degeneracy due to the spin remains, but with several hundred inverse fb of

compute the experimentally unobservable, but physically interesting vector
form-factors of the $\eta_c, J/\psi$ and $\chi_{c0}$.
  To this end we apply an ambitious combination of lattice techniques,
computing three-point functions with heavy domain wall fermions on an
anisotropic lattice within the quenched approximation. With an anisotropy
$\xi=3$ at $a_s \sim 0.1 \mathrm{fm}$ we find a reasonable gross spectrum and a
hyperfine splitting $\sim 90 \mathrm{MeV}$, which compares favourably with
other improved actions.
  In general, after extrapolation of lattice data at non-zero $Q^2$ to the
photopoint, our results agree within errors with all well measured experimental
values. Furthermore, results are compared with the expectations of simple quark
models where we find that many features are in agreement; beyond this we
propose the possibility of constraining such models using our extracted values

The more regular infrared behavior of some peculiar combinations of Sudakov

approaches to power corrections is explained, and a possible resolution is
proposed, which makes use of the arbitrariness of the choice of exponentiated

effective coupling at large Nf follows naturally from these considerations. In
this last version, a new result is presented: the striking emergence of an

characteristics of a proton. There are no direct ways to model the orbital
angular momentum. However, the Jz=1/2 sum rule includes an angular momentum
component and can provide indirect access to its properties. One of the other
unknowns in the sum rule is the gluon polarization. We can define the gluon
spin asymmetry in a proton as the ratio of the polarized to unpolarized gluon
distributions. This can be written as a sum of a scale-invariant piece and a
small scale-dependent term. The x-dependence of the asymmetry can be calculated
and a suitable parametrization for scale-dependent term can be made to estimate
this asymmetry. When combined with the measured unpolarized gluon density, this
provides a model independent prediction for the polarized gluon distribution.
This eliminates one unknown in the Jz=1/2 sum rule and allows a reasonable
estimate for the size and evolution of the orbital angular momentum of the
constituents.

all d-tuples x_1...x_d in T_1x...xT_d with h(x_1)+...+h(x_d)=0, equipped with a

finitely presented group into which the lamplighter group embeds naturally.
Also when d>=4 and q_1=...=q_d=q is such that each prime power in the
decomposition of q is larger than d-1, we show that DL is a Cayley graph of a
finitely presented group. This group is of type F_{d-1}, but not F_d. It is not
automatic, but it is an automata group in most cases.
  On the other hand, when the q_j do not all coincide, DL(q_1,...,q_d) is a
vertex-transitive graph, but is not the Cayley graph of a finitely generated
group. Indeed, it does not even admit a group action with finitely many orbits
and finite point stabilizers.
  The l^2-spectrum of the ``simple random walk'' operator on DL is always pure
point. When d=2, it is known explicitly from previous work, while for d=3 we
compute it explicitly. Finally, we determine the Poisson boundary of a large
class of group-invariant random walks on DL. It coincides with a part of the
geometric boundary of DL.

1940, asks one to describe the effect of attaching one or more cells, on the
algebraic invariants of a topological space. This thesis studies the effect of
cell attachments on loop space homology. It generalizes previous work by D.
Anick on spherical 2-cones, and S. Halperin, J.-M. Lemaire and others on inert
attaching maps.
  It is assumed that the loop space homology of the base space is torsion-free.
Two classes of attaching maps are introduced: free and semi-inert attaching
maps. For these cases, the loop space homology is calculated as a module and as
an algebra, respectively, and is shown to have a surprisingly simple form.
These results are also presented in terms of extensions of differential graded
algebras.
  The second part of the thesis uses Adams-Hilton models and the previous
results to prove that the loop space homology of certain CW complexes is
generated by Hurewicz images. This can sometimes be used to show that the loop
space of a finite complex is, after localizing away from finitely many primes,
homotopy equivalent to a product of spheres and loops on spheres.
  A lemma, which may of independent interest, generalizes the Schreier
property, which states that a Lie subalgebra of a free (graded) Lie algebra is
also a free Lie algebra.

we develop a new algorithm for constructing stationary complex-valued
algebro-geometric solutions of the Toda hierarchy, which is of independent
interest as it solves the inverse algebro-geometric spectral problem for
generally non-self-adjoint Jacobi operators, starting from a suitably chosen
set of initial divisors of full measure. Combined with an appropriate
first-order system of differential equations with respect to time (a substitute
for the well-known Dubrovin equations), this yields the construction of global
algebro-geometric solutions of the time-dependent Toda hierarchy.
  The inherent non-self-adjointness of the underlying Lax (i.e., Jacobi)
operator associated with complex-valued coefficients for the Toda hierarchy
poses a variety of difficulties that, to the best of our knowledge, are
successfully overcome here for the first time. Our approach is not confined to

of walks along complex networks. Each subset of knowledge is represented as a
node, and relations between such knowledge are expressed as edges. Two types of
edges are considered, corresponding to free and conditional transitions. The
latter case implies that a node can only be reached after visiting previously a
set of nodes (the required conditions). The process of knowledge acquisition
can then be simulated by considering the number of nodes visited as a single
agent moves along the network, starting from its lowest layer. It is shown that
hierarchical networks, i.e. networks composed of successive interconnected
layers, arise naturally as a consequence of compositions of the prerequisite
relationships between the nodes. In order to avoid deadlocks, i.e. unreachable
nodes, the subnetwork in each layer is assumed to be a connected component.
Several configurations of such hierarchical knowledge networks are simulated
and the performance of the moving agent quantified in terms of the percentage
of visited nodes after each movement. The Barab\'asi-Albert and random models
are considered for the layer and interconnecting subnetworks. Although all
subnetworks in each realization have the same number of nodes, several
interconnectivities, defined by the average node degree of the interconnection
networks, have been considered. Two visiting strategies are investigated:
random choice among the existing edges and preferential choice to so far
untracked edges. A series of interesting results are obtained, including the

evolution in catastrophic structural prob-lems, such as lack of invariant basic
measurement units, loss of stable numerical predictions, absence of reliable

(low momentum behaviour) with an index depending on the scaling index of the
random flow and of the index of the random forcing. If the velocity has
correlations growing with the distance (a turbulent flow) then the large
distance correlations depend in a crucial way on the scaling index of the

  GATA-1 and PU.1","27 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in Journal of
  Theoretical Biology",,,,"q-bio.MN q-bio.QM",,"  In addition to their self-renewal capabilities, hematopoietic stem cells
guarantee the continuous supply of fully differentiated, functional cells of
various types in the peripheral blood. The process which controls
differentiation into the different lineages of the hematopoietic system
(erythroid, myeloid, lymphoid) is referred to as lineage specification. It
requires a potentially multi-step decision sequence which determines the fate
of the cells and their successors. It is generally accepted that lineage
specification is regulated by a complex system of interacting transcription
factors. However, the underlying principles controlling this regulation are
currently unknown.
  Here, we propose a simple quantitative model describing the interaction of
two transcription factors. This model is motivated by experimental observations
on the transcription factors GATA-1 and PU.1, both known to act as key
regulators and potential antagonists in the erythroid vs. myeloid
differentiation processes of hematopoietic progenitor cells. We demonstrate the
ability of the model to account for the observed switching behavior of a
transition from a state of low expression of both factors (undifferentiated
state) to the dominance of one factor (differentiated state). Depending on the
parameter choice, the model predicts two different possibilities to explain the
experimentally suggested, stem cell characterizing priming state of low level
co-expression. Whereas increasing transcription rates are sufficient to induce
differentiation in one scenario, an additional system perturbation (by
stochastic fluctuations or directed impulses) of transcription factor levels is
required in the other case.

each of which is prepared in one of the six states, is used directly to encode
classical information in the quantum secret sharing process. In this scheme,
each of all $m$ members in group 1 choose randomly their own secret key
individually and independently, and then directly encode their respective
secret information on the states of single photons via unitary operations, then
the last one (the $m$th member of group 1) sends $1/n$ of the resulting qubits
to each of group 2. By measuring their respective qubits, all members in group
2 share the secret information shared by all members in group 1. The secret
message shared by group 1 and group 2 in such a way that neither subset of each
group nor the union of a subset of group 1 and a subset of group 2 can extract
the secret message, but each whole group (all the members of each group) can.
The scheme is asymptotically 100% in efficiency. It makes the Trojan horse
attack with a multi-photon signal, the fake-signal attack with EPR pairs, the
attack with single photons, and the attack with invisible photons to be
nullification. We show that it is secure and has an advantage over the one

success probabilities for dishonest agent eavesdropping encryption using the

dramatically change the final answer by upsetting the delicate cancellation

quantum fluctuations. It is well known that quantities which are linear in a
free quantum field have a Gaussian distribution. Here it will be argued that
quadratic quantities, such as the quantum stress tensor, must have a skewed
distribution. Some possible implications of this result for inflationary
cosmology will be discussed. In particular, this might be a source for

attack targeting two practical bidirectional QKD systems (the ""plug & play""

unaware of our attack, the final key shared between them can be compromised in
some situations. Specifically, we showed that, in the case of the
Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol with ideal single-photon sources, when
the quantum bit error rate (QBER) is between 14.6% and 20%, our attack renders
the final key insecure, whereas the same range of QBER values has been proved
secure if the two users are unaware of our attack; also, we demonstrated three
situations with realistic devices where positive key rates are obtained without
the consideration of Trojan horse attacks but in fact no key can be distilled.
We remark that our attack is feasible with only current technology. Therefore,
it is very important to be aware of our attack in order to ensure absolute
security. In finding our attack, we minimize the QBER over individual
measurements described by a general POVM, which has some similarity with the
standard quantum state discrimination problem.

other hand, do not require active error correction, but perform poorly in terms
of minimum distance. In this paper, examples of degenerate quantum codes are
constructed that have better minimum distance than decoherence free subspaces
and allow some errors of small weight that do not require active error
correction. In particular, two new families of [[n,1,>= sqrt(n)]]_q degenerate
quantum codes are derived from classical duadic codes.

  Characterization by Quantum Interference","long version, 16 pages","Phys. Rev. A 74, 063808 (2006)",,,"quant-ph",,"  We present a multi-mode model to describe an arbitrary N-photon state with a
wide spectral range and some arbitrary temporal distribution. In general, some
of the $N$ photons are spread out in time while other may overlap and become
indistinguishable. From this model, we find that the temporal
(in)distinguishability of photons is related to the exchange symmetry of the
multi-photon wave function. We find that simple multi-photon detection scheme
gives rise to a more general photon bunching effect with the famous two-photon
effect as a special case. We then send this N-photon state into a recently
discovered multi-photon interference scheme. We calculate the visibility of the
multi-photon interference scheme and find that it is related to the temporal
distinguishability of the $N$ photons. Maximum visibility of one is achieved
for the indistinguishable N-photon state whereas the visibility degrades when
some of the photons are separated and become distinguishable. Thus we can
identify an experimentally measurable quantity that may quantitatively define
the degree of indistinguishability of an N-photon state. This presents a
quantitative demonstration of the complementary principle of quantum
interference.

secret transmitting order of particles. In these protocols, the secret
transmitting order of particles ensures the security of communication, and no
secret messages are leaked even if the communication is interrupted for
security. This strategy of security for communication is also generalized to
quantum dialogue. It not only ensures the unconditional security but also
improves the efficiency of communication.

quantum information within many quantum computer implementations. Here we
describe a new design for a q-wire with perfect transmission using a uniformly
coupled Ising spin chain subject to global (homogeneously-applied) pulses.
Besides allowing for perfect transport of single qubits, the design also yields
the perfect ``mirroring'' of multiply encoded qubits within the wire. We
further utilise this global-pulse generated perfect mirror operation as a
``clock cycle'' to perform universal quantum computation on these multiply
encoded qubits. We demonstrate the operation of single and two-qubit quantum
logic gates and show that only $N-1$ complete mirror cycles are required to
execute a quantum Fourier transform on $N$ qubits encoded within the q-wire.
