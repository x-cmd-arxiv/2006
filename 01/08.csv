medium irradiated by the far ultra-violet radiation from local star-forming
regions, and it calculates thermal and ionization equilibrium between cooling
and heating. The model allows us to predict the mass fraction of a cold neutral
medium (CNM) embedded in a warm neutral medium (WNM). Our cosmological SPH
simulations include a treatment of radiative cooling/heating, star formation,
and feedback effects from supernovae and galactic winds. Using our method, we
make predictions for the [CII] luminosity from high-redshift galaxies which can

effects to obtain the correct temperature dependence of sigma(omega, T), and to
consider polarization oscillations to obtain the correct frequency dependence.
We have therefore generalized the Ambegaokar-Eckern-Schoen (AES) model for
granular metals to obtain an effective field theory incorporating the
polarization fluctuations of the individual metallic grains. In contrast to the
DC conductivity, which is determined by inter-grain charge transfer and obeys
an Arrhenius law at low temperature, the AC conductivity is dominated by a
resonance peak for intra-grain polarization oscillations, which has a power-law
tail at low frequencies. More importantly, although the resonance frequency
agrees with the classical prediction, the resonance width depends on intergrain
quantum tunneling and Coulomb blockade parameters, in addition to the classical
Drude relaxation within the grain. This additional damping is due to inelastic
cotunneling of polarization fluctuations to neighbouring grains and it
qualitatively differs from the DC conductivity in its temperature dependence
quite unlike the expectation from Drude theory.

resonantly excited by the gravitomagnetic tidal field of its companion. This
post-Newtonian gravitomagnetic driving of these modes dominates over the
Newtonian tidal driving previously computed by Ho and Lai. To leading order in
the tidal expansion parameter R/r (where R is the radius of the neutron star
and r is the orbital separation), only the l=2, |m|= 1 and |m| = 2 r-modes are
excited. The tidal work done on the star through this driving has an effect on
the evolution of the inspiral and on the phasing of the emitted gravitational
wave signal. For a neutron star of mass M, radius R, spin frequency f_spin,
modeled as a Gamma =2 polytrope, with a companion also of mass M, the
gravitational wave phase shift for the m=2 mode is
(0.1radians)(R/10km)^4(M/1.4M_sun)^{-10/3}(f_spin/100Hz)^{2/3} for optimal spin
orientation. For canonical neutron star parameters this phase shift will likely
not be detectable by gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO, but if the
neutron star radius is larger it may be detectable if the signal-to-noise ratio
is moderately large. For neutron star - black hole binaries, the effect is
smaller; the phase shift scales as companion mass to the -4/3 power for large
companion masses. The net energy transfer from the orbit into the star is
negative corresponding to a slowing down of the inspiral. This occurs because
the interaction reduces the spin of the star, and occurs only for modes which
satisfy the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instability criterion.
