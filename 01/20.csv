of elliptical galaxies contribute significantly to the build-up of the massive
end of the red sequence. We perform a series of major merger simulations to
investigate the spatial and velocity structure of the remnants of such mergers.
Regardless of orbital energy or angular momentum, we find that the stellar
remnants lie on the fundamental plane defined by their progenitors, a result of
virial equilibrium with a small tilt due to an increasing central dark matter
fraction. However, the locations of merger remnants in the projections of the
fundamental plane -- the Faber-Jackson and R_e-M_* relations -- depend strongly
on the merger orbit, and the relations steepen significantly from the canonical
scalings (L sigma^4 and R_e M_*^0.6) for mergers on radial orbits. Our results
imply that the projections of the fundamental plane -- but not necessarily the
plane itself -- provide a powerful way of investigating the assembly history of
massive elliptical galaxies, including the brightest cluster galaxies at or
near the centers of galaxy clusters. We argue that most massive ellipticals are
formed by anisotropic merging and that their fundamental plane projections
should thus differ noticeably from those of lower mass ellipticals even though
they should lie on the same fundamental plane. Current observations are
consistent with this conclusion. The steepening in the L-sigma relation for
luminous ellipticals may also be reflected in a corresponding steepening in the
M_BH-sigma relation for massive black holes.

high-redshift dwarf galaxies and dissipationless simulations of a Milky Way
sized halo to estimate the expected abundance and spatial distribution of the
dwarf satellite galaxies that formed most of their stars around z~8 and evolved
only little since then. Such galaxies can be considered as fossils of the
reionization era, and studying their properties could provide a direct window
into the early, pre-reionization stages of galaxy formation. We show that 5-15%
of the objects existing at z~8 do indeed survive until the present in the MW
like environment without significant evolution. This implies that it is
plausible that the fossil dwarf galaxies do exist in the Local Group. Because
such galaxies form their stellar systems early during the period of active
merging and accretion, they should have spheroidal morphology regardless of
their current distance from the host galaxy. We show that both the expected
luminosity function and spatial distribution of dark matter halos which are
likely to host fossil galaxies agree reasonably well with the observed
distributions of the luminous (L_V>10^6 Lsun) Local Group fossil candidates
near the host galaxy (d<200 kpc). However, the predicted abundance is
substantially larger (by a factor of 2-3) for fainter galaxies (L_V<10^6 Lsun)

this discrepancy.

effectively stall at the dark matter core radius. We conclude that the Fornax

generated by the Spot. We confirm the robustness of that detection, since the
probability of obtaining this deviation by chance is 0.69%. Afterwards, the

that the flat frequency dependence of the Spot cannot be explained by a thermal

BD +40 4124 in the dense molecular gas tracer CS J=2-1 and the continuum dust
continuum at 3.1 mm and 850 micron. The dense gas and dust in the system is
aligned into a long ridge morphology extending ~0.4 pc with 16 gas clumps of
estimated masses ranging from 0.14 - 1.8 Solar masses. A north-south variation
in the CS center line velocity can be explained with a two cloud model. We
posit that the BD +40 4124 stellar cluster formed from a cloud-cloud collision.
The largest linewidths occur near V1318 Cyg-S, a massive star affecting its
natal environment. In contrast, the dense gas near the other, more evolved,
massive stars displays no evidence for disruption; the material must either be
processed into the star, dissipate, or relax, fairly quickly. The more evolved
low-mass protostars are more likely to be found near the massive stars. If the
majority of low-mass stars are coeval, the seemingly evolved low-mass
protostars are not older: the massive stars have eroded their structures.
Finally, at the highest resolution, the 3.1 mm dust emission is resolved into a
flattened structure 3100 by 1500 AU with an estimated mass of 3.4 Solar masses.
The continuum and CS emission are offset by 1.1 arcsec from the southern binary
source. A simple estimate of the extinction due to the continuum emission
structure is AV = 700 mag. From the offset and as the southern source is
detected in the optical, the continuum emission is from a previously unknown
very young, intermediate-mass, embedded stellar object. (see high resolution

interferometric observations of dusty disks surrounding pre-main sequence stars

interferometric observations of six intermediate mass pre-main sequence stars
(CQ Tau, VV Ser, MWC 480, MWC 758, V1295 Aql and AB Aur) in the framework of a
more detailed physical model of the inner region of the dusty disk. Our aim is
to verify whether the model will allow us to constrain the disk and dust
properties. METHODS: Observed visibilities from the literature are compared
with theoretical visibilities from our model. With the assumption that
silicates are the most refractory dust species, our model computes
self-consistently the shape and emission of the inner edge of the dusty disk
(and hence its visibilities for given interferometer con gurations). The only
free parameters in our model are the inner disk orientation and the size of the
dust grains. RESULTS: In all objects with the exception of AB Aur, our
self-consistent models reproduce both the interferometric results and the
near-infrared spectral energy distribution. In four cases, grains larger than
1.2 micron, and possibly much larger are either required by or consistent with
the observations. The inclination of the inner disk is found to be always
larger than 30 deg, and in at least two objects much larger.

of the unique SDI device, we discovered a substellar companion to SCR 1845 at a
separation of 4.5 AU (1.170''+-0.003'' on the sky) and fainter by 3.57+-0.057
mag in the 1.575 um SDI filter. This substellar companion has an H magnitude of
13.16+0.31-0.26 (absolute H magnitude of 15.30+0.31-0.26), making it likely the
brightest mid-T dwarf known. The unique Simultaneous Differential Imager (SDI)
consists of 3 narrowband filters placed around the 1.6 um methane absorption
feature characteristic of T-dwarfs (Teff < 1200 K). The flux of the substellar
companion drops by a factor of 2.7+-0.1 between the SDI F1(1.575 um) filter and
the SDI F3(1.625 um) filter, consistent with strong methane absorption in a
substellar companion. We estimate a spectral type of T5.5+-1 for the companion
based on the strength of this methane break. The chances that this object is a
background T dwarf are vanishing small -- and there is no isolated background
T-dwarf in this part of the sky according to 2MASS. Thus, it is a bound
companion, hereafter SCR 1845-6357B. For an age range of 100 Myr - 10 Gyr and

The method, ``smear fitting'', makes the constraints necessary for
interferometric imaging double as a model, with uncertainties, of the sky
brightness distribution. It does this by modelling the sky with a set of
functions and then convolving each component with its own elliptical gaussian
to account for the uncertainty in its shape and location that arises from
noise. This yields much sharper resolution than CLEAN for significantly
detected features, without sacrificing any sensitivity. Using appropriate
functional forms for the components provides both a scientifically interesting
model and imaging constraints that tend to be better than those used by
traditional deconvolution methods. This allows it to avoid the most serious
problems that limit the imaging quality of those methods. Comparisons of smear
fitting to CLEAN and maximum entropy are given, using both real and simulated
observations. It is also shown that the famous Rayleigh criterion (resolution =
wavelength / baseline) is inappropriate for interferometers as it does not
consider the reliability of the measurements.

constructed with pulsation codes that include turbulent convection, and the
properties of these models are studied at maximum, mean and minimum light. As
with Galactic models, at maximum light the photosphere is located next to the
HIF for the LMC models. However very different behavior is found at minimum
light. The long period (P>10days) LMC models imply that the photosphere is
disengaged from the HIF at minimum light, similar to the Galactic models, but
there are some indications that the photosphere is located near the HIF for the
short period (P<10 days) LMC models. We also use the updated LMC data to derive
empirical PC and AC relations at these phases. Our numerical models are broadly
consistent with our theory and the observed data, though we discuss some
caveats in the paper. We apply the idea of the HIF-photosphere interaction to
explain recent suggestions that the LMC period-luminosity (PL) and PC relations
are non-linear with a break at a period close to 10 days. Our empirical PC and
PL relations are also found to be non-linear with the F-test. Our explanation
relies on the properties of the Saha ionization equation, the HIF-photosphere
interaction and the way this interaction changes with the phase of pulsation
and metallicity to produce the observed changes in the Cepheid PC and PL
relations.

Cepheids, together with existing data on Galactic Cepheids, are combined to
study the period-colour (PC) and amplitude-colour (AC) relations as a function
of pulsation phase. Our results confirm earlier work that the LMC PC relation
(at mean light) is more consistent with two lines of differing slopes,
separated at a period of 10 days. However, our multi-phase PC relations reveal
much new structure which can potentially increase our understanding of Cepheid
variables. These multi-phase PC relations provide insight into why the Galactic
PC relation is linear but the LMC PC relation is non-linear. This is because
the LMC PC relation is shallower for short (log P < 1) and steeper for long
(log P > 1) period Cepheids than the corresponding Galactic PC relation. Both
of the short and long period Cepheids in all three galaxies exhibit the
steepest and shallowest slopes at phases around 0.75-0.85, respectively. A
consequence is that the PC relation at phase ~0.8 is highly non-linear.
Further, the Galactic and LMC Cepheids with log P > 1 display a flat slope in
the PC plane at phases close to the maximum light. When the LMC
period-luminosity (PL) relation is studied as a function of phase, we confirm
that it changes with the PC relation. The LMC PL relation in V- and I-band near
the phase of 0.8 provides compelling evidence that this relation is also
consistent with two lines of differing slopes joined at a period close to 10
days.

the nearest globular cluster, using a technique suggested by T. Maccarone.
These mass estimates have been derived from 3sigma upper limits on the radio
continuum flux at 1.4 GHz, assuming that the putative central black hole
accretes the surrounding matter at a rate between 0.1% and 1% of the Bondi
accretion rate. For 47Tuc, we find a 3sigma upper limit of 2060 - 670 solar
masses, depending on the actual accretion rate of the black hole and the
distance to 47Tuc. For NGC6397, which is closer to us, we derive a 3sigma upper
limit of 1290 - 390 solar masses. While estimating mass upper-limits based on
radio continuum observations requires making assumptions about the gas density
and the accretion rate of the black hole, their derivation does not require
complex and time consuming dynamical modeling. Thus, this method offers an
independent way of estimating black hole masses in nearby globular clusters.
If, generally, central black holes in stellar systems accrete matter faster

evidence that the Universe is currently accelerating and it accelerated in the

accelerated in the past. The results obtained from the 157 gold sample

comparable because the two different data sets measure the luminosity distance
up to different redshifts.
  We then use the Friedmann equation and a dark energy parametrization to
discuss the same problem. When we fit the model to the supernova Ia data alone,
we find weak evidence that the Universe is accelerating and the current matter
density is higher than that measured from other experiments. After we add the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey data to constrain the dark energy model, we find that
the behavior of the deceleration parameter is almost the same as that obtained

grows through Bondi accretion and a fraction of the accretion power is
distributed as thermal feedback into the surrounding gas. The gas expands or
contracts until AGN heating and radiative cooling balance each other. The
balance of heating and cooling is used to determine a quasi-equilibrium
temperature at which the black hole accretes in self-regulated equilibrium with
the surrounding intergalactic medium. This temperature grows with the black
hole mass. The temperature increase is very steep around a critical black hole
mass due to the shape of the cooling function. The quasi-equilibrium
temperature cannot exceed the virial temperature or the AGN will drive a
thermal wind. This limits the black hole mass to a maximum value determined by
the depth of the potential well. In the regime in which cooling is dominated by
bremsstrahlung, this model determines a relation between black hole mass and
halo characteristic velocity of the form M_BH ~ v^4. The predictions of the

have determined effective temperature and luminosity, then mass and position in

sequence band. We show that this inhomogeneous age distribution cannot be
attributed to the effects of random errors and small number statistics. Our
data suggest also that the surface magnetic flux of CP stars increases with
stellar age and mass, and correlates with the rotation period. For stars with
M>3Msun, rotation periods decrease with age in a way consistent with the
conservation of the angular momentum, while for less massive magnetic CP stars
an angular momentum loss cannot be ruled out. The mechanism that originates and
sustains the magnetic field in the upper main sequence stars may be different

been established using ultraviolet and far-infrared measurements, refining the
results of numerous measurements over the past decade. Taken together, the most
recent and robust data indicate a compellingly consistent picture of the SFH
out to redshift z~6, with especially tight constraints for z<~1. We fit these
data with simple analytical forms, and derive conservative bands to indicate
possible variations from the best fits. Since the z<~1 SFH data are quite
precise, we investigate the sequence of assumptions and corrections that
together affect the SFH normalisation, to test their accuracy, both in this
redshift range and beyond. As lower limits on this normalisation, we consider
the evolution in stellar mass density, metal mass density, and supernova rate
density, finding it unlikely that the SFH normalisation is much lower than
indicated by our direct fit. Additionally, predictions from the SFH for
supernova type Ia rate densities tentatively suggests delay times of ~3 Gyr. As
a corresponding upper limit on the SFH normalisation, we consider the
Super-Kamiokande (SK) limit on the electron antineutrino flux from past
core-collapse supernovae, which applies primarily to z<~1. We find consistency
with the SFH only if the neutrino temperatures from SN events are relatively
modest. Constraints on the assumed initial mass function (IMF) also become
apparent. The traditional Salpeter IMF, assumed for convenience by many
authors, is known to be a poor representation at low stellar masses (<~ 1 solar
mass), and we show that recently favoured IMFs are also constrained. In
particular, somewhat shallow, or top-heavy, IMFs may be preferred, although
they cannot be too top-heavy. (Abridged)

law. However, at smaller energies the continuum displays an excess with respect
to the extrapolation of this power law, called the ''soft X-ray excess''. Until
now this soft X-ray excess was attributed, either to reflection of the hard
X-ray source by the accretion disk, or to the presence of an additional
comptonizing medium, giving a steep spectrum. An alternative solution proposed
by Gierlinski and Done (2004) is that a single power law well represents both
the soft and the hard X-ray emission and the impression of the soft X-ray
excess is due to absorption of a primary power law by a relativistic wind. We
examine the advantages and drawbacks of reflection versus absorption models,
and we conclude that the observed spectra can be well modeled, either by
absorption (for a strong excess), or by reflection (for a weak excess). However
the physical conditions required by the absorption models do not seem very
realistic: we would prefer an ''hybrid model''.

and/or 24 um flux densities using a library of template SEDs, and L(IR,radio),
derived from the radio (1.4 and/or 8.5 GHz) using the radio-far infrared
correlation, agree with a 1-sigma dispersion of 40 %. We use the k-correction
as a tool to probe different parts of the MIR spectral energy distribution
(SED) of galaxies as a function of their redshift and find that on average
distant galaxies present MIR SEDs very similar to local ones. However, in the
redshift range z= 0.4-1.2, L(IR,24um) is in better agreement with L(IR,radio)
than L(IR,15 um) by 20 %, suggesting that the warm dust continuum is a better
tracer of the SFR than the broad emission features due to polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs). We find marginal evidence for an evolution with redshift
of the MIR SEDs: two thirds of the distant galaxies exhibit rest-frame MIR
colors (L(12 um)/L(7 um) and L(10 um)/L(15 um) luminosity ratios) below the
median value measured for local galaxies. Possible explanations are examined
but these results are not sufficient to constrain the physics of the emitting
regions. We compare three commonly used SED libraries which reproduce the
color-luminosity correlations of local galaxies with our data and discuss
possible refinements to the relative intensities of PAHs, warm dust continuum
and silicate absorption.

next generation of space observatories will directly detect photons from
planets in the habitable zones of nearby stars. The synergistic combination of
measurements of mass from astrometry and radial velocity, of radius and
composition from transits, and the wealth of information from the direct
detection of visible and mid-IR photons will create a rich field of comparative
planetology. Information on proto-planetary and debris disks will complete our
understanding of the evolution of habitable environments from the earliest
stages of planet-formation through to the transport into the inner solar system
of the volatiles necessary for life.
  The suite of missions necessary to carry out the search for nearby, habitable

VR optical observations of SBS 0909+532A,B and the field stars in 2003. The
frames were taken at Calar Alto, Maidanak and Wise observatories, and the VR
light curves of the field stars and quasar components are derived from aperture
and point-spread function fitting methods. We measure the R-band time delay of
the system from the chi-square and dispersion techniques and 1000 synthetic
light curves based on the observed records. One nearby field star (SBS
0909+532c) is found to be variable, and the other two nearby field stars are
non-variable sources. With respect to the quasar components, the R-band records
seem more reliable and are more densely populated than the V-band ones. The
observed R-band fluctuations permit a pre-conditioned measurement of the time
delay. From the chi-square minimization, if we assume that the quasar emission
is observed first in B and afterwards in A (in agreement with basic
observations of the system and the corresponding predictions), we obtain a
delay of - 45 (+ 1)/(- 11) days (95% confidence interval). The dispersion
technique leads to a similar delay range. A by-product of the analysis is the
determination of a totally corrected flux ratio in the R band (corrected by the
time delay and the contamination due to the galaxy light). Our 95% measurement
of this ratio (0.575 +/- 0.014 mag) is in excellent agreement with previous
results from contaminated fluxes at the same time of observation.

time. The absence of linear polarization sets a lower limit to the accretion

similar to the properties of Sgr A*, the central radio source in the Milky Way.

of 100 relative to iron and the Sun, in the heavy s-elements (Ba, La, ..). It
is also heavily enriched in Eu, which is generally considered an r-element, and
in other similar elements. It is less enriched, by about a factor of 10, in the
lighter s-elements (Sr, Y and Zr). C is also strongly enhanced and, to a
somewhat lesser degree, N and O. These abundance estimates are subject to
severe uncertainties due to NLTE and thermal inhomogeneities which are not
taken into detailed consideration. However, an interesting result, which is
most probably robust in spite of these uncertainties, emerges: the abundances
derived for this star are very similar to those of other stars with an overall
enhancement of all elements beyond the iron peak.
  We have defined criteria for this class of stars, r+s stars, and discuss nine
different scenarios to explain their origin. None of these explanations is
found to be entirely convincing. The most plausible hypotheses involve a binary
system in which the primary component goes through its giant branch and
asymptotic giant branch phases and produces CNO and s-elements which are dumped
onto the observed star. Whether the r-element Eu is produced by supernovae
before the star was formed (perhaps triggering the formation of a low-mass
binary), by a companion as it explodes as a supernova (possibly triggered by
mass transfer), or whether it is possibly produced in a high-neutron-density
version of the s-process is still unclear. Several suggestions are made on how
to clarify this situation.

independent of the carrier density) which, however, has an opposite sign to the

effect could still manifest itself as nonzero magnetization Hall current and
finite magnetization at the sample edges because the magnetic dipole moment
associated with the spin of an electron is twice as large as that of the OAM.

in a marked particle-hole asymmetry, with canting winning only on the electron

models which possess a liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP) in addition to the
usual liquid-gas critical point. Furthermore they exhibit thermodynamic
anomalies in the density and compressibility, the nature of which may be akin
to those occurring in water. Previous simulation studies of ramp potentials
have focused on just one functional form, for which the LLCP is
thermodynamically stable. In this work we construct a series of ramp
potentials, which interpolate between this previously studied form and a
ramp-based approximation to the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential. By means of Monte
Carlo simulation, we locate the LLCP, the first order high density liquid
(HDL)-low density liquid (LDL) coexistence line, and the line of density maxima
for a selection of potentials in the series. We observe that as the LJ limit is
approached, the LLCP becomes metastable with respect to freezing into a
hexagonal close packed crystalline solid. The qualitative nature of the phase
behaviour in this regime shows a remarkable resemblance to that seen in
simulation studies of accurate water models. Specifically, the density of the
liquid phase exceeds that of the solid; the gradient of the metastable LDL-HDL
line is negative in the pressure (p)-temperature (T) plane; while the line of
density maxima in the p-T plane has a shape similar to that seen in water and
extends well into the {\em stable} liquid region of the phase diagram. As such,
our results lend weight to the `second critical point' hypothesis as an

where classical general relativity breaks down. In particular in cosmology one
has to deal with initial singularities, i.e. the fact that the backward
evolution of a classical space-time inevitably comes to an end after a finite
amount of proper time. This presents a breakdown of the classical picture and
requires an extended theory for a meaningful description. Since small length
scales and high curvatures are involved, quantum effects must play a role. Not
only the singularity itself but also the surrounding space-time is then
modified. One particular realization is loop quantum cosmology, an application
of loop quantum gravity to homogeneous systems, which removes classical
singularities. Its implications can be studied at different levels. Main
effects are introduced into effective classical equations which allow to avoid
interpretational problems of quantum theory. They give rise to new kinds of
early universe phenomenology with applications to inflation and cyclic models.
To resolve classical singularities and to understand the structure of geometry
around them, the quantum description is necessary. Classical evolution is then
replaced by a difference equation for a wave function which allows to extend
space-time beyond classical singularities. One main question is how these
homogeneous scenarios are related to full loop quantum gravity, which can be
dealt with at the level of distributional symmetric states. Finally, the new
structure of space-time arising in loop quantum gravity and its application to
cosmology sheds new light on more general issues such as time.

outside $K_L$ decays has been discovered in 2001 in $B_d \to \psi K_S$,

using low release angles the player released the ball with a greater release

the bulk properties of the materials present. This analysis separates the
contribution to these fields of the molecule in which the atom in question is
bonded, the ""host"" fields, from the contribution of all the other molecules in
the system, the ""external"" fields. We discuss the circumstances under which the
latter can be found by determining the macroscopic fields in the sample and
then removing the averaged contribution of the host molecule. We demonstrate
that the results produced by the, so-called, ""sphere of Lorentz"" construction
are of general validity in both static and time-varying cases. This analytic
construct, however, is not ""mystical"" and its justification rests not on any
sphericity in the system but on the local uniformity and isotropy, i.e.,
spherical symmetry, of the medium when averaged over random microscopic
configurations. This local averaging is precisely that which defines the
equations that describe the macroscopic fields. Hence, the external microscopic
fields, in a suitably averaged sense, can be estimated from the macroscopic
fields. We then discuss the calculation of the external fields and that of the
resonant nucleus in NMR experiments.

and folding simulation. Simplified protein models such as those requiring only
$C_\alpha$ or backbone atoms are attractive because they enable efficient
search of the conformational space. We show residue specific reduced discrete
state models can represent the backbone conformations of proteins with small
RMSD values. However, no potential functions exist that are designed for such
simplified protein models. In this study, we develop optimal potential
functions by combining contact interaction descriptors and local
sequence-structure descriptors. The form of the potential function is a
weighted linear sum of all descriptors, and the optimal weight coefficients are
obtained through optimization using both native and decoy structures. The
performance of the potential function in test of discriminating native protein
structures from decoys is evaluated using several benchmark decoy sets. Our
potential function requiring only backbone atoms or $C_\alpha$ atoms have
comparable or better performance than several residue-based potential functions
that require additional coordinates of side chain centers or coordinates of all
side chain atoms. By reducing the residue alphabets down to size 5 for local
structure-sequence relationship, the performance of the potential function can
be further improved. Our results also suggest that local sequence-structure
correlation may play important role in reducing the entropic cost of protein
folding.

to NMR spectroscopy. To illustrate some key features of susceptibility effects
we present, among a more general overview, results obtained with red blood
cells and a recently described model system involving diethyl phthalate in
water. This substance forms a relatively stable emulsion in water and yet it
has a significant solubility of 5 mmol/L at room temperature; thus, the NMR
spectrum has twice as many resonances as would be expected for a simple
solution. What determines the relative intensities of the two families of peaks
and can their frequencies be manipulated experimentally in a predictable way?
The theory used to interpret the NMR spectra from the model system and cells
was first developed in the context of electrostatics nearly a century ago, and
yet some of its underlying assumptions now warrant closer scrutiny. While this
insight is used in a practical way in this article, the accompanying article
deals with the mathematics and physics behind this new analysis.

interaction deterministically changes the states such that the outcome can be
read from the state of the observer after the interaction. If the observer
consistently realizes the outcome which maximizes the likelihood ratio that the
outcome pertains to the system under study (and not to his own state), he will
be called Bayes-optimal. We calculate the probability if for each trial of the
experiment the observer is in a new state picked randomly from his set of
states, and the system under investigation is taken from an ensemble of
identical pure states. For classical statistical mixtures, the relative
frequency resulting from the maximum likelihood principle is an unbiased
estimator of the components of the mixture. For repeated Bayes-optimal
observation in case the state space is complex Hilbert space, the relative
frequency converges to the Born rule. Hence, the principle of Bayes-optimal
observation can be regarded as an underlying mechanism for the Born rule. We
show the outcome assignment of the Bayes-optimal observer is invariant under
unitary transformations and contextual, but the probability that results from
repeated application is non-contextual. The proposal gives a concise
interpretation for the meaning of the occurrence of a single outcome in a
