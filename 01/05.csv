N, the gravitational softening length $\epsilon$ and the time-step $\Delta t$
is investigated in the context of galaxy simulations. For isolated galaxy
models we have performed a convergence study and estimated the numerical
parameters ranges for which the relaxed models do not deviate significantly
from its initial configuration. By fixing N, we calculate the range of the mean
interparticle separation $\lambda(r)$ along the disc radius. We have found that
in the simulations with N=1310720 particles $\lambda$ varies by a factor of 6,
and the corresponding final Toomre's parameters Q change by only about 5 per
cent. By decreasing N, the $\lambda$ and Q ranges broaden. Large $\epsilon$ and
small N cause an earlier bar formation. For a given set of parameters the disc
heating is smaller with the Plummer softening than with the spline softening.
For galaxy collision models numerical simulations indicate that the properties
of the formed bars strongly depend upon the selection of N and $\epsilon$.
Large values of the gravitational softening parameter and a small number of
particles results in the rapid formation of a well defined, slowly rotating
bar. On the other hand, small values of $\epsilon$ produce a small, rapidly
rotating disc with tightly wound spiral arms, and subsequently a weak bar
emerges. We have found that by increasing N, the bar properties converge and
the effect of the softening parameter diminishes. Finally, in some cases short
spiral arms are observed at the ends of the bar that change periodically from
trailing to leading and vice-versa - the wiggle.

combined effect from all the known massive stars that power the Carina Nebula.
The present-day total ionizing photon luminosity produced by the 65 O stars and
3 WNL stars in Carina is about 1e51/s, the total bolometric luminosity of all
stars earlier than B2 is 2.5e7 Lsun, and the total mechanical luminosity of
stellar winds is about 1e5 Lsun. The total ionizing flux was about 25 per cent
higher when eta Car was on the main sequence, before it and its companion were
surrounded by its obscuring dust shell, and when the 3 WNL stars were on the
main sequence. For the first 3 Myr, the net ionizing flux of the 70 O-type
stars in Carina was about 150 times greater than in the Orion Nebula. About
400-500 Msun has been contributed to the region by stellar wind mass loss
during the past 3 Myr. The net ionizing flux and mechanical luminosity are also
given for the individual clusters Tr14, 15, and 16, and Bo10 and 11, which are

desorption occurs in a single step whereas for layered ices it proceeds in two
steps, one corresponding to N2 desorption from a pure N2 ice environment and

models on the number of galaxies as a function of the halo mass, or the
so-called halo occupation number, by assigning a luminosity distribution to
those galaxies. Suggestions have now been made that both the clustering
strength and properties of hosted galaxies of a given dark matter halo depends
also on the age and the environment of that halo in addition to halo mass.
Based on simple CLF models, we find that at least one suggestion that made use
of central galaxy properties may be affected by uncertainties in the group
catalog from which clustering properties were measured to address the age
dependence. Establishing how galaxy properties of fixed mass halos change with
the environment or the age is challenging, if not impossible, given
uncertainties in group and cluster catalogs. It may be possible to address this
issue through statistics based on a combined study of luminosity and color
distributions, and luminosity- and color-dependent galaxy clustering, all of

``uniform time offset,'' which measures the time lag between the observed
secondary eclipse and that predicted by a planet with a uniform surface flux
distribution. We compare the predicted amplitude of this parameter for HD
209458 with the precision with which it could be measured with IRAC. We find
that IRAC observations at 3.6um a single secondary eclipse should permit
sufficient precision to confirm or reject the Cooper & Showman model of the
surface flux distribution for this planet. We quantify the signal-to-noise
ratio for this offset in the remaining IRAC bands (4.5um, 5.8um, and 8.0um),

result in a disk of mostly liquid or solid debris, where pressure is not
effective, well before the accumulation process starts. If the debris is
dominated by vapor gas, strong spiral shocks are generated, and therefore the

rates as an observational input along with temperature and density data for
each cluster. On energetic grounds we find that thermal conduction could
provide the necessary heating for A2199, Perseus, A1795 and A478. However, the
suppression factor, of the clasical Spitzer value, is a different function of
radius for each cluster. Based on the observations of plasma bubbles we also
calculate the duty cycles for each AGN, in the absence of thermal conduction,
which can provide the required energy input. With the exception of Hydra-A it
appears that each of the other AGNs in our sample require duty cycles of
roughly $10^{6}-10^{7}$ yrs to provide their steady-state heating requirements.
If these duty cycles are unrealistic, this may imply that many galaxy clusters
must be heated by very powerful Hydra-A type events interspersed between more
frequent smaller-scale outbursts. The suppression factors for the thermal
conductivity required for combined heating by AGN and thermal conduction are
generally acceptable. However, these suppression factors still require
`fine-tuning` of the thermal conductivity as a function of radius. As a
consequence of this work we present the AGN duty cycle as a cooling flow
diagnostic.

This offers an explanation why topological quantities of $V$ may become

investigated over these two last decades. It has been established that 1D

In this paper, we present deeper analysis and investigate the 2D scaling
properties of these fracture surfaces. We showed that the properties of scaling
invariance are anisotropic and evidenced the existence of two peculiar
directions on the post-mortem fracture surface caracterized by two different
scaling exponents: the direction of the crack growth and the direction of the
crack front. These two exponents were found to be universal, independent of the
crack growth velocity, in both silica glass and aluminum alloy, archetype of

that fully characterizes the scaling properties of the fracture surface was
shown to take a peculiar form similar to the one predicted by some models

properties of the networks, such as size, connectivity, hub and authority
analyses, etc., allow us to make quantitative comparison so as to reveal
different paths of development. For example, the asynchrony of development in
network size and average degree suggests that children cannot be simply
classified as early talkers or late talkers by one or two measures. Children
follow different paths in a multi-dimensional space. They may develop faster in
one dimension but slower in another dimension. The network approach requires
little preprocessing of words and analyses on sentence structures, and the
characteristics of words and their usage emerge from the network and are
independent of any grammatical presumptions. We show that the change of the two
articles ""the"" and ""a"" in their roles as important nodes in the network
reflects the progress of children's syntactic development: the two articles
often start in children's networks as hubs and later shift to authorities,
while they are authorities constantly in the adult's networks. The network
analyses provide a new approach to study language development, and at the same
time language development also presents a rich area for network theories to
explore.

  Memoryless Systems: Computation and Comparison with Separate Coding","Technical Report, December 2005",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  We investigate the computation of Csiszar's bounds for the joint
source-channel coding (JSCC) error exponent, E_J, of a communication system
consisting of a discrete memoryless source and a discrete memoryless channel.
We provide equivalent expressions for these bounds and derive explicit formulas
for the rates where the bounds are attained. These equivalent representations
can be readily computed for arbitrary source-channel pairs via Arimoto's
algorithm. When the channel's distribution satisfies a symmetry property, the
bounds admit closed-form parametric expressions. We then use our results to
provide a systematic comparison between the JSCC error exponent E_J and the
tandem coding error exponent E_T, which applies if the source and channel are
separately coded. It is shown that E_T <= E_J <= 2E_T. We establish conditions
for which E_J > E_T and for which E_J = 2E_T. Numerical examples indicate that
E_J is close to 2E_T for many source-channel pairs. This gain translates into a
power saving larger than 2 dB for a binary source transmitted over additive
white Gaussian noise channels and Rayleigh fading channels with finite output
quantization. Finally, we study the computation of the lossy JSCC error
exponent under the Hamming distortion measure.

  linear system over a noisy communication link Part I: scalar systems","27 pages, submitted to Information Theory Transactions",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  We review how Shannon's classical notion of capacity is not enough to
characterize a noisy communication channel if the channel is intended to be
used as part of a feedback loop to stabilize an unstable scalar linear system.
While classical capacity is not enough, another sense of capacity (parametrized
by reliability) called ``anytime capacity'' is shown to be necessary for the
stabilization of an unstable process. The required rate is given by the log of
the unstable system gain and the required reliability comes from the sense of
stability desired. A consequence of this necessity result is a sequential
generalization of the Schalkwijk/Kailath scheme for communication over the AWGN
channel with feedback.
  In cases of sufficiently rich information patterns between the encoder and
decoder, adequate anytime capacity is also shown to be sufficient for there to
exist a stabilizing controller. These sufficiency results are then generalized
to cases with noisy observations, delayed control actions, and without any
explicit feedback between the observer and the controller. Both necessary and
sufficient conditions are extended to continuous time systems as well. We close
with comments discussing a hierarchy of difficulty for communication problems
and how these results establish where stabilization problems sit in that
hierarchy.

fine tuned parameter space of minimal supersymmetric standard model is with
negative stop masses squared at the grand unification scale. While stop mass
squared is typically driven to positive values at the weak scale, the
contribution to the Higgs mass squared parameter from the running can be
arbitrarily small, which reduces fine tuning of electroweak symmetry breaking.
At the same time the stop mixing is necessarily enhanced and the maximal mixing
scenario for the Higgs mass can be generated radiatively even when starting
with negligible mixing at the unification scale. This highly alleviates
constraints on possible models for supersymmetry breaking in which fine tuning
is absent.

thus determine that the contributions to F_2(q^2) and F_3(q^2), Fock state by
Fock state, are related, independent of the fundamental mechanism through which
CP violation is generated. Our relation is not specific to the nucleon, but,
rather, is true of spin-1/2 systems in general, be they lepton or baryon. The
empirical values of the anomalous magnetic moments, in concert with empirical
bounds on the associated electric dipole moments, can better constrain theories

proposed iterative methods for approximating the canonical tight and canonical
dual window of a Gabor frame (g,a,b). The iterations start with the window g
while the iteration steps comprise the window g, the k^{th} iterand \gamma_{k},
the frame operators S and S_{k} corresponding to (g,a,b) and (\gamma_{k},a,b),
respectively, and a number of scalars. The structure of the iteration step of
the method is determined by the envisaged convergence order m of the method. We
consider two strategies for scaling the terms in the iteration step: norm
scaling, where in each step the windows are normalized, and initial scaling
where we only scale in the very beginning. Norm scaling leads to fast, but
conditionally convergent methods, while initial scaling leads to
unconditionally convergent methods, but with possibly suboptimal convergence
constants. The iterations, initially formulated for time-continuous Gabor
systems, are considered and tested in a discrete setting in which one passes to
the appropriately sampled-and-periodized windows and frame operators.
Furthermore, they are compared with respect to accuracy and efficiency with
other methods to approximate canonical windows associated with Gabor frames.

applying a Green's operator to the SPDE in such a way that the invariant

important for the development of practical algorithms for sampling infinite

challenges in the theory of SPDEs. The two primary ones are the presence of
nonlinear boundary conditions, involving first order derivatives, and a loss of
the smoothing property in the case of the pre-conditioned SPDEs. These
challenges are overcome and a theory of existence, uniqueness and ergodicity is
developed in sufficient generality to subsume the sampling problems of interest
to us. The Gaussian theory developed in Part I of this paper considers Gaussian
SDEs, leading to linear Gaussian SPDEs for sampling. This Gaussian theory is
used as the basis for deriving nonlinear SPDEs which affect the desired

Amplifier Experimental Facility (X-ADS) downcomer channel. The simulation is
focused on the Steady-State Analysis. The Intermediate Heat exchangers (IHX) of
the X-ADS reference configuration are immersed in the lead-bismuth eutectic of
the downcomer. Due to the absence of a physical separation between the primary
coolant hot and cold collectors, two different flow paths are available in the
downcomer region: inside the IHX and outside it (IHX by-pass flow). The amount
of IHX by-pass flow is determined by the balance between the driving force due
to buoyancy (originated by the weight difference between the cooled fluid
inside the IHX and the hot outside downcomer fluid) and the IHX pressure
losses. At the IHX exit the two flow paths are mixed before the core inlet.
This fact provides a potential for a downcomer thermal stratification, which is
influenced by the actual value of coolant flow rate outside the IHX. The amount
and extension of the thermal stratification phenomena is the object of this
study. The simulation allowed studying the position and intensity of the
thermal stratification phenomena. Several runs have been performed. However, to
limit the extension of the paper, we deal with the results of only one of the

with physical explanation for optically pre-amplified DPSK receivers using
optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) demodulation and balanced detection.
It is shown that BER calculation method for this kind of receivers is different
from the conventional calculation method used widely for IM/DD receivers. An
analytical relationship in receiver sensitivity between DPSK receivers using
MZI demodulation with balanced detection and IM/DD receivers (or DPSK receivers
using MZI demodulation and single-port detection) is given based on the
Gaussian noise approximation. Our calculation method correctly predicts the
3-dB improvement of receiver sensitivity by using balanced detection over
single-port detection or IM/DD receivers. Furthermore, quantum-limited DPSK
