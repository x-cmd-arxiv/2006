out to >2500km/s from the line core, and down to a flux density of <10^-3 of
the peak flux density. Numerical and analytic calculations indicate that
exponential wings are expected for optically thin, isotropic, thermal electron
scattering. Such scattering produces exponential wings with sigma=1.1sigma_e(ln
tau_e^-1)^0.45, where sigma_e is the electron velocity dispersion, and tau_e is
the electron scattering optical depth. The Halpha wings in NGC 4395 are well
fit by an electron scattering model with tau_e=0.34, and an electron
temperature T_e=1.1x10^4K. Such conditions are produced in photoionized gas
with an ionization parameter U=0.3, as expected in the broad line region (BLR).
Similar analysis of the [O III] 5007 line yields tau_e<0.01, consistent with
the lower ionization in the narrow line region. If the electron scattering
interpretation is correct, there should be a tight correlation between tau_e
and the ionizing flux on time scales shorter than the BLR dynamical time, or ~1
week for NGC 4395. In contrast, the value of sigma should remain nearly
constant on these time scales. Such wings may be discernible in other objects
with unusually narrow Balmer lines, and they can provide a useful direct probe
of T_e and tau_e in the BLR.

realistic temperature profile which is continuous at all optical depths and
thus goes beyond the two-temperature model. It is based on the approximate
solution of the radiation transfer in the disk obtained from the
frequency-integrated moment equations in the Eddington approximation. We come
up with a simple procedure (``constant g_z approximation'') for treating the
vertical structure of the disk in regions where its optical depth to stellar
radiation is high. This allows us to obtain expressions for the vertical
profiles of density and pressure at every point in the disk and to determine
the shape of its surface. Armed with these analytical results we calculate the
full radial structure of the disk and demonstrate that it favorably agrees with
the results of direct numerical calculations. We also describe a simple and
efficient way of the SED calculation based on our adopted temperature profile.
Resulting spectra provide very good match (especially at short wavelengths) to
the results of more detailed (but also more time-consuming) SED calculations

scattering with the MBHB -- on binary separation. Even in the absence of
two-body relaxation or gas dynamical processes, very unequal mass binaries of
mass M=10^7 solar masses can shrink to the gravitational wave emission regime
in less than a Hubble time, and are therefore a target for the planned Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Three-body interactions create a
subpopulation of hypervelocity stars on nearly radial, corotating orbits, with
a spatial distribution that is initially highly flattened in the inspiral plane
of the MBHB, but becomes more isotropic with decreasing binary separation. The
mass ejected is ~0.7 times the binary reduced mass, and most of the stars are
ejected in an initial burst lasting much less than a bulge crossing time.

luminosities of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in molecular-line data cubes with
low resolution and sensitivity. We find that moment methods are robust and
sensitive -- making full use of both position and intensity information -- and
we recommend a standard method to measure the position angle, major and minor
axis sizes, line width, and luminosity using moment methods. Without
corrections for the effects of beam convolution and sensitivity to GMC
properties, the resulting properties may be severely biased. This is
particularly true for extragalactic observations, where resolution and
sensitivity effects often bias measured values by 40% or more. We correct for
finite spatial and spectral resolutions with a simple deconvolution and we
correct for sensitivity biases by extrapolating properties of a GMC to those we
would expect to measure with perfect sensitivity. The resulting method recovers
the properties of a GMC to within 10% over a large range of resolutions and
sensitivities, provided the clouds are marginally resolved with a peak
signal-to-noise ratio greater than 10. We note that interferometers
systematically underestimate cloud properties, particularly the flux from a
cloud. The degree of bias depends on the sensitivity of the observations and
the (u,v) coverage of the observations. In the Appendix to the paper we present
a conservative, new decomposition algorithm for identifying GMCs in
molecular-line observations. This algorithm treats the data in physical rather
than observational units, does not produce spurious clouds in the presence of
noise, and is sensitive to a range of morphologies. As a result, the output of
this decomposition should be directly comparable among disparate data sets.

from the BH via the BZ process to power a GRB, while a large fraction of energy

thus, its design involves from the nano- to the mega-mechanics. The predicted
strengths are extensively compared with the experiments and the atomistic
simulations on carbon nanotubes available in the literature. All these
approaches unequivocally suggest that the megacable strength will be reduced by
a factor at least of ~70% with respect to the theoretical nanotube strength,
today (erroneously) assumed in the cable design. The reason is the unavoidable
presence of defects in a so huge cable. Preliminary in silicon tensile

Calculations reveal in certain cases of X = Co based compounds non-integer

magnetic moment calculated for such compounds, the dependency of the electronic
structure on the lattice parameter was studied theoretically. In local density
approximation (LDA), the minimum total energy of Co$_2$FeSi is found for the
experimental lattice parameter, but the calculated magnetic moment is about 12%
too low. Half-metallic ferromagnetism and a magnetic moment equal to the
experimental value of $6\mu_B$ are found, however, only after increasing the
lattice parameter by more than 6%.
  To overcome this discrepancy, the LDA$+U$ scheme was used to respect on-site
electron correlation in the calculations. Those calculations revealed for
Co$_2$FeSi that an effective Coulomb-exchange interaction $U_{eff}=U-J$ in the
range of about 2eV to 5eV leads to half-metallic ferromagnetism and the
measured, integer magnetic moment at the measured lattice parameter. Finally,
it is shown in the case of Co$_2$MnSi that correlation may also serve to
destroy the half-metallic behavior if it becomes too strong (for Co$_2$MnSi
above 2eV and for Co$_2$FeSi above 5eV). These findings indicate that on-site

dependence far from the Ambegaokar-Baratoff formula. It rapidly decreases with

the problems in our tunnel junctions. There are poor-crystalline MgB2 layers
and/or amorphous Mg-B composite layers of a few nanometers between AlOx barrier

charges, the latter system being in the stability-against-collapse regime of
reduced inverse temperatures $0\le \beta <2$. In the previous work, using a
sine-Gordon representation of the Coulomb gas, an exact renormalized-charge
formula was derived for the special case of the {\em pointlike} guest charge
$Q$, in its stability regime $\beta | Q| < 2$. In the present paper, we extend
the renormalized-charge treatment to the guest charge with a hard core of
radius $\sigma$, which allows us to go beyond the stability border $\beta| Q| =
2$. In the limit of the hard-core radius much smaller than the correlation
length of the Coulomb-gas species and at a strictly finite temperature, due to
the counterion condensation in the extended region $\beta| Q| >2$, the
renormalized charge $Q_{\rm ren}$ turns out to be a periodic function of the
bare charge $Q$ with period 1. The renormalized charge therefore does not
saturate at a specific finite value as $| Q| \to\infty$, but oscillates between
two extreme values. In the high-temperature Poisson-Boltzmann scaling regime of
limits $\beta\to 0$ and $Q\to\infty$ with the product $\beta Q$ being finite,
one reproduces correctly the monotonic dependence of $\beta Q_{\rm ren}$ on
$\beta Q$ in the guest-charge stability region $\beta| Q| <2$ and the
Manning-Oosawa type of counterion condensation with the uniform saturation of
$\beta Q_{\rm ren}$ at the value $4/\pi$ in the region $\beta| Q|\ge 2$.

these pair-breaking mechanisms than that of the critical temperature. These two
scattering mechanisms should be taken into account to get a better agreement
between experimental results and theoretical description. We also study the
influence of the interface transparency on the properties of S/F structures.

paging problem. To deal with it, Borodin et. al. introduced the access graph
model, which attempts to capture the locality of reference. However, the access
graph model has a number of troubling aspects. The access graph has to be known
in advance to the paging algorithm and the memory required to represent the
access graph itself may be very large.
  In this paper we present truly online strongly competitive paging algorithms
in the access graph model that do not have any prior information on the access
sequence. We present both deterministic and randomized algorithms. The
algorithms need only O(k log n) bits of memory, where k is the number of page
slots available and n is the size of the virtual address space. I.e.,
asymptotically no more memory than needed to store the virtual address
translation table.
  We also observe that our algorithms adapt themselves to temporal changes in
the locality of reference. We model temporal changes in the locality of
reference by extending the access graph model to the so called extended access
graph model, in which many vertices of the graph can correspond to the same
virtual page. We define a measure for the rate of change in the locality of
reference in G denoted by Delta(G). We then show our algorithms remain strongly
competitive as long as Delta(G) >= (1+ epsilon)k, and no truly online algorithm
can be strongly competitive on a class of extended access graphs that includes
all graphs G with Delta(G) >= k- o(k).

of the asymmetry in the error estimates. Whereas the likelihood analysis
involves a linear optimization procedure for symmetrical error estimates, it
involves a nonlinear optimization procedure for asymmetrical error estimates.
  We find that for most frequencies there is little difference between the
power spectra derived from analyses of symmetrized error estimates and from
asymmetrical error estimates. However, this proves not to be the case for the
principal peak in the power spectra, which is found at 9.43 yr-1. A likelihood
analysis which allows for a ""floating offset"" and takes account of the start
time and end time of each bin and of the flux estimate and the symmetrized

shows that there is a chance of only 1% of finding a peak this big or bigger in
the frequency band 1 - 36 yr-1 (the widest band that avoids artificial peaks).
On the other hand, an analysis that takes account of the error asymmetry leads
to a peak with power 13.24 at that frequency. A Monte Carlo analysis shows that
there is a chance of only 0.1% of finding a peak this big or bigger in that
frequency band 1 - 36 yr-1. From this perspective, power spectrum analysis that
takes account of asymmetry of the error estimates gives evidence for
variability that is significant at the 99.9% level.

of the Super-Kamiokande and SNO solar neutrino experiments.

an O(4) internal symmetry. The physical mesons of these models are sigma, pion,
eta and a_0 where the latter two are not present in the O(4) model. Including
two-loop contributions through sunset graphs we calculate the temperature
behavior of the order parameter and the masses for explicit chiral symmetry
breaking and in the chiral limit. Decay threshold effects introduced by the
sunset graphs alter the temperature dependence of the condensate and
consequently that of the masses as well. This correctly reproduces a
second-order phase transition for the O(4) model and for the U(2)_L x U(2)_R
model with an axial U(1) anomaly as expected from universality class arguments.
Chiral symmetry tends to be restored at higher temperatures in the two-loop
approximation than in the Hartree-Fock approximation. To model a restoration of
the axial U(1) symmetry we imply a temperature-dependent anomaly parameter that
sharply drops at about 175 MeV. This triggers the restoration of chiral
symmetry before the full symmetry is restored and lowers the transition
temperatures significantly below 200 MeV.

case of Dirac and gauge fields and show that in the absence of a chemical
potential, the finite temperature Feynman diagrams can be related to the
corresponding zero temperature graphs through a thermal operator. At non-zero
chemical potential we show explicitly in the case of the fermion self-energy
that such a factorization is violated because of the presence of a singular
contact term. Such a temperature dependent term which arises only at finite
density and has a quadratic mass singularity cannot be related, through a
regular thermal operator, to the fermion self-energy at zero temperature which
is infrared finite. Furthermore, we show that the thermal radiative corrections
at finite density have a screening effect for the chemical potential leading to
a finite renormalization of the potential.

corresponding symmetry of the effective superpotential W_eff(S_i) under
permutations of the S_i. For W(x)=^W(h(x)) with h(x)=x^k, this allows us to
express the prepotential F_0 and effective superpotential W_eff on certain
submanifolds of the moduli space in terms of an ^F_0 and ^W_eff of a different
theory with tree-level superpotential ^W. In particular, if the Z_k symmetric

explicit formulae for F_0 and W_eff. Moreover, in this case, every vacuum of
the effective Veneziano-Yankielowicz superpotential ^W_eff is shown to give
rise to a vacuum of W_eff. Somewhat surprisingly, at the level of the
prepotential F_0(S_i) the permutation symmetry only holds for k=2, while it is
anomalous for k>2 due to subtleties related to the non-compact period
integrals. Some of these results are also extended to general polynomial

limit shape dominates in the statistical model. The limit shape is linked with
a hyperelliptic curve, which is a five-dimensional version of the SU(N)
Seiberg-Witten curve. Amoebas and the Ronkin functions play intermediary roles
between the limit shape and the hyperelliptic curve. In particular, the Ronkin
function realizes an integration of thermodynamical density of the main
diagonal partitions, along one-dimensional slice of it and thereby is
interpreted as the counting function of gauge instantons. The radius of $S^1$
can be identified with the inverse temperature of the statistical model. The
large radius limit of the five-dimensional Yang-Mills is the low temperature
limit of the statistical model, where the statistical model is frozen to a
ground state that is associated with the local SU(N) geometry. We also show
that the low temperature limit corresponds to a certain degeneration of amoebas

approach is applied to finite nuclei using external potentials and

pure, perturbative hbar^2 correction. In external potentials, VWK passes
through the average of the quantal values of the accumulated level density and
total energy as a function of the Fermi energy. However, there is a problem of
overbinding when the energy per particle is displayed as a function of the
particle number. The situation is analyzed comparing spherical and deformed
harmonic oscillator potentials. In the self-consistent case, we show for Skyrme
forces that VWK binding energies are very close to those obtained from extended
Thomas-Fermi functionals of hbar^4 order, pointing to the rapid convergence of
the VWK theory. This satisfying result, however, does not cure the overbinding
problem, i.e., the semiclassical energies show more binding than they should.
This feature is more pronounced in the case of Skyrme forces than with the
relativistic mean field approach. However, even in the latter case the shell
correction energy for e.g. 208Pb turns out to be only -6 MeV what is about a
factor two or three off the generally accepted value. As an ad hoc remedy,
increasing the kinetic energy by 2.5%, leads to shell correction energies well
acceptable throughout the periodic table. The general importance of the present
studies for other finite Fermi systems, self-bound or in external potentials,
is pointed out.

advantage of already more than an order of magnitude in the number of maximally

by-product, we compute the radius of the largest ball that fits into the triple
projective tensor product of the unit ball in R^3.

impurity atom, a so-called atomic quantum dot (AQD), where only state |1>
couples to a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). A direct relation between the
dephasing of the internal states of the AQD and the temporal phase fluctuations
of the BEC is established. Based on this relation we suggest a scheme to probe
BEC phase fluctuations nondestructively via dephasing measurements of the AQD.
In particular, the scheme allows to trace the dependence of the phase
fluctuations on the trapping geometry of the BEC.

storage device. The information is encrypted in the collective ground state
atomic coherence, which, in the absence of external excitation, is decoupled
from the vacuum and therefore decoherence free. However, in the process of
manipulation of atoms with light pulses (writing, reading), one inadvertently
introduces a coupling to the environment, i.e. a source of decoherence. The
dissipation process is often treated as an independent process for each atom in
the ensemble, an approach which fails at large atomic optical depths where
cooperative effects must be taken into account. In this paper, the cooperative
behavior of spin decoherence and population transfer for a system of two,
driven multilevel-atoms is studied. Not surprisingly, an enhancement in the
decoherence rate is found, when the atoms are separated by a distance that is
small compared to an optical wavelength; however, it is found that this rate
increases even further for somewhat larger separations for atoms aligned along
the direction of the driving field's propagation vector. A treatment of the
cooperative modification of optical pumping rates and an effect of polarization
swapping between atoms is also discussed, lending additional insight into the
origin of the collective decay.

from a certain local causality requirement (``Bell Locality'') and the
empirically well-supported predictions of quantum theory for the standard
EPR-Bell setup. The demonstrated hidden variables are precisely those needed
for the derivation of the Bell Inequalities. We thus refute the widespread view
that empirical violations of Bell Inequalities leave open a choice of whether
to reject (i) locality or (ii) hidden variables. Both principles are indeed
assumed in the derivation of the inequalities, but since, as we demonstrate
here, (ii) actually follows from (i), there is no choice but to blame the
violation of Bell's Inequality on (i). Our main conclusion is thus that no Bell
Local theory can be consistent with what is known from experiment about the
correlations exhibited by separated particles. Aside from our conclusion being
based on a different sense of locality this conclusion resembles one that has
been advocated recently by H.P. Stapp. We therefore also carefully contrast the
argument presented here to that proposed by Stapp.

specifically a single atom in a driven optical cavity with cavity loss and
spontaneous emission. The system reaches a steady pure state when driven very
weakly. Under these conditions, there is an optimal value for atom-field
coupling to maximize entanglement, as larger coupling favors a loss port due to
the cavity enhanced spontaneous emission. We address ways to implement
measurements of entanglement witnesses and find that normalized
cross-correlation functions are indicators of the entanglement in the system.
The magnitude of the equal time intensity-field cross correlation between the
transmitted field of the cavity and the fluorescence intensity is proportional
to the concurrence for weak driving fields.

can rise non-local correlations. However, for almost forty years, it has been
assumed that the most non-local states would be the maximally entangled ones.
Surprisingly it is not the case: non-maximally entangled states are generally
more non-local than maximally entangled states for all the measures of
non-locality proposed to date: Bell inequalities, the Kullback-Leibler
distance, entanglement simulation with communication or with non-local boxes,
the detection loophole and efficiency of cryptography. In fact, one can even
find simple examples in low dimensions, confirming that it is not an artefact
of a specifically constructed Hilbert space or topology. This anomaly shows
that entanglement and non-locality are not only different concepts, but also
truly different resources. We review the present knowledge on this anomaly,
point out that Hardy's theorem has the same feature, and discuss the
perspectives opened by these discoveries.
