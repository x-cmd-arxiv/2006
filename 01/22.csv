the absence of a natural guide star. Single guide star systems with a star
created in the earth's sodium layer can be used to correct the wavefront in the
near infrared spectral regime for 8-m class telescopes. For possible future
telescopes of larger sizes, or for correction at shorter wavelengths, the use
of a single guide star is ultimately limited by focal anisoplanatism that
arises from the finite height of the guide star. To overcome this limitation we
propose to overlap coherently pulsed laser beams that are expanded over the
full aperture of the telescope, traveling upwards along the same path which
light from the astronomical object travels downwards. Imaging the scattered
light from the resultant interference pattern with a camera gated to a certain
height above the telescope, and using phase shifting interferometry we have
found a method to retrieve the local wavefront gradients. By sensing the
backscattered light from two different heights, one can fully remove the cone
effect, which can otherwise be a serious handicap to the use of laser guide
stars at shorter wavelengths or on larger telescopes. Using two laser beams
multiconjugate correction is possible, resulting in larger corrected fields.
With a proper choice of laser, wavefront correction could be expanded to the
visible regime and, due to the lack of a cone effect, the method is applicable
to any size of telescope. Finally the position of the laser spot could be
imaged from the side of the main telescope against a bright background star to
retrieve tip-tilt information, which would greatly improve the sky coverage of
the system.

interest because they provide additional constraints on the models of the lens
systems. To use a gravitational lens system for measuring the Hubble constant,
one would need to determine the lens potential and the source intensity
distribution simultaneously. A linear inversion method to reconstruct a
pixellated source brightness distribution of a given lens potential model was
introduced by Warren & Dye. In the inversion process, a regularisation on the
source intensity is often needed to ensure a successful inversion with a
faithful resulting source. In this paper, we use Bayesian analysis to determine
the optimal regularisation constant (strength of regularisation) of a given
form of regularisation and to objectively choose the optimal form of
regularisation given a selection of regularisations. We consider and compare
quantitatively three different forms of regularisation previously described in
the literature for source inversions in gravitational lensing: zeroth-order,
gradient and curvature. We use simulated data with the exact lens potential to
demonstrate the method. We find that the preferred form of regularisation
depends on the nature of the source distribution.

was recently shown that the inherent infrared finiteness of inclusive spectra
extends beyond the level of logarithms. Dressed Gluon Exponentiation makes
practical use of this property by computing the Sudakov exponent as a Borel
sum. Based on renormalon analysis, infrared sensitivity in the exponent is
reflected in power corrections that are inversely proportional to the third
power of the mass. Therefore, the parametric enhancement of non-perturbative
corrections near the phase--space boundary is effective only in a small region.
Consequently, the on-shell decay spectrum provides a good approximation to the
meson decay. In particular, it facilitates a precise determination of V_ub from
present measurements of inclusive charmless semileptonic widths without

presented. It is based on counting the number of interacting pairs in different
spin-isospin (S,T) states for a given spatial symmetry, and estimating the
overall binding according to the sum of sigma_i.sigma_j tau_i.tau_j expectation
values, as suggested by one-pion-exchange. Applied to s- and p-shell nuclei,
this simple picture accounts for the relative stability of nuclei as A
increases and as T changes across isobars, the saturation of nuclear binding in
the p-shell, and the tendency to form d, t, or alpha subclusters there. With
allowance for pairwise tensor and spin-orbit forces, which are also generated
or boosted by pion-exchange, the model explains why mixing of different spatial
symmetries in ground states increases as T increases across isobars, and why
for states of the same spatial symmetry, the ones with greater S are lower in
the spectrum. The ordering of some sd-shell intruder levels can also be
understood. The success of this simple model supports the idea that
one-pion-exchange is the dominant force controlling the structure of light
nuclei.

"nucl-th/0601066","Vladimir Garistov Petrovich","Elmir Dermendjiev","A new method of measurement of the velocities of solar neutrinos","One file of LaTeX, no figures",,,,"nucl-th",,"  A new method of measurement of the velocities of solar electron antineutrinos
is proposed. The method is based on the assumption, that if the neutrino
detector having a shape of a pipe and providing a proper angular resolution, is
directed onto the optical ""image"" of the sun, then it would detect solar
neutrinos with velocities $V_{\widetilde{\nu}_{e}}$ $=c$. Here c is the
velocity of light. It is expected that the less is the value of $V_{\widetilde
{\nu}_{e}}$, the larger would be the angular lagging of the ""image"" of these
neutrinos relative to the position of the optical ""image"" of the sun.
Therefore, one can detect solar neutrinos with different energies by changing
the angle between the axis of a detector pipe and the direction to the ""image""
of the sun. Also, the method gives unique possibility to check hypotheses
predicting an existence of solar neutrinos with $V_{\widetilde{\nu}_{e}}>c$. In
this case the ""image"" of such solar neutrinos on the sky should pass the
""image"" of the sun.

microscopic $LC$ oscillator. In the framework of classical electromagnetic
field theory we analytically obtain, for the hydrogen atom, the quantized
electron orbit radius. Without the adaptation of any other fundamental
principles of quantum mechanics, we present a reasonable explanation of the
polarization of photon, the Zeeman effect, Selection rules and Pauli exclusion
principle. Particularly, it is found that a pairing Pauli electron can move
closely and steadily in a DNA-like double helical electron orbit. Our results
also reveal an essential connection between electron spin and the intrinsic
helical movement of electron and indicate that the spin itself is the effect of
quantum confinement. In addition, a possible physical mechanism of
superconductivity and the deeper physical understandings of the electron mass,
zero point energy, and the hardness property of electron are also provided.
Finally, we show analytically that the Dirac's quantization of magnetic
monopole is merely a special handed electron at absolute zero-temperature,

role played by boundary conditions is noted.

natural and social systems. In the present work we empirically investigate the
relevance of this theory to stock-market dynamics. Avalanches in stock-market
indices are identified using a multi-scale wavelet-filtering analysis designed
to remove Gaussian noise from the index. Here new methods are developed to
identify the optimal filtering parameters which maximize the noise removal. The
filtered time series is reconstructed and compared with the original time
series. A statistical analysis of both high-frequency Nasdaq E-mini Futures and
daily Dow Jones data is performed. The results of this new analysis confirm
earlier results revealing a robust power law behaviour in the probability
distribution function of the sizes, duration and laminar times between
avalanches. This power law behavior holds the potential to be established as a
stylized fact of stock market indices in general. While the memory process,
implied by the power law distribution of the laminar times, is not consistent
with classical models for self-organized criticality, we note that a power-law
distribution of the laminar times cannot be used to rule out self-organized
critical behaviour.

use the broader approach of considering how geometry and symmetry alone play a
role. We investigate the nonlinear optical response of potential energy
functions that are given by a superposition of force centers (representing the
nuclear charges) that lie in various planar geometrical arrangements. We find
that for certain specific geometries, such as an octupolar-like molecule with
donors and acceptors of varying strengths at the branches, the
hyperpolarizability is near the {\em fundamental limit}. In these cases, the
molecule is observed to be well approximated by a three-level model -
consistent with the three-level ansatz previously used to calculate the {\em
fundamental limits}. However, when the hyperpolarizability is below the {\em
apparent limit} (about a factor of thirty below the {\em fundamental limit})
the system is no longer representable by a three-level model; where both
two-level and a many-state models are found to be appropriate, depending on the
symmetry.
