stored in Keplerian rotating passive discs.
  Methods: We present a homogeneous and systematic study of the Spectral Energy
Distributions (SEDs) of a sample of 51 post-AGB objects. The selection criteria
to define the whole sample were tuned to cover the broad-band characteristics
of known binary post-AGB stars. The whole sample includes 20 dusty RV Tauri
stars from the General Catalogue of Variable Stars (GCVS). We supplemented our
own Geneva optical photometry with literature data to cover a broad range of
fluxes from the UV to the far-IR.
  Results: All the SEDs display very similar characteristics: a large IR excess
with a dust excess starting near the sublimation temperature, irrespective of
the effective temperature of the central star. Moreover, when available, the
long wavelength fluxes show a black-body slope indicative of the presence of a
component of large mm sized grains.
  Conclusions: We argue that in all systems, gravitationally bound dusty discs
are present. The discs must be puffed-up to cover a large opening angle for the
central star and we argue that the discs have some similarity with the passive
discs detected around young stellar objects. We interpret the presence of a
disc to be a signature for binarity of the central object, but this will need
confirmation by long-term monitoring of the radial velocities. We argue that
dusty RV Tauri stars are those binaries which happen to be in the Population II
instability strip.

unit redshift is approximately 0.1, making them relatively rare objects. Large,
blind QSO surveys for low redshift DLAs are therefore an expensive prospect for
space-borne UV telescopes. Increasing the efficiency of these surveys by
pre-selecting DLA candidates based on the equivalent widths of metal absorption
lines has previously been a successful strategy. However, the success rate of
DLA identification is still only ~ 35% when simple equivalent width cut-offs
are applied, the majority of systems having 19.0 < log N(HI)<20.3. Here we
propose a new way to pre-select DLA candidates. Our technique requires
high-to-moderate resolution spectroscopy of the MgII 2796 transition, which is
easily accessible from the ground for 0.2 < z < 2.4. We define the D-index, the
ratio of the line's equivalent width to velocity spread and measure this
quantity for 19 DLAs and 8 sub-DLAs in archival spectra obtained with echelle
spectrographs. For the majority of absorbers, there is a clear distinction
between the D-index of DLAs compared with sub-DLAs (Kolmogorov-Smirnov
probability = 0.8%). Based on this pilot data sample, we find that the D-index
can select DLAs with a success rate of up to 90%, an increase in selection
efficiency by a factor of 2.5 compared with a simple equivalent width cut. We
test the applicability of the D-index at lower resolution and find that it
remains a good discriminant of DLAs for FWHM < 1.5 A. However, the recommended
D-index cut-off between DLAs and sub-DLAs decreases with poorer resolution and
we tabulate the appropriate D-index values that should be used with spectra of
different resolutions.

when and only when the acceleration of gravity, as computed considering only
baryons, goes below a well defined value a0=1.2e-8 cm/s/s. This might indicate
a breakdown of Newton's law of gravity (or inertia) below a0, an acceleration
smaller than the smallest probed in the solar system. It is therefore important
to verify whether Newton's law of gravity holds in this regime of
accelerations. In order to do this, one has to study the dynamics of objects
that do not contain significant amounts of DM and therefore should follow
Newton's prediction for whatever small accelerations. Globular clusters are
believed, even by strong supporters of DM, to contain negligible amounts of DM
and therefore are ideal for testing Newtonian dynamics in the low acceleration
limit. Here, we discuss the status of an ongoing program aimed to do this test.
Compared to other studies of globular clsuters, the novelty is that we trace
the velocity dispersion profile of globular clusters far enough from the center
to probe gravitational accelerations well below a0. In all three clusters
studied so far the velocity dispersion is found to remain constant at large
radii rather than follow the Keplerian falloff. On average, the flattening
occurs at the radius where the cluster internal acceleration of gravity is
1.8+-0.4 x 10^{-8} cm/s/s, fully consistent with MOND predictions.

  Lambda = 350 microns lies near the spectral energy distribution peak for z =

extrapolating to the peak from detection wavelengths of lambda > 850 microns.

luminosities and overestimates redshifts on the order of Delta z ~ 1, whereas
redshifts based on either on submillimeter data alone or the 1.6 micron stellar

reveals generally good agreement between theory and experiment. In particular,
the 82.76 A emission line in the XSST spectrum is identified, for the first
time to our knowledge in an astrophysical source. Most of the Fe XV transitions
which are blended have had the species responsible clearly identified, although
there remain a few instances where this has not been possible. The line ratio
calculations are also compared with a co-added spectrum of Capella obtained
with the Chandra satellite, which is probably the highest signal-to-noise
observation achieved for a stellar source in the 25-175 A soft X-ray region.
Good agreement is found between theory and experiment, indicating that the Fe
XV lines are reliably detected in Chandra spectra, and hence may be employed as
diagnostics to determine the temperature and/or density of the emitting plasma.
However the line blending in the Chandra data is such that individual emission
lines are difficult to measure accurately, and fluxes may only be reliably
determined via detailed profile fitting of the observations. The co-added
Capella spectrum is made available to hopefully encourage further exploration
of the soft X-ray region in astronomical sources.

ISM and derive expressions relating the mean amplitude of the temperature
fluctuations to the temperatures of the phases and to the energy input, in
excess of the basic component due to photoionization, required to maintain
them. We apply these expressions to a set of limiting cases for the temperature
and density differences between the phases. Finally we compare the most
plausible case with the most complete data set available: the temperature
fluctuations observed in the Orion Nebula. Results. We first list the cases
considered and our general inferences: (a) Very hot tenuous substrate and warm
moderately dense clouds; discarded as requiring too much excess energy input.
(b) Two phases with equal densities but different temperatures, both warm;
feasible but not general. (c) Two warm phases at moderately different
temperatures and densities; the most probable case. This case is then used to
quantify a specific hypothesis, reconnection of turbulent magnetic fields, as
the source of the fluctuations observed in the Orion Nebula. Field strengths of

contaminations. We first consider primary and secondary anisotropies only. For
the first time in such analyses, the cosmological dependence of secondary

possible contaminations from unresolved and unremoved point sources. Under
these considerations, we discuss the effects on the cosmological parameters. We

$G_{N}$ scales in such a way as to render the vacuum energy density a true
constant. Nevertheless, the model acts as a dynamical dark-energy model since
the scaling of $G_{N}$ goes at the expense of deviation of concentration of
dark-matter particles from its canonical form and/or of promotion of their mass
to a time-dependent quantity, thereby making the effective equation of state
(EOS) variable and different from -1 at the present epoch. Thus the model has a
potential to naturally underpin Dirac's suggestion for explaining the
large-number hypothesis, which demands a dynamical $G_{N}$ along with the
creation of matter in the universe. We show that with the aid of observational
bounds on the variation of the gravitational coupling, the effective-field
theory IR cutoff can be strongly restricted, being always closer to the future
event horizon than to the Hubble distance. As for the observational side, the
effective EOS restricted by observation can be made arbitrary close to -1, and
therefore the present model can be considered as a ``minimal'' dynamical
dark-energy scenario. In addition, for nonzero but small curvature
$(|\Omega_{k0}| \lsim 0.003)$, the model easily accommodates a transition
across the phantom line for redshifts $z \lsim 0.2 $, as mildly favored by the
data. A thermodynamic aspect of the scenario is also discussed.

collapse (AIC) of white dwarfs, starting from 2D rotational equilibrium
configurations of a 1.46-Msun and a 1.92-Msun model. Electron capture leads to
the collapse to nuclear densities of these cores within a few tens of
milliseconds. The shock generated at bounce moves slowly, but steadily,
outwards. Within 50-100ms, the stalled shock breaks out of the white dwarf
along the poles. The blast is followed by a neutrino-driven wind that develops
within the white dwarf, in a cone of ~40deg opening angle about the poles, with
a mass loss rate of 5-8 x 10^{-3} Msun/yr. The ejecta have an entropy on the
order of 20-50 k_B/baryon, and an electron fraction distribution that is
bimodal. By the end of the simulations, at >600ms after bounce, the explosion
energy has reached 3-4 x 10^{49}erg and the total ejecta mass has reached a few
times 0.001Msun. We estimate the asymptotic explosion energies to be lower than
10^{50}erg, significantly lower than those inferred for standard core collapse.
The AIC of white dwarfs thus represents one instance where a neutrino mechanism
leads undoubtedly to a successful, albeit weak, explosion.
  We document in detail the numerous effects of the fast rotation of the
progenitors: The neutron stars are aspherical; the ``nu_mu'' and anti-nu_e
neutrino luminosities are reduced compared to the nu_e neutrino luminosity; the
deleptonized region has a butterfly shape; the neutrino flux and electron
fraction depend strongly upon latitude (a la von Zeipel); and a quasi-Keplerian

together with non-circular motions. The kinematics are modelled in terms of an
expanding and rotating disc or torus. The rotation axis is found to be in the
same direction as the molecular outflow. There is an inner cavity of radius
approx 1300 au with no OH masers. The inner cavity, like the water `shell'
masers and SiO masers, is centred on radio source I. Some of the OH masers
occur in velocity-coherent strings or arcs that are longer than 5~arcsec (2250
au). One such feature, Stream A, is a linear structure at position angle approx
45 degree, lying between IRc2 and BN. We suggest that these masers trace shock
fronts, and have appeared, like a vapour trail, 200 yr after the passage of the
runaway star BN. The radio proper motions of BN, source I and source n project
back to a region near the base of Stream A that is largely devoid of OH masers.

clusters, including the preferential loss of low-mass stars due to mass
segregation. The stellar mass function of a cluster evolves due to three
effects: (a) the evolution of massive stars; (b) early tidal effects reduce the
mass function independently of the stellar mass; (c) after mass segregation has
completed, tidal effects preferentially remove the lowest-mass stars from the
cluster. Results: (1) During the first ~40% of the lifetime of a cluster the
cluster simply gets fainter due to the loss of stars by tidal effects. (2)
Between ~40 and ~80% of its lifetime the cluster gets bluer due to the loss of
low-mass stars. This will result in an underestimate of the age of clusters if
standard cluster evolution models are used (0.15 -- 0.5 dex). (3) After ~80% of
the total lifetime of a cluster it will rapidly get redder. This is because
stars at the low-mass end of the main sequence, which are preferentially lost,
are bluer than the AGB stars that dominate the light at long wavelengths,
resulting in an age overestimate. (4) Clusters with mass segregation and the
preferential loss of low-mass stars evolve along almost the same tracks in
colour-colour diagrams as clusters without mass segregation. Therefore it will
be difficult to distinguish this effect from that due to the cluster age for
unresolved clusters, unless the total lifetime of the clusters can be
estimated. (5) The changes in the colour evolution of unresolved clusters due
to the preferential loss of low-mass stars will affect the determination of the
SFHs. (6) The preferential loss of low-mass stars might explain the presence of
old (~13 Gyr) clusters in NGC 4365 which are photometrically disguised as
intermediate-age clusters (2 - 5 Gyr). [Abridged]

of non-equilibrium chemistry, swiftly triggered in bursts of turbulence
dissipation and followed by a slow thermal and chemical relaxation phase,
assumed isobaric. The set of values derived from the observations, i.e. large
HCO+ abundances, temperatures in the range of 100--200 K and densities in the
range 100--1000 cm3, unambiguously belongs to the relaxation phase. The
kinematic properties of the gas suggest in turn that the observed HCO+ line
emission results from a space-time average in the beam of the whole cycle
followed by the gas and that the chemical enrichment is made at the expense of
the non-thermal energy. Last, we show that the ""warm chemistry"" signature (i.e
large abundances of HCO+, CH+, H20 and OH) acquired by the gas within a few
hundred years, the duration of the impulsive chemical enrichment, is kept over
more than thousand years. During the relaxation phase, the \wat/OH abundance
ratio stays close to the value measured in diffuse gas by the SWAS satellite,
while the OH/HCO+ ratio increases by more than one order of magnitude.

identified. Possible candidates include metal poor starburst dwarf galaxies of
which the Blue Compact Galaxy Haro 11 may represent a local counterpart. Using
the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) we obtained spectra of Haro
11 to search for leaking ionizing radiation. A weak signal shortwards of the
Lyman break is identified as Lyman continuum (LyC) emission escaping from the
ongoing starburst. From profile fitting to weak metal lines we derive column
densities of the low ionization species. Adopting a metallicity typical of the
H II regions of Haro 11, the corresponding H I column density is optically
thick in the LyC. Therefore most of the LyC photons must escape through
transparent holes in the interstellar medium. Using spectral evolutionary
models we constrain the escape fraction of the produced LyC photons to between
4 and 10%, assuming a normal Salpeter IMF. We argue that in a hierarchical
galaxy formation scenario, this allows for a substantial contribution to cosmic
reionization by starburst dwarf galaxies at high redshifts.

constrained Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate $\Delta G(n)$, the free energy
to form a crystalline embryo containing n silicon atoms, at T=3000, 3100, 3200

G(n)$ fits reasonably well to the data at all T studied, and at 3300 K yields a
chemical potential difference between liquid and stishovite that matches
independent calculation. We find that $n^*$, the size of the critical nucleus,
is approximately 10 silicon atoms at T=3300 K. At 3000 K, $n^*$ decreases to
approximately 3, and at such small sizes methodological challenges arise in the
evaluation of $\Delta G(n)$ when using standard techniques; indeed even the
thermodynamic stability of the supercooled liquid comes into question under
these conditions. We therefore present a modified approach that permits an
estimation of $\Delta G(n)$ at 3000 K. Finally, we directly evaluate at T=3000
K the kinetic prefactors in the CNT expression for J, and find physically
reasonable values; e.g. the diffusion length that Si atoms must travel in order
to move from the liquid to the crystal embryo is approximately 0.2 nm. We are
thereby able to compare the results for J at 3000 K obtained both directly and
based on CNT, and find that they agree within an order of magnitude.

magnetic anisotropy along [110] is found to exceed intrinsic cubic
magnetocrystalline anisotropy above a hole concentration of p = 1.5 * 10^21

annealing, and the temperature-dependent ac susceptibility is significantly
changed with increasing annealing time. On the basis of our recent scenario

deduce that the growth of highly hole-concentrated cluster regions with [110]

uniaxial anisotropy at the high hole concentration regime. We can clearly rule
out anisotropic lattice strain as a possible origin of the switching of the

strong time-dependent external source. An example of such a theory is the Color
Glass Condensate. We derive a formula, in terms of cut vacuum-vacuum Feynman
graphs, for the probability of producing a given number of particles. This
formula is valid to all orders in the coupling constant. The distribution of
multiplicities is non--Poissonian, even in the classical approximation. We
investigate an alternative method of calculating the mean multiplicity. At
leading order, the average multiplicity can be expressed in terms of retarded
solutions of classical equations of motion. We demonstrate that the average
multiplicity at {\it next-to-leading order} can be formulated as an initial
value problem by solving equations of motion for small fluctuation fields with
retarded boundary conditions. The variance of the distribution can be
calculated in a similar fashion. Our formalism therefore provides a framework
to compute from first principles particle production in proton-nucleus and
nucleus-nucleus collisions beyond leading order in the coupling constant and to
all orders in the source density. We also provide a transparent interpretation
(in conventional field theory language) of the well known
Abramovsky-Gribov-Kancheli (AGK) cancellations. Explicit connections are made
between the framework for multi-particle production developed here and the
framework of Reggeon field theory.

productions of a quarkonium. By taking color-octet components into account, the
approach can explain the $\psi'$-anomaly at Tevatron, where the measured
production rate at large transverse momentum $p_\perp$ is in order of magnitude
larger than the predicted with color-singlet components only. With the approach
one can predict that the produced $J/\psi$ and $\psi'$ at large $p_\perp$ will
be transversely polarized. But the prediction fails in confronting with
experimental measurements and this generates a puzzle. We examine the role of
spin-flip interactions in the spin density matrix of the transition of a
color-octet charm quark pair into $J/\psi$ and $\psi'$. These interactions will
introduce new nonperturbative parameters in the spin density matrix. Our result
shows that the impact of the interactions is always to dilute the polarization
and can be very significant. Taking the impact into account, predictions for
the polarization are more close to the measured than the previous predicted.
The same can also be expected for the polarization of $J/\psi$.

carrying fluxes corresponding to the `true' charges, while the quantum of P

exists an integer, n, such that T^n (x) = 1. The Statistical (3x+1)-Conjecture
asks the same question, except for a subset of Pi of density 1. The Structure
Theorem proven in \cite{sinai} shows that infinity is in a sense a repelling

this paper, we present the analogous theorem for some generalizations of the
(3x+1)-Map, and expand on the consequences derived in \cite{sinai}. The
generalizations we consider are determined by positive coprime integers, d and
g, with g > d >= 2, and a periodic function, h(x). The map T is defined by the
formula T(x) = (gx+h(gx))/d^k, where k is again the largest integer for which
T(x) is an integer. We prove an analogous Structure Theorem for (d,g,h)-Maps,
and that the probability distribution corresponding to the density converges to
the Wiener measure with the drift log(g) - d/(d-1)log(d) and positive diffusion
constant. This shows that it is natural to expect that typical trajectores
return to the origin if log(g) - d/(d-1) log(d) <0 and escape to infinity

this paper, we address the problem of computing maximum likelihood estimates in

to the condition that the errors for variables $i$ and $j$ be uncorrelated if
variable $i$ occurs in the structural equation for variable $j$. We introduce a

long-term evolution of a structured asexual population. It is based on the
assumptions of large population, rare mutations and small mutation steps, that
lead to a deterministic ODE describing the evolution of the dominant type,
called the ``canonical equation of adaptive dynamics.'' Here, in order to
include the effect of stochasticity (genetic drift), we consider self-regulated
randomly fluctuating populations subject to mutation, so that the number of
coexisting types may fluctuate. We apply a limit of rare mutations to these
populations, while keeping the population size finite. This leads to a jump
process, the so-called ``trait substitution sequence,'' where evolution
proceeds by successive invasions and fixations of mutant types. Then we apply a
limit of small mutation steps (weak selection) to this jump process, that leads
to a diffusion process that we call the ``canonical diffusion of adaptive
dynamics,'' in which genetic drift is combined with directional selection
driven by the gradient of the fixation probability, also interpreted as an
invasion fitness. Finally, we study in detail the particular case of multitype
logistic branching populations and seek explicit formulae for the invasion
fitness of a mutant deviating slightly from the resident type. In particular,
second-order terms of the fixation probability are products of functions of the
initial mutant frequency, times functions of the initial total population size,
called the invasibility coefficients of the resident by increased fertility,
defence, aggressiveness, isolation or survival.

with parallel semi-circular walls, which can serve as a model for a bended

space separates into two disjoint invariant components corresponding to the
left and right uni-directional motions. Dynamics is decomposed into the jump
map -- a Poincare map between the two ends of a basic cell, and the time
function -- traveling time across a basic cell of a point on a surface of
section. The jump map has a mixed phase space where the relative sizes of the
regular and chaotic components depend on the width of the channel. For a
suitable value of this parameter we can have almost fully chaotic phase space.
We have studied numerically the Lyapunov exponents, time auto-correlation
functions and diffusion of particles along the chain. As a result of a

subtract the average drift. The last result is also supported by some

as a function of $f_S$ and the loading rate ($r_f$). The simulations and
theoretical analysis have been done without and with the handles that are
explicitly modeled by semiflexible polymer chains. The mechanisms and time
scales for denaturation by temperature jump and mechanical unfolding are vastly
different. The directed perturbation of the native state by $f_S$ results in a
sequential unfolding of the hairpin starting from their ends whereas thermal
denaturation occurs stochastically. From the dependence of the unfolding rates
on $r_f$ and $f_S$ we show that the position of the unfolding transition state
(TS) is not a constant but moves dramatically as either $r_f$ or $f_S$ is
changed. The TS movements are interpreted by adopting the Hammond postulate for
forced-unfolding. Forced-unfolding simulations of RNA, with handles attached to
the two ends, show that the value of the unfolding force increases (especially
at high pulling speeds) as the length of the handles increases. The pathways
for refolding of RNA from stretched initial conformation, upon quenching $f_S$
to the quench force $f_Q$, are highly heterogeneous. The refolding times, upon
force quench, are at least an order of magnitude greater than those obtained by
temperature quench. The long $f_Q$-dependent refolding times starting from
fully stretched states are analyzed using a model that accounts for the
microscopic steps in the rate limiting step which involves the trans to gauche
transitions of the dihedral angles in the GAAA tetraloop. The simulations with
explicit molecular model for the handles show that the dynamics of force-quench
refolding is strongly dependent on the interplay of their contour length and
the persistence length, and the RNA persistence length.

proven useful to characterize some aspects of the folding of small proteins.
The success of these models is limited by the fact that all residues interact
in the same way, so that the folding features of a protein are determined only
by the geometry of its native conformation. We present an extended version of a
C-alpha based Go model where different residues interact with different

which has lately received particular attention. The picture which emerges for
the three proteins under study is that of a hierarchical process, where local
elementary structures (LES) (not necessarily coincident with elements of
secondary structure) are formed at the early stages of the folding and drive
the protein, through the transition state and the postcritical folding nucleus

information on the nature of any optical field and find various relevant
applications. Nevertheless, no detector that can reliably discriminate the
number of incident photons is available. On the other hand the alternative of
reconstructing density matrix by quantum tomography leads to various technical
difficulties that are particular severe in the pulsed regime (where mode
matching between signal an local oscillator is very challenging). Even if
on/off detectors, as usual avalanche PhotoDiodes operating in Geiger mode, seem
useless as photocounters, recently it was shown how reconstruction of photon
statistics is possible by considering a variable quantum efficiency. Here we
present experimental reconstructions of photon number distributions of both
continuous-wave and pulsed light beams in a scheme based on on/off avalanche
photodetection assisted by maximum-likelihood estimation. Reconstructions of
the distribution for both semiclassical and quantum states of light (as single
photon, coherent, pseudothermal and multithermal states) are reported for
single-mode as well as for multimode beams. The stability and good accuracy
obtained in the reconstruction of these states clearly demonstrate the
interesting potentialities of this simple technique.
