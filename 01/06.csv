solution we find the masses and radii of the two components to be 30 +/- 1 and
16 +/- 1 solar masses and 7.5 +/- 0.5 and 5.3 +/- 0.5 solar radii. These radii,
and hence also the luminosities, are smaller than those of normal O-type stars,
but similar to recently born ZAMS O-type stars. The absolute magnitudes derived
from our analysis locate FO 15 at the same distance as Eta Carinae. From
Chandra and XMM X-ray images we also find that there are two close X-ray

obscure star in M31. The spectrum of the star is an extremely close match to
that of P Cygni, one of the archetypes of Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs). The
star has not shown much variability over the past 40 years ($<0.2$ mag),
although small-scale (0.05 mag) variations over a year appear to be real.
Nevertheless, the presence of a sub-arcsecond extension around the star is
indicative of a past outburst, and from the nebula's size (0.5 pc diameter) we
estimate the outburst took place roughly 2000 yrs ago. P Cygni itself exhibits
a similar photometric behavior, and has a similar nebula (0.2 pc diameter). We
argue that this may be more typical behavior for LBVs than commonly assumed.
The star's location in the HR diagram offers substantial support for stellar
evolutionary models that include the effects of rotation, as the star is just
at a juncture in the evolutionary track of a 85Mo star. The star is likely in a
transition from an O star to a late-type WN Wolf-Rayet.

jet flows emitting synchrotron radiation. Here we extend previous models of
jets propagating at large angles to our line of sight to self-consistently
include the effects of energy losses of the relativistic electrons due to the
synchrotron process itself and the adiabatic expansion of the jet flow. We also
take into account energy gains through self-absorption. Two model classes are
presented. The ballistic jet flows, with the jet material travelling along
straight trajectories, and adiabatic jets. Despite the energy losses, both
scenarios can result in flat emission spectra, however, the adiabatic jets
require a specific geometry. No re-acceleration process along the jet is needed
for the electrons. We apply the models to observational data of the X-ray
binary Cygnus X-1. Both models can be made consistent with the observations.
The resulting ballistic jet is extremely narrow with a jet opening angle of
only 5"". Its energy transport rate is small compared to the time-averaged jet
power and therefore suggests the presence of non-radiating protons in the jet
flow. The adiabatic jets require a strong departure from energy equipartition
between the magnetic field and the relativistic electrons. These models also
imply a jet power two orders of magnitude higher than the Eddington limiting
luminosity of a 10 solar mass black hole. The models put strong constraints on
the physical conditions in the jet flows on scales well below achievable

newcomers that recently infall from outside, we can learn an important lesson
on the latest stages of galaxy evolution. We start by reviewing the
observational scenario, covering the broadest possible stretch of the
electromagnetic spectrum, from the gas tracers, the star formation tracers, the
old star tracers and the dust. Strong emphasis is given to the three nearby,
well studied clusters Virgo, A1367 and Coma, representative of different
evolutionary stages, from unrelaxed, spiral rich (Virgo) to relaxed, spiral
poor clusters (Coma). We continue by providing a review of models of galaxy
interactions relevant to clusters of galaxies. Prototypes of various mechanisms
and processes are discussed and their typical time-scales are given in an
Appendix. Observations indicate the presence of healthy late-type galaxies
falling into nearby clusters individually or belonging to massive groups. More
rare are infalling galaxies belonging to compact groups where significant
pre-processing might take place. Once entered the cluster, they loose their gas
and quench their star formation activity, becoming anemics. Observations and
theory agree in indicating that the interaction with the intergalactic medium
is responsible for the gas depletion. This process, however, cannot be at the
origin of the cluster lenticular galaxy population. Physical and statistical
properties of S0 in nearby clusters and at higher redshift, indicate that they
originate from spiral galaxies transformed by gravitational interactions.

decades. Even if data are coming from different sources, it is well established
that a temporal variability exists which can be set to as approximately 0.1%,
in phase with the solar cycle. Today, one of the best explanation for such an
irradiance variability is provided by the evolution of the solar surface
magnetic fields. But if some 90 to 95% can be reproduced, what would be the
origin of the 10 to 5% left? Non magnetic effects are conceivable. In this
paper we will consider temporal variations of the diameter of the Sun as a
possible contributor for the remaining part. Such an approach imposes strong
constraints on the solar radius variability. We will show that over a solar
cycle, variations of no more than 20 mas of amplitude can be considered. Such a
variability (far from what is reported by observers conducting measurements by
means of ground-based solar astrolabes) may explain a little part of the
irradiance changes not explained by magnetic features. Further requirements are
needed that may help to reach a conclusion. Dedicated space missions are
necessary (for example PICARD, GOLF-NG or SDO, scheduled for a launch around

used to describe canonical extra mixing in low mass red giants of low and solar
metallicity. These models are able to simultaneously explain the observed Li
and CN abundance changes along upper red giant branch (RGB) in field
low-metallicity stars and match photometry, rotation and carbon isotopic ratios
for stars in the old open cluster M67. The shear mixing model requires that
main sequence (MS) progenitors of upper RGB stars possessed rapidly rotating
radiative cores and that specific angular momentum was conserved in each of
their mass shells during their evolution. We surmise that solar-type stars will
not experience canonical extra mixing on the RGB because their more efficient
MS spin-down resulted in solid-body rotation, as revealed by helioseismological
data for the Sun. Thus, RGB stars in the old, high metallicity cluster NGC 6791
should show no evidence for mixing in their carbon isotopic ratios.
  We develop the idea that canonical extra mixing in a giant component of a
binary system may be switched to its enhanced mode with much faster and
somewhat deeper mixing as a result of the giant's tidal spin-up. This scenario
can explain photometric and composition peculiarities of RS CVn binaries. The
tidally enforced enhanced extra mixing might contribute to the star-to-star
abundance variations of O, Na and Al in globular clusters. This idea may be
tested with observations of carbon isotopic ratios and CN abundances in RS CVn
binaries.

explosive nucleosynthesis in a collapsar using the model of MacFadyen and
Woosley (1999). It is shown that 56Ni is not produced in the jet of the
collapsar sufficiently to explain the observed amount of a hypernova when the
duration of the explosion is \sim 10 sec, which is considered to be the typical
timescale of explosion in the collapsar model. Even though a considerable
amount of 56Ni is synthesized if all explosion energy is deposited initially,
the opening angles of the jets become too wide to realize highly relativistic
outflows and gamma-ray bursts in such a case. From these results, it is
concluded that the origin of 56Ni in hypernovae associated with GRBs is not the
explosive nucleosynthesis in the jet. We consider that the idea that the origin
is the explosive nucleosynthesis in the accretion disk is more promising. We
also show that the explosion becomes bi-polar naturally due to the effect of
the deformed progenitor. This fact suggests that the 56Ni synthesized in the
accretion disk and conveyed as outflows are blown along to the rotation axis,
which will explain the line features of SN 1998bw and double peaked line
features of SN 2003jd. Some fraction of the gamma-ray lines from 56Ni decays in
the jet will appear without losing their energies because the jet becomes
optically thin before a considerable amount of 56Ni decays as long as the jet
is a relativistic flow. We show that abundance of nuclei whose mass number \sim
40 in the ejecta depends sensitively on the energy deposition rate. So it may
be determined by observations of chemical composition in metal poor stars which
model is the proper one as a model of a gamma-ray burst accompanied by a
hypernova.

galaxies (U-V=0.62). We determine which galaxies would be selected as Lyman
break galaxies (LBGs) or Distant Red Galaxies (DRGs, having J-K>2.3) in this
mass-limited sample. By number DRGs make up 69% of the sample and LBGs 20%,
with a small amount of overlap. By mass DRGs make up 77% and LBGs 17%. Neither
technique provides a representative sample of massive galaxies at 2<z<3 as they
only sample the extremes of the population. As we show here, multi-wavelength
surveys with high quality photometry are essential for an unbiased census of
massive galaxies in the early Universe. The main uncertainty in this analysis
is our reliance on photometric redshifts; confirmation of the results presented
here requires extensive near-infrared spectroscopy of optically-faint samples.

2 kpc to 50 parsecs. The angular momentum transport, disk morphology and radial
profiles depend sensitively on force and mass resolution. At low resolution,
similar to that used in most current cosmological simulations, the cold gas
component has lost half of its initial angular momentum via different
mechanisms. The angular momentum is transferred primarily to the hot halo
component, by resolution-dependent hydrodynamical and gravitational torques,
the latter arising from asymmetries in the mass distribution. In addition,
disk-particles can lose angular momentum while they are still in the hot phase
by artificial viscosity. In the central disk, particles can transfer away over
99% of their initial angular momentum due to spiral structure and/or the
presence of a central bar. The strength of this transport also depends on force
and mass resolution - large softening will suppress the bar instability, low
mass resolution enhances the spiral structure. This complex interplay between
resolution and angular momentum transfer highlights the complexity of
simulations of galaxy formation even in isolated haloes. With 10^6 gas and dark
matter particles, disk particles lose only 10-20% of their original angular
momentum, yet we are unable to produce pure exponential profiles.

This age dependence of halo clustering makes it desirable to study the
correlation between the occupation of galaxies within halos and the halo age.
We find that, in halos of fixed mass, the number of satellite galaxies has a
strong dependence on halo age, with fewer satellites in older halos. The
youngest one-third of the halos can have an order of magnitude more satellites
than the oldest one-third. For central galaxies, in halos that form earlier,
they tend to have more stars and thus appear to be more luminous, and the
dependence of their luminosity on halo age is not as strong as that of stellar
mass. The results can be understood through the star formation history in halos
and the merging of satellites onto central galaxies. The age dependence of the
galaxy contents within halos would constitute an important ingredient in a more
accurate halo-based model of galaxy clustering.

morphology (obtained from GOODS data) of 75 % of our LBGs is consistent with a
disk. The vast majority of LBGs with an IR detection are also Luminous Infrared
Galaxies (LIRGs). As a class, the galaxies not detected at 24 microns are an
order of magnitude fainter relative to the UV compared with those detected
individually, suggesting that there may be two types of behavior within the
sample. For the IR-bright galaxies, there is an apparent upper limit for the UV
dust attenuation and this upper limit is anti-correlated with the observed UV
luminosity. Previous estimates of dust attenuations based on the ultraviolet
slope are compared to new ones based on the FIR/UV ratio (for LBGs detected at
24 microns), which is usually a more reliable estimator. Depending on the
calibration we use to estimate the total IR luminosity, beta-based attenuations
A_{FUV} are larger by 0.2 to 0.6 mag. than the ones estimated from FIR/UV
ratio. Finally, for IR-bright LBGs, median estimated beta-based SFRs are 2-3
times larger than the total SFRs estimated as SFR_{TOT} = SFR_{UV} + SFR_{IR}
while IR-based SFRs provide values below SFR_{TOT} by 15 - 20 %. We use a

distribution of a gravitational lens system with multiple strong-lensed images.
The technique involves a dynamic grid in the lens plane on which the mass
distribution of the lens is approximated by a sum of basis functions, one per
grid cell. We used the projected mass densities of Plummer spheres as basis
functions. A genetic algorithm then determines the mass distribution of the
lens by forcing images of a single source, projected back onto the source
plane, to coincide as well as possible. Averaging several tens of solutions
removes the random fluctuations that are introduced by the reproduction process
of genomes in the genetic algorithm and highlights those features common to all
solutions. Given the positions of the images and the redshifts of the sources
and the lens, we show that the mass of a gravitational lens can be retrieved
with an accuracy of a few percent and that, if the sources sufficiently cover
the caustics, the mass distribution of the gravitational lens can also be
reliably retrieved. A major advantage of the algorithm is that it makes full
use of the information contained in the radial images, unlike methods that
minimise the residuals of the lens equation, and is thus able to accurately
reconstruct also the inner parts of the lens.

gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) obtained using the Swift satellite for which the
narrow-field instruments were pointed at the burst within 10 minutes of the

X-ray light curve can be well described by an exponential that relaxes into a
power law, often with flares superimposed. The transition time between the
exponential and the power law provides a physically defined timescale for the
burst duration. In most bursts the power law breaks to a shallower decay within
the first hour, and a late emission ""hump"" is observed which can last for many
hours. In other GRBs the hump is weak or absent. The observed variety in the
shape of the early X-ray light curve can be explained as a combination of three
components: prompt emission from the central engine; afterglow; and the late
hump. In this scenario, afterglow emission begins during or soon after the
burst and the observed shape of the X-ray light curve depends on the relative
strengths of the emission due to the central engine and that of the afterglow.
There is a strong correlation such that those GRBs with stronger afterglow
components have brighter early optical emission. The late emission hump can
have a total fluence equivalent to that of the prompt phase. GRBs with the
strongest late humps have weak or no X-ray flares.

thin, optically thick accretion discs are illuminated by a central radiation
source. This illumination exerts a non-axisymmetric radiation pressure on the
surface of the disc resulting in a torque that acts on the disc to induce a
twist or warp. Initially planar discs are unstable to warping driven by the
radiation torque and in general the warps also precess in a retrograde
direction relative to the orbital flow. We simulate a number of X-ray binary
systems which have different mass ratios using a number of different
luminosities for each. Radiation-driven warping occurs for all systems
simulated. For mass ratios q ~ 0.1 a moderate warp occurs in the inner disc
while the outer disc remains in the orbital plane (c.f. X 1916-053). For less

> 0$ and $\phi(x) \in \mathbb{R}$, a scalar height variable, and define
occupation variables $\rho_h(x) =1,(0)$ for $\phi(x) > h (<h)$. The probability
$p$ of a site being occupied, is then a function of $h$. In the voter model we
consider the stationary measure, in which each site is either occupied or
empty, with probability $p$. In both cases the truncated pair correlation of
the occupation variables, $G(x-y)$, decays asymptotically like $|x-y|^{-1}$.

accurate values of $p_c$ as well as the critical exponents for these systems.

asymmetric binary hard sphere mixtures. This system is treated within an
effective fluid approximation in which the large particles interact through a
depletion potential (R. Roth {\em et al}, Phys. Rev. E{\bf 62} 5360 (2000))
designed to capture the effects of a virtual sea of small particles. We
generalize this depletion potential to include the effects of explicit size
dispersity in the large particles and consider the case in which the particle
diameters are distributed according to a Schulz form having degree of
polydispersity 14%. The resulting alteration (with respect to the monodisperse
limit) of the metastable fluid-fluid critical point parameters is determined
for two values of the ratio of the diameters of the small and large particles:
$q\equiv\sigma_s/\bar\sigma_b=0.1$ and $q=0.05$. We find that inclusion of
polydispersity moves the critical point to lower reservoir volume fractions of
the small particles and high volume fractions of the large ones. The estimated
critical point parameters are found to be in good agreement with those
predicted by a generalized corresponding states argument which provides a link
to the known critical adhesion parameter of the adhesive hard sphere model.
Finite-size scaling estimates of the cluster percolation line in the one phase
fluid region indicate that inclusion of polydispersity moves the critical point
deeper into the percolating regime. This suggests that phase separation is more
likely to be preempted by dynamical arrest in polydisperse systems.

time are considered and one consequent benefit of the framework is the ability
to systematically reduce infinite-time reasoning to finite-time reasoning. The
treatment of PTL with both the operator Until and past time naturally reduces
to that for PTL without either one. Our method utilises a low-level normal form
for PTL called a ""transition configuration"". In addition, we employ reasoning
about intervals of time. Besides being hierarchical and interval-based, the
approach differs from other analyses of PTL typically based on sets of formulas
and sequences of such sets. Instead we describe models using time intervals
represented as finite and infinite sequences of states. The analysis relates
larger intervals with smaller ones. Steps involved are expressed in
Propositional Interval Temporal Logic (PITL) which is better suited than PTL
for sequentially combining and decomposing formulas. Consequently, we can
articulate issues in PTL model construction of equal relevance in more
conventional analyses but normally only considered at the metalevel. We also
describe a decision procedure based on Binary Decision Diagrams.

Separate characterizations in terms of the spectral properties of appropriate

combinatorial interference model (e.g., Protocol model). These provide an inner
approximation to the $n^2$ dimensional capacity region. These results answer
the following questions which arise naturally from previous work: (a) What is
the significance of $1/\sqrt{n}$ in the scaling laws for the Protocol
interference model obtained by Gupta and Kumar (2000)? (b) Can we obtain a
tight approximation to the ""maximum supportable flow"" for node distributions
more general than the geometric random distribution, traffic models other than
randomly chosen source-destination pairs, and under very general assumptions on
the channel fading model?
  We first establish that the random source-destination model is essentially a
one-dimensional approximation to the capacity region, and a special case of
product multi-commodity flow. Building on previous results, for a combinatorial
interference model given by a network and a conflict graph, we relate the
product multicommodity flow to the spectral properties of the underlying graphs
resulting in computational upper and lower bounds. For the more interesting
random fading model with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), we show that the
scaling laws for PMF can again be tightly characterized by the spectral
properties of appropriately defined graphs. As an implication, we obtain
computationally efficient upper and lower bounds on the PMF for any wireless
network with a guaranteed approximation factor.

comparing the perturbed M/M/1 queue with the M/M/1 queue where the service rate

magnitude of a small parameter \eps \ll 1 and related to an auxiliary
stationary Markovian process (X(t)). Under the assumption that data transfers
are exponentially distributed, arrive according to a Poisson process, and share
the available bandwidth according to the ideal processor sharing discipline, we
derive the mean bit rate of a data transfer as a power series expansion in

and is an area of ongoing research. The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)
at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) inaugurated its operation as the first
polarized-proton collider during the 2001-2002 run, marking the beginning of a
new era in the study of proton spin structure.

transverse single-spin asymmetry (A_N) for neutral pion production at x_F~0.0
over a transverse momentum range of 1 to 5 GeV/c from polarized proton-proton
interactions at a center-of-mass energy of 200 GeV and found it to be zero

production at forward angles by the E704 collaboration at Fermilab (sqrt{s} =

energies, as well as single-spin, azimuthal asymmetries observed recently in
semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering experiments. Such large asymmetries
were initially surprising because at leading order, pQCD predicted only small
effects.
  Several possible origins of these large asymmetries have been proposed.
Despite great theoretical progress in recent years, no single, clear formalism
has emerged in which to interpret the available data. Further theoretical work
and a variety of additional experimental measurements will be necessary to
understand current results and elucidate the transverse spin structure of the
proton.

special relations among parameters, highly sensitive to small variations. This

the general parameter space of low-energy supersymmetry, one of the most

that provided the mixing angle around y-axis to diagonalize the Majorana mass

non-relativistic Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). Let $H(\vp,\sig)$ denote the
fiber Hamiltonian corresponding to the conserved total momentum $\vp\in\R^3$ of
the Pauli electron and the photon field, regularized by a fixed ultraviolet
cutoff in the interaction term, and an infrared regularization parametrized by
$0<\sig\ll1$ which we ultimately remove by taking $\sig\searrow0$. For
$|\vp|<\puppbd$, all $\sig>0$, and all values of the finestructure constant
$\gs<\gs_0$, with $\gs_0\ll1$ sufficiently small and {\em independent} of
$\sig$, we prove the existence of a ground state eigenvalue of multiplicity two
at the bottom of the essential spectrum. Moreover, we prove that the
renormalized electron mass satisfies $1<m_{ren}(\vp,\sig)<1+c\alpha$, {\em
uniformly} in $\sig\geq0$, in units where the bare mass has the value 1, and we
prove the existence of the renormalized mass in the limit $\sig\searrow0$. Our
analysis uses the isospectral renormalization group method of
Bach-Fr\""ohlich-Sigal introduced in \cite{bfs1,bfs2} and further developed in
\cite{bcfs1,bcfs2}. The limit $\sig\searrow0$ determines a scaling-critical
renormalization group problem of endpoint type, in which the interaction is
strictly marginal (of scale-independent size). The main achievement of this
paper is the development of a method that provides rigorous control of the
renormalization of a {\em strictly marginal} quantum field theory characterized
by a {\em non-trivial scaling limit}.

due to the way in which users are networked in a real-life human society.
Furthermore, two kinds of user network, namely, the fully-connected user
network and the scale-free network, are employed to model the way in which
telephone users are connected. We show that the blocking probability is
generally higher in the case of the scale-free user network, and that the
