deep high-resolution imaging by HST/ACS. Our reference catalogue of faint
high-redshift galaxies, which we have thoroughly tested for completeness and
reliability, comes from a deep (S(3.6micron)>1 microJy) image by IRAC on the
Spitzer Observatory. These imaging data in the field are complemented with
extensive optical spectroscopy by the ESO VLT/FORS2 and VIMOS spectrographs,
while deep K-band VLT/ISAAC imaging is also used to derive further
complementary statistical constraints and to assist the source identification
and SED analysis. We have selected a highly reliable IRAC 3.6micron sub-sample
of 1478 galaxies with S(3.6)>10microJy, 47% of which have spectroscopic
redshift, while for the remaining objects both COMBO-17 and Hyperz are used to
estimate the photometric redshift. This very extensive dataset is exploited to
assess evolutionary effects in the galaxy luminosity and stellar mass
functions, while luminosity/density evolution is further constrained with the
number counts and redshift distributions. The deep ACS imaging allows us to
differentiate these evolutionary paths by morphological type, which our
simulations show to be reliable at least up to z=1.5 for the two main early-
(E/S0) and late-type (Sp/Irr) classes. These data, as well as our direct
estimate of the stellar mass function above M=10^(10)M_sun for the spheroidal
subclass, consistently evidence a progressive dearth of such objects to occur
starting at z=0.7, paralleled by an increase in luminosity. (abridged)

wavelength observations enable rough separation of dust emission from thermal
free-free emission, and we find substantial dust emission toward most objects.
For the ten objects detected at both 3 mm and near-IR wavelengths, eight
exhibit substantial dust emission. Excluding the high-mass stars and assuming a
gas-to-dust ratio of 100, we estimate circumstellar masses ranging from 0.13 to
0.39 Msun. For the cluster members not detected at 3 mm, images of individual
objects are stacked to constrain the mean 3 mm flux of the ensemble. The
average flux is detected at the 3-sigma confidence level, and implies an
average disk mass of 0.005 Msun, comparable to the minimum mass solar nebula.
The percentage of stars in Orion surrounded by disks more massive than ~0.1
Msun is consistent with the disk mass distribution in Taurus, and we argue that
massive disks in Orion do not appear to be truncated through close encounters
with high-mass stars. Comparison of the average disk mass and number of massive

excellent tracer of even small amounts ($\sim 1$% mass fraction) of recent

possible emission-line or radio-selected AGN removed to avoid contamination. We
find that contamination by AGN candidates and late-type interlopers highly bias
any study of recent star formation in early-type galaxies and that, after
removing those, our lower limit to the fraction of massive early-type galaxies
showing signs of recent star formation is roughly $30 \pm 3%$ This suggests
that residual star formation is common even amongst the present day early-type

All of our targets are clearly detected. A search for extended X-ray emission
associated with kpc-scale radio jets revealed only limited evidence for X-ray
extension in our sample: three sources showed no evidence of X-ray extension,
and the other three had 3-30% of their total X-ray fluxes extended >1 arcsec
away from their X-ray cores. Additionally, we do not observe any systematic
flattening of the optical-to-X-ray spectral index (alpha_{ox}) compared to
low-redshift quasars. These results suggest that kpc-scale X-ray jet emission
is not dominated by inverse-Compton scattering of CMB-seed photons off jet
electrons. We measured X-ray continuum shapes and performed individual and
joint spectral fits of our data combined with eight archival RLQs. A single
power-law model acceptably fit the data. We added an intrinsic absorption
component to our model, and neither the moderate-R nor the high-R fits set a
lower bound on N_H. Our spectral results suggest that intrinsic absorption does
not strongly depend on radio-loudness, and high-R sources have flatter power
laws than moderate-R sources. Overall, our high-redshift RLQs have basic X-ray
properties consistent with similar RLQs in the local universe.

Within a region of the initial density field that is to evolve into a lower
mass galaxy, subgalactic-scale fluctuation is of a smaller amplitude. The
formation of subgalactic-scale objects, i.e., gravitational collapse of the
subgalactic-scale fluctuation, and the subsequent onset of star formation

the evaporation from high disk altitudes effectively lead to a progressive,
moderate enrichment of the disk. The fact that noble gases are vaporized from
the grains in the hot inner disk regions (e.g. Jupiter formation region) is not
a concern because a negative temperature gradient prevents convection from
carrying the species into the evaporating region. We show that the ~2 times
solar enrichment of Ar, Kr, Xe in Jupiter is hence naturally explained by a
continuous growth of the planet governed by viscous diffusion in the protosolar
disk in conjunction with an evaporation of the disk and its progressive
enrichment on a million years timescale.

interactions in supercell calculations for systems that are infinite and
periodic in 1 or 2 dimensions, extending previous works for finite systems. The
proposed cutoffs are functions in Fourier space, that are used as a
multiplicative factor to screen the bare Coulomb interaction. The functions are
analytic everywhere but in a sub-domain of the Fourier space that depends on
the periodic dimensionality. We show that the divergences that lead to the
non-analytical behaviour can be exactly cancelled when both the ionic and the
Hartree potential are properly screened. This technique is exact, fast, and
very easy to implement in already existing supercell codes. To illustrate the
performance of the new scheme, we apply it to the case of the Coulomb
interaction in systems with reduced periodicity (as one-dimensional chains and
layers). For those test cases we address the impact of the cutoff in different
relevant quantities for ground and excited state properties, namely: the
convergence of the ground state properties, the static polarisability of the
system, the quasiparticle corrections in the GW scheme and in the binding
energy of the excitonic states in the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The results are
very promising.

three-dimensional, and instead of an isolated multiphase point, we find
two-dimensional multiphase regions. In an example of Villain's ``order from
disorder'' \cite{Villain80a,Villain91}, an infinitesimal temperature breaks the
ground-state degeneracy. In first order of a low-temperature expansion, we find
that the degeneracy is broken everywhere in a multiphase region except on a
line. A segment of the line appears to remain multiphase to all orders in a
low-temperature expansion when the number $L$ of magnetic layers between
non-magnetic spacers is 4 but not for other values of $L$. For L=4, the
hierarchy of phases more closely resembles that in the ANNNI model than in the

aggregation. Additionally, a classification of fractal growth models is
suggested.

external forces (the boundary condition), and on the probability distribution
of individual contact forces. The disordered spatial structure of the force
network, however, has remained elusive so far. Here we report evidence for
scale invariance of clusters of particles that interact via relatively strong
forces. We analyzed granular packings generated by molecular dynamics
simulations mimicking real granular matter; despite the visual variation, force
networks for various values of the confining pressure and other parameters have
identical scaling exponents and scaling function, and thus determine a
universality class. Remarkably, the flat ensemble of force configurations--a
simple generalization of equilibrium statistical mechanics--belongs to the same
universality class, while some widely studied simplified models do not.

We also verify that at large distances to the core the space-time metric is
similar to that of a global string. We study the motion of test particles
approaching from infinity and show that photons are scattered to infinity while
massive particles are trapped in bounded trajectories. We also calculate an
overall limit on the magnitude of the variation of $\alpha$ for a GUT string,

level of a few percent. Such studies parallel those of the electroweak sector
over the past fifteen years, and deviations from expectations would be a sign
of new physics. These observables provide a firm ``place to stand'' from which
to extend our understanding. This links to the second category of study, where
one deliberately moves to regions in which the usual theoretical tools fail;
here new approximations in QCD are developed to increase our portfolio of
understood processes, and hence our sensitivity to new physics. Recent progress
in both these aspects of QCD at colliders is discussed.

discovery of the Higgs particle, and search for new physics in the TeV energy
scale, such as supersymmetry or extra dimensions. Besides these goals, the LHC
will also make a substantial number of precision measurements and will offer a
new regime to study the strong force via perturbative QCD processes and
diffraction. For the full LHC physics programme a good understanding of QCD
phenomena and the structure function of the proton is essential. Therefore, in
March 2004, a one-year-long workshop started to study the implications of HERA
on LHC physics. This included proposing new measurements to be made at HERA,
extracting the maximum information from the available data, and
developing/improving the theoretical and experimental tools. This report
summarizes the results achieved during this workshop.

  Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan, during 28Nov- 02Dec 2005",,,,"hep-ph astro-ph hep-th",,"  Cosmic strings in the brane Universe have recently gained a great interest. I
think the most interesting story is that future cosmological observations
distinguish them from the conventional cosmic strings. If the strings are the
higher-dimensional objects that can (at least initially) move along the
compactified space, and finally settle down to (quasi-)degenerated vacua in the
compactified space, then kinks should appear on the strings, which interpolate
between the degenerated vacua. These kinks look like ``beads'' on the strings,
which means that the strings turn into necklaces. Moreover, in the case that
the compact manifold is not simply connected, the string loop that winds around
a non-trivial circle is stable due to the topological reason. Since the
existence of degenerated vacua and a non-trivial circle is the common feature
of the brane models, it is important to study cosmological constraints on the
cosmic necklaces and their stable winding states in the brane Universe.

is not favored if the Peccei-Quinn field emerges with non-zero value at the end

circumstances, it leads to unacceptably large isocurvature perturbations. The
lightest neutralino is the most popular candidate constituent of cold dark
matter. Its relic abundance in the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard
model can be reduced to acceptable values by pole annihilation of neutralinos
or neutralino-stau coannihilation. Axinos can also contribute to cold dark
matter provided that the reheat temperature is adequately low. Gravitinos can
constitute the cold dark matter only in limited regions of the parameter space.
We present a supersymmetric grand unified model leading to violation of Yukawa
unification and, thus, allowing an acceptable b-quark mass within the
constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model with mu>0. The model
possesses a wide range of parameters consistent with the data on the cold dark
matter abundance as well as other phenomenological constraints. Also, it leads
to a new version of shifted hybrid inflation.

homogeneous boundary conditions. We prove that its eigenfunctions are

orthogonality is proved asymptotically within a narrow eigenvalue window of
width o(E^{1/2}) centered about E, as E->infinity. For the special case of
Dirichlet boundary conditions, the normal-derivative functions are
quasi-orthogonal on the boundary with respect to the geometric weight function
r.n. The result is independent of any quantum ergodicity assumptions and hence
of the nature of the domain's geodesic flow; however if this is ergodic then
heuristic semiclassical results suggest an improved asymptotic estimate.
Boundary quasi-orthogonality is the key to a highly efficient `scaling method'
for numerical solution of the Laplace eigenproblem at large eigenvalue. One of
the main results of this paper is then to place this method on a more rigorous

the sunflower are amongst the most widely-known occurrences. While these are
static, dynamic spirals can also be observed in excitable systems such as heart
tissue, retina, certain chemical reactions, slime mold aggregates, flame
fronts, etc. The images associated with these spirals are often breathtaking,
but spirals have also been linked to cardiac arrhythmias, a potentially fatal
heart ailment.
  In the literature, very specific models depending on the excitable system of
interest are used to explain the observed behaviour of spirals (such as
anchoring or drifting). Barkley first noticed that the Euclidean symmetry of
these models, and not the model itself, is responsible for the observed
behaviour. But in experiments, the physical domain is never Euclidean. The
heart, for instance, is finite, anisotropic and littered with inhomogeneities.
To capture this loss of symmetry, LeBlanc and Wulff introduced forced Euclidean
symmetry-breaking (FESB) in the analysis.
  To accurately model the physical situation, two basic types of
symmetry-breaking perturbations are used: translational symmetry-breaking (TSB)
and rotational symmetry-breaking (RSB) terms. In this paper, we provide an
overview of currently know results about spiral wave dynamics under FESB.

founded that the definition of vortex, based on the Stokes decomposition,

decomposition. By further extending Chen results, this research studies the
motion equation of fluid for the case where highly asymmetric velocity gradient
is exhibited. The result shows that the classical NS equation does not meet the
requirement of angular momentum conservation, which is apparently ignored for
infinitesimal velocity gradient of fluid. This paper reformulates the intrinsic
geometric description of fluid motion and two additional equations are
introduced. Combining with the classical NS equation, the reformulated motion
equations are in closed-form. The research shows that the NS equation is good
approximation for average flow, so it can not solve the turbulent problem in

much interest during the last decades. Despite the fact that recent numerical
simulations of the geodynamo have shown nice polarity transitions, the very
reason and the basic mechanism of reversals are far from being understood.
Using a paradigmatic mean-field dynamo model with a spherically symmetric
helical turbulence parameter alpha we attribute the essential features of
reversals to the magnetic field dynamics in the vicinity of an exceptional
point of the spectrum of the non-selfadjoint dynamo operator. At such
exceptional (branch) points of square root type two real eigenvalues coalesce
and continue as a complex conjugated pair of eigenvalues. Special focus is laid
on the comparison of numerically computed time series with paleomagnetic
observations. It is shown that the considered dynamo model with high
supercriticality can explain the observed time scale and the asymmetric shape
of reversals with a slow decay and a fast field recovery.

by experimental results concerning the light transmission through three
polarizers.

is discussed from a control theoretic perspective. The noninvasive nature of
the bulk measurement allows for a fully unitary and deterministic closed loop.
The Lyapunov-based feedback design presented does not require spins that are
selectively addressable. With this method, it is possible to obtain control
inputs also for difficult tasks, like suppressing undesired couplings in
identical spin systems.

studied. We propose the quantum cloning transformations not only for the
triplet (symmetric) states but also for the singlet (antisymmetric) state. We
can copy these two identical mixed qubits to M (M>2) copies. This quantum
cloning machine is optimal in the sense that the shrinking factor between the
input and the output single qubit achieves the upper bound. The result shows
that we can copy two identical mixed qubits with the same quality as that of
two identical pure states.

method for matter wave interferometry with fluorescent particles. Mechanically
magnified fluorescence imaging turns out to be an excellent tool for recording
quantum interference patterns. It has a good sensitivity and yields patterns of
high visibility. The spatial resolution of this technique is only determined by
the Talbot gratings and can exceed the optical resolution limit by an order of
magnitude. A unique advantage of this approach is its scalability: for certain
classes of nano-sized objects, the detection sensitivity will even increase
significantly with increasing size of the particle.

A 75, 032321 (2007)","10.1103/PhysRevA.75.032321",,"quant-ph cond-mat.str-el",,"  We show that adiabatic evolution of a low-dimensional lattice of quantum
spins with a spectral gap can be simulated efficiently. In particular, we show
that as long as the spectral gap \Delta E between the ground state and the
first excited state is any constant independent of n, the total number of
spins, then the ground-state expectation values of local operators, such as
correlation functions, can be computed using polynomial space and time
resources. Our results also imply that the local ground-state properties of any
two spin models in the same quantum phase can be efficiently obtained from each
other. A consequence of these results is that adiabatic quantum algorithms can
be simulated efficiently if the spectral gap doesn't scale with n. The
simulation method we describe takes place in the Heisenberg picture and does
not make use of the finitely correlated state/matrix product state formalism.
