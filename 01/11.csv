isothermal, magnetically-confined coronae. These coronae extend outwards until
either the pressure of the hot coronal gas overcomes the magnetic field, or, if
the corona interacts with a disk before this happens, by the action of the disk
itself. This work is motivated by the results of the Chandra Orion Ultradeep
Project (COUP) that show an increase in the X-ray emission measure with
increasing stellar mass. We find that this variation (and its large scatter)
result naturally from the variation in the sizes of the stellar coronae. The
reduction in the magnitude of the X-ray emission due to the presence of a disk
stripping the outer parts of the stellar corona is most pronounced for the
lower mass stars. The higher mass stars with their greater surface gravities
have coronae than typically do not extend out as far as the inner edge of the
disk and so are less affected by it. For these stars, accretion takes place
along open field lines that connect to the disk. By extrapolating surface
magnetograms of young main sequence stars we have examined the effect on the
X-ray emission of a realistic degree of field complexity. We find densities
consistent with estimates from modelling of individual flares. A simple dipole
field in contrast gives densities typically an order of magnitude less. We
suggest that T Tauri stars have coronal fields that are slightly more extended
than their main sequence counterparts, but not as extended as a purely dipolar
fields.

Friedmann equation receives a correction of the form
$H^{\alpha}/r_c^{2-\alpha}$, which realize an accelerated expansion without
dark energy. In order to address structure formation in these model, we
construct simple covariant gravitational equations which give the modified
Friedmann equation with $\alpha=2/n$ where $n$ is an integer. For $n=2$, the
underlying theory is known as a 5D braneworld model (the DGP model). Thus the
models interpolate between the DGP model ($n=2, \alpha=1$) and the LCDM model
in general relativity ($n \to \infty, \alpha \to 0$). Using the covariant
equations, cosmological perturbations are analyzed. It is shown that in order
to satisfy the Bianchi identity at a perturbative level, we need to introduce a
correction term $E_{\mu \nu}$ in the effective equations. In the DGP model,
$E_{\mu \nu}$ comes from 5D gravitational fields and correct conditions on
$E_{\mu \nu}$ can be derived by solving the 5D perturbations. In the general
case $n>2$, we have to assume the structure of a modified theory of gravity to
determine $E_{\mu \nu}$. We show that structure formation is different from a
dark energy model in general relativity with identical expansion history and
that quantitative features of the difference crucially depend on the conditions
on $E_{\mu \nu}$, that is, the structure of the underlying theory of modified
gravity. This implies that it is essential to identify underlying theories in
order to test these phenomenological models against observational data and,
once we identify a consistent theory, structure formation tests become
essential to distinguish modified gravity models from dark energy models in
general relativity.

surface density and temperature profiles onto an embedded protoplanetary embryo
is generally a negative quantity that leads to the embryo inwards migration.
Here we investigate how the tidal torque balance is affected at a disk surface
density radial jump. The jump has two consequences :
  - it affects the differential Lindblad torque. In particular if the disk is
merely empty on the inner side, the differential Lindblad torque almost amounts
to the large negative outer Lindblad torque.
  - It affects the corotation torque, which is a quantity very sensitive to the
local gradient of the disk surface density. In particular if the disk is
depleted on the inside and if the jump occurs radially over a few pressure
scale-heights, the corotation torque is a positive quantity that is much larger
than in a power-law disk.
  We show by means of customized numerical simulations of low mass planets
embedded in protoplanetary nebulae with a surface density jump that the second
effect is dominant, that is that the corotation torque largely dominates the
differential Lindblad torque on the edge of a central depletion. As a
consequence the type I migration of low mass objects reaching the jump should
be halted, and all these objects should be trapped there.

afterglows, there must be inverse Compton (IC) emission arising from such flare
photons scattered by forward shock afterglow electrons. We find that this IC
emission produces GeV-TeV flares, which may be detected by GLAST and
ground-based TeV telescopes. We speculate that this kind of emission may
already have been detected by EGRET from a very strong burst--GRB940217. The
enhanced cooling of the forward shock electrons by the X-ray flare photons may
suppress the synchrotron emission of the afterglows during the flare period.
The detection of GeV-TeV flares combined with low energy observations may help
to constrain the poorly known magnetic field in afterglow shocks. We also
consider the self-IC emission in the context of internal-shock and
external-shock models for X-ray flares. The emission above GeV from internal
shocks is low, while the external shock model can also produce GeV-TeV flares,
but with a different temporal behavior from that caused by IC scattering of
flare photons by afterglow electrons. This suggests a useful approach for
distinguishing whether X-ray flares originate from late central engine activity

reaction network is solved at outer radii (r \ge 50 AU). Vertical distributions
of some molecular species at different radii are similar, when plotted as a
function of hydrogen column density Sigma_H from the disk surface.
Consequently, molecular column densities do not much depend on disk radius. In
the models with larger a_max, the lower temperature in the surface layer makes
the geometrical thickness of the disk smaller, and the gaseous molecules are
confined to smaller heights. However, if we plot the vertical distributions of
molecules as a function of Sigma_H, they do not significantly depend on a_max.
The dependence of the molecular column densities on a_max is not significant,
either. Notable exceptions are HCO+, H3+ and H2D+, which have smaller column
densities in the models with larger a_max.

sheets: a vertical one below and a transverse one above the flux rope. The flux
rope erupts when reconnection takes place in the current sheets, and the flux
rope dynamics depends on the reconnection sequence in the two current sheets.
Three cases are discussed: reconnection occurs (1) simultaneously in the two

(3) in an order opposite to case 2. Such a two-current-sheet reconnection

The main difference with the usual Earth-based laboratories is that we cannot
control the experiments. Instead, we have no choice but to create virtual
laboratories on Earth, in order to simulate all the relevant physics in
large-scale computational experiments. This implies a realistic treatment of
stellar dynamics, stellar evolution, and stellar hydrodynamics.
  Each of these three fields has its own legacy codes, workhorses that are
routinely used to simulate star clusters, stars, and stellar collisions,
respectively. I outline the main steps that need to be taken in order to embed
and where needed transform these legacy codes in order to produce a far more
modular and robust environment for modeling dense stellar systems.
  The time is right to do so: within a few years computers will reach the
required speed, in the Petaflops range, to follow a star cluster with a million
stars for ten billion years, while resolving the internal binary and multiple
star motions. By that time simulation software will be the main bottleneck in
our ability to analyze dense stellar systems. Only through full-scale

curves as well as medium and high-resolution X-ray spectra to determine the
plasma properties of the sample CTTS and to study the origin of their X-ray
emission and its variability. The emission measure distributions and observed
temperatures differ significantly and the targets are dominated either by
plasma at high densities as produced by accretion shocks or by predominantly
hotter plasma of coronal origin. Likewise the variability of the X-ray
luminosity is found to be generated by both mechanisms. Cool plasma at high
densities is found in all stars with detected \ion{O}{vii} triplet emission,
prevented only for SU~Aur due to strong absorption. A general trend is present
in the abundance pattern, with neon being at solar value or enhanced while
oxygen, iron and most other metals are depleted, pointing to the presence of
the inverse FIP effect in active coronae and possibly grain formation in
evolved disks. We find that both accretion shocks and coronal activity
contribute to the observed X-ray emission of the targets. While coronal
activity is the dominant source of X-ray activity in the majority of the CTTS,

They are built in order to get detection at both wavelengths for most of the

estimators for individual galaxies based on the NUV fluxes corrected for dust
attenuation and on the total IR luminosity. A combined estimator based on NUV
and IR luminosities seems to be the best proxy over the whole range of values
of SFR. Although both samples present similar average values of the birthrate
parameter b, their star-formation-related properties are substantially
different: NUV-selected galaxies tend to show larger values of $b$ for lower
masses, SFRs and dust attenuations, supporting previous scenarios for the star
formation history (SFH). Conversely, about 20% of the FIR-selected galaxies
show high values of $b$, SFR and NUV attenuation. These galaxies, most of them
being LIRGs and ULIRGs, break down the downsizing picture for the SFH, however
their relative contribution per unit volume is small in the local Universe.
Finally, the cosmic SFR density of the local Universe is estimated in a
consistent way from the NUV and IR luminosities.

low galactic latitude gamma-ray sources and microquasars, we have applied a
leptonic jet model based on the microquasar scenario that reproduces the
gamma-ray spectrum of three unidentified gamma-ray sources, 3EG J1735-1500, 3EG

as in other objects of this type that present harder gamma-ray spectra.
Moreover, the dominant mechanism of high-energy emission should be synchrotron
self-Compton (SSC) scattering, and the radio jets may only be observed at low
frequencies. For each particular case, further predictions of jet physical
conditions and variability generation mechanisms have been made in the context
of the model. Although there might be other candidates able to explain the

crosses the Be star disc twice per orbit, just prior to and just after

binary system is thought to be due to the collision of pulsar wind with the
wind of Be star. We present here the results of new XMM-Newton observations of
the PSR B1259-63 system during the beginning of 2004 as the pulsar approached
the disc of Be star.We combine these results with earlier unpublished X-ray
data from BeppoSAX and XMM-Newton as well as with ASCA data. The detailed X-ray
lightcurve of the system shows that the pulsar passes (twice per orbit) through
a well-defined gaussian-profile disk with the half-opening angle (projected on
the pulsar orbit plane) ~18.5 deg. The intersection of the disk middle plane
with the pulsar orbital plane is inclined at ~70 deg to the major axis of the
pulsar orbit. Comparing the X-ray lightcurve to the TeV lightcurve of the
system we find that the increase of the TeV flux some 10--100 days after the
periastron passage is unambiguously related to the disk passage. At the moment
of entrance to the disk the X-ray photon index hardens from 1.8 up to 1.2
before returning to the steeper value 1.5. Such behaviour is not easily
accounted for by the model in which the X-ray emission is synchrotron emission
from the shocked pulsar wind. We argue that the observed hardening of the X-ray
spectrum is due to the inverse Compton or bremsstrahlung emission from 10-100
MeV electrons responsible for the radio synchrotron emission.

modulation index, along with their frequency dependence, are discrepant with
the values expected from a Kolmogorov spectrum with infinitismally small inner

circumstellar disk to date. Nonetheless, a long-standing puzzle has been around
since the detection of metallic gas in the disk: radiation pressure from the
star should blow the gas away, yet the observed motion is consistent with
Keplerian rotation. In this work we search for braking mechanisms that can
resolve this discrepancy. We find that all species affected by radiation force
are heavily ionized and dynamically coupled into a single fluid by Coulomb
collisions, reducing the radiation force on species feeling the strongest
acceleration. For a gas of solar composition, the resulting total radiation
force still exceeds gravity, while a gas of enhanced carbon abundance could be
self-braking. We also explore two other braking agents: collisions with dust
grains and neutral gas. Grains surrounding beta Pic are photoelectrically
charged to a positive electrostatic potential. If a significant fraction of the
grains are carbonaceous (10% in the midplane and larger at higher altitudes),
ions can be slowed down to satisfy the observed velocity constraints. For
neutral gas to brake the coupled ion fluid, we find the minimum required mass
to be $\approx$ 0.03 $M_\earth$, consistent with observed upper limits of the
hydrogen column density, and substantially reduced relative to previous
estimates. Our results favor a scenario in which metallic gas is generated by
grain evaporation in the disk, perhaps during grain-grain collisions. We
exclude a primordial origin for the gas, but cannot rule out the possibility of
its production by falling evaporating bodies near the star. We discuss the
implications of this work for observations of gas in other debris disks.

the double stranded DNA unzips an at critical force Fc and the number of

unzipping from an extended coil state in which the number of unzipped monomers
M goes as M~(Fc-F)^{-chi}, where the exponent chi is either 1 or 2 depending on
whether the double stranded DNA sequence is homogeneous or heterogeneous

a double stranded DNA with a very large number N of base pairs, the force
remains almost constant as a function of the extension, before the unraveling
transition, at which the force drops abruptly to zero. Right at the unraveling
transition, the number of base pairs remaining in the condensed globule state
is still very large and goes as N^{3/4}, in agreement with theoretical
predictions of the unraveling transition of polymers stretched by an external

polarisation of the external medium by the charge distribution inside the
cavity is accounted for by appropriate image charges. We focus on the influence
of the external permittivity $\epsilon'$ on the static and dynamic properties
of the confined fluid. The density profile and local orientational order
parameter of the dipoles turn out to be remarkably insensitive to $\epsilon'$.
Permittivity profiles $\epsilon(r)$ inside the spherical cavity are calculated
from a generalised Kirkwood formula. These profiles oscillate in phase with the
density profiles and go to a ``bulk'' value $\epsilon_b$ away from the
confining surface; $\epsilon_b$ is only weakly dependent on $\epsilon'$, except
for $\epsilon' = 1$ (vacuum), and is strongly reduced compared to the
permittivity of a uniform (bulk) fluid under comparable thermodynamic
conditions.
  The dynamic relaxation of the total dipole moment of the sample is found to
be strongly dependent on $\epsilon'$, and to exhibit oscillatory behaviour when
$\epsilon'=1$; the relaxation is an order of magnitude faster than in the bulk.
The complex frequency-dependent permittivity $\epsilon(\omega)$ is sensitive to
$\epsilon'$ at low frequencies, and the zero frequency limit
$\epsilon(\omega=0)$ is systematically lower than the ``bulk'' value
$\epsilon_b$ of the static primitivity.

probably raised one of the most impassioned debates in the history of science.
The so-called reversibility paradox around which intense polemics occurred
reveals the apparent incompatibility between the microscopic and macroscopic
levels. While classical mechanics describes the motion of bodies such as atoms
and molecules by means of time reversible equations, thermodynamics emphasizes
the irreversible character of macroscopic phenomena such as viscosity. Aiming
at reconciling both levels of description, Boltzmann proposed a probabilistic
explanation. Nevertheless, such an interpretation has not totally convinced
generations of physicists, so that this question has constantly animated the
scientific community since his seminal work. In this context, an important
breakthrough in dynamical systems theory has shown that the hypothesis of
microscopic chaos played a key role and provided a dynamical interpretation of
the emergence of irreversibility. Using viscosity as a leading concept, we
sketch the historical development of the concepts related to this fundamental
issue up to recent advances. Following the analysis of the Liouville equation
introducing the concept of Pollicott-Ruelle resonances, two successful
approaches --- the escape-rate formalism and the hydrodynamic-mode method ---
establish remarkable relationships between transport processes and chaotic
properties of the underlying Hamiltonian dynamics.

proper phase transition; or one may say, there is a phase transition at {\em
zero percolation probability}. Nevertheless, a finite size percolation
threshold $q_c(N)$, where $N$ is the network size, can be defined. For such
heavy-tailed networks, one can choose a percolation probability $q(N)=\rho
q_c(N)$ such that $\displaystyle \lim_{N\to \infty}(q-q_c(N)) =0$, and yet
$\rho$ is arbitrarily large (such a scenario does not exist for networks with
non-zero percolation threshold). We find that the critical behavior of random
power-law networks is best described in terms of $\rho$ as the order parameter,
rather than $q$. This paper makes the notion of the phase transition of the
size of the largest connected component at $\rho=1$ precise. In particular,
using a generating function based approach, we show that for $\rho>1$, and the
power-law exponent, $2\leq \tau<3$, the largest connected component scales as
$\sim N^{1-1/\tau}$, while for $0<\rho<1$ the scaling is at most $\sim
N^{\frac{2-\tau}{\tau}}$; here, the maximum degree of any node, $k_{max}$, has
been assumed to scale as N^{1/\tau}$. In general, our approach yields that for
large $N$, $\rho \gg 1$, $2\leq \tau<3$, and $k_{max} \sim N^{1/\tau}$, the
largest connected component scales as $\sim
\rho^{1/(3-\tau)}N^{1-1/\tau}$.Thus, for any fixed but large N, we recover, and
make it precise, a recent result that computed a scaling behavior of
$q^{1/(3-\tau)}$ for ""small $q$"". We also provide large-scale simulation
results validating some of these scaling predictions, and discuss applications
of these scaling results to supporting efficient unstructured queries in

shaped magnetic of optical field. We focus on the configuration with the
nonlinear coefficient different from zero in a circle or annulus, including the
case of a narrow ring. Two-dimensional axisymmetric solitons are found in a
numerical form, and also by means of a variational approximation; for an
infinitely narrow ring, the soliton is found in an exact form (in the latter
case, exact solitons are also found in a two-component model). A stability
region for the solitons is identified by means of numerical and analytical
methods. In particular, if the nonlinearity is supported on the annulus, the
upper stability border is determined by azimuthal perturbations; the stability
region disappears if the ratio of the inner and outer radii of the annulus
exceeds a critical value 0.47. The model gives rise to bistability, as the
stationary solitons coexist with stable axisymmetric breathers, whose stability
region extends to higher values of the norm than that of the static solitons.

analytical expression is obtained for the relaxation of the donor population

This transition occurs at the conformational mean residence time intervals

partially break the classical symmetries of general relativity, and the

the AdS/CFT correspondence, N=4 SYM theory at vanishing coupling constant
should be dual to a theory in AdS which exhibits higher spin gauge symmetry
enhancement. When the SYM coupling is non-zero, all but a handful of HS
currents are violated by anomalies, and correspondingly local higher spin
symmetry in the bulk gets spontaneously broken. In agreement with previous
results and holographic expectations, we find that, barring one notable
exception (spin 1 eating spin 0), the Goldstone modes responsible for HS
symmetry breaking in AdS have non-vanishing mass even in the limit in which the
gauge symmetry is restored. We show that spontaneous breaking a' la

a pole (Laurent solution), depending on the maximal number of free parameters,

the Hoyle state, which our 3 alpha condensate wave function reproduces very
well like previous 3 alpha RGM/GCM models. The analysis is made by varying the
size of the Hoyle state artificially. As a result, we find that only the
maximum value of the form factor sensitively depends on its size, while the
positions of maximum and minimum are almost unchanged. This size dependence is
found to come from a characteristic feature of the transition density from the
ground state to the Hoyle state. We further show the theoretical predictions of
the inelastic form factor to the second 2+ state of 12C, which was recently
observed above the Hoyle state, and of the inelastic form factor to the
calculated third 0+ state of 16O, which was conjectured to correspond to the 4
alpha condensed state in previous theoretical work by the present authors.

within a three state non-Markovian modeling of the ion channel conformational

additional closed state for the ion channel which mimics the manifold of
voltage-independent closed subconformations (inactivated ``state''). The
conformational transition into the open state occurs through a domain of
voltage-dependent closed subconformations (closed ``state''). At distinct
variance with a standard two-state or also three-state Markovian approach, the
inactivated state is characterized by a broad, non-exponential probability
distribution of corresponding residence times. The linear response to a
periodic voltage signal is determined for arbitrary distributions of the
channel's recovery times. Analytical results are obtained for the spectral
amplification of the applied signal and the corresponding signal-to-noise

the gating dynamics is caused by the thermally activated transitions in a

degenerate and embraces the whole manifold of closed substates. Opening of the
ion channel is energetically prohibited from most of the closed substates and
requires a special conformation where the voltage sensor can move along an
activation pathway and trigger the transition into the open conformation. When
the corresponding activation barrier towards the channel's opening is removed
by the applied voltage, the statistics of non-conducting time intervals become
strongly influenced by the conformational diffusion. For the corresponding
supra-threshold voltages, our model explains the origin of the power law
distribution of the closed time intervals. The exponential-linear dependence of
the opening rate on voltage, often used as an experimental fit, is also

of poisoned excitable membrane patches is studied by use of a stochastic
generalization of the Hodgkin-Huxley model. Internal noise stemming from the
stochastic dynamics of individual ion channels is known to affect the
collective properties of the whole ion channel cluster. For example, there
exists an optimal size of the membrane patch for which the internal noise alone
causes a regular spontaneous generation of action potentials. In addition to
varying the size of ion channel clusters, living organisms may adapt the
densities of ion channels in order to optimally regulate the spontaneous
spiking activity. The influence of channel block on the excitability of a
membrane patch of certain size is twofold: First, a variation of ion channel
densities primarily yields a change of the conductance level. Second, a
down-regulation of working ion channels always increases the channel noise.
While the former effect dominates in the case of sodium channel block resulting
in a reduced spiking activity, the latter enhances the generation of
spontaneous action potentials in the case of a tailored potassium channel
blocking. Moreover, by blocking some portion of either potassium or sodium ion
channels, it is possible to either increase or to decrease the regularity of
the spike train.

quantum measurement problem (QMP), essentially concerned with the apparent
non-unitarity of the measurement process and the classicality of macroscopic
systems. In an information theoretic approach proposed by us earlier (Quantum
Information Processing 2, 153, 2003), which we clarify and elaborate here, QMP
is understood to signal a fundamental finite resolution of quantum states, or,
equivalently, a discreteness of Hilbert space. This was motivated by the notion
that physical reality is a manifestation of information stored and discrete
computations performed at a deeper, sub-physical layer. This model entails that
states of sufficiently complex, entangled systems will be unresolvable, or,
{\em computationally unstable}. Wavefunction collapse is postulated as an error
preventive response to such computational instability. In effect, sufficiently
complex systems turn classical because of the finiteness of the computational
resources available to the physical universe. We show that this model forms a
reasonable complement to decoherence for resolving QMP, both in respect of the
problem of definite outcomes and of the preferred basis problem. The model
suggests that QMP, as a window on the sub-physical universe, serves as a
witness to Wheeler's koan ``it from bit''. Some implications for quantum

black hole physics would disappear. However, the linearity of quantum mechanics
forbids exact cloning of quantum states. Here we show that black holes indeed
clone incoming quantum states with a fidelity that depends on the black hole's
absorption coefficient, without violating the no-cloning theorem because the
clones are only approximate. Perfectly reflecting black holes are optimal
universal ""quantum cloning machines"" and operate on the principle of stimulated
emission, exactly as their quantum optical counterparts. In the limit of
perfect absorption, the fidelity of clones is equal to what can be obtained via
quantum state estimation methods. But for any absorption probability less than
one, the cloning fidelity is nearly optimal as long as $\omega/T\geq10$, a
common parameter for modest-sized black holes.

threshold for optical cluster-state quantum computation. Our noise model allows
both photon loss and depolarizing noise, as a general proxy for all types of
local noise other than photon loss noise. We obtain a threshold region of
allowed pairs of values for the two types of noise. Roughly speaking, our
results show that scalable optical quantum computing is possible for photon
loss probabilities less than 0.003, and for depolarization probabilities less
than 0.0001. Our fault-tolerant protocol involves a number of innovations,
including a method for syndrome extraction known as telecorrection, whereby
repeated syndrome measurements are guaranteed to agree. This paper is an
extended version of [Dawson et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 020501].

parametric down-conversion (PDC) source at telecom wavelengths meeting the

spectral and spatial modes (single-mode fibers). We propose a protocol to
optimize the photon collection, noise levels and the uncertainty evaluation.
This study ties together the results of our efforts to model the single-mode
heralding efficiency of a two-photon PDC source and to estimate the heralding
uncertainty of such a source.

feasibility of time-coding protocols for quantum key distribution. Alice
produces coherent 20 ns faint pulses of light at 853 nm. They are sent to Bob
with delay 0 ns (encoding bit 0) or 10 ns (encoding bit 1). Bob directs at
random the received pulses to two different arms. In the first one, a 300 ps
resolution Si photon-counter allows Bob to precisely measure the detection
times of each photon in order to establish the key. Comparing them with the
emission times of the pulses sent by Alice allows to evaluate the quantum bit
error rate (QBER). The minimum obtained QBER is 1.62 %. The possible loss of
coherence in the set-up can be exploited by Eve to eavesdrop the line.
Therefore, the second arm of Bob set-up is a Mach-Zender interferometer with a
10 ns propagation delay between the two path. Contrast measurement of the
output beams allows to measure the autocorrelation function of the received
pulses that characterizes their average coherence. In the case of an ideal
set-up, the value expected with the pulses sent by Alice is 0.576. The
experimental value of the pulses autocorrelation function is found to be 0.541.
Knowing the resulting loss of coherence and the measured QBER, one can evaluate
the mutual information between Alice and Eve and the mutual information between
Alice and Bob, in the case of intercept-resend attacks and in the case of
attacks with intrication. With our values, Bob has an advantage on Eve of 0.43
bit per pulse. The maximum possible QBER corresponding to equal informations
for Bob and Eve is 5.8 %. With the usual attenuation of fibres at 850 nm, it
shows that secure key distribution is possible up to a distance of 2.75 km,
which is sufficient for local links.

the barrier is unaffected by it. B) When the barrier is absorptive (i.e., its
potential is imaginary) it affects the transmitted wave function at shorter
times than a real potential barrier. Therefore, it is possible to distinguish
between an imaginary and a real potential barrier by measuring its effect at
short times only on the transmitting wavefunction.

We have extended the previous work of Englert, Schwinger and Scully \cite{ISG1}
including the fluctuations of the magnetic field generated by a properly chosen
magnet. As a result we obtained an attenuation factor to the possible revival
of coherence when the beams are perfectly recombined . When the source of the
magnetic field is a SQUID(superconducting quantum interference device) the
attenuation factor can be controlled by external circuits and the spin
decoherence directly measured. For the proposed SQUID with dimensions in the
scale of microns the attenuation factor has been shown unimportant when
compared with the interaction time of the spin with the magnet.
