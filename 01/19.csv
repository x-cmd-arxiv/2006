observations of this cluster. The X-ray data give us the opportunity to reveal
the complexity of the cluster, especially its temperature distribution. The
integrated spectrum is well fitted by a single temperature thermal model,
indicating a mean temperature of ~7 keV. However, the cluster is not isothermal
at this temperature: its eastern regions are significantly cooler, at ~5.5 keV,
whilst towards the West the temperature reaches ~8.5 keV.
  These temperature asymmetries can be explained if Abell 2255 has been
assembled recently by the merging of smaller subunits. It is now in the phase
after the cores of these subunits have collided (the `core-crossing' phase)
some 0.1-0.2 Gyr ago. A comparison with numerical simulations suggests that it
will settle down into a single relaxed cluster in ~(2-3) Gyr.

other words, the ""bulges"" of these galaxies have disk-like properties. We
conclude that these are examples of ""pseudobulges"" -- that is, products of
secular dynamical evolution. Nonaxisymmetries such as bars and oval disks
transport disk gas toward the center. There, star formation builds dense
stellar components that look like -- and often are mistaken for -- merger-built
bulges but that were constructed slowly out of disk material. These
pseudobulges can most easily be recognized when, as in the present galaxies,
they retain disk-like properties. NGC 7690 and NGC 4593 therefore contribute to
the growing evidence that secular processes help to shape galaxies.
  NGC 4593 contains a nuclear ring of dust that is morphologically similar to
nuclear rings of star formation that are seen in many barred and oval galaxies.
The nuclear dust ring is connected to nearly radial dust lanes in the galaxy's
bar. Such dust lanes are a signature of gas inflow. We suggest that gas is
currently accumulating in the dust ring and hypothesize that the gas ring will
starburst in the future. The observations of NGC 4593 therefore suggest that
major starburst events that contribute to pseudobulge growth can be episodic.

derived from these observations we obtain evidence that bulges could be formed
by pure disk evolution (secular evolution), in agreement with the suggestion by
some authors. The color profiles, especially the near-IR ones show null or
almost null color gradients, supporting the hypothesis that the disk stellar
populations are similar to those present in the bulge, and/or some bulges can
be understood as disks with enhanced stellar density (or pseudobulges). In the
optical, half of the galaxies present an inverse color gradient, giving
additional evidence in favor of secular evolution for the sample investigated.
The comparison of the observed colors with those obtained from

black hole astrophysics over the past few decades. In Chapter 2 we present a
detailed description of the ray-tracing code, which is used to calculate the
transfer function between the accretion disk and the detector. In Chapter 3, we
employ a simple ``hot spot'' model to explain the frequencies and amplitudes of
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). In Chapter 4, we introduce additional
features to the hot spot model to explain the broadening of the QPO peaks as
well as the damping of higher-frequency harmonics in the power spectrum. In
Chapter 5 we present a description of the structure of a relativistic
alpha-disk around a Kerr black hole, and the observed spectrum from such a
disk. The features of this modified thermal spectrum may be used to infer the
physical properties of the accretion disk and the central black hole. In
Chapter 6 we develop a Monte Carlo code to calculate the detailed propagation
of photons from a hot spot emitter scattering through a corona surrounding the
black hole. The coronal scattering has two major observable effects: the
inverse-Compton process alters the photon spectrum by adding a high energy
power-law tail, and the random scattering of each photon effectively damps out

We provide a novel test of this prediction using a sample of galaxies drawn
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. To perform the test, we compare measurements
of galaxy clustering in dense and underdense regions. We find that galaxies in
dense regions cluster significantly more strongly than those in less dense
regions. This is true over the entire 0.1--30 Mpc pair separation range for
which we can make accurate measurements. We make similar measurements in
realistic mock catalogs in which the only environmental effects are those which
arise from the predicted correlation between halo mass and environment. We also
provide an analytic halo-model based calculation of the effect. Both the mock
catalogs and the analytic calculation provide rather good descriptions of the
SDSS measurements. Thus, our results provide strong support for hierarchical
models. They suggest that, unless care is taken to study galaxies at fixed
mass, correlations between galaxy properties and the surrounding environment
are almost entirely due to more fundamental correlations between galaxy
properties and host halo mass, and between halo mass and environment.

bodies. It is an especially sensitive diagnostic tool to reveal physical
properties of the bodies whose observational characteristics are governed by
small scatterers (dust, regolith surfaces). For these objects, at small phase
angles, a negative polarization is observed, i.e., the electric vector E
oscillates predominantly in the scattering plane, contrary to what is typical
for rather smooth homogeneous surfaces. The behavior of negative polarization
with phase angle depends on the size, composition and packing of the
scatterers. These characteristics can be unveiled by modelling the light
scattering by the dust or regolith in terms of the coherent backscattering
mechanism.

  From a theoretical point of view, recent studies of the evolution of
metal-poor massive stars show that rotation-induced mixing can enrich the outer
H and He layers with C, N, and O (CNO) elements, particularly N, and at the
same time cause intense mass loss of these layers. Here we consider energetic
supernova explosions occurring after the progeniter star has lost all but a
small fraction of the He layer. The fastest portion of the supernova ejecta can
interact directly with the circumstellar matter (CSM), both composed of He and
CNO, and induce light element production through spallation and He-He fusion
reactions. The CSM should be sufficiently thick to energetic particles so that
the interactions terminate within its innermost regions. We calculate the
resulting Li6/O and Be9/O ratios in the ejecta+CSM material out of which the
very metal-poor stars may form. We find that they are consistent with the
observed values if the mass of the He layer remaining on the pre-explosion core
is 0.01-0.1 solar mass, and the mass fraction of N mixed in the He layer is
about 0.01. Further observations of Li6, Be and N at low metallicity should
provide critical tests of this production scenario.

obtain the stratification with depth of temperature, line-of-sight velocity,
and microturbulence across the penumbra. Our results suggest that the physical
mechanism(s) responsible for the penumbral filaments operate preferentially in
the lower photosphere. We confirm the existence of a thermal asymmetry between
the center and limb-side penumbra, the former being hotter by 100-150 K on
average. We also investigate the nature of the bright ring that appears in the
inner penumbra when sunspots are observed in the wing of spectral lines. The
line-of-sight velocities retrieved from the inversion are used to determine the
flow speed and flow angle at different heights in the photosphere. Both the
flow speed and flow angle increase with optical depth and radial distance.
Downflows are detected in the mid and outer penumbra, but only in deep layers

retrieved from the inversion are consistent with the idea of penumbral flux
tubes channeling the Evershed flow. Finally, we show that larger Evershed flows

contrast is well described by a log-normal distribution. For model parameters
in agreement with observations and for an experiment operating in the
Rayleigh-Jeans regime, the largest IGM contribution is expected at scales
corresponding to multipole numbers of about 2000. The amplitude is rather
uncertain and could be as large as 100-200 [mikroK]^2, comparable to the
contribution of galaxy clusters. The actual value is strongly dependent on the
gas polytropic index and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum sigma_8. At
all redshifts, the largest contribution comes from scales very close to the
comoving baryon Jeans length. This scale is not yet resolved in numerical
simulations that follow the evolution of gas on cosmological scales. The
anisotropy generated by the Intergalactic Medium could make compatible the
excess of power measured by Cosmic Background Imager (CBI) on scales of l >
2000 with sigma_8=0.9. Taking the CBI result as an upper limit, the polytropic
index can be constrained to < 1.5 at 2-sigma level at redshifts z ~ 0.1-0.4.
With its large frequency coverage, the PLANCK satellite will be able to measure
the secondary anisotropies coming from hot gas. Cluster and Intergalactic
Medium contributions could be separated by cross correlating galaxy/cluster
catalogs with CMB maps. This measurement will determine the state of the gas at

abundance ratios in $\omega$ Cen. It is still uncertain whether the abundance
peculiarities of $\omega$ Cen result from the fact that the high velocity

positive identifications of D at high redshifts--when the D/H ratio was close
to its primordial value--they give us the most reliable determination of the
baryon density, in excellent agreement with measures obtained from entirely
different probes, such as the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background
temperature and the average absorption of the UV light of quasars by the
intergalactic medium. In this review, I relate observations of D/H in distant
gas clouds to the large body of data on the local abundance of D obtained in
the last few years with the FUSE satellite. I also discuss some of the
outstanding problems in light element abundances and consider future prospects
for advances in this area.

protostellar collapse. In addition to allowing for the freeze out of `heavy'
species on to grains, we have computed the variation of population densities of
the different nuclear spin states of ``tracer'' molecular ions such as H2D+ and
D2H+. Processes which determine the relative populations of the nuclear spin
states of molecules and molecular ions have received much less attention in the
literature than those involved in their deuteration; but in fact the former
processes are as significant as the latter and often involve the same
reactants. We find that the ortho:para ratio of some species, e.g. H2D+, vary
considerably as the density increases. Because the dynamical timescale is much
shorter than some of the chemical timescales, there can be large departures of
the predictions of the free--fall model from the steady state solution at the
same density and temperature. In the case of H2, it seems unlikely that the
steady state value of the ortho:para ratio is attained before protostellar
collapse from the progenitor molecular cloud commences. Values of the
ortho:para H2 ratio much higher than in steady state, which would prevail in
``young'' molecular clouds, are found to be inconsistent with high levels of
deuteration of the gas. The internal energy of ortho--H2 acts as a reservoir of
chemical energy which inhibits the deuteration of H3+ and hence of other
species, such as N2H+ and NH3. In essence, the deuteration of molecular ions
and molecules is sensitive to the ortho:para H2 ratio and hence to the chemical
and thermal history of the parent molecular cloud.

calculate analytically the interior distance distribution function for

force derived from the distance distribution function we present a simple
expression for the kinetics of interior looping by adopting Kramers theory. For
the parameters, that are appropriate for DNA, the theoretical predictions in
comparison to the case are in excellent agreement with explicit Brownian
dynamics simulations of worm-like chain (WLC) model. The interior looping times
($\tau_{IC}$) can be greatly altered in cases when the stiffness of the loop
differs from that of the dangling ends. If the dangling end is stiffer than the
loop then $\tau_{IC}$ increases for the case of the WLC with uniform
persistence length. In contrast, attachment of flexible dangling ends enhances
rate of interior loop formation. The theory also shows that if the monomers are
charged and interact via screened Coulomb potential then both the cyclization
($\tau_c$) and interior looping ($\tau_{IC}$) times greatly increase at low
ionic concentration. Because both $\tau_c$ and $\tau_{IC}$ are determined
essentially by the effective persistence length ($l_p^{(R)}$) we computed
$l_p^{(R)}$ by varying the range of the repulsive interaction between the
monomers. For short range interactions $l_p^{(R)}$ nearly coincides with the
bare persistence length which is determined largely by the backbone chain
connectivity. This finding rationalizes the efficacy of describing a number of
experimental observations (response of biopolymers to force and cyclization
kinetics) in biomolecules using WLC model with an effective persistence length.

Schr\""odinger equation. While eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian FP operator are
complex in general, in a small tilting case the imaginary parts of the

with PBC. The decay rate is analyzed in the context of quantum tunneling
through a triple-well effective periodic potential. In a large tilting case,
the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of FP operator are crucial. We apply the
complex-valued WKB method to the Schr\""odinger equation with the absorbing

the temperature, the potential periodicity and the viscous constant. The
intermediate tilting case is also explored. The analytic results agree well

presence of superconducting leads. If the interface between the nanostructure
and the superconductors is sufficiently transparent, a dissipationless current
(supercurrent) can flow through the device due to the Josephson effect. A
Josephson coupling, as measured via the zero-resistance supercurrent, has been
obtained via tunnel barriers, superconducting constrictions, normal metals, and
semiconductors. The coupling mechanisms vary from tunneling to Andreev
reflection. The latter process has always occurred via a normal-type system
with a continuous density of states. Here we investigate a supercurrent flowing
via a discrete density of states, i.e., the quantized single particle energy
states of a quantum dot, or artificial atom, placed in between superconducting
electrodes. For this purpose, we exploit the quantum properties of finite-sized
carbon nanotubes (CNTs). By means of a gate electrode, successive discrete
energy states are tuned ON and OFF resonance with the Fermi energy in the
superconducting leads, resulting in a periodic modulation of the critical
current and a non-trivial correlation between the conductance in the normal
state and the supercurrent. We find, in good agreement with existing theory,
that the product of the critical current and the normal state resistance
becomes an oscillating function, in contrast to being constant as in previously
explored regimes.

equation we show that the spin magnetic moment induced in the superconductor is
an oscillating sign-changing function of the product $hd$ of the exchange field
$h$ and the thickness $d$ of the ferromagnet. Therefore the total spin magnetic
moment of the system in the superconducting state can be not only smaller
(screening) but also greater (anti-screening) than that in the normal state, in
contrast with the case of highly disordered (diffusive) systems, where only
screening is possible. This surprising effect is due to peculiar periodic
properties of localized Andreev states in the system. It is most pronounced in
systems with ideal ballistic transport (no bulk disorder in the samples, smooth
ideally transparent interface), however these ideal conditions are not crucial
for the very existence of the effect. We show that oscillations exist (although
suppressed) even for arbitrary low interface transparency and in the presence
of bulk disorder, provided that $h \tau \gg 1$ ($\tau$ -- mean free path). At
low interface transparency we solve the problem for arbitrary strength of
disorder and obtain oscillating magnetization in ballistic regime ($h \tau \gg
1$) and nonoscillating magnetization in diffusive one ($h \tau \ll 1$) as
limiting cases of one formula.

first-order phase transition in a two-dimensional Ising lattice gas with
attractive nearest-neighbor interactions is investigated by means of kinetic
Monte Carlo simulations. For example, electrochemical underpotential deposition
proceeds by this mechanism. One major difference from adsorption in vacuum
surface science is that under control of the electrode potential and in the
absence of mass-transport limitations, local adsorption equilibrium is
approximately established. We analyze our results using the theory of
Kolmogorov, Johnson and Mehl, and Avrami (KJMA), which we extend to an
exponentially decaying nucleation rate. Such a decay may occur due to a
suppression of nucleation around existing clusters in the presence of lateral
adsorbate diffusion. Correlation functions prove the existence of such
exclusion zones. By comparison with microscopic results for the nucleation rate
I and the interface velocity of the growing clusters v, we can show that the
KJMA theory yields the correct order of magnitude for Iv^2. This is true even
though the spatial correlations mediated by diffusion are neglected. The
decaying nucleation rate causes a gradual crossover from continuous to
instantaneous nucleation, which is complete when the decay of the nucleation
rate is very fast on the time scale of the phase transformation. Hence,
instantaneous nucleation can be homogeneous, producing negative minima in the
two-point correlation functions. We also present in this paper an n-fold way
Monte Carlo algorithm for a square lattice gas with adsorption/desorption and
lateral diffusion.

goal is to design n strings that satisfy a given set of constraints while
minimizing the length of the strings. For multiple sets of constraints, we
provide high-probability algorithms that run in time polynomial in n and any
given constraint parameters, and output strings of length within a constant
factor of the optimal. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to
consider this type of optimization problem in the context of DNA code design.

might be revealed in a measurement of the fractional differential acceleration
$\eta$ between two test bodies -of different composition, falling in the
gravitational field of a source mass- if the measurement is made to the level
of $\eta\simeq 10^{-13}$ or better. This being within the reach of ground based
experiments, gives them a new impetus. However, while slowly rotating torsion
balances in ground laboratories are close to reaching this level, only an
experiment performed in low orbit around the Earth is likely to provide a much
better accuracy.
  We report on the progress made with the ""Galileo Galilei on the Ground"" (GGG)
experiment, which aims to compete with torsion balances using an instrument
design also capable of being converted into a much higher sensitivity space
test.
  In the present and following paper (Part I and Part II), we demonstrate that
the dynamical response of the GGG differential accelerometer set into
supercritical rotation -in particular its normal modes (Part I) and rejection
of common mode effects (Part II)- can be predicted by means of a simple but
effective model that embodies all the relevant physics. Analytical solutions
are obtained under special limits, which provide the theoretical understanding.
A simulation environment is set up, obtaining quantitative agreement with the
available experimental data on the frequencies of the normal modes, and on the
whirling behavior. This is a needed and reliable tool for controlling and
separating perturbative effects from the expected signal, as well as for
planning the optimization of the apparatus.

priori} unknown polarization waveforms, requires the use of data from a network
of detectors. For determining how the data from such a network should be
combined, approaches based on the maximum likelihood principle have proven to
be useful. The most straightforward among these uses the global maximum of the
likelihood over the space of all waveforms as both the detection statistic and
signal estimator. However, in the case of burst signals, a physically
counterintuitive situation results: for two aligned detectors the statistic
includes the cross-correlation of the detector outputs, as expected, but this
term disappears even for an infinitesimal misalignment. This {\em two detector
paradox} arises from the inclusion of improbable waveforms in the solution
space of maximization. Such waveforms produce widely different responses in
detectors that are closely aligned. We show that by penalizing waveforms that
exhibit large signal-to-noise ratio (snr) variability, as the corresponding
source is moved on the sky, a physically motivated restriction is obtained that
(i) resolves the two detector paradox and (ii) leads to a better performing
statistic than the global maximum of the likelihood. Waveforms with high snr
variability turn out to be precisely the ones that are improbable in the sense
mentioned above. The coherent network analysis method thus obtained can be
applied to any network, irrespective of the number or the mutual alignment of
detectors.

(sound waves) in an Eulerian fluid obey a relativistic equation: the d'Alembert
equation. This analogy between propagation of sound and that of a massless
scalar field in a Lorentzian metric also applies to non-homogeneous flows. In
these cases, sound waves effectively propagate in a curved four-dimensional
''acoustic'' metric whose properties are determined by the flow. Using this
analogy, we consider regular flows which become supersonic, and show that the
acoustic metric behaves like that of a black hole. The analogy is so good that,
when considering quantum mechanics, acoustic black holes should produce a
thermal flux of Hawking phonons.
  We then focus on two interesting questions related to Hawking radiation which
are not fully understood in the context of gravitational black holes due to the
lack of a theory of quantum gravity. The first concerns the calculation of the
modifications of Hawking radiation which are induced by dispersive effects at
short distances, i.e., approaching the atomic scale when considering sound. We
generalize existing treatments and calculate the modifications caused by the
propagation near the black hole horizon. The second question concerns
backreaction effects. We return to the Eulerian action, compute second order
effects, and show that the backreaction of sound waves on the fluid's flow can
be expressed in terms of their stress-energy tensor. Using this result in the
context of Hawking radiation, we compute the secular effect on the background
flow.

important physical consequences, like the emergence of a new, diffusive,
scaling, which replaces the `geometric scaling' property characteristic of the
mean field approximation. To establish this, we shall rely on a dipole version
of the Good-Walker formula for diffraction (that we shall derive here in the
context of DIS), together with the high-energy estimates for the dipole
scattering amplitudes which follow from the recently established evolution
equations with Pomeron loops and include the relevant fluctuations. We also
find that, as a consequence of fluctuations, the diffractive cross-section at

dominates the total energy of the system at first. The temperature decreases as
the universe expands. Then the non-BPS D9-branes become unstable at low

$p_n$ and $q_n$ such that $Z_n,$ the $p_n\times q_n$ upper left block of a
random matrix $\boldsymbol{\Gamma}_n$ which is uniformly distributed on the
orthogonal group O(n), can be approximated by independent standard normals?
This problem is solved by two different approximation methods. First, we show
that the variation distance between the joint distribution of entries of $Z_n$
and that of $p_nq_n$ independent standard normals goes to zero provided
$p_n=o(\sqrt{n})$ and $q_n=o(\sqrt{n})$. We also show that the above variation
distance does not go to zero if $p_n=[x\sqrt{n} ]$ and $q_n=[y\sqrt{n} ]$ for
any positive numbers $x$ and $y$. This says that the largest orders of $p_n$
and $q_n$ are $o(n^{1/2})$ in the sense of the above approximation. Second,
suppose $\boldsymbol{\Gamma}_n=(\gamma_{ij})_{n\times n}$ is generated by
performing the Gram--Schmidt algorithm on the columns of
$\bold{Y}_n=(y_{ij})_{n\times n}$, where $\{y_{ij};1\leq i,j\leq n\}$ are
i.i.d. standard normals. We show that $\epsilon_n(m):=\max_{1\leq i\leq n,1\leq
j\leq m}|\sqrt{n}\cdot\gamma_{ij}-y_{ij}|$ goes to zero in probability as long
as $m=m_n=o(n/\log n)$. We also prove that $\epsilon_n(m_n)\to 2\sqrt{\alpha}$
in probability when $m_n=[n\alpha/\log n]$ for any $\alpha>0.$ This says that
$m_n=o(n/\log n)$ is the largest order such that the entries of the first $m_n$
columns of $\boldsymbol{\Gamma}_n$ can be approximated simultaneously by
independent standard normals.

the convenience of the concrete models they provide. Finding a bijective proof
of a seemingly obscure identity can reveal unsuspected significance to it.
Finding a combinatorial model for some mathematical entity is a particular
instance of the process called ``categorification''. Examples include the
interpretation of N as the Burnside rig of the category of finite sets with
product and coproduct, and the interpretation of N[x] as the category of
combinatorial species. This has interesting applications to quantum mechanics,
and in particular the quantum harmonic oscillator, via Joyal's ``species'', a
new generalization called ``stuff types'', and operators between these, which
can be represented as rudimentary Feynman diagrams for the oscillator. In
quantum mechanics, we want to represent states in an algebra over the complex
numbers, and also want our Feynman diagrams to carry more structure than these
``stuff operators'' can do, and these turn out to be closely related. We will
show how to construct a combinatorial model for the quantum harmonic oscillator
in which the group of phases, U(1), plays a special role. We describe a general
notion of ``M-Stuff Types'' for any monoid M, and see that the case M=U(1)
provides an interpretation of time evolution in the combinatorial setting, as
well as other quantum mechanical features of the harmonic oscillator.

probabilistic models to quantify propensities of residues for different spatial

H-bonds, side-chain interactions, and weak H-bonds. The propensity values and
p-values measuring statistical significance are calculated exactly by
analytical formulae we have developed. Contrary to the ``positive-inside'' rule
for helical membrane proteins, $\beta$-barrel membrane proteins follow a
significant albeit weaker ``positive-outside'' rule, in that the basic residues
Arg and Lys are disproportionately favored in the extracellular cap region and
disfavored in the periplasmic cap region. Different residue pairs prefer strong
backbone H-bonded interstrand pairings (e.g. Gly-Aromatic) or non-H-bonded
pairings (e.g. Aromatic-Aromatic). In addition, Tyr and Phe participate in
aromatic rescue by shielding Gly from polar environments. These propensities
can be used to predict the registration of strand pairs, an important task for
the structure prediction of $\beta$-barrel membrane proteins. Our accuracy of
44% is considerably better than random (7%) and other studies. Our results
imply several experiments that can help to elucidate the mechanisms of in vitro

post-selection. Unlike the case of only pre-selected ensembles, we show that in
this case the probabilities for measurement outcomes at intermediate times
satisfy causality only rarely; such ensembles can in general be used to signal
between causally disconnected regions. We show that under restrictive
conditions, there are certain non-trivial bi-partite ensembles which do satisfy
causality. These ensembles give rise to a violation of the CHSH inequality,
which exceeds the maximal quantum violation given by Tsirelson's bound, $B_{\rm
CHSH}\le 2\sqrt2$, and obtains the Popescu-Rohrlich bound for the maximal
violation, $B_{\rm CHSH}\le 4$. This may be regarded as an a posteriori
realization of super-correlations, which have recently been termed
Popescu-Rohrlich boxes.

possesses a hidden symmetry that is represented by the linear operator $\cC$.
This symmetry operator $\cC$ guarantees that the Hamiltonian acts on a Hilbert
space with an inner product that is both positive definite and conserved in
time, thereby ensuring that the Hamiltonian can be used to define a unitary
theory of quantum mechanics. In this paper it is shown how to construct the
operator $\cC$ for the $\cP\cT$-symmetric square well using perturbative
techniques.

We further prove that such a spin swapping operator is equal to the spin
singlet pairing operator under the partial transposition. For SU(2) invariant
states, it is shown that the expectation value of the spin swapping operator
and its generalizations, the permutations, can be used as an entanglement
witness, especially, for the formulation of observable conditions of
entanglement.

coherent states, which is the simplest example of quantum state comparison for
continuous variables. The method we present has a high success probability, and
is experimentally feasible to realize as the only required components are beam
splitters and photon detectors. An easily realizable method for quantum state
comparison could be important for real applications. As examples of such
applications we present a ""lock and key"" scheme and a simple scheme for quantum

on G/H in the case where G/H is a Riemannian symmetric space. These results are
mainly obtained by using methods from Lie theory and geometric control.
