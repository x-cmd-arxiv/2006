a non-linear resonance mechanism, operating in strong-gravity regime, is
responsible for these quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). By extending the
multiple-scales analysis of Rebusco, we construct two-dimensional phase-space
sections, which enable us to identify different topologies governing the system
and to follow evolutionary tracks of the twin peaks. This suggests that the
original (Abramowicz and Kluzniak) parametric-resonance scheme can be viewed as
an ingenuous account of the QPOs model with an internal resonance. We show an
example of internal resonance in a system with up to two critical points, and
we describe a general technique that permits to treat other cases in a
systematical manner. A separatrix divides the phase-space sections into regions
of different topology: inside the libration region the evolutionary tracks
bring the observed twin-peak frequencies to an exact rational ratio, whereas in
the circulation region the observed frequencies remain off resonance. Our
scheme predicts the power should cyclically be exchanged between the two
oscillations. Likewise the high-frequency QPOs in neutron-star binaries, also
in black-hole sources one expects, as a general property of the non-linear

energy carried by a relativistic outflow is dissipated and converted into
radiation. The efficiency of this process, $\epsilon_\gamma$, is one of the
critical factors in any GRB model. The X-ray afterglow light curves of Swift
GRBs show an early stage of flat decay. This has been interpreted as reflecting
energy injection. When combined with previous estimates, which have concluded
that the kinetic energy of the late ($\gtrsim 10$ hr) afterglow is comparable
to the energy emitted in gamma-rays, this interpretation implies very high
values of $\epsilon_\gamma \gtrsim 0.9$. Such a high efficiency is hard to
reconcile with most models, including in particular the popular internal-shocks
model. We re-analyze the derivation of the kinetic energy from the afterglow
X-ray flux and re-examine the resulting estimates of the efficiency. We confirm
that, if the flatt decay arises from energy injection and the pre-Swift
broad-band estimates of the kinetic energy are correct, then $\epsilon_\gamma
\gtrsim 0.9$. We point out, however, that another interpretation of the
flattish decay - a variable X-ray afterglow efficiency (e.g., due to a time
dependence of afterglow shock microphysical parameters) - is possible. We also
show that direct estimates of the kinetic energy from the late X-ray afterglow
flux are sensitive to the assumed values of the shock microphysical parameters
and suggest that broad-band afterglow fits might have underestimated the
kinetic energy (e.g., by overestimating the fraction of electrons that are
accelerated to relativistic energies). Either one of these possibilities
implies a lower gamma-ray efficiency, and their joint effect could conceivably
reduce the estimate of the typical $\epsilon_\gamma$ to $\sim 0.1-0.5$.

FeII gas that have not yet been detected in intervening quasar absorption line
systems. Our results indicate that the gas with large MgI equivalent width
(e.g. GRB 051111) must occur at distances >~50pc from GRB afterglows to avoid
photoionization. We examine the mechanisms for fine-structure excitation and
find two processes can contribute: (1) indirect UV pumping by the GRB afterglow
provided a far-UV intensity in excess of 10^6 times the Galactic radiation
field; and (2) collisional excitation in gas with electron density n_e>10^4
cm^-3. The observed abundances of excited ions are well explained by UV pumping
with the gas at approximately a few hundred pc from the afterglow for GRB
051111 and r<100pc for GRB 050730, without invoking extreme gas density and
temperature in the ISM. We show that UV pumping alone provides a simple
explanation for all reported detections of excited ions in GRB afterglow
spectra. The presence of strong fine-structure transitions therefore may offer
little constraint for the gas density or temperature. We discuss additional
implications of UV pumping including its impact on chemical abundance
measurements, new prospects for observing line-strength variability, and future
prospects for studying the gas density and temperature. Finally, we list a
series of criteria that can distinguish between the mechanisms of UV pumping
and collisional excitation.

resolved feature at 5.6 microns identified as a blend of [Mg VII] and [Mg V].
There are no strong PAH emission features in the FSC 10214+4724 spectrum. We
place a limit of 0.1 micron on the equivalent width of 6.2 micron PAH emission
but see no evidence of a corresponding 7.7 micron feature. Semi-empirical fits
to the spectral energy distribution suggest about 45% of the bolometric
luminosity arises from cold 50 K dust, half arises from warm (190 K) dust, and
the remainder, 5%, originates from hot (640 K) dust. The hot dust is required

Based on the assumption that these objects are isolated neutron stars similar

slightly below the radio emission ""death line'', which become active
occasionally only when the conditions for pair production and coherent emission
are satisfied. The second interpretation invokes a radio emission direction
reversal in conventional pulsars, as has been introduced to interpret the

sight misses the main radio emission beam of the pulsar but happens to sweep
the emission beam when the radio emission direction is reversed. These

suggest that X-ray observations may provide clues to differentiate between
these two possibilities.

emission shows an elongated structure, like a killifish, with a central compact
source. The compact source is point-like, and named as XMMU J053559.3$-$673509.
The source spectrum is well reproduced with a power-law model with a photon
index of $\Gamma = 1.57$ (1.51--1.62) and the intrinsic luminosity is
$2.2\times 10^{35} \mathrm{ergs s^{-1}}$ in the 0.5--10.0 keV band, with the
assumed distance of 50 kpc. The source has neither significant coherent
pulsations in $2.0\times 10^{-3}$ Hz--8.0 Hz, nor time variabilities. Its
luminosity and spectrum suggest that the source might be a pulsar wind nebula
(PWN) in DEM L241. The spectral feature classifies this source into rather
bright and hard PWN, which is similar to those in Kes 75 and B0540$-$693. The
elongated diffuse structure can be divided into a ``Head'' and ``Tail'', and
both have soft and line-rich spectra. Their spectra are well reproduced by a
plane-parallel shock plasma ({\it vpshock}) model with a temperature of
0.3--0.4 keV and over-abundance in O and Ne and a relative under-abundance in
Fe. Such an abundance pattern and the morphology imply that the emission is
from the ejecta of the SNR, and that the progenitor of DEM L241 is a very
massive star, more than 20 M\sun. This result is also supported by the
existence of the central point source and an OB star association, LH 88. The

expected for time-evolution of the merger. The data reveal for the first time
extended dust emission in the ULIRG galaxy bodies and along their tidal

the fine-structure elliptical galaxies lack such structured emission. This
likely results from the optical selection of the elliptical sample, resulting

In this paper, we present the results of varying two other important free

the case of a temporally random driving force. Our results demonstrate that a
very important consideration for the actual level of turbulent support against
gravity is the ratio of driving wavelength lambda_0 to the the size of the
initial non-turbulent cloud; maximum cloud expansion is achieved when this
ratio is close to unity. The best consistency with the observational
correlation of magnetic field strength, turbulent line width, and density is
achieved by cloud models with beta_0 approx 1. We also calculate the spatial
power spectra of the turbulent clouds, and show that significant power is
developed on scales larger than the scale length H_0 of the initial cloud, even
if the input wavelength of turbulence lambda_0 approx H_0. The cloud
stratification and resulting increase of Alfven speed toward the cloud edge
allows for a transfer of energy to wavelengths significantly larger than
lambda_0. This explains why the relevant time scale for turbulent dissipation
is the crossing time over the cloud scale rather than the crossing time over
the driving scale.

evolution. The gas emission is remarkably coextensive with the extinction seen
at infrared wavelengths and with the submillimeter dust emission. Our results
show that IRDCs are on average cold (T < 20 K) and have variations among the

trend in temperature from IRDCs with high ammonia column density to high mass

model is a system of spherical particles interacting through a square well
potential, with an additional constraint that limits the maximum number of
bonds, $N_{\rm max}$, per particle. Extensive simulations have been carried out
as a function of temperature, packing fraction, and $N_{\rm max}$. The dynamics
of this model are characterized by Arrhenius temperature dependence of the
transport coefficients and by nearly exponential relaxation of dynamic
correlators, i.e. features defining strong glass-forming liquids. This model
has two important features: (i) landscape basins can be associated with bonding
patterns; (ii) the configurational volume of the basin can be evaluated in a
formally exact way, and numerically with arbitrary precision. These features
allow us to evaluate the number of different topologies the bonding pattern can
adopt. We find that the number of fully bonded configurations, i.e.
configurations in which all particles are bonded to $N_{\rm max}$ neighbors, is
extensive, suggesting that the configurational entropy of the low temperature
fluid is finite. We also evaluate the energy dependence of the configurational
entropy close to the fully bonded state, and show that it follows a logarithmic
functional form, differently from the quadratic dependence characterizing
fragile liquids. We suggest that the presence of a discrete energy scale,
provided by the particle bonds, and the intrinsic degeneracy of fully bonded
disordered networks differentiates strong from fragile behavior.

model. Based on the slave-boson representation we introduce an additional new
order parameter associated with difference of the chemical potential between
conduction electrons $c_{i\sigma}$ and local spinons $f_{i\sigma}$. This order
parameter allows pseudospin construction $T_{ix} =
{1/2}<{c}_{i\alpha}^{\dagger}f_{i\alpha} + f_{i\alpha}^{\dagger}c_{i\alpha}>$,
$T_{iy} = - \frac{i}{2}<{c}_{i\alpha}^{\dagger}f_{i\alpha} -

{1/2}<{c}_{i\alpha}^{\dagger}c_{i\alpha} - f_{i\alpha}^{\dagger}f_{i\alpha}>$,

order parameter in the slave-boson representation of the Kondo lattice model.

YBCO and further work has ensued. Most of the theoretical work has been limited
to low temperature because it has not included the effect of the superfluid
current on the energy gap. We find that this effect leads to important
corrections above T~0.2Tc, while leaving the 1/T low temperature behavior
intact. A twofold increase in the nonlinear coefficient at temperatures of
order ~0.75 Tc is found, and as T->Tc the nonlinearity comes entirely from the
effects of the superfluid current on the gap. Impurity scattering has been
included and, in addition, signatures for the case of d+s-wave are presented.

include spinor matter fields. Our formulation applies to generic values of the
Immirzi parameter and reduces to the Ashtekar-Romano-Tate approach when the
Immirzi parameter is taken equal to the imaginary unit. The dynamics of the
gravity-fermions coupled system is described by the Holst plus Dirac action
with a non-minimal coupling term. The non-minimal interaction together with the
Holst modification to the Hilbert-Palatini action reconstruct the Nieh-Yan
invariant, so that the effective action coming out is the one of
Einstein-Cartan theory with a typical Fermi-like interaction term: in spite of
the presence of spinor matter fields, the Immirzi parameter plays no role in
the classical effective dynamics and results to be only a multiplicative factor
in front of a total divergence.
  We reduce the total action of the theory to the sum of dynamically
independent Ashtekar-Romano-Tate actions for self and anti-self dual
connections, with different weights depending on the Immirzi parameter. This
allows to calculate the constraints of the complete theory in a simple way, it
is only necessary to realize that the Barbero-Immirzi connection is a weighted
sum of the self and anti-self dual Ashtekar connections. Finally the obtained
constraints for the separated action result to be polynomial in terms of the
self and anti-self dual connections, this could have implications in the
inclusion of spinor matter in the framework of non-perturbative quantum
gravity.

  To appear IMRN",,,,"math.GR math.RT",,"  For $n>2$, given $\phi_1,...,\phi_n$ randomly chosen isometries of $S^2$, it
is well-known that the group $\G$ generated by $\phi_1,...,\phi_n$ acts
ergodically on $S^2$. It is conjectured in \cite{GJS} that for almost every
choice of $\phi_1,...,\phi_n$ this action is {\em strongly ergodic}. This is
equivalent to the spectrum of $\phi_1+\phi_1{\inv}+{...}+\phi_n+\phi_n^{\inv}$
as an operator on $L^2(S^2)$ having a spectral gap, i.e. all eigenvalues but
the largest one being bounded above by some $\lambda_1<2n$. (The largest
eigenvalue $\lambda_0$, corresponding to constant functions, is $2n$.)
  In this article we show that if $n>2$, then either the conjecture is true or
almost every $n$-tuple fails to have a gap. In fact, the same result is holds
for any $n$-tuple $\phi_1,..., \phi_n$ in any any compact group $K$ that is an
almost direct product of SU(2) factors with $L^2(S^2)$ replaced by $L^2(X)$

some conditional results for similar actions of $F_n$ on homogeneous spaces for

is well resolved. The variation of the constant shear rate S causes a change of
the turbulent velocity fluctuations on all scales and thus of the intensity of
local stretching rate of the advecting flow. The latter is measured by the
maximum Lyapunov exponent lambda_1 which is found to increase as \lambda_1 ~
S^{3/2}, in agreement with a dimensional argument. The ensemble of up to 2
times 10^6 passively advected dumbbells is advanced by Brownian dynamics
simulations in combination with a pseudospectral integration for the turbulent
shear flow. Anisotropy of stretching is quantified by the statistics of the
azimuthal angle $\phi$ which measures the alignment with the mean flow axis in
the x-y shear plane, and the polar angle theta which determines the orientation
with respect to the shear plane. The asymmetry of the probability density
function (PDF) of phi increases with growing shear rate S. Furthermore, the PDF
becomes increasingly peaked around mean flow direction (phi= 0). In contrast,
the PDF of the polar angle theta is symmetric and less sensitive to changes of

lead to systems with hierarchical phase space, where the stickiness is
apparently enhanced due to the presence of infinitely many regular islands and
Cantori. In this case, we show that the distribution of recurrence times can be
composed of a sum of exponentials or a sum of power-laws, depending on the
relative contribution of the primary and secondary structures of the hierarchy.

evidence, for all the simple vowels of US English, for both male and female

undermining the validity of these linear techniques, supporting the assumptions
of either dynamical nonlinearity and/or non-Gaussianity common to more recent,
complex, efforts at dynamical modelling speech time series. However, an
additional finding is that the classical assumptions cannot be ruled out
entirely, and plausible evidence is given to explain the success of the linear
Gaussian theory as a weak approximation to the true, nonlinear/non-Gaussian
dynamics. This supports the use of appropriate hybrid
linear/nonlinear/non-Gaussian modelling. With a calibrated calculation of
statistic and particular choice of experimental protocol, some of the known
systematic problems of the method of surrogate data testing are circumvented to
obtain results to support the conclusions to a high level of significance.

Significant departure from a t*rho form is found only for nuclear densities
about and less than 20% of nuclear-matter density, and extrapolation to
nuclear-matter density yields an attractive potential, about 170 MeV deep.
Partial restoration of chiral symmetry compatible with pionic atoms and
low-energy pion-nuclear data plays no role at the relevant low-density regime,
but this effect is not ruled out at high densities. Kbar-nuclear bound states
are generated across the periodic table self consistently, using a relativistic
mean-field model Lagrangian which couples the Kbar to the scalar and vector
meson fields mediating the nuclear interactions. The reduced phase space
available for Kbar absorption from these bound states is taken into account by
adding an energy-dependent imaginary term which underlies the corresponding
Kbar-nuclear level widths, with a strength required by fits to the atomic data.
Substantial polarization of the core nucleus is found for light nuclei, and the
binding energies and widths calculated in this dynamical model differ
appreciably from those calculated for a static nucleus. A wide range of binding
energies is spanned by varying the Kbar couplings to the meson fields. Our
calculations provide a lower limit of Gamma(Kbar) = 50 +/- 10 MeV on the width
of nuclear bound states for Kbar binding energy in the range B(Kbar) = 100 -
200 MeV. Comments are made on the interpretation of the FINUDA experiment at

the slope of the Hubble plot increases. The Hubble plot is also curved,

actions of protein kinase A (PKA), MAP kinase (MAPK), and CaM kinase II
(CAMKII) in the vicinity of the synapse, and activation of transcription by CaM
kinase IV (CAMKIV) and MAPK. L-LTP is represented by increases in a synaptic
weight. Simulations suggest that steep, supralinear stimulus-response
relationships between stimuli (elevations in [Ca2+]) and kinase activation are
essential for translating brief stimuli into long-lasting gene activation and
synaptic weight increases. Convergence of multiple kinase activities to induce
L-LTP helps to generate a threshold whereby the amount of L-LTP varies steeply
with the number of tetanic electrical stimuli. The model simulates tetanic,
theta-burst, pairing-induced, and chemical L-LTP, as well as L-LTP due to
synaptic tagging. The model also simulates inhibition of L-LTP by inhibition of
MAPK, CAMKII, PKA, or CAMKIV. The model predicts results of experiments to
delineate mechanisms underlying L-LTP induction and expression. For example,
the cAMP antagonist RpcAMPs, which inhibits L-LTP induction, is predicted to
inhibit ERK activation. The model also appears useful to clarify similarities

charge qubits interacting with a single-mode quantized field, which is provided
by a on-chip transmission line resonator. We analyze the dressed state
structure of this superconducting circuit QED system and the selection rules of
electromagnetic-induced transitions between any two of these dressed states.
Its macroscopic quantum criticality, in the form of ground state level
crossing, is also analyzed, resulting from competition between the Ising-type
inter-qubit coupling and the controllable on-site potentials.

A 73, 062313 (2006)","10.1103/PhysRevA.73.062314",,"quant-ph",,"  We propose a natural generalization of bipartite Werner and isotropic states
to multipartite systems consisting of an arbitrary even number of d-dimensional
subsystems (qudits). These generalized states are invariant under the action of
local unitary operations. We study basic properties of multipartite invariant
states: separability criteria and multi-PPT conditions.
