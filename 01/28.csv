destroyed by their coupling to the environment provided by sub-Hubble modes. We
identify what features the sub-Hubble environment must have in order to
decohere the longer wavelengths, and identify how the onset of decoherence (and
how long it takes) depends on the properties of the sub-Hubble physics which
forms the environment. Our results show that the decoherence process is largely
insensitive to the details of the coupling between the sub- and super-Hubble

distances (TWA 1, TWA 4,TWA 9,TWA 11,TWA 19).The method is based on the

presents a quite different orbit so that it does not appear to be a dynamical
member of TWA. The four remaining stars have a first maximum orbits'
confinement at the age of -8.3 $\pm{0.8}$ Myr which is considered the dynamical
age of TWA. This confinement fixes the probable 3D forming region of TWA with a
mean radius of 14.5 pc. This region is related to the older subgroups of the
Sco-Cen OB association, Lower Centaurus Crux (LCC) and Upper Centaurus Lupus

of the $\beta$ Pic Moving Group (BPMG) with an age of 11 Myr, also discussed

an absorbed power-law or multicolour disc blackbody prove inadequate at
describing the spectra. Better fits are found using a combination of these two
components, with both variants of this model - a cool (0.2 keV) disc blackbody
plus hard power-law continuum, and a soft power-law continuum plus a warm (1.7
keV) disc blackbody - providing good fits to 8/13 ULX spectra. However, by
examining the data above 2 keV, we find evidence for curvature in the majority
of datasets, inconsistent with the dominance of a power-law in this regime. The
most successful empirical description of the spectra proved to be a combination
of a cool (0.2 keV) classic blackbody spectrum, plus a warm disc blackbody
(good fits to 10/13 ULX spectra). The best overall fits are provided by a
physically self-consistent accretion disc plus Comptonised corona model (diskpn
+ eqpair), which fits acceptably to 11/13 ULXs. This model provides a physical
explanation for the spectral curvature, namely that it originates in an
optically-thick corona, though the accretion disc photons seeding this corona
still originate in an apparently cool disc. We note similarities between this
fit and models of Galactic black hole binaries at high accretion rates. We
conclude that this analysis of the best spectral data for ULXs shows it to be
plausible that the majority of the population are high accretion rate
stellar-mass (perhaps up to 80-Msun) black holes, though we cannot
categorically rule out the presence of larger, 1000-Msun intermediate-mass

Approximately 97% of the H2 mass density rho_H2 is in systems above N_H2=10^21

present simulations which predict silicon enhancement of planet hosts within
the context of the core-accretion hypothesis for giant planet formation.
Because silicon and oxygen are both alpha elements, [Si/Fe] traces [O/Fe], so
the silicon enhancement in planet hosts predicts that these stars are
oxygen-rich as well. We present new numerical simulations of planet formation
by core accretion that establish the timescale on which a Jovian planet reaches
rapid gas accretion, t_rga, as a function of solid surface density sigma_solid:
(t_rga / 1 Myr) = (sigma_solid / 25.0 g cm^{-2})^{-1.44}. This relation enables
us to construct Monte Carlo simulations that predict the fraction of star-disk
systems that form planets as a function of [Fe/H], [Si/Fe], disk mass, outer
disk radius and disk lifetime. Our simulations reproduce both the known
planet-metallicity correlation and the planet-silicon correlation reported in
this paper. The simulations predict that 16% of Solar-type stars form
Jupiter-mass planets, in agreement with 12% predicted from extrapolation of the
observed planet frequency-semimajor axis distribution. Although a simple
interpretation of core accretion predicts that the planet-silicon correlation
should be much stronger than the planet-nickel correlation, we observe the same
degree of silicon and nickel enhancement in planet hosts. If this result
persists once more planets have been discovered, it might indicate a complexity
in the chemistry of planet formation beyond the simple accumulation of solids

absorbed, initiating inverse Compton $e^\pm$ pair cascades in the anisotropic
radiation from stellar surfaces. We investigate influence of the propagation
effects on the spectral and angular features of the gamma-ray spectra emerging
from these two binary systems by applying the Monte Carlo method. Two different
hypothesis are considered: isotropic injection of primary gamma-rays with the
power law spectrum and electrons. It is concluded that propagation effects of
gamma-rays can be responsible for the spectral features observed from LS 5039.
The cascade processes occurring inside these binary systems significantly
reduce the gamma-ray opacity obtained in other works by simple calculations of
the escape of gamma-rays from the radiation fields of the massive stars. Both
systems provide very similar conditions for the TeV gamma-ray production at the
periastron passage. Any TeV gamma-ray flux at the apastron passage in LSI +61
303 will be relatively stronger with respect to its GeV flux than in LS 5039.
If gamma-rays are produced inside these binaries not far from the massive
stars, i.e. within a few stellar radii, then clear anticorrelation between the
GeV and TeV emission should be observed, provided that primary gamma-rays at
GeV and TeV energies are produced in the same process by the same population of
relativistic particles. These gamma-ray propagation features can be tested in
the near future by the multi-wavelength campaigns engaging the AGILE and GLAST
telescopes and the Cherenkov telescopes (e.g. MAGIC, HESS, VERITAS and

Questions of how thin superconducting wires or films can be before they lose
their superconducting properties have important technological ramifications and
go to the heart of understanding coherence and robustness of the
superconducting state in quantum-confined geometries. Here, we exploit quantum
confinement of itinerant electrons in a soft metal to stabilize superconductors
with lateral dimensions of the order of a few millimeters and vertical
dimensions of only a few atomic layers. These extremely thin superconductors
show no indication of defect- or fluctuation-driven suppression of
superconductivity and sustain supercurrents of up to 10% of the depairing
current density. The extreme hardness of the critical state is attributed to
quantum trapping of vortices. This study paints a conceptually appealing,
elegant picture of a model nanoscale superconductor with calculable critical
state properties. It indicates the intriguing possibility of exploiting robust
superconductivity at the nanoscale.

considerations for a toy model problem in electrodynamics motivate the
introduction of a variational principle for the lapse with several attractive
properties. In particular, it is argued that the resulting elliptic gauge
condition for the lapse together with a suitable condition for the shift and
constraint-preserving boundary conditions controlling the Weyl scalar Psi_0 are
expected to yield a well posed initial-boundary value problem for metric
formulations of Einstein's field equations which are commonly used in numerical
relativity.
  To present a simple and explicit example we consider the 3+1 decomposition
introduced by York of the field equations on a cubic domain with two periodic
directions and prove in the weak field limit that our gauge condition for the
lapse and our boundary conditions lead to a well posed problem. The method
discussed here is quite general and should also yield well posed problems for
different ways of writing the evolution equations, including first order
symmetric hyperbolic or mixed first-order second-order formulations. Well posed
initial-boundary value formulations for the linearization about arbitrary
stationary configurations will be presented elsewhere.

important consequences for the pre-inflationary dynamics of the early universe.
In particular, they may allow a self-interacting scalar field to climb up its
potential during a very large number of these cycles. The cycles are naturally
broken when the potential reaches a critical value and the universe begins to
inflate, thereby providing a `graceful entrance' to early universe inflation.
We study the dynamics of this behaviour within the context of braneworld
scenarios which exhibit a bounce from a collapsing phase to an expanding one.
The dynamics can be understood by studying a general class of braneworld models
that are sourced by a scalar field with a constant potential. Within this
context, we determine the conditions a given model must satisfy for a graceful
entrance to be possible in principle. We consider the bouncing braneworld model
proposed by Shtanov and Sahni and show that it exhibits the features needed to
realise a graceful entrance to inflation for a wide region of parameter space.

Our model contains minimally coupled free scalar field as a matter source. We

analysis is performed in conformally related Brans-Dicke and Einstein frames.
Dynamical behavior of our Universe is described by its scale factor. Since the
scale factors of our Universe are described by different variables in both
frames, they can have different dynamics.
  Indeed, we show that with our S-brane ansatz in the Brans-Dicke frame the
stages of accelerating expansion exist for all types of the external space
(flat, spherical and hyperbolic). However, applying the same ansatz for the
metric in the Einstein frame, we find that a model with flat external space and
hyperbolic compactification of the internal space is the only one with the
stage of the accelerating expansion. Scalar field can prevent this
acceleration. It is shown that the case of hyperbolic external space in
Brans-Dicke frame is the only model which can satisfy experimental bounds for
the fine structure constant variations. We obtain a class of models where a
pare of dynamical internal spaces have fixed total volume. It results in fixed
fine structure constant. However, these models are unstable and external space
is non-accelerating.

equivalent to the property that every homomorphism of the group $F_\infty\times
F_\infty$ into the unitary group $U(\ell^2)$ with the strong topology is
pointwise approximated by homomorphisms with a precompact range. In this form,
the property (which we call Kirchberg's property) makes sense for an arbitrary
topological group. We establish the validity of the Kirchberg property for the
isometry group $Iso(U)$ of the universal Urysohn metric space $U$ as a
consequence of a stronger result: every representation of a residually finite
group by isometries of $U$ can be pointwise approximated by representations
with a finite range. This brings up the natural question of which other
concrete infinite-dimensional groups satisfy the Kirchberg property.

compact stars. The theory is developed within the method of real-time Green's
functions and is applied to study of baryonic matter at and above the
saturation density. The non-relativistic and covariant theories based on
continuum Green's functions and the T-matrix and related approximations to the
self-energies are reviewed. The effects of symmetry energy, onset of hyperons
and meson condensation on the properties of stellar configurations are
demonstrated on specific examples. Neutrino interactions with baryonic matter
are introduced within a kinetic theory. We concentrate on the classification,
analysis and first principle derivation of neutrino radiation processes from
unpaired and superfluid hadronic phases. We then demonstrate how neutrino
radiation rates from various microscopic processes affect the macroscopic
cooling of neutron stars and how the observed X-ray fluxes from pulsars
constrain the properties of dense hadronic matter.

surface used in this work. The vibrational modes associated with the H3+ - H2
torsion and stretching posses very flat minima. As a consequence the
fundamental frequencies corresponding to these modes are poorly described in
the harmonic approximation. The vibrational frequencies obtained in this work
are in good agreement with the available experimental data as well as other
computational methods found in literature. In our genetic algorithm study of
the potential energy surface using cartesian coordinates we have found some
unexpected minima. A careful analysis shows that some of these minima are
described by the same curviliniar coordinates in which the potential is
described. However, they represent nonequivalent molecular geometries.

to a well-posed bound state problem when x is taken on a contour in the
lower-half complex plane. It is then PT-symmetric rather than Hermitian.
Nonetheless it has been shown numerically to have a real spectrum, and a proof
of reality, involving the correspondence between ordinary differential
equations and integral systems, was subsequently constructed for the general
class of potentials -(ix)^N. For PT-symmetric but non-Hermitian Hamiltonians
the natural PT metric is not positive definite, but a dynamically-defined
positive-definite metric can be defined, depending on an operator Q. Further,
with the help of this operator an equivalent Hermitian Hamiltonian h can be
constructed. This programme has been carried out exactly for a few soluble
models, and the first few terms of a perturbative expansion have been found for
the potential m^2x^2+igx^3. However, until now, the -x^4 potential has proved
intractable. In the present paper we give explicit, closed-form expressions for
Q and h, which are made possible by a particular parametrization of the contour
in the complex plane on which the problem is defined. This constitutes an
explicit proof of the reality of the spectrum. The resulting equivalent
Hamiltonian has a potential with a positive quartic term together with a linear
term.
