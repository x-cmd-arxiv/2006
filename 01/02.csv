very hot Jupiters (VHJs) with 1-3 day periods by comparing the planets actually
detected in the OGLE-III survey with those predicted by our models. The models
are constructed following Gould & Morgan (2003) by populating the line of sight
with stars drawn from the Hipparcos catalog. Using these, we demonstrate that
the number of stars with sensitivity to HJs and VHJs is only 4--16% of those in
the OGLE-III fields satisfying the spectroscopic-followup limit of V_max<17.5.
Hence, the frequencies we derive are much higher than a naive estimate would
indicate. We find that at 90% confidence the fraction of stars with planets in
the two period ranges is (1/310)(1^{+1.39}_{-0.59}) for HJs and
(1/690)(1^{+1.10}_{-0.54}) for VHJs. The HJ rate is statistically
indistinguishable from that found in radial velocity (RV) studies. However, we
note that magnitude-limited RV samples are heavily biased toward metal-rich
(hence, planet-bearing) stars, while transit surveys are not, and therefore we
expect that more sensitive transit surveys should find a deficit of HJs as
compared to RV surveys. The detection of 3 transiting VHJs, all with periods
less than 2 days, is marginally consistent with the complete absence of such
detections in RV surveys. The planets detected are consistent with being
uniformly distributed between 1.00 and 1.25 Jovian radii, but there are too few
in the sample to map this distribution in detail.

been commonly interpreted as being driven by the mechanical modes of the
magnetar's solid crust which are excited during the flare. Here we show that
this interpretation is in sharp contradiction with the conventional magnetar
model. Firstly, we show that a magnetar crustal mode decays on the timescale of
at most a second due to the emission of Alfven waves into the neutron-star
interior. A possible modification is then to assume that the QPOs are
associated with the magnetars' global modes. However, we argue that at the
frequencies of the observed QPOs, the neutron-star core is likely to support a
continuum of Magneto-Hydrodynamic (MHD) normal modes. We demonstrate this on a
completely solvable toy model which captures the essential physics of the
system. We then show that the frequency of the global mode of the whole star is
likely to have a significant imaginary component, and its amplitude is likely
to decay on a short timescale. This is not observed. Thus we conclude that
either (i) the origin of the QPO is in the magnetar's magnetosphere, or (ii)
the magnetic field has a special configuration: either it is expelled from the
magnetar's core prior to the flares, or its poloidal component has very small
coherence length.

minimum quantity of 50,000 kg of red particles has fallen from the sky through
red rain. An analysis of this strange phenomenon further shows that the

galaxies; 16 Fanaroff & Riley Type I radio galaxies and 11 (more) normal
early-type galaxies. We focus here on what can be learned from the nuclear
velocity dispersion (line width) of the gas as a complement to the many studies
dealing with gas rotation velocities. We find that the dispersion in a STIS
aperture of ~0.1''-0.2'' generally exceeds the large-scale stellar velocity
dispersion of the galaxy. This is qualitatively consistent with the presence of
central BHs, but raises the question whether the excess gas dispersion is of
gravitational or non-gravitational origin and whether the implied BH masses are
consistent with our current understanding of BH demography(as predicted by the
M-sigma relation between BH mass and stellar velocity dispersion). To address
this we construct dynamical models for the gas, both thin disk models and
models with more general axis ratios and velocity anisotropies. For the normal
galaxies the nuclear gas dispersions are adequately reproduced assuming disks
around BHs with masses that follow the M-sigma relation. In contrast, the gas
dispersions observed for the radio galaxies generally exceed those predicted by
any of the models. We attribute this to the presence of non-gravitational
motions in the gas that are similar to or larger than the gravitational
motions. The non- gravitational motions are presumably driven by the active
galactic nucleus (AGN), but we do not find a relation between the radiative
output of the AGN and the non-gravitational dispersion. It is not possible to
uniquely determine the BH mass for each galaxy from its nuclear gas dispersion.
However, for the sample as a whole the observed dispersions do not provide
evidence for significant deviations from the M-sigma relation.

removing a small velocity gradient across the SMC (7.9 km/s/deg oriented at 10
deg E of N), we measure an rms velocity scatter of 27.5+-0.5 km/s. The line of
sight velocity distribution is well-characterized by a Gaussian and the
velocity dispersion profile is nearly constant as a function of radius. We find
no kinematic evidence of tidal disturbances. Without a high-precision
measurement of the SMC's proper motion, it is not possible to constrain the
SMC's true rotation speed from our measured radial-velocity gradient. However,
even with conservative assumptions, we find that v < sigma and hence that the
SMC is primarily supported by its velocity dispersion. We find that the shape
of the SMC, as measured from the analysis of the spatial distribution of its
red giant stars, is consistent with the degree of rotational flattening
expected for the range of allowed v/sigma values. As such, the properties of
the SMC are consistent with similar low luminosity spheroidal systems. We
conclude that the SMC is primarily a low luminosity spheroid whose irregular
visual appearance is dominated by recent star formation. A simple virial
analysis using the measured kinematics implies an enclosed mass within 1.6 kpc

and the quasiparticle residue vanishes as the quantum critical point is
approached from either side. Some of the unusual experiments, concerning the
phases and quantum critical points of heavy fermion metals, are discussed from

Recent experimental realizations of superfluidity in dilute gases of ultracold
fermionic (half-integer spin) atoms offer exciting opportunities to directly
test theoretical models of related many-body fermion systems that are
inaccessible to experimental manipulation, such as neutron stars and
quark-gluon plasmas. However, the microscopic interactions between fermions are
potentially quite complex, and experiments in ultracold gases to date cannot
clearly distinguish between the qualitatively different microscopic models that
have been proposed. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that optical
measurements of electron spin noise -- the intrinsic, random fluctuations of
spin -- can probe the entangled quantum states of ultracold fermionic atomic
gases and unambiguously reveal the detailed nature of the interatomic
interactions. We show that different models predict different sets of
resonances in the noise spectrum, and once the correct effective interatomic
interaction model is identified, the line-shapes of the spin noise can be used
to constrain this model. Further, experimental measurements of spin noise in
classical (Boltzmann) alkali vapors are used to estimate the expected signal
magnitudes for spin noise measurements in ultracold atom systems and to show
that these measurements are feasible.

good agreement with the experimental results, were employed to optimize the

  Detail explanations are added",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.str-el math-ph math.MP",,"  Phase transition is a war game. It widely exists in different kinds of
complex system beyond physics. Where there is revolution, there is phase
transition. The renormalization group transformation, which was proved to be a
powerful tool to study the critical phenomena, is actually a game process. The
phase boundary between the old phase and new phase is the outcome of many
rounds of negotiation between the old force and new force. The order of phase
transition is determined by the cutoff of renormalization group transformation.
This definition unified Ehrenfest's definition of phase transition in
thermodynamic physics. If the strategy manifold has nontrivial topology, the
topological relation would put a constrain on the surviving strategies, the
transition occurred under this constrain may be called a topological one. If
the strategy manifold is open and noncompact, phase transition is simply a game
process, there is no table for topology. An universal phase coexistence
equation is found, it sits at the Nash equilibrium point. Inspired by the
fractal space structure demonstrated by renormalization group theory, a
conjecture is proposed that the universal scaling law of a general phase
transition in a complex system comes from the coexistence equation around Nash
equilibrium point. Game theory also provide us new understanding to pairing
mechanism and entanglement in many body physics.

process coupled to strain equals the measuring frequency. The reliability of
the anelastic experiments and of the assignments to various microscopic

solitonic tilt waves and fast local motion. The latter is driven by atomic
tunneling and is enormously enhanced and accelerated by doping, demonstrating
direct coupling between tilt modes and hole excitations. The dynamics of the
hole stripes has been probed when they act as walls between domains of
antiferromagnetically correlated spins (cluster spin glass) at LHe temperature,
and at higher temperature, when they overcome by thermal activation the pinning
barriers provided by Sr dopants. In YBCO various diffusion and ordering
processes of the O atoms in the CuOx planes are identified, involving: i) Cu-O
chains in the orthorhombic O-I phase (x~1); ii) sparser chains fragments at
lower O content; iii) isolated O atoms. The hopping barriers are ~1 eV for the
first two types of jumps and 0.11 eV for the latter. It is discussed how such
widely different barriers are possible and how the extraordinarily high
mobility of isolated O atoms is compatible with slow O ordering. In addition,
relaxation processes have been attributed to hopping of O between off-center
positions within the Cu-O chains and to bipolarons on orbitals that do not
contribute to superconductivity. The O mobility in the RuO2-d planes of Ru-1212
is explained in terms of hopping of O vacancies whose elastic quadrupoles are

  incorrect proof in the appendex with a corrected one",,,,"math.NA math.PR",,"  The understanding of adaptive algorithms for SDEs is an open area where many
issues related to both convergence and stability (long time behaviour) of
algorithms are unresolved. This paper considers a very simple adaptive
algorithm, based on controlling only the drift component of a time-step. Both
convergence and stability are studied.
  The primary issue in the convergence analysis is that the adaptive method
does not necessarily drive the time-steps to zero with the user-input
tolerance. This possibility must be quantified and shown to have low
probability.
  The primary issue in the stability analysis is ergodicity. It is assumed that
the noise is non-degenerate, so that the diffusion process is elliptic, and the
drift is assumed to satisfy a coercivity condition. The SDE is then
geometrically ergodic (converges to statistical equilibrium exponentially
quickly). If the drift is not linearly bounded then explicit fixed time-step
approximations, such as the Euler-Maruyama scheme, may fail to be ergodic. In
this work, it is shown that the simple adaptive time-stepping strategy cures
this problem. In addition to proving ergodicity, an exponential moment bound is
also proved, generalizing a result known to hold for the SDE itself.

minimum action on the model parameters determines the statistical distribution
in the model space consistent with the measurements. We illustrate the
efficiency of the approach by solving an intensively studied problem from the
population dynamics of predator-prey system where the prey populations may be
observed while the predator populations or even their number is difficult or
impossible to estimate. We apply our approach to recover both the unknown
dynamics of predators and model parameters (including parameters that are
traditionally very difficult to estimate) directly from measurements of the
prey dynamics. We provide a comparison of our method with the Markov Chain
Monte Carlo technique.

  and extended the discussion on the quantum origin of friction","New J. Phys. 8, 83 (2006)","10.1088/1367-2630/8/5/083",,"quant-ph",,"  The unavoidable irreversible losses of power in a heat engine are found to be
of quantum origin. Following thermodynamic tradition a model quantum heat
engine operating by the Otto cycle is analyzed. The working medium of the model
is composed of an ensemble of harmonic oscillators. A link is established
between the quantum observables and thermodynamical variables based on the
concept of canonical invariance. These quantum variables are sufficient to
determine the state of the system and with it all thermodynamical variables.
Conditions for optimal work, power and entropy production show that maximum
power is a compromise between the quasistatic limit of adiabatic following on
the compression and expansion branches and a sudden limit of very short time
allocation to these branches. At high temperatures and quasistatic operating
conditions the efficiency at maximum power coincides with the endoreversible
result. The optimal compression ratio varies from the square root of the
temperature ratio in the quasistatic limit where their reversibility is
dominated by heat conductance to the temperature ratio to the power of 1/4 in
the sudden limit when the irreversibility is dominated by friction. When the
engine deviates from adiabatic conditions the performance is subject to
friction. The origin of this friction can be traced to the noncommutability of
the kinetic and potential energy of the working medium.

superposition of multiple states simultaneously. Quantum information processing
(QIP) harnesses this profound phenomenon to manipulate information in radically
new ways. A fundamental challenge in all QIP technologies is the corruption of
superposition in a quantum bit (qubit) through interaction with its
environment. Quantum bang-bang control provides a solution by repeatedly
applying `kicks' to a qubit, thus disrupting an environmental interaction.
However, the speed and precision required for the kick operations has presented
an obstacle to experimental realization. Here we demonstrate a phase gate of
unprecedented speed on a nuclear spin qubit in a fullerene molecule (N@C60),
and use it to bang-bang decouple the qubit from a strong environmental
interaction. We can thus trap the qubit in closed cycles on the Bloch sphere,
or lock it in a given state for an arbitrary period. Our procedure uses
operations on a second qubit, an electron spin, in order to generate an
arbitrary phase on the nuclear qubit. We anticipate the approach will be vital
for QIP technologies, especially at the molecular scale where other strategies,
such as electrode switching, are unfeasible.

variable f:\Omega\to R on a phase space \Omega is associated with a
semispectral measure E^f, such that the moment operators of E^f are required to
be of the form \Gamma(f^k), with \Gamma a suitable mapping from the set of
classical variables to the set of (not necessarily bounded) operators in some
Hilbert space. In particular, we investigate the situation where the map \Gamma
is implemented by the operator integral with respect to some fixed positive
operator measure. The phase space \Omega is first taken to be an abstract
measurable space, then a locally compact unimodular group, and finally R^2,
where we determine explicitly the relevant operators \Gamma(f^k) for certain
variables f, in the case where the quantization map \Gamma is implemented by a
translation covariant positive operator measure. In addition, we consider the
question under what conditions a positive operator measure is projection

storage/communication medium is described by quantum mechanics. We assume an
m-ary alphabet with arbitrary prior distribution, and an n-dimensional quantum
system. Under these constraints, we seek an encoding-retrieval setup, comprised
of code-states and a quantum measurement, which maximizes the probability of
correct detection. In our development, we consider two cases. In the first, the
measurement is predefined and we seek the optimal code-states. In the second,
optimization is performed on both the code-states and the measurement.
  We show that one cannot outperform `pseudo-classical transmission', in which
we transmit n symbols with orthogonal code-states, and discard the remaining
symbols. However, such pseudo-classical transmission is not the only optimum.
We fully characterize the collection of optimal setups, and briefly discuss the
links between our findings and applications such as quantum key distribution
and quantum computing. We conclude with a number of results concerning the
design under an alternative optimality criterion, the worst-case posterior
probability, which serves as a measure of the retrieval reliability.
