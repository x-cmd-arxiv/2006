on day 6526 with T-ReCS attached to the Gemini telescope. The 11.7um flux has
increased significantly since our last observations on day 6067. The images
clearly show that all the emission arises from the equatorial ring (ER).
Spectra obtained with Spitzer, on day 6184 with MIPS at 24um, on day 6130 with
IRAC in the 3.6-8um region, and on day 6190 with IRS in the 12-37um region show
that the emission consists of thermal emission from silicate dust that
condensed out in the red giant wind of the progenitor star. The dust
temperature is ~166K, and the emitting dust mass is ~2.6 x 10-6 Msun. Lines of
[Ne II]12.82um and [Ne III]15.56um are clearly present, as well as a weak [Si
II]34.8um line. We also detect two lines near 26um which we tentatively ascribe
to [Fe II]25.99um and [O IV]25.91um. Comparison of the Gemini 11.7um image with
X-ray images from Chandra, UV-optical images from HST, and radio synchrotron
images obtained by the ATCA show generally good correlation of the images
across all wavelengths. Because of the limited resolution of the mid-IR images
we cannot uniquely determine the location or heating mechanism of the dust
giving rise to the emission. The dust could be collisionally heated by the
X-ray emitting plasma, providing a unique diagnostic of plasma conditions.
Alternatively, the dust could be radiatively heated in the dense UV-optical
knots that are overrun by the advancing supernova blast wave. In either case
the dust-to-gas mass ratio in the circumstellar medium around the supernova is
significantly lower than that in the general ISM of the LMC, suggesting either
a low condensation efficiency in the wind of the progenitor star, or the
efficient destruction of the dust by the SN blast wave.

with an initial metallicity of $Z=10^{-8}$, masses between 20 and 85 Mo and
average rotation velocities at these metallicities (Vini=600-800 km/s). The
most interesting models are the models with $Z=10^{-8}$ ([Fe/H]=~-6.6). In the
course of helium burning, carbon and oxygen are mixed into the hydrogen burning
shell. This boosts the importance of the shell and causes a reduction of the
size of the CO core. Later in the evolution, the hydrogen shell deepens and
produces large amount of primary nitrogen. For the most massive models (M>~60
Mo), significant mass loss occurs during the red supergiant stage. This mass
loss is due to the surface enrichment in CNO elements via rotational and
convective mixing.
  The yields of the fast rotating 20 Mo models can best reproduce (within our
study) the observed abundances at the surface of extremely metal poor (EMP)
stars. The wind of the massive models can reproduce the CNO abundances of the

decomposition of the hydrodynamical equations. The eddy-viscosity closure for
the rate of energy transfer from resolved toward subgrid scales is localised by
means of a dynamical procedure for the computation of the closure parameter.
Therefore, the subgrid scale model applies to arbitrary flow geometry and
evolution. For the treatment of microscopic viscous dissipation a
semi-statistical approach is used, and the gradient-diffusion hypothesis is
adopted for turbulent transport. A priori tests of the localised eddy-viscosity
closure and the gradient-diffusion closure are made by analysing data from
direct numerical simulations. As an a posteriori testing case, the large eddy
simulation of thermonuclear combustion in forced isotropic turbulence is
discussed. We intend the formulation of the subgrid scale model in this paper

the hypothesis that the effective flame speed is determined by the unresolved

includes a localised treatment of the energy transfer through the turbulence
cascade in combination with semi-statistical closures for the dissipation and
non-local transport of turbulence energy. In addition, subgrid scale buoyancy
effects are included. In the limit of negligible energy transfer and transport,
the dynamical model reduces to the Sharp-Wheeler relation. According to our
findings, the Sharp-Wheeler relation is insuffcient to account for the
complicated turbulent dynamics of flames in thermonuclear supernovae. The
application of a co-moving grid technique enables us to achieve very high
spatial resolution in the burning region. Turbulence is produced mostly at the
flame surface and in the interior ash regions. Consequently, there is a
pronounced anisotropy in the vicinity of the flame fronts. The localised
subgrid scale model predicts significantly enhanced energy generation and less
unburnt carbon and oxygen at low velocities compared to earlier simulations.

brought new constraints on stellar evolution models. In an attempt to explain
the origin of the abundances observed, we computed pre--supernova evolution
models, explosion models and the related nucleosynthesis. In this paper, we
start by presenting the pre-SN models of rotating single stars with
metallicities ranging from solar metallicity down to almost metal free. We then
review key processes in core-collapse and bounce, before we integrate them in a
simplistic parameterization for 3D MHD models, which are well underway and
allow one to follow the evolution of the magnetic fields during collapse and
bounce. Finally, we present explosive nucleosynthesis results including
neutrino interactions with matter, which are calculated using the outputs of
the explosion models.
  The main results of the pre-SN models are the following. First, primary
nitrogen is produced in large amount in models with an initial metallicity
$Z=10^{-8}$. Second, at the same metallicity of $Z=10^{-8}$ and for models with
an initial mass larger than about 60 Mo, rotating models may experience heavy
mass loss (up to more than half of the initial mass of the star). The chemical
composition of these winds can qualitatively reproduce the abundance patterns
observed at the surface of carbon-rich EMP stars. Explosive nucleosynthesis
including neutrino-matter interactions produce improved abundances for iron
group elements, in particular for scandium and zinc. It also opens the way to a
new neutrino and proton rich process ($\nu$p-process) able to contribute to the
nucleosynthesis of elements with A > 64. (Abridged)

velocity distribution of this sample is offset from the Tully-Fisher relation
(TFR) of local low-mass spirals, whereas the distant high-mass spirals are
compatible with the local TFR. We show that the slope of the local and the

a factor of 3 between z~0.5 and z~0. On the other hand, the distant
low-luminosity disks have much lower stellar M/L ratios than their local

3D-interactions. The extrapolation to longer lipids shows that the transition
discontinuity inherent to a lipid layer (i.e., determined by the lateral
interactions themselves) is expected for the saturated phosphatidylcholines
having more than 16-18 C-atoms per chain. Interestingly, it is the saturated
chains of this length that are the most abundant in biological membranes.
Probably, the biological membrane ""prefers"" to be near the critical state where
the system is the most responsive to physical actions.

The average binary weight enumerators of Reed Solomon product codes are also

defining a quantum field theory of matter and gravity in the absence of an
underlying background geometry. Loop quantum gravity (LQG) is a promising
proposal for addressing this difficult task. Despite the steady progress of the
field, dynamics remains to a large extend an open issue in LQG. Here we present
the main ideas behind a series of proposals for addressing the issue of
dynamics. We refer to these constructions as the {\em spin foam representation}
of LQG. This set of ideas can be viewed as a systematic attempt at the
construction of the path integral representation of LQG.
  The {\em spin foam representation} is mathematically precise in 2+1
dimensions, so we will start this chapter by showing how it arises in the
canonical quantization of this simple theory. This toy model will be used to
precisely describe the true geometric meaning of the histories that are summed
over in the path integral of generally covariant theories.
  In four dimensions similar structures appear. We call these constructions
{\em spin foam models} as their definition is incomplete in the sence that at
least one of the following issues remains unclear: 1) the connection to a
canonical formulation, and 2) regularization independence (renormalizability).
In the second part of this chapter we will describe the definition of these
models emphasizing the importance of these open issues. We also discuss the non
standard picture of quantum spacetime that follows from background
independence.

supposes that the hyperspace can be described with octonions and if
4-dimensional Minkowski space is a projection of the hyperspace, consequently
equations for 4-dimensional space must be projections of hyperspace equations.
Therefore he obtains a new object as volumetric analog of Pauli sigma-matrices
for 8 (or maybe 24)-dimensional hyperspace. Also the author represents general
form of a volumetric Dirac equation solution. As is well known nonassociativity
is the main distinctive feature of octonions. But square matrices cannot be
nonassociative. Therefore the author had to introduce cubic sigma-matrices.
From another hand a volumetric object has 3 indices, as a result of it one
cannot introduce multiplicative operator for cubic matrices, their projections
only can be objects of the multiplicative operator. Meanwhile an uncertainty
appears because of a rest index. To overcome the uncertainty one need to
consider all the 3 projections of an octonion equation.

shortage in the United States has sparked a debate about optimal vaccination
strategies to reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality caused by the
influenza virus. We present a comparative analysis of two classes of suggested
vaccination strategies: mortality-based strategies that target high risk
populations and morbidity-based that target high prevalence populations.
Applying the methods of contact network epidemiology to a model of disease
transmission in a large urban population, we evaluate the efficacy of these
strategies across a wide range of viral transmission rates and for two
different age-specific mortality distributions. We find that the optimal
strategy depends critically on the viral transmission level (reproductive rate)
of the virus: morbidity-based strategies outperform mortality-based strategies
for moderately transmissible strains, while the reverse is true for highly
transmissible strains. These results hold for a range of mortality rates
reported for prior influenza epidemics and pandemics. Furthermore, we show that
vaccination delays and multiple introductions of disease into the community
have a more detrimental impact on morbidity-based strategies than
mortality-based strategies. If public health officials have reasonable
estimates of the viral transmission rate and the frequency of new introductions
into the community prior to an outbreak, then these methods can guide the
design of optimal vaccination priorities. When such information is unreliable
or not available, as is often the case, this study recommends mortality-based
vaccination priorities.

mutual information. We present here a detailed analysis of the different
meanings and properties of these four definitions. We show that all these
measures satisfy, at least, a weaker additivity condition, i.e. limited to the
response set. This allows us to use them for analysing correlated coding, as we
illustrate in a toy-example from hippocampal place cells.

self-organization on nucleotide content of evolving species. In our model,
genomes of the species under consideration have been represented by their
nucleotide genomic fraction and we have applied two-parameter Kimura model of
substitutions to include the changes of the fraction in time. The initial
nucleotide fraction and substitution rates were decided with the help of random
number generator. Deviation of the genomic nucleotide fraction from its
equilibrium value was playing the role of the fitness parameter, $B$, in
Bak-Sneppen model. Our finding is, that the higher is the value of the
threshold fitness, during the evolution course, the more frequent are large
fluctuations in number of species with strongly differentiated nucleotide
content; and it is more often the case that the oldest species, which survive
the food-chain competition, might have specific nucleotide fraction making
possible generating long genes

  computation time",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The NP-complete problem of the travelling salesman (TSP) is considered in the
framework of quantum adiabatic computation (QAC). We first derive a remarkable
lower bound for the computation time for adiabatic algorithms in general as a
function of the energy involved in the computation. Energy, and not just time
and space, must thus be considered in the evaluation of algorithm complexity,
in perfect accordance with the understanding that all computation is physical.
We then propose, with oracular Hamiltonians, new quantum adiabatic algorithms
of which not only the lower bound in time but also the energy requirement do
not increase exponentially in the size of the input. Such an improvement in
both time and energy complexity, as compared to all other existing algorithms
for TSP, is apparently due to quantum entanglement. We also appeal to the
general theory of Diophantine equations in a speculation on physical
implementation of those oracular Hamiltonians.

detuned modes can form an optical trap at such distances while the back-action
of the atom on the field modes can simultaneously be used for atom detection.
We investigate these trapping potentials including van-der-Waals and
Casimir-Polder forces and discuss corresponding atom detection efficiencies,
depending on a variety of system parameters. Finally, we analyze the
feasibility of non-destructive detection.

continuous variable Gaussian systems and suggest minimal schemes for
implementations. In our schemes, the symbols from a given alphabet are encoded
in a set of Gaussian signals which are coupled to a probe excited in a known
state. After the interaction the probe is measured, in order to infer the
transmitted state, while the conditional state of the signal is left for the
subsequent user. The schemes are minimal, {\em i.e.} involve a single
additional probe, and allow for the nondemolitive transmission of a continuous
real alphabet over a quantum channel. The trade-off between information gain
and state disturbance is quantified by fidelities and, after optimization with
respect to the measurement, analyzed in terms of the energy carried by the
signal and the probe. We found that transmission fidelity only depends on the
energy of the signal and the probe, whereas estimation fidelity also depends on
the alphabet size and the measurement gain. Increasing the probe energy does
not necessarily lead to a better trade-off, the most relevant parameter being
the ratio between the alphabet size and the signal width, which in turn
determine the allocation of the signal energy.
