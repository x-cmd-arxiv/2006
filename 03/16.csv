image as a smeared version of the infrared image. The physical basis for this
model is that cosmic-ray electrons (CR electrons) will diffuse significant
distances from their originating sources before decaying by synchrotron
emission. We find that this description generally works well, improving the
correlation between the radio and infrared images of our four sample galaxies
by an average factor of $\sim$1.6. We also find that the best-fit smearing
kernels seem to show a dependence on the ongoing star formation activity within
each disk. Galaxies having lower star formation activity (NGC 2403 and NGC
3031) are best-fit using larger smearing kernels than galaxies with more active
star-forming disks (NGC 5194 and NGC 6946). We attribute this trend to be due
to a recent deficit of CR electron injection into the interstellar medium of
galaxies with lower star formation activity throughout their disks.

intriguingly consistent with a larger running of the inflationary scalar
spectral index than would be expected for single-field inflation. We revisit
the issue of a large running spectral index, first by reexamining the evidence
from the data, and then by reconstructing the inflationary potential, using an
improved method based upon the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. We note that a
spectrum which runs only over 1.5 decades of k space provides as good a fit to
the CMB data as one which runs at all k, that significant evidence for running
comes from multipoles l near 40, and that large running gives a better fit than
a flat spectrum primarily if the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ is large, r ~ 0.5,
and the field values are at the Planck scale. This allows one to break the
large degeneracy of potentials which would be consistent with the scalar power
alone. Large running, should it be confirmed, is thus linked to a high scale of
inflation and the possibility of seeing effects of tensor modes in the CMB and
Planck-scale physics. Nevertheless, we show that the reconstructed inflaton
potential is well-described by a renormalizable potential whose quantum
corrections are under control despite the large field values.

have analyzed archival ISOSWS spectra of the DR21 outflow, and compare them to
updated H2 shocked and UV-excitation models. We find that H2 line emission
contributes about 50% of the flux of the IRAC bands at 3.6 um, 4.5 um , and 5.8

that the outflow contains multiple excitation mechanisms. Other potentially
strong features, in particular Br alpha and CO emission, have been suggested as
contributing to IRAC fluxes in outflows, but they are weak or absent in DR21;
surprisingly, there also is no evidence for strong PAH emission. The results
imply that IRAC images can be a powerful detector of, and diagnostic for,
outflows caused by massive star formation activity in our galaxy, and in other

individual subsamples from a given survey or publication have significantly
tighter relationships between light curve shape and luminosity than the
relationship derived from the sum of all the samples, pointing to uncorrected
systematic errors in the photometry, mainly in BV filters. Using our method, we
calculate luminosity distances and host galaxy reddening to 89 SNe in the

the Hubble diagram is 0.20 mag, or an error of ~9% in distance to a single SN.

evolution? How do these rare starbursting systems, which contribute

populations? Deep radio observations have been most useful for studying these
systems, but still leave a significant fraction of the population unidentified.
Now with the deep IRAC and MIPS images from the GOODS Spitzer Legacy program
and a re-analysis of the deep radio data, we are able to identify counterparts
for a large fraction of SCUBA galaxies in GOODS-N. All of these counterparts
are detected by Spitzer. Given the vast multi-wavelength data in this field, we
can study the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these systems and
determine what is fueling their intense infrared luminosities. A rest-frame
composite optical-to-radio SED for all spectroscopically identified submm
sources shows that the average SCUBA galaxy is consistent with models of
ultraluminous starburst galaxies, although cooler than those observed locally.
Because of this, the submm flux alone consistently overestimates IR when using
spectral templates which obey the local ULIRG temperature-luminosity relation.
The wide range of 24/850 micron flux ratios as a function of redshift indicates
the presence of strong mid-IR features, to be confirmed with deep IRS
spectroscopy. The IRAC colours of the submm systems provide useful redshift
constraints, since, at these redshifts, IRAC samples the stellar bump. The
Spitzer photometry of this large sample of submm galaxies has allowed us to put
constraints on many of the outstanding issues in submm astronomy.

have been obtained. Particularly for a charged relativistic star, again
following the argument by Wald, the star was shown to gradually accrete charge
until it reached an equilibrium value $\tilde{Q}=2B_{0}J$. This value of the
equilibrium charge seems to be generic as a rotating black hole is known to
accrete exactly the same amount. Although these results are equally relevant to
all species of slowly-rotating relativistic stars, we particularly have the

number of red galaxies in close apparent proximity. We use the Gemini
Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) on Gemini South to obtain optical spectra for
a large fraction of these sources. We show that there is a group of galaxies at
$z\sim0.66$, coincident with a metal-line absorption system seen in the
quasar's optical spectrum. The multiplexing capabilities of GMOS also allow us
to measure redshifts of many foreground galaxies in the field surrounding the
quasar.
  The galaxy group has five confirmed members, and a further four fainter
galaxies are possibly associated. All confirmed members exhibit early-type
galaxy spectra, a rare situation for a Mg II absorbing system. We discuss the
relationship of this group to the absorbing gas, and the possibility of
gravitational lensing of the quasar due to the intervening galaxies.

continuum at 345 GHz with the SMA at an angular resolution of 1.0""x0.7"" (144AU
x 100AU). The continuum emission traces a dust disk with a central depression
and a maximum overall dimension of 450AU (FWHM). This dust disk exhibits
several distinct peaks that appear to coincide with bright features in the
near-IR image, in particular the brightest inner spiral arm. The CO emission
traces a rotating gas disk of size 530AU x 330AU with a deprojected maximum
velocity of 2.8km/s at 450AU. In contrast to the dust disk, the gas disk
exhibits an intensity peak at the stellar position. Furthermore, the CO
emission in several velocity channels traces the innermost spiral arm seen in
the near-IR. We compare the observed spatial-kinematic structure of the CO
emission to a simple model of a disk in Keplerian rotation, and find that only
the emission tracing the main spiral arm clearly lies outside the confines of
our model. This emission has a net outward radial motion compared with the
radial velocity predicted by the model at the location of the main spiral arms.
The disk of AB Aur is therefore quite different from the Keplerian disks seen
around many Herbig Ae stars. The spiral-like structures of the disk with
non-Keplerian motions we revealed in 12CO (3-2), together with the central
depression of the dust disk, may be explained to be driven by the possible
existence of a giant planet forming in the disk.

derive a set of new T_eff--log g--color relations based on synthetic

between the new T_eff--color relations and those available from the literature
are typically well within ~100 K, effective temperatures predicted by the
scales based on synthetic colors tend to be slightly higher than those

  The first, StWr 2-21, belongs to the main body of Sgr. The second, the halo
PN BoBn 1, has a location, distance and velocity in agreement with the leading
tidal tail of Sgr. We estimate that 10 per cent of the Galactic halo consists
of Sgr debris. The specific frequency of PNe indicates a total luminosity of
Sgr, including its tidal tails, of M_V=-14.1. StWr 2-21 shows a high abundance
of [O/H]=-0.23, which confirms the high-metallicity population in Sgr uncovered
by Bonaficio et al. (2004). The steep metallicity--age gradient in Sgr is due
to ISM removal during the Galactic plane passages, ISM reformation due to
stellar mass loss, and possibly accretion of metal-enriched gas from our
Galaxy. The ISM re-formation rate of Sgr, from stellar mass loss, is 5 X 10^-4
M_sun yr^-1, amounting to ~10^6 M_sun per orbital period. HST images reveal
well-developed bipolar morphologies, and provide clear detections of the
central stars. All three stars with deep spectra show WR-lines, suggesting that
the progenitor mass and metallicity determines whether a PN central star
develops a WR spectrum. One Sgr PN belongs to the class of IR-[WC] stars.
Expansion velocities are determined for three nebulae. Comparison with
hydrodynamical models indicates an initial density profile of rho ~ r^-3. This
is evidence for increasing mass-loss rates on the AGB. Peak mass-loss rates are
indicated of ~ 10^-4 M_sun yr^-1. The IR-[WC] PN, He 2-436, provides the sole
direct detection of dust in a dwarf spheroidal galaxy, to date.

medium in galaxies but substantial variations are seen from object to object.
The main source of the emission at a galactic scale is still poorly understood.
Previous studies of the CII emission in galaxies have a resolution of several
kpc or more so the observed emission is an average of different ISM components.
The aim of this work is to study, for the first time, the CII emission at the
scale of a spiral arm. We want to investigate the origin of this line and its
use as a tracer of star formation. We present CII and OI observations of a
segment of a spiral arm of M~31 using the Infrared Space Observatory. The CII
emission is compared with tracers of neutral gas (CO, HI) and star formation
(H\alpha, Spitzer 24 mu.) The similarity of the CII emission with the Ha and 24
mu images is striking when smoothed to the same resolution, whereas the
correlation with the neutral gas is much weaker. The CII cooling rate per H
atom increases dramatically from ~2.7e-26 ergs/s/atom in the border of the map
to ~ 1.4e-25 ergs/s/atom in the regions of star formation. The CII/FIR(42-122)
ratio is almost constant at 2%, a factor 3 higher than typically quoted.
However, we do not believe that M~31 is unusual. Rather, the whole-galaxy
fluxes used for the comparisons include the central regions where the CII/FIR
ratio is known to be lower and the resolved observations neither isolate a
spiral arm nor include data as far out in the galactic disk as the observations
presented here. A fit to published PDR models yields a plausible average
solution of G_0~100 and n~3000 for the PDR emission in the regions of star
formation in the arm of M31.

temperature of a pre-stellar core. We find that the gas temperature of this
object is surprisingly low (~7-8 K), and significantly below the dust
temperature, in the outer layers (Av < 5 mag) that are traced by C18O and 13CO
emission. As shown previously, the inner layers (Av > 5 mag) exhibit
significant freeze-out of CO onto grain surfaces. Because the dust and gas are
not fully coupled, depletion of key coolants in the densest layers raises the
core (gas) temperature, but only by ~1 K. The gas temperature in layers not
traced by C18O and 13CO emission can be probed by NH3 emission, with a
previously estimated temperature of ~10-11 K. To reach these temperatures in
the inner core requires an order of magnitude reduction in the gas to dust
coupling rate. This potentially argues for a lack of small grains in the
densest gas, presumably due to grain coagulation.

this effect is too small for neutralinos, lighter dark matter particle
candidates, e.g. with mass of 1-100 MeV, which was proposed recently to explain

affects mainly the CMB anisotropy at small angular scales (large $\ell$), and
is distinctively different from the effect of early reionization. We perform a
multi-parameter analysis of the CMB data, including the both the WMAP first

that the observed excess of $e^+e^-$ pairs in the galactic center region is

to the model of a junction with a coordinate-dependent Josephson current

correspondence between the classes of Josephson junctions of variable width and
quasi-one-dimensional junctions with a variable thickness of the barrier layer.
It is shown that for a junction of exponentially varying width the barrier
layer of the equivalent quasi-one-dimensional junction has a distributed
resistive inhomogeneity that acts as an attractor for magnetic flux vortices.
The curve of the critical current versus magnetic field for a Josephson
junction with a resistive microinhomogeneity is constructed with the aid of a
numerical simulation, and a comparison is made with the critical curve of a
junction of exponentially varying width. The possibility of replacing a
distributed inhomogeneity in a Josephson junction by a local inhomogeneity at

develop a comprehensive analytical formalism for far-field black hole lensing

lensing observables. We then make the first analysis of wave optics in
braneworld lensing, working in the semi-classical limit. We show that wave
optics offers the only realistic way to observe braneworld effects in black
hole lensing. We point out that if primordial braneworld black holes exist,
have mass M, and contribute a fraction f of the dark matter, then roughly 3e5 x
f (M/1e-18 Msun)^(-1) of them lie within our Solar System. These objects, which
we call ""attolenses,"" would produce interference fringes in the energy spectra
of gamma-ray bursts at energies ~100 (M/1e-18 Msun)^(-1) MeV (which will soon
be accessible with the GLAST satellite). Primordial braneworld black holes
spread throughout the universe could produce similar interference effects; the
probability for ""attolensing"" may be non-negligible. If interference fringes
were observed, the fringe spacing would yield a simple upper limit on M.
Detection of a primordial black hole with M <~ 1e-19 Msun would challenge
general relativity and favor the braneworld model. Further work on lensing
tests of braneworld gravity must proceed into the physical optics regime, which

that the theory is near an Argyres-Douglas-type singularity where a set of
non-local dibaryons becomes massless in conjunction with a set of confining
strings becoming tensionless. The doubly-scaled theory consists of two
decoupled sectors, one whose spectrum and interactions follow the usual large-N
scaling whilst the other has light states of fixed mass in the large-N limit
which subvert the usual large-N scaling and lead to an interacting theory in
the limit. $F$-term properties of this interacting sector can be calculated
using a Dijkgraaf-Vafa matrix model and in this context the double-scaling
limit is precisely the kind investigated in the ""old matrix model'' to describe
two-dimensional gravity coupled to $c<1$ conformal field theories. In
particular, the old matrix model double-scaling limit describes a sector of a
gauge theory with a mass gap and light meson-like composite states, the
approximate Goldstone boson of superconformal invariance, with a mass which is
fixed in the double-scaling limit. Consequently, the gravitational $F$-terms in

forms, which are invariant ones and correspond to conservation laws for
physical fields. Hence, to understand the foundations of field theories and
their unity, one has to know how such closed exterior forms are obtained.
  In the present paper it is shown that closed exterior forms corresponding to
field theories are obtained from the equations modelling conservation
(balance)laws for material media. It has been developed the evolutionary method
that enables one to describe the process of obtaining closed exterior forms.
  The process of obtaining closed exterior forms discloses the mechanism of
evolutionary processes in material media and shows that material media
generate, discretely, the physical structures, from which the physical fields
are formed. This justifies the quantum character of field theories.
  On the other hand, this process demonstrates the connection between field
theories and the equations for material media and points to the fact that the
foundations of field theories must be conditioned by the properties of material
media. It is shown that the external and internal symmetries of field theories
are conditioned by the degrees of freedom of material media. The classification
parameter of physical fields and interactions, that is, the parameter of the
unified field theory, is connected with the number of noncommutative balance
conservation laws for material media.

dynamical nonlinearity, surrogate testing is used in conjunction with
volatility analysis [2-4]. In this brief communication, surrogate testing of
volatility series from long-range correlated noise and their static, invertible
nonlinear transforms is investigated. Long-range correlated monofractal noise
is generated using FARIMA (0, d, 0) with Gaussian and non-Gaussian innovations.
We show significant deviation in the scaling behavior between the empirical

observed in the case of Gaussian innovations. The results encourage cautious
interpretation of surrogate testing in the presence of non-Gaussian

nonlinear forces present in cylindrical lenses. Defocusing between lenses is
greatly reduced by having all of the main electric fields point in the same

us better control of the focusing strength in the two transverse planes and
allowed focusing of the beam to half the image size in both planes. The beam
envelope was calculated for lens voltages selected to produced specific
focusing properties. The calculations, starting from first principles, were

CE phase by down-conversion of the laser light to the terahertz (THz) frequency
range via plasma generation in ambient air, an isotropic medium where optical
rectification (down-conversion) in the forward direction is only possible if
the inversion symmetry is broken by electrical or optical means. We show that
few-cycle pulses directly produce a spatial charge asymmetry in the plasma. The
asymmetry, associated with THz emission, depends on the CE phase, which allows
for a determination of the phase by measurement of the amplitude and polarity
of the THz pulse.

starting site as a reference state, the Terwilliger algebra connected with this
choice turns the graph into the metric space, hence stratifies the graph into a
(d+1) disjoint union of strata, where the amplitudes of observing the
continuous-time quantum walk on all sites belonging to a given stratum are the
same. In graphs of association schemes with known spectrum, the transition
amplitudes and average probabilities are given in terms of dual eigenvalues of
association schemes. As most of association schemes arise from finite groups,
hence the continuous-time walk on generic group association schemes have been
studied in great details, where the transition amplitudes are given in terms of
characters of groups. Further investigated examples are the walk on graphs of
association schemes of symmetric $S_n$, Dihedral $D_{2m}$ and cyclic groups.
