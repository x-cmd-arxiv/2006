  (Wavelet based hIgh resolution Fitting of Internal Templates)","Submitted to ApJ","Astrophys.J.648:784-796,2006","10.1086/506015",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a new approach to foreground removal for Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) maps. Rather than relying on prior knowledge about the
foreground components, we first extract the necessary information about them
directly from the microwave sky maps by taking differences of temperature maps
at different frequencies. These difference maps, which we refer to as internal
templates, consist only of linear combinations of galactic foregrounds and
noise, with no CMB component. We obtain the foreground cleaned maps by fitting
these internal templates to, and subsequently subtracting the appropriately
scaled contributions of them from, the CMB dominated channels. The fitting
operation is performed in wavelet space, making the analysis feasible at high
resolution with only a minor loss of precision. Applying this procedure to the
WMAP data, we obtain a power spectrum that matches the spectrum obtained by the
WMAP team at the signal dominated scales. Finally, we have revisited previous
claims about a north-south power asymmetry on large angular scales, and confirm
that these remain unchanged with this completely different approach to
foreground separation. This also holds when fitting the foreground contribution
independently to the northern and southern hemisphere indicating that the
asymmetry is unlikely to have its origin in different foreground properties of
the hemispheres. This conclusion is further strengthened by the lack of any
observed frequency dependence.

Chandra observation had a duration of ~30 ks, with a separation of ~50 ks. The
spectrum was observed to harden between these observations via a scaling down
of the soft-band flux. The inter-observation variability is in a different
sense to the observed variability within each observation and is most likely
the result of increased absorption. Spectral variations were seen during the
first observation suggesting that the X-ray emission is produced in more than
one disconnected region. We have also re-analyzed a ~17 ks Chandra observation
conducted in 2000. During the three Chandra observations the 2-10 keV flux is
about a factor of 2 lower than seen during an XMM-Newton observation conducted
in 2003. Moreover, the fractional variability amplitude exhibited during the
XMM-Newton observation is significantly softer than seen during the Chandra
observations. A power-spectral analysis of the first of the two new Chandra
observations revealed a peak at 341s with a formal detection significance of
99%. A similar peak was seen previously in the 2000 Chandra data. However, the
detection of this feature is tentative given that it was found in neither the

much narrower than expected. The Hubble Space Telescope observation was

these ``optically--dull'' AGN are no more than 6 times fainter than their host

overwhelmed by stellar continuum in at least half the sample. We find that
optically--dull AGN have the mid--infrared emission and L(x)/L(IR) ratios

extranuclear dust in the host galaxy plays an important role in hiding the

eleven making this the second largest collection of these objects in an open

the initial mass function of Praesepe being Salpeter in form. Furthermore, it
suggests that the bulk of Praesepe white dwarfs did not gain a substantial
recoil kick velocity from possible asymmetries in their loss of mass during the
asymptotic giant branch phase of evolution. By comparing our estimates of the
effective temperatures and the surface gravities of WD0833+194, WD0840+190,
WD0840+205 and WD0843+184 to modern theoretical evolutionary tracks we have
derived their masses to be in the range 0.72-0.76Msun and their cooling ages

masses are between 3.3-3.5Msun. Examining these new data in the context of the

range 2.7Msun to 6Msun. Assuming an extrapolation of this relation to larger
initial masses is valid and adopting a maximum white dwarf mass of 1.3Msun, our
results support a minimum mass for core-collapse supernovae progenitors in the

indirect methods (isochrone fitting and integrated spectra) of metallicity
determination lead to values of [Fe/H] which are 0.3 to 0.5 dex too high, and
that this is primarily due to the underlying reference calibration typically
used by these studies. We show that Cluster 1, with [Fe /H] = -2.5, now holds
the record for the lowest metallicity globular cluster. We also measure an
over-abundance of Eu in Cluster 3 stars that has only been previously detected
in a subgroup of stars in M15. We find that the Fornax globular cluster
properties are a global match to what is found in their Galactic counterparts;
including deep mixing abundance patterns in two stars. We conclude that at the

area infrared surveys are expected to identify enough BDs covering wide enough
mass--age ranges to potentially measure the mass function down to ~0.03Mo, and
the BD formation history out to 10 Gyr, at a level capable of establishing if
BD formation follows star formation. We suggest these capabilities are best
realised by spectroscopic calibration of BD properties (Teff, g and [M/H])
which, when combined with a measured luminosity and an evolutionary model can
give BD mass and age relatively independent of BD atmosphere models. Such
calibration requires an empirical understanding of how BD spectra are affected
by variations in these properties, and thus the identification and study of
""benchmark BDs"" whose age and composition can be established independently. We
identify the best sources of benchmark BDs as young open cluster members,
moving group members, and wide (>1000AU) BD companions to both subgiant stars
and high mass white dwarfs (WDs). We have used 2MASS to measure a wide L dwarf
companion fraction of 2.7(+0.7/-0.5)%, which equates to a BD companion fraction
of 34(+9/-6)% for an alpha~1 companion mass function. Using this value we
simulate populations of wide BD binaries, and estimate that 80(+21/-14)
subgiant--BD binaries, and 50(+13/-10) benchmark WD--BD binaries could be
identified using current and new facilities. The WD--BD binaries should all be
identifiable using the Large Area Survey component of UKIDSS combined with
Sloan. Discovery of the subgiant--BD binaries will require a NIR imaging

massive black holes (MBHs) will be observable to cosmological distances. While
a CR spirals in, 2-body scattering by field stars may cause it to fall into the
MBH before reaching a short period orbit that would give an observable signal.
As a result, only CRs very near (~0.01 pc) the MBH can spiral in successfully.
In a multi-mass stellar population, the heaviest objects sink to the center,
where they are more likely to slowly spiral into the MBH without being
swallowed prematurely. We study how mass-segregation modifies the stellar
distribution and the rate of GW events. We find that the inspiral rate per
galaxy for white dwarfs is 30 per Gyr, for neutron stars 6 per Gyr, and for
stellar black holes (SBHs) 250 per Gyr. The high rate for SBHs is due to their
extremely steep density profile, n_{BH}(r)\propto r^{-2}. The GW detection rate
will be dominated by SBHs.

hole of M31 has been interpreted as a 200 Myr starburst. The formation of a
population of young stars in close proximity to a massive black hole presents a
difficult challenge to star formation theory. We point out that in a high
stellar density environment, the course of stellar evolution is modified by
frequent collisions and mergers. METHODS: Blue stragglers, which are the
results of mergers in globular clusters, occupy the same position in the
color-magnitude diagram as the observed hot stars in M31. For confirmation, the
integrated spectrum of P3 is shown to be compatible with the spectral energy
distribution of a blue horizontal branch field star. RESULTS: We suggest an old
stellar population of evolved blue horizontal-branch stars and of merger
products cannot be ruled out on the basis of the available data. Observations
are suggested that would help distinguish between a ``young'' and ``old''
stellar population interpretation of the observations.

by a single effective temperature and surface gravity. Our measurements, when
compared to synthetic visibilities and synthetic spectrophotometry from a
Roche-von Zeipel gravity-darkened model atmosphere, provide strong evidence for
the model of Vega as a rapidly rotating star viewed very nearly pole-on. Our
best fitting model indicates that Vega is rotating at ~91% of its angular
break-up rate with an equatorial velocity of 275 km/s. Together with the
measured vsin(i), this velocity yields an inclination for the rotation axis of
5 degrees. For this model the pole-to-equator effective temperature difference
is 2250 K, a value much larger than previously derived from spectral line
analyses. The derived equatorial T_eff of 7900 K indicates Vega's equatorial
atmosphere may be convective and provides a possible explanation for the
discrepancy. The model has a luminosity of ~37 Lsun, a value 35% lower than
Vega's apparent luminosity based on its bolometric flux and parallax, assuming
a slowly rotating star. The model luminosity is consistent with the mean
absolute magnitude of A0V stars. Our model predicts the spectral energy
distribution of Vega as viewed from its equatorial plane; a model which may be
employed in radiative models for the surrounding debris disk.

depend on local physical conditions -- and not just on metallicity. The
observed relationships between the column density of CH and those of CN, CH+,
Na I, and K I in the MC are generally consistent with the trends observed in
our Galaxy. Using existing data for the rotational populations of H2, we
estimate temperatures, radiation field strengths, and local hydrogen densities
for the diffuse molecular gas. Densities estimated from N(CH), assuming that CH

better agreement is found by assuming that the CH is made via the (still

to correlate with the physical properties of their hosts, including the mass of
the dark-matter halo. Using these clues as a starting point many studies have
produced models that can explain phenomena like the quasar luminosity function.
The shortcoming of this approach is that working models are not unique, and as
a result it is not always clear what input physics is being constrained. Here
we take a different approach. We identify critical parameters that describe the
evolution of SMBHs at high redshift, and constrain their parameter space based
on observations of high redshift quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We
find that the luminosity function taken in isolation is somewhat limited in its
ability to constrain SMBH evolution due to some strong degeneracies. This
explains the presence in the literature of a range of equally successful models
based on different physical hypotheses. Including the constraint of the local
SMBH to halo mass ratio breaks some of the degeneracies, and our results
suggest halo masses at z~4.8 of 10^{12.5+/-0.3}M_solar (with 90% confidence),
with a SMBH to halo mass ratio that decreases with time (>99%). We also find a
quasar luminosity to halo mass ratio that increases with halo mass (>99%).
These features need to be incorporated in all successful models of SMBH
evolution. On the other hand current observations do not permit any conclusions
regarding the evolution of quasar lifetime, or the SMBH occupation fraction in
dark matter halos.

HD187085 has a Jupiter-mass companion with a ~1000d orbit. Our formal `best
fit' solution suggests an eccentricity of 0.47, however, it does not sample the
periastron passage of the companion and we find that orbital solutions with
eccentricities between 0.1 and 0.8 give only slightly poorer fits (based on RMS

in 2007 June should allow for the reliable determination of the orbital
eccentricity for the companion to HD187085. Our dataset for HD20782 does sample
periastron and so the orbit for its companion can be more reliably determined.

theory. A momentum method for the formation of dirty dust grains (nucleation,
growth, evaporation, drift) is used in application to a static brown dwarf
atmosphere structure to compute the dust grain properties, in particular the
heterogeneous grain composition and the grain size. Effective medium and Mie
theory are used to compute the extinction of these spherical grains. Dust
formation results in grains whose composition differs from that of grains
formed at equilibrium. Our kinetic model predicts that solid amorphous SiO2[s]

  MgSiO4[s] and MgSiO3[s], while SiO2[s] is absent in equilibrium models
because it is a metastable solid. Solid amorphous SiO2[s] possesses a strong
broad absorption feature centered at 8.7mum, while amorphous
Mg2SiO4[s]/MgSiO3[s] absorb at 9.7mum beside other absorption features at
longer wavelength. Those features at lambda < 15mum are detectable in
absorption if grains are small (radius < 0.2mum) in the upper atmosphere as
suggested by our model. We suggest that the detection of a feature at 8.7mum in

is based on i) the assumption of ""elementary"" particle sub-constituents on
several levels below the presently known, inspired by Glashow's ""blooming
desert"", ii) the existence of nearly scale-invariant density fluctuations in
the early universe, e.g. as predicted by inflationary models, iii) our own
previous theoretical work showing that a class of objects considerably more
compact than previously thought possible in astrophysics can exist. We also
give several independent arguments strongly pointing towards the non-existence
of black holes. Some brief suggestions on observational signals due to the
hierarchy, both in collected astronomical data and in possible future
observations, concludes the paper.

as due to emission from the hot plasma ""cocoon"" associated with the jet, which
expands relativistically after the jet has broken through the stellar envelope,
if a substantial fraction of the coccon kinetic energy is dissipated at
scattering optical depths \tau_T ~ 10^2-10^3. This results in the bulk of the
coccon photons being observed at X-ray energies, after a delay of few hundreds
of seconds relative to the gamma-ray photons from the jet. Multiple Compton
scattering inside the cocoon causes a spread in the arrival times of the X-ray
photons. We calculate numerically the observed light curve of photons emerging
from the cocoon, and show that it exhibits a steep decay, which resembles that
observed in many GRB afterglows. During the adiabatic expansion that follows
the dissipation phase, photons lose energy to the expanding plasma, and as a
result, the emerging photon energy distribution differs from a black-body
spectrum, and can be approximated as a power law in the Swift XRT band.
Comparison of the numerical results with the Swift XRT data of GRB050315 and
GRB050421 shows good agreement between the light curves and spectra during the

``core'' and ``power-law'' galaxies, on the basis of the nuclear slope of their
brightness profiles. We used HST and Chandra data to isolate their nuclear
emission to study the multiwavelength behaviour of their nuclei. The properties
of the nuclei hosted by the 29 core galaxies were presented in Paper II. Core
galaxies invariably host a radio-loud nucleus, with a median radio-loudness of
Log R = 3.6 and an X-ray based radio loudness parameter of Log R,X = -1.3. Here
we discuss the properties of the nuclei of the 22 ``power-law'' galaxies. They
show a substantial excess of optical and X-ray emission with respect to core
galaxies at the same level of radio luminosity. Conversely, their
radio-loudness parameters, Log R ~ 1.6 and Log R,X ~ -3.3, are similar to those
measured in Seyfert galaxies. Thus the radio-loudness of AGN hosted by
early-type galaxies appears to be univocally related to the host's brightness
profile: radio-loud AGN are only hosted by core galaxies, while radio-quiet AGN
are found only in power-law galaxies. The brightness profile is determined by
the galaxy's evolution, through its merger history; our results suggest that
the same process sets the AGN flavour.

dwarf rotational period. The spin pulse is strongly energy dependent. Weak

Simultaneous UV and optical photometry shows that the spin pulse is anti-phased

the complexity of the X-ray emission, being composed of a soft 50eV black--body
component and two optically thin emission components at 0.2keV and 11keV
strongly absorbed by dense material with an equivalent hydrogen column density
of 10**(23)cm**(-2) partially (50%) covering the X-ray source. The complex
X-ray and UV/optical temporal behaviour indicates that accretion occurs
predominantly (80%) via a disc with a partial contribution (20%) directly from
the stream. The main accreting pole dominates at high energies whilst the
secondary pole mainly contributes in the soft X-rays and at lower energies. The
bolometric flux ratio of the soft-to-hard X-ray emissions is found to be
consistent with the prediction of the standard accretion shock model. We find
the white dwarf in UU Col accretes at a low rate and possesses a low magnetic

present here a map in the CO(2-1) rotational line of the cold molecular gas
associated with some Halpha filaments surrounding the central galaxy of the
Perseus cluster: NGC 1275. The map, extending to about 50 kpc (135 arcsec) from
the center of the galaxy, has been made with the 18-receiver array HERA, at the
focus of the IRAM 30m telescope. Although most of the cold gas is concentrated
to the center of the galaxy, the CO emission is also clearly associated to the
extended filaments conspicuous in ionised gas and could trace a possible
reservoir fueling the star formation there. Some of the CO emission is also
found where the X-ray gas could cool down more efficiently: at the rims of the
central X-ray cavity (where the hot gas is thought to have been pushed out and
compressed by the central AGN expanding radio lobes). The CO global kinematics
does not show any rotation in NGC 1275. The cold gas is probably a mixture of
gas falling down on the central galaxy and of uplifted gas dragged out by a
rising bubble in the intracluster medium. As recenlty suggested in other

simulations of the well-known Lebwohl-Lasher (LL) model. As the I-N transition
temperature is approached from the isotropic side, we find that the decay of
the orientational time correlation functions (OTCF) slows down noticeably,
giving rise to a power law decay at intermediate timescales. The angular
velocity time correlation function also exhibits a rather pronounced power law
decay near the I-N boundary. In the mean squared angular displacement at
comparable timescales, we observe the emergence of a \emph{subdiffusive regime}
which is followed by a \emph{superdiffusive regime} before the onset of the
long-time diffusive behavior. We observe signature of dynamical heterogeneity
through \emph{pronounced non-Gaussian behavior in orientational motion}
particularly at lower temperatures. This behavior closely resembles what is
usually observed in supercooled liquids. We obtain the free energy as a
function of orientational order parameter by the use of transition matrix Monte
Carlo method. The free energy surface is flat for the system considered here
and the barrier between isotropic and nematic phases is vanishingly small for
this weakly first-order phase transition, hence allowing large scale,
collective and correlated orientational density fluctuations. This might be
responsible for the observed power law decay of the OTCFs.

  less tentative discussion in several places; corresponds to published version","Phys.Rev. D73 (2006) 114503","10.1103/PhysRevD.73.114503",,"hep-lat",,"  Staggered chiral perturbation theory (schpt) takes into account the
""fourth-root trick"" for reducing unwanted (taste) degrees of freedom with
staggered quarks by multiplying the contribution of each sea quark loop by a
factor of 1/4. In the special case of four staggered fields (four flavors,
nF=4), I show here that certain assumptions about analyticity and phase
structure imply the validity of this procedure for representing the rooting
trick in the chiral sector. I start from the observation that, when the four
flavors are degenerate, the fourth root simply reduces nF=4 to nF=1. One can
then treat nondegenerate quark masses by expanding around the degenerate limit.
With additional assumptions on decoupling, the result can be extended to the
more interesting cases of nF=3, 2, or 1. A apparent paradox associated with the
one-flavor case is resolved. Coupled with some expected features of unrooted
staggered quarks in the continuum limit, in particular the restoration of taste
symmetry, schpt then implies that the fourth-root trick induces no problems
(for example, a violation of unitarity that persists in the continuum limit) in
the lowest energy sector of staggered lattice QCD. It also says that the theory
with staggered valence quarks and rooted staggered sea quarks behaves like a
simple, partially-quenched theory, not like a ""mixed"" theory in which sea and
valence quarks have different lattice actions. In most cases, the assumptions
made in this paper are not only sufficient but also necessary for the validity
of schpt, so that a variety of possible new routes for testing this validity
are opened.

decay. With the help of the CP-tag we compute all possible intensities and
asymmetries which concern flavour-specific and CP Golden Plate decays. Our
proposed observables are a new self-consistency check for the Standard Model,
as well as a new exploration for the traces of the discrete symmetries in the

  In the second set of results we study CPT violation in the initial state of
the B-factories through the loss of indistinguishability of $B^0$ and $\bar
B^0$. We show that, if the consequence of Bose statistic is relaxed, then the
equal-sign dilepton events are considerably modified. We analyze the demise of
flavour tagging and we also prove that the equal-sign charge asymmetry,
$A_{sl}$, is an optimal observable where to look for this new CPT violation
effect. The detailed study of this asymmetry allows us to predict different
behaviours according to the possible values of the CPT violating parameter
$\w$. We conclude that the best observable where to find traces of this novel
kind of CPT violation is the analysis of $A_{sl}$ at small $\Dt$'s. We use

show that this conjecture is false, but in an interesting way. There are no
cases where tunneling amplitudes are discontinuous at vanishing cosmological
constant; rather, the space of potentials separates into two regions. In one
region decay is strongly suppressed, and the proposed picture of eternal
inflation remains viable; sending the (false) vacuum energy to zero in this

coordinates and the corresponding expansion of the metric, and then study
various aspects of the higher order corrections to the Penrose limit. In
particular, we observe that in general the first-order corrected metric is such
that it admits a light-cone gauge description in string theory. We also
establish a formal analogue of the Weyl tensor peeling theorem for the Penrose
limit expansion in any dimension, and we give a simple derivation of the
leading (quadratic) corrections to the Penrose limit of AdS_5 x S^5.

provides an alternative framework in which to study uncertain interconnections

when compared with traditional Lyapunov analysis. Contraction-based methods are
particularly useful for analyzing systems with uncertain parameters and for
proving synchronization properties of nonlinear oscillators. Existence of a
contraction metric for a given system is a necessary and sufficient condition
for global exponential convergence of system trajectories. For systems with
polynomial or rational dynamics, the search for contraction metrics can be made
fully algorithmic through the use of convex optimization and sum of squares
(SOS) programming. The search process is made computationally tractable by
relaxing matrix definiteness constraints, whose feasibility indicate existence
of a contraction metric, into SOS constraints on polynomial matrices. We
illustrate the results through examples from the literature, emphasizing the
advantages and contrasting the differences between the contraction approach and
traditional Lyapunov techniques.

the local structure of the deformation space of discontinuous groups, we
introduce the concepts from a group theoretic perspective, and focus on
`stability' and `local rigidity' of discontinuous groups.
  As a test case, we give an explicit description of the deformation space of
Z^k acting properly discontinuously on R^{k+1} by affine nilpotent

Amer. Math. Soc.,",,"RIMS-1537","math.DG math.RT",,"  This article gives an up-to-date account of the theory of discrete group
actions on non-Riemannian homogeneous spaces.
  As an introduction of the motifs of this article, we begin by reviewing the
current knowledge of possible global forms of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds with
constant curvatures, and discuss what kind of problems we propose to pursue.
  For pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, isometric actions of discrete groups are not
always properly discontinuous. The fundamental problem is to understand when
discrete subgroups of Lie groups $G$ act properly discontinuously on
homogeneous spaces $G/H$ for non-compact $H$. For this, we introduce the
concepts from a group-theoretic perspective, including the `discontinuous dual'
of $G/H$ that recovers $H$ in a sense.
  We then summarize recent results giving criteria for the existence of
properly discontinuous subgroups, and the known results and conjectures on the
existence of cocompact ones. The final section discusses the deformation theory
and in particular rigidity results for cocompact properly discontinuous groups
for pseudo-Riemannian symmetric spaces.

one-dimensional $q$-state Potts model at zero temperature), though in later
sections we widen our scope to general ``$H$-colorings'' of arbitrary graphs
$G$. Existing theoretical analyses of the mixing time of such simulations
relate mainly to a dynamics in which a random vertex is selected for updating
at each step. However, experimental work is often carried out using systematic
strategies that cycle through coordinates in a deterministic manner, a dynamics
sometimes known as systematic scan. The mixing time of systematic scan seems
more difficult to analyze than that of random updates, and little is currently
known. In this article we go some way toward correcting this imbalance. By
adapting a variety of techniques, we derive upper and lower bounds (often
tight) on the mixing time of systematic scan. An unusual feature of systematic
scan as far as the analysis is concerned is that it fails to be time
reversible.

holds for any function $F$ dominated by $W$:
\[\phi_n\to\phi:=\pi(F),\qquad{a.s.}, n\to\infty.\] 2. The lower error
probability defined by $\mathsf {P}\{\phi_n\le c\}$, for $c<\phi$, $n\ge1$,
satisfies a large deviation limit theorem when the function $F$ satisfies a
monotonicity condition. Under additional minor conditions an exact large
deviations expansion is obtained. 3. If $W$ is near-monotone, then
control-variates are constructed based on the Lyapunov function $V$, providing
a pair of estimators that together satisfy nontrivial large asymptotics for the

it is shown that exact large deviation asymptotics are possible even when the

asymptotic normality for both the patient allocation and the estimators of
unknown parameters, under some widely satisfied conditions. These properties
are important for statistical inferences and they are also useful for the
understanding of the urn limiting process. A superior feature of our proposed
model is its capability to yield limiting treatment proportions according to
any desired allocation target. The applicability of our model is illustrated

That is, each site of the $d$-dimensional integer lattice is occupied by a
cluster of individuals; each individual can be healthy or infected. The
evolution of the disease depends on three parameters, namely the outside
infection rate which models the interactions between the clusters, the within
infection rate which takes into account the repeated contacts between
individuals in the same cluster, and the size of each social cluster. For the
first model, we assume cluster recoveries, while individual recoveries are
assumed for the second one. The aim is to investigate the existence of
nontrivial stationary distributions for both processes depending on the value
of each of the three parameters. Our results show that the probability of an
epidemic strongly depends on the recovery mechanism.

scaled as $k^{-2+\eta}$. The restrictions given by nonzero helicity on the
regions with stable fixed points which correspond to the scaling regimes are
analyzed in detail. The dependence of the effective diffusivity on the helicity
parameter is discussed. The anomalous exponents of the structure functions of
the passive scalar field which define their anomalous scaling are calculated
and it is shown that although the separate composite operators which define
them strongly depend on the helicity parameter the resulting two-loop
contributions to the critical dimensions of the structure functions are
independent of helicity. Details of calculations are shown.

the symmetry-restoring fluctuation (SRF) for the pairing phenomena in finite
fermionic systems, distinctively from those of additional quantum fluctuations.
It is shown by numerical calculations that the phase transition is compatible
with the conservation in this theory, and that the SRF shifts up the critical
temperature ($T^\mathrm{cr}$). This shift of $T^\mathrm{cr}$ occurs due to
reduction of degrees-of-freedom in canonical ensembles, and decreases only
slowly as the particle-number increases (or as the level spacing narrows), in
contrast to the conventional BCS theory.

ground states and dynamically evolving states of quantum spin chains: we show
that the geometric entropy of a distinguished block saturates, and hence
follows an entanglement-boundary law. These results apply to any ground state
of a gapped model resulting from dynamics generated by a local hamiltonian, as
well as, dually, to states that are generated via a sudden quench of an
interaction as recently studied in the case of dynamics of quantum phase
transitions. We achieve these results by exploiting ideas from quantum
information theory and making use of the powerful tools provided by
Lieb-Robinson bounds. We also show that there exist noncritical fermionic
systems and equivalent spin chains with rapidly decaying interactions whose
geometric entropy scales logarithmically with block length. Implications for
the classical simulatability are outlined.

from a simple, self-evident principle: an experimentalist's estimate of the
quantum state generated by an apparatus should be constrained by honesty. A
skeptical observer should subject the estimate to a test that guarantees that a
self-interested experimentalist will report the true state as accurately as
possible. We also find a non-asymptotic, operational interpretation of the
quantum relative entropy function.

relative to the original linked-state method, is achieved. The proposed method
is applicable to Nielsen's optical ``cluster-state'' approach as well.
