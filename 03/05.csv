the likelihood function for linear polarization measurements and use it to
create confidence regions and upper limits. This is accomplished by integrating
the likelihood function over the true polarization (parameter space), rather
than the measured polarization (data space). These regions are valid for both
low and high signal-to-noise measurements.

preserving a macroscopically chiral phase in a system with no molecular

imprinting efficiency depends on the balance between the elastics constants and
twisting power at network formation. One spectacular property of phase
chirality imprinting is the created ability of the network to adsorb
preferentially one stereo-component from a racemic mixture. In this paper we
explore this property of chirality transfer from a macroscopic to the molecular
scale. In particular, we focus on the competition between the phase chirality
and the local nematic order. We demonstrate that it is possible to control the
subsequent release of chiral solvent component from the imprinting network and
the reversibility of the stereo-selective swelling by racemic solvents.

  welcomed",,,,"physics.med-ph cond-mat.dis-nn",,"  The current article shows how concepts from the areas of random walks, Markov
chains, complex networks and image analysis can be naturally combined in order
to provide a unified and biologically plausible model relating saliency and
visual attention. Two types of models are proposed: (i) images are converted
into complex networks by considering pixels as nodes while connections are
established in terms of fields of influence defined by visual features such as
tangent fields induced by gray-level contrasts and distance; and (ii) image
pixels exhibiting particularly distinctive values of visual properties such as
gray-level intensity, contrast, size of objects, orientation and texture are
mapped into nodes and the weights of links are defined in order to favor
transitions between regions with similar or different visual features, also
taking the distance between the nodes into account. Preferential random walks
are performed on such networks in order to emulate attentional shifts and eye
movements, and the saliency of each region is obtained in terms of the
frequency of visits to each node at equilibrium. In the case of the first
model, there is a definite tendency to emphasize not only high curvature points
but also convergences of the tangent field. The frequency of visits is found to
be strongly correlated with the node degrees (strengths) for this model.
Different results have been obtained for the second model as a consequence of
the directed and asymmetric nature of the respectively obtained networks.

amplitude fluctuations - varies regularly in time, with these variations being
similar for processes of any nature, from biochemical reactions to noise in the
gravitational antenna and all types of the radioactive decay. In particular, we
have revealed basic laws, suggesting a cosmo-physical nature of these
phenomena, in the time series created by the noise generators of the global GCP
net. On the basis of all the results obtained, a conclusion has been made that
the histogram form is determined by fluctuations of the spacetime, which depend
on the movement of the measured system (laboratory) relative to the heavenly
bodies. An important step to understand the nature of these phenomena was the
finding that at the moments of the new Moon, a specific histogram form appears
practically simultaneously at different geographical points, from Arctic to
Antarctic, in middle latitudes of West and East hemispheres. This effect seems
to be not due to a change of the tide-generating forces; to explain it,
nontrivial hypotheses are needed. The present paper shows the appearance of
specific histogram forms at the culminations of the solar eclipses (moments of
the geocentric superposition of the Sun and the Moon), with the eclipse forms
differing from the new-moon ones. Specific histogram forms appear practically
simultaneously all over the Earth and depend nor on the geographical
coordinates, nor on the nature of the process studied.

pathological tremor velocity is studied on the basis of the statistical theory
of discrete non-Markov stochastic processes and flicker-noise spectroscopy. We
have developed a new method of analyzing and diagnosing Parkinson's disease
(PD) by taking into consideration discreteness, fluctuations, long- and
short-range correlations, regular and stochastic behavior, Markov and
non-Markov effects and dynamic alternation of relaxation modes in the initial
time signals. The spectrum of the statistical non-Markovity parameter reflects
Markovity and non-Markovity in the initial time series of tremor. The
relaxation and kinetic parameters used in the method allow us to estimate the
relaxation scales of diverse scenarios of the time signals produced by the
patient in various dynamic states. The local time behavior of the initial time
correlation function and the first point of the non-Markovity parameter give
detailed information about the variation of pathological tremor in the local
regions of the time series. The obtained results can be used to find the most
effective method of reducing or suppressing pathological tremor in each
individual case of a PD patient. Generally, the method allows one to assess the
efficacy of the medical treatment for a group of PD patients.

radiative and Auger vacancy decay of an endohedral atom A@C60. The
collectivized electrons of the C60 shell add new possibilities for radiative

final state vacancies almost always belong to different subshells. It is shown
that the smallness of the atomic shell radii as compared to that of the
fullerenes shell provides an opportunity to derive the simple formulas for the
probabilities of the electron transitions. It is shown that the radiative and
Auger (or Koster-Kronig) widths of a vacancy decay due to electron transition
in the atom A in A@C60 acquire an additional factors that can be expressed via
the polarizability of the C60 at transition energy. It is demonstrated that due
to opening of the non-radiative decay channel for vacancies in subvalent
subshells the decay probability increases by five -- six orders of magnitude.
