measured in deep seawater of a marine region located in the Southern Ionian

  Journal","Astrophys.J. 645 (2006) 1448-1463","10.1086/504585",,"astro-ph",,"  In the light of the recent results of the stellar interferometry, we examine
the nature of the extra molecular layer outside the photosphere of red super-
giant stars, so far studied mostly with the use of the infrared spectra.
Although the visibility data are more direct probes of the spatial structure of
the outer atmosphere, it is essential that they are analyzed in combination
with the spectral data of a wide spectral coverage. In the case of the M2
supergiant mu Cephei, several sets of data, both spectra and visibilities,
strongly suggested the presence of an extra-molecular layer, and its basic
parameters are estimated to be: excitation temperature T_ex = 1600 K, column
densities of CO and H2O N_col = 3.0d+20/cm2, and inner radius R_in = 2.0R*. The
result shows reasonable agreement with the one based on the infrared spectra
alone, and this may be because the infrared spectra already include some
information on the spatial structure of the outer atmosphere. It is important,
however, that the model inferred from the spectra is now fully supported with
the recent visibility data. In the case of the M2 supergiant alpha Orionis, the
infrared spectra and visibilities show a consistent picture in that its
molecular layer is closer to the photosphere (R_in = 1.3R*) with higher gas
temperature (T_ex = 2250 K) and lower gas column density (N_col = 1.0d+20/cm2),
compared with that of mu Cephei. Some controversy on the interpretation of the
mid infrared data of alpha Orionis can be reconciled.

distribution of galactic systems in hierarchical clustering scenarios using the
disc-bulge structural parameters and their dynamical properties to quantify
them. We focus on the analysis of the Fundamental Mass Plane relation, finding
that secular evolution phases contribute significantly to the determination of
a plane with a slope in agreement to that of the observed luminosity relation.
In these simulations, secular phases are responsible for the formation of
compact stellar bulges with the correct structural parameter combination. We
also test that the relations among these parameters agree with observations.
Taking into account these results, the hierarchical growth of the structure
predicts a bulge formation scenario for typical field spiral galaxies where
secular evolution during dissipate mergers plays a fundamental role.
Conversely, subsequent mergers can help to enlarge the bulges but do not seem
to strongly modify their fundamental mass relations. Systems get to the local
mass relations at different stages of evolution (i.e. different redshifts) so
that their formation histories introduce a natural scatter in the relations.
Our results suggest that the formation mechanisms of the bulge and disc
components, satisfying their corresponding fundamental mass relations, might be
coupled and that secular evolution could be the possible connecting process.

sufficiently massive monopole the system develops an extremal magnetic
Reissner-Nordstrom quasi-horizon. These solutions, called quasi-black holes,
although non-singular, are arbitrarily close to having a horizon. However, at
the critical value the quasi-black hole turns into a degenerate spacetime. On
the other hand, for a high Higgs mass, a sufficiently massive monopole develops
also a quasi-black hole, but it turns into an extremal true horizon, with
matter fields outside. One can also put a small Schwarzschild black hole inside
the magnetic monopole, an example of a non-Abelian black hole. Surprisingly,
Majumdar-Papapetrou systems, Abelian systems constructed from extremal dust,
also show a resembling behavior. Previously, we have reported that one can find
Majumdar-Papapetrou solutions which can be arbitrarily close of being a black
hole, displaying quasi-black hole behavior. With the aim of better

increases from zero as the effective potential has negative larger curvature at

  We show that at the critical temperature $T=T_1$, TdS with hyperbolic

  Hawking-Page transition from the zero mass de Sitter space to TdS. It is also
shown that there is no Hawking-Page transition for TdS with Ricci-flat and
spherical horizons, when the zero mass de Sitter space is taken as the thermal
background. Also we find that the SdS undergoes a different phase transition at
T=0 which the Nariai black hole is formed. Finally we connect our results to

$\Rey$, whose character depends on the fluid response, as opposed to the
Grashof number, whose character depends on the forcing. $\Rey$ is defined as
$\Rey = U\ell/\nu$ where $U$ is a bounded spatio-temporally averaged
Navier-Stokes velocity field and $\ell$ the characteristic scale of the
forcing. It is found that the inverse Kolmogorov length is estimated by
$\ell\lambda_{k}^{-1} \leq c (\ell/\alpha)^{1/4}\Rey^{5/8}$. Moreover, the

on the first member of the hierarchy $\left<\kappa_{1,0}^2\right>$ coincides
with the inverse squared Taylor micro-scale to within log-corrections.

for many of the interesting peaks. We find that low-energy strength increases
with N in all multipoles, but with distinctive features in each. The low-lying
0+ strength near the neutron at large N barely involves protons at all, with
the strength coming primarily from a single two-quasineutron configuration with

integrating a priori knowledge of the gene networks could help in the

algorithms of expression profiles, resulting in classifiers with biological

analyzed. Each particle in the box behaves like an independent entity
represented by a {\it macro-orbital} (a kind of pair waveform). While the
expectation value of their interaction, $<V_{HC}(x)>$, vanishes for every state
of two particles, the expectation value of their relative separation, $<x>$,
satisfies $<x> \ge \lambda/2$ (or $q \ge \pi/d$, with $2d = L$ being the size
of the box). The particles in their ground state define a close-packed
arrangement of their wave packets (with $<x> = \lambda/2$, phase position
separation $\Delta\phi = 2\pi$ and momentum $|q_o| = \pi/d$) and experience a
mutual repulsive force ({\it zero point repulsion}) $f_o = h^2/2md^3$ which
also tries to expand the box. While the relative dynamics of two particles in
their excited states represents usual collisional motion, the same in their
ground state becomes collisionless. These results have great significance in
determining the correct microscopic understanding of widely different many body
systems.

in which Eve exploits the action of gravitation to infer information about the
quantum-mechanical state of the qubit exchanged between Alice and Bob, is
described. It is demonstrated that the known laws of physics do not allow to
describe the attack. Without making assumptions that are not based on broad
consensus, the laws of quantum gravity, unknown up to now, would be needed even
for an approximate treatment. Therefore, it is currently not possible to
predict with any confidence if information gained in this attack will allow to
break BB84. Contrary to previous belief, a proof of the perfect security of
BB84 cannot be based on the assumption that the known laws of physics are
strictly correct, yet.

quantum secret sharing protocol based on Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs and
entanglement swapping. The present quantum secure direct communication protocol
makes use of the ideal of block transmission. We also point out that the sender
can encode his or her secret message without ensuring the security of the
quantum channel firstly. In the multiparty quantum secret sharing protocol, the
communication parties adopt checking mode or encoding mode with a certain
probability. It is not necessary for the protocol to perform local unitary
operation. In both the protocols, one party transmits only one photon for each
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair to another party and the security for the
transmitting photons is ensured by selecting Z-basis or X-basis randomly to
measure the sampling photons.

resulting from the collision of a particle on a target via a short-range
potential. We show that the resulting formalism is non-Hermitian and describe
the Hilbert spaces and metric operator relevant to a correct formulation of
such theories. The structure and tools employed are the same that have been
introduced in current works dealing with PT-symmetric and quasi-Hermitian
problems. The relevance of the non-Hermitian formulation to practical
computations is assessed by introducing a non-Hermiticity index. We give a
numerical example involving scattering by a short-range potential in a Coulomb
field for which it is seen that even for a small but non-negligible
non-Hermiticity index the non-Hermitian character of the problem must be taken
into account. The computation of physical quantities in the relevant Hilbert
spaces is also discussed.
