the low-inertia (or ""force-free"") limit of MHD. We present a new numerical
method for solution of equations of force-free relativistic MHD based on the
finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) approach with a prescription for handling
spontaneous formation of current sheets. We use this method to study the
time-dependent evolution of pulsar magnetospheres in both aligned and oblique
magnetic geometries. For the aligned rotator we confirm the general properties
of the time-independent solution of Contopoulos et al. (1999). For the oblique
rotator we present the 3D structure of the magnetosphere and compute, for the
first time, the spindown power of pulsars as a function of inclination of the
magnetic axis. We find the pulsar spindown luminosity to be L = (mu^2
Omega^4/c^3) (1+ sin^2(alpha)) for a star with the dipole moment ""mu"", rotation
frequency ""Omega"", and magnetic inclination angle ""alpha"". We also discuss the
effects of current sheet resistivity and reconnection on the structure and
evolution of the magnetosphere.

Contemporaneous measurements of the turbulence profile made with a DIMM/MASS

function of the binary companion. Predicted companion Strehl ratios are shown
to match measurements to within a few percent, whereas predictions based on the
isoplanatic angle approximation are highly discrepant. The predicted companion
point spread functions are shown to agree with observations to 10%. These
predictions are used to measure the differential photometry between binary

an accuracy of 1 mas. Errors in the differential astrometry are shown to be
dominated by differential atmospheric tilt jitter. These results are compared

than M7. From the properties of the radio emission we infer magnetic field
strengths of ~100 G in quiescence and nearly 1 kG during flares, while the
majority of the non-detected objects have B<50 G. Depending on the
configuration and size of the magnetic loops, the surface magnetic fields may
approach 1 kG even in quiescence, at most a factor of few smaller than in
early-M dwarfs. With the larger sample of sources we find continued evidence
for (i) a sharp transition around spectral type M7 from a ratio of radio to
X-ray luminosity of log(L_R/L_X) ~ -15.5 to >-12, (ii) increased radio activity
with later spectral type, in contrast to H-alpha and X-ray observations, and
(iii) an overall drop in the fraction of active sources from about 30% for M
dwarfs to about 5% for L dwarfs, fully consistent with H-alpha and X-ray
observations. Taken together, these trends suggest that some late-M and L
dwarfs are capable of generating 0.1-1 kG magnetic fields, but the overall drop
in the fraction of such objects is likely accompanied by a change in the
structure of the chromospheres and coronae, possibly due to the increasingly
neutral atmospheres and/or a transition to a turbulent dynamo. A more extended

in a feedback-driven blast wave, applicable to large-scale outflows from bright
quasars in galaxy mergers, low-luminosity AGN, and BHs in supernova remnants.
Under the assumption that cold gas stochastically accretes onto a central SMBH
at a rate set by the dynamics of that gas, our solution determines the Seyfert
light curve evolution. We use this to predict the Seyfert luminosity function
(LF), duty cycles, lifetimes, and distribution of host morphologies, Eddington
ratios, and obscuration as a function of AGN luminosity and mass, and find
agreement with observations at z=0. We consider the breakdown of contributions
from this and stellar wind accretion and merger-driven activity. We make
specific predictions for the weak evolution of the Seyfert LF with redshift (LF
of non-merger driven activity), and for changes in both the slope and scatter
of the M_BH-sigma relation at low-M_BH. Quiescent fueling dominates over a wide
luminosity range (-14 > M_B > -22) at z=0, where most BH growth occurs around
M_BH~10^7 M_sun, in S0 and Sa/b galaxies. However, quasar activity from
gas-rich mergers evolves more rapidly with redshift, and by z=1 quiescent
fueling is important only at luminosities an order of magnitude or more below
the LF break. Although non-merger driven fueling is important for BH growth and
the M_BH-sigma relation at low M_BH, it does not significantly contribute to
the total BH mass density or cosmological backgrounds.

bumps evident in the first 75 minutes, including a major rebrightening
(Delta_r'=-1.6 at t=3000s), interpreted as late energy injection. At early time
(t=440s), we find evidence for fast (Delta t_(rest)<4s<<t) variability,
indicating on-going internal-engine activity. We emphasise that a low redshift
GRB (z<1) with similar intrinsic properties would have been interpreted
completely differently due to undersampling of the light curve in the rest
frame at early times; the light-curve behaviour of GRB 060206 should therefore
not be considered peculiar. Finally, although the observed late-time steepening
of the optical light curve resembles a jet break if taken in isolation, the
lack of a corresponding change in the X-ray slope rules out a jet-break
interpretation. Traditionally, GRB jet breaks have been inferred from optical
data in the absence of simultaneous X-ray data. We suggest therefore that
current estimates of the jet opening angle distribution might be biased by
events like GRB060206. Consequently, the GRB explosion energy distribution and

so-called ``passive spiral galaxies'' -a significant population which exhibits
spiral morphology with little or no spectroscopic evidence for ongoing star
formation. This population is thought to represent infalling galaxies whose
star formation has been somehow truncated by environmental processes, possibly
in morphological transition to S0 galaxies. Compared to normal cluster spirals,
we find that passive spirals are redder in FUV-optical color, while exhibiting
much stronger UV emission than cluster E/S0s - as expected for
recently-truncated star formation. By modeling the different temporal
sensitivities of UV and spectroscopic data to recent activity, we show that
star formation in passive spirals decayed on timescales of less than 1 Gyr,
consistent with `gas starvation' - a process where the cluster environment
prevents cold gas from accreting onto the spiral disk. Intriguingly, the
fraction of spirals currently observed in the passive phase is consistent with
the longer period expected for the morphological transformation and the
subsequent build-up of cluster S0s observed since z=0.4.

absorption features that are commonly seen at the earliest epochs ($\sim 10$
days before maximum light) are investigated by means of a 3D Monte Carlo

allows statistical study of the geometry of the ejecta. The observed diversity
in strength of the high velocity features (HVFs) can be explained in terms of a
``covering factor'', which represents the fraction of the projected photosphere
that is concealed by high velocity material. Various geometrical models
involving high velocity material with a clumpy structure or a thick torus can
naturally account for the observed statistics of HVFs. HVFs may be formed by a
combination of density and abundance enhancements. Such enhancements may be
produced in the explosion itself or may be the result of interaction with
circumstellar material or an accretion disk. Models with 1 or 2 blobs, as well
as a thin torus or disk-like enhancement are unlikely as a standard situation.

by chemically processed stellar wind. Therefore, we analyzed our models of
radiative and wind bubbles of an isolated 85 Msun star with solar metallicity
(Kr\""oger et al. 2006) with respect to the chemical enrichment of the
circumstellar HII region. Plausibly, the hot stellar wind bubble (SWB) is

In all cases, the stellar populations appear to have asymmetric metallicity
distributions with very high confidence levels. The mean metallicities of both
stellar subpopulations, determined from mixture modelling of the metallicity
distribution functions, correlate with parent galaxy luminosity. This suggests
that the vast majority of field stars have probably formed in galactic
fragments that were already embedded in the dark matter halo of the final
galaxy. The steeper correlation between the mean stellar metallicity and parent
galaxy luminosity is driven by an increasing fraction of metal-rich stars with
increasing galaxy luminosity. Metal-poor components show larger dispersion in
metallicity than metal-rich components. These properties are in striking
similarity with those of globular cluster subpopulations around early-type
galaxies. The properties of field stars along the minor axis are consistent
with a formation scenario in which the metal-poor stars formed in all galaxies,
possibly as a result of tidal disruption of dwarf-like objects. An additional
metal-rich component might be related to the formation of the bulge and/or the

roughly in the NS direction with the axis close to the LOS. This scenario

faster than L dwarfs. However, there is a hint for an increasing lower envelope

local auxiliary integrations over continuous fields with the BP contribution
corresponding to an integrand saddle-point value. The integrals are replaced by
sums in the complimentary approach, briefly explained in \cite{06CCa}. A local
gauge symmetry transformation that clarifies an important invariant feature of
the BP solution, is revealed in both approaches. The partition function remains
invariant while individual terms change under the gauge transformation. The
requirement for all individual terms to be non-zero only for closed loops in
the factor graph (as opposed to paths with loose ends) is equivalent to fixing
the first term in the series to be exactly equal to the BP contribution.

parameters are obtained {\em self-consistently} by solving a coupled system of
non-eigenvalue -- generally integro-differential -- equations to get the
one-particle functions and by diagonalizing the secular matrix problem to find
the expansion coefficients. We call this theory multi-configurational Hartree
for bosons or MCHB(M), where M specifies explicitly the number of one-particle
functions used to construct the configurations. General rules for evaluating
the matrix elements of one- and two-particle operators are derived and applied
to construct the secular Hamiltonian matrix. We discuss properties of the
derived equations. It is demonstrated that for any practical computation where
the configurational space is restricted, the description of trapped bosonic
systems strongly depends on the choice of the many-body basis set used, i.e.,
self-consistency is of great relevance. As illustrative examples we consider
bosonic systems trapped in one- and two-dimensional symmetric and asymmetric
double-well potentials. We demonstrate that self-consistency has great impact
on the predicted physical properties of the ground and excited states and show
that the lack of self-consistency may lead to physically wrong predictions. The
convergence of the general MCHB(M) scheme with a growing number M is validated

objective in the SBP is to compute a short tour for the snowblower to follow to
remove all the snow from a domain (driveway, sidewalk, etc.). When a snowblower
passes over each region along the tour, it displaces snow into a nearby region.
The constraint is that if the snow is piled too high, then the snowblower
cannot clear the pile.
  We give an algorithmic study of the SBP. We show that in general, the problem
is NP-complete, and we present polynomial-time approximation algorithms for
removing snow under various assumptions about the operation of the snowblower.
Most commercially-available snowblowers allow the user to control the direction
in which the snow is thrown. We differentiate between the cases in which the
snow can be thrown in any direction, in any direction except backwards, and
only to the right. For all cases, we give constant-factor approximation
algorithms; the constants increase as the throw direction becomes more
restricted.

equations can be derived from commutation relations among Euclidean coordinates
and velocities, without explicit reference to momentum, action or variational
principle. This result was extended to the relativistic case and shown to
correspond to a Stueckelberg-type quantum theory, in which gauge
transformations may depend on the invariant evolution parameter, such that the
associated the five-dimensional electromagnetism becomes standard Maxwell
theory in the equilibrium limit. Building on the work of Berard, Grandati,
Lages and Mohrbach, we construct an extension of the Lorentz generators in
N-dimensions that restores the closed commutation relations in the presence of
a Maxwell field, and renders the extended generators constants of the classical
motion. The algebra imposes conditions on the Maxwell field, leading to a Dirac
monopole solution. The construction can be maximally satisfied in a three
dimensional subspace of the full Minkowski space; this subspace can be chosen
to describe either the O(3)-invariant space sector, generalizing the
nonrelativistic result, or an O(2,1)-invariant restriction of spacetime, and
leading to a relativistic Coulomb-like potential of the type used by Horwitz
and Arshansky to obtain a covariant generalization of the hydrogen-like bound

towards understanding the nature of dark energy. We review the observational
evidence for the current accelerated expansion of the universe and present a
number of dark energy models in addition to the conventional cosmological
constant, paying particular attention to scalar field models such as
quintessence, K-essence, tachyon, phantom and dilatonic models. The importance
of cosmological scaling solutions is emphasized when studying the dynamical
system of scalar fields including coupled dark energy. We study the evolution
of cosmological perturbations allowing us to confront them with the observation
of the Cosmic Microwave Background and Large Scale Structure and demonstrate
how it is possible in principle to reconstruct the equation of state of dark
energy by also using Supernovae Ia observational data. We also discuss in
detail the nature of tracking solutions in cosmology, particle physics and
braneworld models of dark energy, the nature of possible future singularities,
the effect of higher order curvature terms to avoid a Big Rip singularity, and
approaches to modifying gravity which leads to a late-time accelerated
expansion without recourse to a new form of dark energy.

the metric of spacetimes generated by brane sources in dimensionally continued

show that these asymptotically AdS spacetimes which contain two fundamental

determine when a Littlewood-Richardson coefficient is non-zero. Briefly, a
Littlewood-Richardson coefficient is non-zero if and only if it satisfies a
collection of Horn inequalities which are indexed by smaller non-zero
Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. There are similar Littlewood-Richardson
numbers for Schur P- and Q- functions. Using a mixture of combinatorics of root
systems, combinatorial linear algebra in Lie algebras, and the geometry of
certain cominuscule flag varieties, we give Horn recursions to determine when
these other Littlewood-Richardson numbers are non-zero. Our inequalities come
from the usual Littlewood-Richardson numbers, and while we give two very
different Horn recursions, they have the same sets of solutions. Another
combinatorial by-product of this work is a new Horn-type recursion for the
usual Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.

their constitutive parameters has been shown to lead to interesting and
unconventional properties that are not otherwise observable for single slabs.
One such case was demonstrated analytically for the conjugate (i.e.,
complementary) pairing of infinite planar slabs of epsilon-negative (ENG) and
mu-negative (MNG) media [A. Alu, and N. Engheta, IEEE Trans. Antennas Prop.,
51, 2558 (2003)]. There it was shown that when these two slabs are juxtaposed
and excited by an incident plane wave, resonance, complete tunneling, total
transparency and reconstruction of evanescent waves may occur in the
steady-state regime under a monochromatic excitation, even though each of the
two slabs by itself is essentially opaque to the incoming radiation. This may
lead to virtual imagers with sub-wavelength resolution and other anomalous
phenomena overcoming the physical limit of diffraction. Here we explore how a
transient sinusoidal signal that starts at t = 0 interacts with such an ENG-MNG
pair of finite size using an FDTD technique. Multiple reflections and
transmissions at each interface are shown to build up to the eventual steady
state response of the pair, and during this process one can observe how the
growing exponential phenomenon may actually occur inside this bilayer.

effective material parameters for such NTLs are derived, and the connection and

constraining the paths in the auxiliary-field path integrals with an
approximate phase condition that depends on a trial wave function. In the

that they reproduce the correct geometry of the tumor and are defined in terms

that it mininises the average time taken for a qubit to reach a given purity.
In fact, the average time taken for the no-feedback protocol beats that for
Jacobs' protocol by a factor of two. We discuss how this is compatible with

implementations. This protocol comprises of BB84 protocol and SARG protocol,
especially in aspects of controlling classical sifting procedures of two
protocols. The protocol is more secure than both of BB84 protocol and SARG
protocol, and the ultimate limit of robustness in the proposed protocol expands
as well than both of them.

Theor. 40 (2007), 1333-1340","10.1088/1751-8113/40/6/010",,"quant-ph",,"  Within a well-known decay model describing a particle confined initially
within a spherical $\delta$ potential shell, we consider the situation when the
undecayed state has an unusual energy distribution decaying slowly as
$k\to\infty$; the simplest example corresponds to a wave function constant
within the shell. We show that the non-decay probability as a function of time
behaves then in a highly irregular, most likely fractal way.

secret key rate without single photon source and detector, but the lack of the
secure and effective key distillation method makes it unpractical. Here, we
present a secure single-bit-reverse-reconciliation protocol combined with
secret information concentration and post-selection, which can distill the
secret key with high efficiency and low computational complexity. The
simulation results show that this protocol can provide high secret key rate
even when the transmission fiber is longer than 150km, which may make the
continuous variable scheme to outvie the single photon one.
