fluctuations, sigma_8, optical depth, tau, and a slope for the scalar
perturbation spectrum, n_s) fits not only the three year WMAP temperature and
polarization data, but also small scale CMB data, light element abundances,
large-scale structure observations, and the supernova luminosity/distance
relationship. Using WMAP data only, the best fit values for cosmological
parameters for the power-law flat LCDM model are (Omega_m h^2, Omega_b h^2, h,
n_s, tau, sigma_8) = 0.1277+0.0080-0.0079, 0.02229+-0.00073, 0.732+0.031-0.032,

dramatically shrink the allowed volume in this six dimensional parameter space.
Assuming that the primordial fluctuations are adiabatic with a power law
spectrum, the WMAP data_alone_ require dark matter, and favor a spectral index
that is significantly less than the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles scale-invariant
spectrum (n_s=1, r=0). Models that suppress large-scale power through a running
spectral index or a large-scale cut-off in the power spectrum are a better fit
to the WMAP and small scale CMB data than the power-law LCDM model; however,
the improvement in the fit to the WMAP data is only Delta chi^2 = 3 for 1 extra
degree of freedom. The combination of WMAP and other astronomical data yields
significant constraints on the geometry of the universe, the equation of state
of the dark energy, the gravitational wave energy density, and neutrino
properties. Consistent with the predictions of simple inflationary theories, we
detect no significant deviations from Gaussianity in the CMB maps.

pressure of the interstellar medium in our own Galaxy, suggesting that they may
play an important role in regulating star formation during the formation and
evolution of galaxies. We here discuss a novel numerical treatment of the
physics of CRs and its implementation in the parallel smoothed particle
hydrodynamics code GADGET-2. In our methodology, the non-thermal CR population
of each gaseous fluid element is approximated by a simple power law spectrum in
particle momentum, characterized by an amplitude, a cut-off, and a fixed slope.
Adiabatic compression, and a number of physical source and sink terms are
modelled which modify the CR pressure of each particle. The most important
sources considered are injection by supernovae and diffusive shock
acceleration, while the primary sinks are thermalization by Coulomb
interactions, and catastrophic losses by hadronic interactions. We also include
diffusion of CRs. Our scheme allows us to carry out the first cosmological
structure formation simulations that self-consistently account for CR physics.
In simulations of isolated galaxies, we find that CRs can significantly reduce
the star formation efficiencies of small galaxies, with virial velocities below
\~80 km/s, an effect that becomes progressively stronger towards low mass
scales. In cosmological simulations at high redshift, the total mass-to-light
ratio of small halos and the faint-end of the luminosity function are strongly
affected. When CR acceleration in shocks is followed as well, up to ~40% of the
energy dissipated at structure formation shocks can appear as CR pressure at
z~3-6, but this fraction drops to ~10% at low redshifts when the shock
distribution becomes increasingly dominated by lower Mach numbers. (abridged)

classified as an X-ray Flash (XRF). XRF 060218 is clearly associated with a
supernova -- dubbed SN 2006aj. We present early spectra for SN 2006aj as well
as optical lightcurves reaching out to 50 days past explosion. Our optical
lightcurves define the rise times, the lightcurve shapes and the absolute
magnitudes in the U, V and R bands, and we compare these data with data for
other relevant supernovae. SN 2006aj evolved quite fast, somewhat similarly to
SN 2002ap, but not as fast as SN 1994I. Our spectra show the evolution of the
supernova over the peak, when the U-band portion of the spectrum rapidly fades
due to extensive line blanketing. We compare to similar spectra of very
energetic Type Ic supernovae. Our first spectra are earlier than spectra for
any other GRB-SN. The spectrum taken 12 days after burst in the rest frame is
similar to somewhat later spectra of both SN 1998bw and SN 2003dh, implying a
rapid early evolution. This is consistent with the fast lightcurve.
  From the narrow emission lines from the host galaxy we derive a redshift of
z=0.0331+-0.0007. This makes XRF 060218 the second closest gamma-ray burst
detected. The flux of these emission lines indicate a high-excitation state,
and a modest metallicity and star formation rate of the host galaxy.

Fourier spectrum of both stars with similar amplitude. We also demonstrate that
the modulation frequencies have basically different properties as the pulsation

from the expectations based on the virial theorem and homology, including the
""tilt"" of the ""fundamental plane"" and the steep decline of density with mass.
We show that such tilts result from dissipative major mergers once the gas
fraction available for dissipation declines with progenitor mass, and derive
the scaling properties of the progenitors. We use hydrodynamical simulations to
quantify the effects of major mergers with different gas fractions on the
structural properties of galaxies. The tilts are driven by the differential
shrinkage of the effective stellar radius as a function of dissipation in the
merger, while the correlated smaller enhancements in internal velocity and
stellar mass keep the slope of the velocity-stellar mass relation near V \pr
M_*^{1/4}. The progenitors match a straightforward model of disc formation in
LCDM haloes. Their total to stellar mass ratio within the effective radius
varies as M/M_* \pr M_*^-0.25, consistent with supernova feedback. They are
nearly homologous in the sense that the dark-matter fractions within the
effective and virial radii scale with mass in a similar way, with only a weak
decline of density with mass. The progenitor radius is roughly R \pr M_*^0.3,
compatible with today's intermediate late-type galaxies. This indicates that
the latest wet mergers involved relatively big discs. The dissipative gas to
stellar mass ratio is predicted to decline \pr M_*^-0.5, similar to the
observed trend in today's blue sequence galaxies. Such a trend should be
observed in relatively massive gaseous galaxies at z~1-4. The corresponding
""baryonic"" relations are consistent with homology and spherical virial
equilibrium, V \pr R \pr M_b^1/3.

light curve is obtained subtracting the galaxy contribution and is modelled
together with two spectra at near-maximum epochs. A red VLT grism 150I spectrum
of the SN near peak is used to extend the spectral coverage, and in particular
to constrain the uncertain reddening, the most likely value for which is
E_{G+H}(B-V) about 1.07 +/- 0.05. Accounting for reddening, SN 2003lw is about
0.3 mag brighter than the prototypical GRB-SN 1998bw. Light curve models yield

more massive (ejecta mass about 13 solar mass) and energetic (kinetic energy
about 6 times 10^52 erg) than the model for SN 1998bw, implying a massive

explosive scenarios. A persistent, thin (less than micron-sr solid angle)
precessing and spinning gamma jet, with a power output comparable to the
progenitor supernova (SN) or XRay pulsar, may explain these issues. The
precessing jets may have a few hours characteristic decay time, while their
decreasing intensity follow a power law for thousands of years. The orientation
of the spinning and precessing beam respect to the line of sight plays a key
role : the farthest GRB events in widest cosmic volumes correspond generally to
a very narrow and on-axis beam, while for the nearest ones sources are mostly
observable off-axis. Consequentely the far ones are the hardest and the most
bright and viceversa nearest one are mostly softer and longest ones as in Amati
correlation. We expect that nearby off-axis GRBs would be accompanied by a
chain of OT and radio bumps as in GRB030329-SN2003 and latest GRB060218-SN2006
events. Delayed blazing jets are observable in the local universe as X-Ray
Flahes (XRFs) or short GRBs often as orphan afterglow event, and at closer
distances as SGRs and anomalous X-ray Pulsars AXRPs. The gamma jet is
originated by ultra-relativistic electron pairs showering via Synchrotron (or
Inverse Compton) radiation. The electron pairs escape from the inner SN core
thanks to a more penetrating couriers, the relativistic PeV muon pairs,
themselves secondaries of inner UHE hadron jets. They are 'transparent' through
the SN shells of matter and lights; they decay far away in to electron pairs
(and later on) in gamma and neutrinos jets. Then GRBs (and SGRs) are not the
most explosive event of the Universe, but just the most beamed ones.

haloes, but rather a signal of the breakdown of General Relativity. To this
aim, we consider power - law fourth order theories of gravity obtained by
replacing the scalar curvature $R$ with $f(R) = f_0 R^n$ in the gravity
Lagrangian. We show that, in the low energy limit, the gravitational potential
generated by a pointlike source may be written as $\Phi(r) \propto r^{-1} \left

properties. In order to apply the model to realistic systems, we compute the
modified potential and the rotation curve for spherically symmetric and for
thin disk mass distributions. It turns out that the potential is still
asymptotically decreasing, but the corrected rotation curve, although not flat,
is higher than the Newtonian one thus offering the possibility to fit rotation
curves without dark matter. To test the viability of the model, we consider a
sample of 15 low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies with combined HI and
H$\alpha$ measurements of the rotation curve extending in the putative dark
matter dominated region. We find a very good agreement between the theoretical
rotation curve and the data using only stellar disk and interstellar gas.

density cusp of the type predicted by many N-body simulations of cold dark
matter (CDM) halos. Our observations are instead consistent with dark matter
halos characterized by cores of roughly constant density, in agreement with
previous investigations. While unremarkable in terms of the central density
slope, these galaxies appear very challenging for existing CDM halo models in
terms of average central halo density, as measured by the Delta_(V/2)
parameter. Since most of our target galaxies are bulgeless disks, our
observations also disfavour a recently suggested mechanism for lowering the
central mass concentration of the halo by means of a fast collapse phase, as
this scenario predicts that the original CDM profile should still be detectable
in bulgeless galaxies. Other potential ways of reconciling the CDM predictions
with these observations are discussed.

transition in CeIrIn$_5$ with resistivity and de-Haas-van-Alphen (dHvA) effect
measurements in the temperature range 0.03-1 K. As the magnetic field is
increased the resistivity increases, reaches a maximum at the metamagnetic
critical field, and falls precipitously for fields just above the transition,
while the amplitude of all measurable dHvA frequencies are significantly
attenuated near the metamagnetic critical field. However, the dHvA frequencies
and cyclotron masses are not substantially altered by the transition. In the
low field state, the resistivity is observed to increase toward low
temperatures in a singular fashion, a behavior that is rapidly suppressed above
the transition. Instead, in the high field state, the resistivity monotonically
increases with temperature with a dependence that is more singular than the
iconic Fermi-liquid, temperature-squared, behavior. Both the damping of the
dHvA amplitudes and the increased resistivity near the metamagnetic critical
field indicate an increased scattering rate for charge carriers consistent with
critical fluctuation scattering in proximity to a phase transition. The dHvA
amplitudes do not uniformly recover above the critical field, with some
hole-like orbits being entirely suppressed at high fields. These changes, taken
as a whole, suggest that the metamagnetic transition in CeIrIn$_5$ is
associated with the polarization and localization of the heaviest of
quasiparticles on the hole-like Fermi surface.

constitution. In particular, PZT is used with compositions near to a so-called
morphotropic phase boundary, where not only different variants of the same
phase (domains), but different phases may coexist. Micro-mechanical models for
ferroelectric ceramics would be much more realistic, if these effects could be
incorporated.
  In this paper, we consider the conditions of mechanical and electrical
compatibility of ferroelectric domain structures. We are able to address the
question of coexistence of different crystallographic phases within the very
same crystallite. In general, the spontaneous strain and spontaneous
polarization of different phases are not compatible. The numerical analysis of
the derived relationships are susceptible to the crystallographic description
of the phases in question. In this presentation, a simple analysis and
analytical, composition dependent fit of strain and polarization of PZT at room
temperature for available data are used.
  The outlined approach can be used to model the overall behavior of
multi-variant and multi-phase crystallites with certain, simplified geometrical
arrangements of the constituents.

junctions and related systems as a function of the structure of the Au:S
contacts. For junctions with semi-infinite flat Au(111) electrodes, the highly
coordinated in-hollow and bridge positions are connected with broad
transmission peaks around the Fermi level, due to a broad range of transmission
angles from transverse motion, resulting in high conductivity and weak
dependence on geometrical variations. In contrast, for (unstable) S-adsorption
on top of an Au atom, or in the hollow of a 3-Au-atom island, the transmission
peaks narrow up due to suppression of large transmission angles. Such more
one-dimensional situations may describe more common types of contacts and
junctions, resulting in large variations in conductivity and sensitivity to
bonding sites, tilting and gating. In particular, if S is adsorbed in an Au
vacancy, sharp spectral features appear near the Fermi level due to essential
changes of the level structure and hybridization in the contacts, admitting
order-of-magnitude variations of the conductivity. Possibly such a system, can
it be fabricated, will show extremely strong non-linear effects and might work
as uni- or bi-directional voltage-controlled 2-terminal switches and non-linear
mixing elements. Finally, density-functional-theory (DFT) based transport
calculations seem relevant, being capable of describing a wide range of
transmission peak structures and conductivities. Prediction and interpretation
of experimental results probably require more precise modeling of realistic
experimental situations.

curvature scalar provided that the space is taken as the union of two $2(2n+1)$
dimensional spaces where the usual 4-dimensional space lies at the intersection
of these spaces. It is shown that this symmetry may be realized through
spacetime reflections that change the sign of the volume element. A possible
relation of this symmetry to the E-parity symmetry of Linde is also pointed
out.

generalized Abel-Plana formula allows to extract from the expectation values
the contribution from single shells and to present the interference part in
terms of exponentially convergent integrals. The vacuum forces acting on the
boundaries are presented as the sum of self-action and interaction terms. The
first one contains well-known surface divergences and needs a further
renormalization. The interaction forces between the cylindrical boundaries are
finite and are attractive for special cases of Dirichlet and Neumann scalars.
For the general Robin case the interaction forces can be both attractive or
repulsive depending on the coefficients in the boundary conditions. The total
Casimir energy is evaluated by using the zeta function regularization
technique. It is shown that it contains a part which is located on bounding
surfaces. The formula for the interference part of the surface energy is
derived and the energy balance is discussed.

the context of cosmological dynamics. The scalar sector includes the inflaton
\phi and the Higgs \upsilon fields. The model possesses gauge and scale
invariance. The latter is spontaneously broken due to intrinsic features of the
TMT dynamics. In the model with the inflaton \phi alone, in different regions
of the parameter space the following different effects can take place without
fine tuning of the parameters and initial conditions: a) Possibility of
resolution of the old cosmological constant problem: this is done in a
consistent way hinted by S. Weinberg in his comment concerning the question of
how one can avoid his no-go theorem. b) The power law inflation without any
fine tuning may end with damped oscillations of $\phi$ around the state with
zero cosmological constant. c) There are regions of the parameters where the
equation-of-state w=p/\rho in the late time universe is w<-1 and w
asymptotically (as t\to\infty) approaches -1 from below. This effect is
achieved without any exotic term in the action. In a model with both \phi and
\upsilon fields, a scenario which resembles the hybrid inflation is realized
but there are essential differences, for example: the Higgs field undergos
transition to a gauge symmetry broken phase <\upsilon>\neq 0 soon after the end
of a power law inflation; there are two oscillatory regimes of \upsilon, one
around \upsilon =0 at 50 e-folding before the end of inflation, another -
during transition to a gauge symmetry broken phase where the scalar dark energy
density approaches zero without fine tuning; the gauge symmetry breakdown is
achieved without tachyonic mass term in the action.

massless relativistic boson, while the O$(1)$ piece gives rise to cubic
self-interactions of the boson. At finite $N$ and high energies, the low-energy

substantial ways: We work in the setup of graded categories, i.e. we allow
infinitely many idempotents and also define a ``Koszul'' duality functor for
not necessarily Koszul categories. As an illustration of the techniques we
reprove the Koszul duality of translation and Zuckerman functors for the

the transverse and longitudinal components of the acoustic field have the
high-frequency and zero-frequency spectral components. We show that a pulse can
propagate in the modes different from the acoustic self-induced transparency.
In particular, a pulse propagating in the mode of acoustic self-induced
supertransparency substantially changes the populations of the spin sublevels,
but its group velocity remains almost equal to the linear velocity of the
sound. If a pulse propagates in the acoustic extraordinary transparency mode,
then its group velocity is substantially lower while the sublevel populations
remain virtually invariant. Also, the modes of propagation under conditions of
weakly excited spin transitions and large detuning of the pulse high-frequency

traditional MS through the inclusion of a new dimension in the space of
molecular characteristics--the electron resonance energy spectrum. However,
before this tool can realize its full potential, it will be necessary to create
a library of resonance energy scans from standards of the molecules for which
EM-MS offers a practical means of detection. Here, an approach supplementing
direct measurement with chemical inference and quantum scattering theory is
presented to demonstrate the feasibility of directly calculating resonance
energy spectra. This approach makes use of the symmetry of the
transition-matrix element of the captured electron to discriminate between the
spectra of isomers. As a way of validating this approach, the resonance values
for twenty-five nitrated aromatic compounds were measured along with their
relative abundance. Subsequently, the spectra for the isomers of nitrotoluene
were shown to be consistent with the symmetry-based model. The initial success
of this treatment suggests that it might be possible to predict negative ion
resonances and thus create a library of EM-MS standards.

between two clusters is calculated. Results obtained with two different methods
are compared. One is to consider a cluster as a collection of many atoms and
evaluate the sum of two-body and three-body interatomic interactions, a common
assumption. The other method, valid at large separation, is to consider each
cluster as a point particle, characterized by a polarizability tensor, and
evaluate the inter-cluster interaction. This method employs the static
polarizability, evaluated by including all many-body (MB) intra-cluster atomic
interactions self-consistently, which yields the full inter-cluster
interaction, including all MB terms. A comparison of the results from the two
methods reveals that the contribution of the higher-than-three-body MB
interactions is always attractive and non-negligible, with a relative
importance that varies with geometry. The procedure is quite general and is
applicable to any shape or size of dielectric clusters, in principle. We
present numerical results for clusters composed of atoms with polarizability
consistent with silica, for which the higher-than-three-body MB correction term
can be as high as 42% of the atomic pair-wise sum. The full result is quite
sensitive to the anisotropic structure of the cluster, in contrast to the
result found in the additive case, which is orientation independent. We also
present a power law expansion of the total van der Waals (VDW) interaction as a

vulnerability of such networks to intentional attacks, these attributes must be
therefore considered along with the topological quantities. In order to tackle
this issue, we consider the case of the world-wide airport network, which is a
weighted heterogeneous network whose evolution and structure are influenced by
traffic and geographical constraints. We first characterize relevant
topological and weighted centrality measures and then use these quantities as
selection criteria for the removal of vertices. We consider different attack
strategies and different measures of the damage achieved in the network. The
analysis of weighted properties shows that centrality driven attacks are
capable to shatter the network's communication or transport properties even at
very low level of damage in the connectivity pattern. The inclusion of weight
and traffic therefore provides evidence for the extreme vulnerability of
complex networks to any targeted strategy and need to be considered as key
features in the finding and development of defensive strategies.

A357 (2006) 6-11","10.1016/j.physleta.2006.04.102",,"quant-ph",,"  We find the time evolution of the system of two non-interacting unstable
particles, distinguishable as well as identical ones, in arbitrary reference
frame having only the Kraus operators governing the evolution of its components
in the rest frame. We than calculate in the rigorous way
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen quantum correlation functions for K0-K0 system in the
singlet state taking into account CP-violation and decoherence and show that
the results are exactly the same despite the fact we treat kaons as
distinguishable or identical particles which means that the statistics of the
particles plays no role, at least in considered cases.

periodic solutions that occur at spectral singularities of PT symmetric models.
For these periodic solutions, the dual functions are associated polynomials
that obey inhomogeneous equations. We construct in detail some explicit
examples for the supersymmetric pairs of potentials V_{+/-}(z) = -U(z)^2 +/-
z(d/(dz))U(z) where U(z) = \sum_{k>0}u_{k}z^{k}. In particular, we consider the
cases generated by U(z) = z and z/(1-z). We also briefly consider the effects
of magnetic vector potentials on the partition functions of these systems.

statistical operators, and we exhibit a necessary condition which has to be
satisfied by any given mixed state $\sigma$ in order that a local and realistic
hidden variable model exists which accounts for the quantum mechanical
predictions implied by $\sigma$. Failure of this condition will imply both the
impossibility of any local explanation of certain joint probability
distributions in terms of hidden variables and the nonseparability of the
considered mixed statistical operator. Our result can be also used to determine
the maximum amount of noise, arising from imperfect experimental
implementations of the original Hardy's proof of nonlocality, in presence of
which it is still possible to put into evidence the nonlocal features of
certain mixed states.
