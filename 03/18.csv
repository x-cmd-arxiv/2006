an improved 'Internal Linear Combination' map, based solely on WMAP data, by
adding a bias correction step and by quantifying residual uncertainties in the

Galactic emission; in particular, we now use low-frequency WMAP data to trace
synchrotron emission. The WMAP point source catalog is updated to include 115
new sources. We derive the angular power spectrum of the temperature anisotropy
using a hybrid approach that combines a maximum likelihood estimate at low l
(large angular scales) with a quadratic cross-power estimate for l>30. Our best
estimate of the CMB power spectrum is derived by averaging cross-power spectra
from 153 statistically independent channel pairs. The combined spectrum is
cosmic variance limited to l=400, and the signal-to-noise ratio per l-mode
exceeds unity up to l=850. The first two acoustic peaks are seen at l=220.8 +-

arises from a merging system composed of a Ly-break galaxy and a pair of
extremely red objects which are multiply-imaged in the optical/NIR
observations. Since the submm emission presents an unusually large angular
extent (~1 arcmin), the possible radio emission asociatted with that system can
help to identify optical/NIR counterparts due to the higher spatial resolution
and astrometric accuracy of the radio observations. Archive VLA data (BnA
configuration at 1.4 GHz) was reduced and analysed. A simple lens model was
constructed to aid the interpretation of the radio and pre-existing sub-mm and
optical/NIR data. We present a 1.4 GHz map of the central region of
MS0451.6-0305 and report the detection of gravitationally lensed radio
emission, coincident with the previously discovered sub-mm lensed emission. The
overall morphology and scale of the radio and sub-mm emission are strikingly
similar, extending ~1 arcmin across the sky. This observation strongly suggests
that the radio and sub-mm emission arise from the same sources. Preliminary
estimates of the total S_850 microns/S_1.4 GHz flux density ratio appear to be
consistent with that expected from distant star forming galaxies. The radio
emission is resolved into 7 distinct components, and the overall structure can
be explained, using a simple lens model, with three multiply-imaged radio
sources at z~2.9. One of these sources is predicted to lie in the middle of the
previously mentioned system in the source plane, suggesting that it is related
to the intense star formation generated during the merging process.

  towards the Initial Mass Function",,,,,"astro-ph",,"  We review the properties of low mass dense molecular cloud cores, including
starless, prestellar, and Class 0 protostellar cores, as derived from
observations. In particular we discuss them in the context of the current
debate surrounding the formation and evolution of cores. There exist several
families of model scenarios to explain this evolution (with many variations of
each) that can be thought of as a continuum of models lying between two extreme
paradigms for the star and core formation process. At one extreme there is the
dynamic, turbulent picture, while at the other extreme there is a slow,
quasi-static vision of core evolution. In the latter view the magnetic field
plays a dominant role, and it may also play some role in the former picture.
Polarization and Zeeman measurements indicate that some, if not all, cores
contain a significant magnetic field. Wide-field surveys constrain the
timescales of the core formation and evolution processes, as well as the
statistical distribution of core masses. The former indicates that prestellar
cores typically live for 2--5 free-fall times, while the latter seems to
determine the stellar initial mass function. In addition, multiple surveys
allow one to compare core properties in different regions. From this it appears
that aspects of different models may be relevant to different star-forming
regions, depending on the environment. Prestellar cores in cluster-forming
regions are smaller in radius and have higher column densities, by up to an
order of magnitude, than isolated prestellar cores. This is probably due to the
fact that in cluster-forming regions the prestellar cores are formed by
fragmentation of larger, more turbulent cluster-forming cores, which in turn
form as a result of strong external compression.

characterized by a finite correlation length, does in general not vanish on
scales larger than the correlation scale. If the variable is a divergence free
vector field, we demonstrate that its power spectrum is blue on large scales.
Accounting for this fact, we compute the gravitational waves induced by an
incompressible turbulent fluid and by a causal magnetic field present in the
early universe. The gravitational wave power spectra show common features: they
are both blue on large scales, and peak at the correlation scale. However, the
magnetic field can be treated as a coherent source and it is active for a long
time. This results in a very effective conversion of magnetic energy in
gravitational wave energy at horizon crossing. Turbulence instead acts as a
source for gravitational waves over a time interval much shorter than a Hubble
time, and the conversion into gravitational wave energy is much less effective.
We also derive a strong constraint on the amplitude of a primordial magnetic
field when the correlation length is much smaller than the horizon.

observed between gamma-rays and X-rays fluxes, whereas no significant

law, more clearly and at lower flux than previous observations at higher

by the extragalactic background light, and most likely is source-inherent.

galaxy mass, and the oldest stellar populations are found in the most massive

number density of ETGs, especially of the less massive ones, whereas existing
data appear to suggest that most of the most-massive ETGs were already fully

partial pressure support against gravity, they trace past energetic events such
as supernovae, and they reveal the underlying structure of the baryonic matter
distribution through their interactions. To study the impact of CRs on galaxy
and cosmic structure formation and evolution, we develop an approximative
framework for treating dynamical and radiative effects of CRs in cosmological
simulations. Our guiding principle is to try to find a balance between
capturing as many physical properties of CR populations as possible while at
the same time requiring as little extra computational resources as possible. We
approximate the CR spectrum of each fluid element by a single power-law, with
spatially and temporally varying normalisation, low-energy cut-off, and
spectral index. Principles of conservation of particle number, energy, and
pressure are then used to derive evolution equations for the basic variables
describing the CR spectrum, both due to adiabatic and non-adiabatic processes.
The processes considered include compression and rarefaction, CR injection via
shocks in supernova remnants, injection in structure formation shock waves,
in-situ re-acceleration of CRs, CR spatial diffusion, CR energy losses due to
Coulomb interactions, ionisation losses, Bremsstrahlung losses, and, finally,
hadronic interactions with the background gas, including the associated
gamma-ray and radio emission due to subsequent pion decay. We show that the
formalism reproduces CR energy densities, pressure, and cooling rates with an
accuracy of ~10% in steady state conditions where CR injection balances

Milky Way companion whose properties are intermediate between those of globular
clusters and dwarf spheroidals. In this paper, we use deep photometry to show
that this object is old and moderately metal-poor, has a distance of 38 +/- 7
kpc, has an M_V of -2.5 mag, and has a half-light radius of 21 +/- 7 pc,
consistent with previous estimates. The spatial distribution of Willman 1's
main sequence stars shows 1) its total spatial extent exceeds its tidal radius
for a range of assumptions about its total mass and its orbit and 2) the
presence of prominent multi-directional stellar tails. The tidal interactions
causing these tail features may explain the large physical size of Willman 1
relative to low-luminosity globular clusters. It is the most distant Galactic
object yet known to display prominent tails, and is the only distant satellite
to display multi-directional tails. Although we cannot at present determine the
cause of this unusual morphology, preliminary comparisons between the
morphology of Willman 1 and published simulations suggest that it may be near
the apocenter of its orbit, or that it may have interacted with another halo
object. We find a significant difference between the luminosity functions of
stars in the center and in the tails of Willman 1, strongly suggesting mass
segregation much like that seen in Palomar 5. Although Willman 1 has more
pronounced tidal tails than most confirmed Milky Way dwarf galaxies, because of
its very low stellar mass we cannot at present rule out the possibility that it
has a dark matter halo. (Abridged)

have been assembled through constrained realizations method and evolved from
the linear regime using cosmological simulations. The `seed' disks have been
inserted at redshift z=3 and increased in mass tenfold over various time
periods, ~1-3 Gyr, with the halo responding quasi-adiabatically to this
process. We follow the dynamical and secular evolution of the disk-halo system
and analyze changes in the most important parameters, like 3-D DM shapes,
stellar and DM radial density profiles, stellar bar development, etc. We find
that a growing disk is responsible for washing out the halo prolateness and for
diluting its flatness over a period of time comparable to the disk growth.
Moreover, we find that a disk which contributes more to the overall rotation
curve in the system is also more efficient in axisymmetrizing the halo, without
accelerating the halo figure rotation. The observational corollary is that the
maximal disks probably reside in nearly axisymmetric halos, while disks whose
rotation is dominated by the halo at all radii are expected to reside in more
prolate halos. The halo shape is sensitive to the final disk mass, but is
independent of how the seed disk is introduced into the system. We also expect
that the massive disks are subject to a bar instability, while light disks have
this instability damped by the halo triaxiality. Implications to the
cosmological evolution of disks embedded in asymmetric halos are discussed and
so are the corollaries for the observed fraction of stellar bars. Finally, the
halo responds to the stellar bar by developing a gravitational wake -- a
`ghost' bar of its own which is almost in-phase with that in the disk.

exceptional precision for even modest numbers of cluster stars. For clusters

molecular clouds, the X-ray spectra from the Galactic center region also
exhibit properties similar to those of a diffuse, thin, very hot plasma at 8
keV on a scale of hundreds of parsecs. This phase is surprising for more than
one reason. First, such a hot plasma should not be bound to the Galactic plane
and the power needed to sustain the escaping matter would be higher then any
known source. Second, there is no known mechanism able to heat the plasma to
more than a few keV. Recently we have suggested that, hydrogen having escaped,
the hot plasma could be a helium plasma, heavy enough to be gravitationally
confined. In this case, the required power is much more reasonable. We present
here a possible heating mechanism which taps the gravitational energy of the
molecular clouds. We note that the 8 keV plasma is highly viscous and we show
how viscous friction of molecular clouds flowing within the hot phase can
dissipate energy in the gas and heat it. We detail the MHD wake of a spherical
cloud by considering the different MHD waves the cloud can excite. We find that
most of the energy is dissipated by the damping of Alfvenic perturbations in
two possible manners, namely by non-linear effects and by a large scale
curvature of the field lines. Depending on the field strength, this heating can
balance the radiative cooling. We note that the plasma parameters may be
optimal to make the dissipation most efficient, suggesting a self-regulation
mechanism. The loss of kinetic and gravitational energy also causes accretion
of the clouds and may have significant action on the gas dynamics in this
region between the large scale, bar dominated flow and the central accretion to
the massive black hole.

dynamics of elliptical galaxies, refer to slow processes of evolution of

relevant quasi-equilibrium configuration at time t from given initial

terms of adiabatic evolution, for the calculation of which efficient
semi--analytical techniques are available. Here we focus on the slow process of
evolution, induced by dynamical friction of a host stellar system on a minority

determine to what extent an adiabatic description might be applied. The study
is realized by comparing directly N--body simulations of the stellar system
evolution (in two significantly different models) from initial to final
conditions in a controlled numerical environment. We demonstrate that for the
examined process the adiabatic description is going to provide incorrect
answers, not only quantitatively, but also qualitatively. The two classes of
models considered exhibit generally similar trends in evolution, with one
exception noted in relation to the evolution of the total density profile. This
simple conclusion should be taken as a warning against the indiscriminate use

comparison of the colour and period relations with those of similar stars in

consequence of sample selection effects. Apparent bolometric magnitudes were
determined by combining the mean JHKL fluxes with mid-infrared photometry from
IRAS and MSX. Then, using the Mira period luminosity relation to set the
absolute magnitudes, distances were determined -- to greater accuracy than has
hitherto been possible for this type of star. Bolometric corrections to the K

subject to spin-dependent scattering. A scattering matrix formalism is
developed to address both coherent and incoherent transport properties. The
coherent case corresponds to elastic scattering by static defects, which is
dominant at low temperatures, while the incoherent case provides a
phenomenological description of the inelastic scattering present in real
physical systems at room temperature. It is found that disorder scattering
increases the amount of spin-mixing of transmitted electrons, reducing the
adiabaticity. This leads, in the incoherent case, to a reduction of conductance
through the domain wall as compared to a uniformly magnetized region which is
similar to the giant magnetoresistance effect. In the coherent case, a
reduction of weak localization, together with a suppression of spin-reversing
scattering amplitudes, leads to an enhancement of conductance due to the domain
wall in the regime of strong disorder. The total effect of a domain wall on the
conductance of a nanowire is studied by incorporating the disordered regions on
either side of the wall. It is found that spin-dependent scattering in these
regions increases the domain wall magnetoconductance as compared to the effect
found by considering only the scattering inside the wall. This increase is most
dramatic in the narrow wall limit, but remains significant for wide walls.

fictitious coordinates that transform nontrivially under the Lorentz group.
Integration over these coordinates in the action produces a four-dimensional
effective theory with Lorentz invariance intact. Previous applications of this
approach, in particular to a specific construction of noncommutative QED, have
been studied only in a low-momentum approximation. Here we discuss
Lorentz-invariant field theories in which the relevant physics can be studied
without requiring an expansion in the inverse scale of noncommutativity.
Qualitatively, we find that tree-level scattering cross sections are
dramatically suppressed as the center-of-mass energy exceeds the scale of
noncommutativity, that cross sections that are isotropic in the commutative
limit can develop a pronounced angular dependence, and that nonrelativistic
potentials (for example, the Coloumb potential) become nonsingular at the
origin. We consider a number of processes in noncommutative QED that may be
studied at a future linear collider. We also give an example of scattering via
a four-fermion operator in which the noncommutative modifications of the
interaction can unitarize the tree-level amplitude, without requiring any other
new physics in the ultraviolet.

at a ``microscopic'' level of description, for example Lattice Boltzmann, Monte
Carlo or Molecular Dynamics simulators, to perform modelling tasks at

rules restricted to small ""patches"" of the domain, the ""teeth'', using
interpolation to bridge the ""gaps"". Here we explore general boundary conditions
coupling the widely separated ``teeth'' of the microscopic simulation that
achieve high order accuracy over the macroscale. We present the simplest case
when the microscopic simulator is the quintessential example of a partial
differential equation. We argue that classic high-order interpolation of the
macroscopic field provides the correct forcing in whatever boundary condition
is required by the microsimulator. Such interpolation leads to Tooth Boundary
Conditions which achieve arbitrarily high-order consistency. The high-order
consistency is demonstrated on a class of linear partial differential equations
in two ways: firstly through the eigenvalues of the scheme for selected
numerical problems; and secondly using the dynamical systems approach of
holistic discretisation on a general class of linear \textsc{pde}s. Analytic
modelling shows that, for a wide class of microscopic systems, the subgrid
fields and the effective macroscopic model are largely independent of the tooth
size and the particular tooth boundary conditions. When applied to patches of
microscopic simulations these tooth boundary conditions promise efficient
macroscale simulation. We expect the same approach will also accurately couple
patch simulations in higher spatial dimensions.
