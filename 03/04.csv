stars at the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB). We use a Maximum Likelihood
algorithm to locate the TRGB in galaxy color-magnitude diagrams. The algorithm
is optimized by introducing reliable photometric errors and a completeness
characterization determined with artificial star experiments. The program is
extensively tested using Monte-Carlo simulations, artificial galaxies, and a
sample of nearby dwarf galaxies observed with HST/WFPC2 and ACS. Our procedure
is shown to be reliable, to have good accuracy, and to not introduce any
systematic errors. The methodology is especially useful in cases where the TRGB
approaches the photometric limit and/or the RGB is poorly populated.

estimated by assuming that the pulsar radio emission in the main pulse and

100 Jy and 35 Jy for the peak flux densities of giant pulses arising in the
main pulse and interpulse, respectively. This assumes that the normal radio
emission of the pulse occurs in the precursor pulse. In this case, the
longitudes of the giant radio pulses relative to the profile of the normal
radio emission turn out to be the same for the Crab pulsar and the millisecond
pulsar B1937+21, namely, the giant pulses arise at the trailing edge of the

degree of circular polarization for the giant pulses suggests that they can
consist of a random mixture of nanopulses with 100% circular polarization of
either sign, with, on average, hundreds of such nanopulses within a single

mostly FRIIs, it has been clear for some time that a population of radio
galaxies (`low-excitation radio galaxies') cannot easily participate in models
that unify narrow-line radio galaxies and broad-line objects. We show that
low-excitation and narrow-line radio galaxies have systematically different
nuclear X-ray properties: while narrow-line radio galaxies universally show a
heavily absorbed nuclear X-ray component, such a heavily absorbed component is
rarely found in sources classed as low-excitation objects. Combining our data
with the results of our earlier work on the z<0.1 3CRR sources, we discuss the
implications of this result for unified models, for the origins of mid-infrared
emission from radio sources, and for the nature of the apparent FRI/FRII
dichotomy in the X-ray. The lack of direct evidence for accretion-related X-ray
emission in FRII LERGs leads us to argue that there is a strong possibility
that some, or most, FRII LERGs accrete in a radiatively inefficient mode.
However, our results are also consistent with a model in which the accretion
mode is the same for low- and high-excitation FRIIs, with the lower accretion
luminosities in FRII LERGs attributed instead to more efficient radio
luminosity production in those objects.

expressed as functions of the time and six constants called elements. Under
disturbance, the constants are endowed with time dependence. The Lagrange
constraint is then imposed to guarantee that the functional dependence of the
perturbed velocity on the time and constants stays the same as in the
undisturbed case. Constants obeying this condition are called osculating
elements. The constants chosen to be canonical are called Delaunay elements, in
the orbital case, or Andoyer elements, in the spin case. (As some Andoyer
elements are time dependent even in the free-spin case, the role of constants
is played by their initial values.) The Andoyer and Delaunay sets of elements
share a feature not readily apparent: in certain cases the standard equations
render them non-osculating. In orbital mechanics, elements furnished by the
standard planetary equations are non-osculating when perturbations depend on
velocities. To preserve osculation, the equations must be amended with extra
terms that are not parts of the disturbing function. In the case of Delaunay
parameterisation, these terms destroy canonicity. So under velocity-dependent
disturbances, osculation and canonicity are incompatible. (Efroimsky and
Goldreich 2003, 2004) Similarly, the Andoyer elements turn out to be
non-osculating under angular-velocity-dependent perturbation. Amendment of only
the Hamiltonian makes the equations render nonosculating elements. To make them
osculating, more terms must enter the equations (and the equations will no
longer be canonical). In practical calculations, is often convenient to
deliberately deviate from osculation by substituting the Lagrange constraint
with a condition that gives birth to a family of nonosculating elements.

current knowledge about disks in young high-mass (proto)stars and discuss their

conclude that for protostars of less than ~20 solar masses, disks with mass
comparable to that of the central star are common. Above this limit the
situation is unclear and there are no good examples of proto O4-O8 stars
surrounded by accretion disks: in these objects only huge, massive, toroidal,
non-equilibrium rotating structures are seen. It is clear on the other hand
that the observed disks in stars of 10-20 solar masses are likely to be
unstable and with short lifetimes.

clouds to understand the range and distribution of cluster membership, size and
surface density. The Spitzer data demonstrate clearly that there is a continuum
of star- forming environments, from relative isolation to dense clusters. The
number of members of a cluster is correlated with the cluster radius, such that
the average surface density of clusters having a few to a thousand members
varies by a factor of only a few. The spatial distributions of
Spitzer-identified young stellar objects frequently show elongation, low
density halos, and sub-clustering. The spatial distributions of protostars
resemble the distribution of dense molecular gas, suggesting that their
morphologies result directly from the fragmentation of the natal gas. We also
examine the effects of the cluster environments on star and planet formation.
Although Far-UV and Extreme-UV radiation from massive stars can truncate disks
in a few million years, fewer than half of the young stars in our sample

fields. Typical volume densities and lifetimes of the observed clusters suggest
that dynamical interactions are not an important mechanism for truncating disks

imprinted on WMAP maps. The signature of non-Gaussianity can be seen with the

found to be consistent with the contamination of the SZ effect of 2MASS

auto-correlations of the WMAP data generally is weaker than the WMAP-2MASS
cross correlations by a factor f^2, which is the ratio between the powers of SZ
effect map and the CMB fluctuations on the scale considered. Therefore, the
ratio of high order auto-correlations of CMB maps to cross-correlations of the

linked, with dynamical processes altering the chemical composition, and
chemistry, in turn, controlling the ionization structure and hence the ability
of the magneto-rotational instability to drive the disk turbulence. Here we
present the results from the first chemical models of the outer regions (R >
100 AU) of protoplanetary disks to consider the effects of turbulence driven
diffusive mixing in the vertical direction. We show that vertical diffusion can
greatly affect the column densities of many species, increasing them by factors
of up to two orders of magnitude. Previous disk models have shown that disks
can be divided into three chemically distinct layers, with the bulk of the
observed molecular emission coming from a region between an atomic/ionic layer
on the surface of the disk and the midplane regoin where the bulk of molecules
are frozen onto grains. Diffusion retains this three layer structure, but
increases the depth of the molecular layer by bringing atoms and atomic ions
form by photodissociation in the surface layers into the shielded molecular
layer where molecules can reform. For other species, notably NH3 and N2H+, the
column densities are relatively unaffected by diffusion. These species peak in
abundance near the midplane where most other molecules are heavily depleted,
rather than in the molecular layer above. Diffusion only affects the abundances
of those molecules with peak abundances in the molecular layer. We find that
diffusion does not affect the ionization fraction of the disk. We compare the
calculated column densities to observations of DM Tau, LkCa 15 and TW Hya and
find good agreement for many molecules with a diffusion coefficient of 1e18
cm^2 s^-1.

likely to be dormant JFCs because their orbits are dynamically coupled to
Jupiter (Bottke et al, 2002). Then, from the numerical simulations of Levison &
Duncan (1997), we construct an orbit distribution model for JFCs in the NEO
orbital element space. We assume an orbit independent SFD for all JFCs, the
slope of which is our unique free parameter. Finally, we compute observational
biases for dormant JFCs using a calibrated NEO survey simulator (Jedicke et al.
2003). By fitting the biased model to the data, we estimate that there are ~75
dormant JFCs with H<18 in the NEO region and that the slope of their cumulative
SFD is -1.5 +/- 0.3. Our slope for the SFD of dormant JFCs is very close to
that of active JFCs as determined by Weissman and Lowry (2003). Thus, we argue
that when JFCs fade they are likely to become dormant rather than to disrupt
and that the fate of faded comets is size independent. Our results imply that
the size distribution of the JFC progenitors - the scattered disk
trans-Neptunian population - either (i) has a similar and shallow SFD or (i')
is slightly steeper and physical processes acting on the comets in a
size-dependent manner creates the shallower active comet SFD. Our measured
slope, typical of collisionally evolved populations with a size dependent

reached collisional equilibrium inside the proto-planetary disk prior to their

of cosmology (considered to be a generic LCDM model with flat geometry and an
early period of inflation), an update on the current state of research
regarding the problem of negative energy is provided. Arguments are then given
to the effect that traditional assumptions concerning the behavior of
negative-action matter give rise to violations of both the principle of
relativity and the principle of inertia. An alternative set of axioms is
proposed that would govern the behavior of negative-action matter if it is to
be considered a viable element of physical theories upon which cosmological
models are build. A simple framework, based on general relativity and the
proposed axioms, is elaborated which enables the formulation of quantitative
predictions concerning the interaction between positive and negative-action
bodies. Based on those developments, a solution is proposed to the problem of
the discrepancy between current experimental and theoretical values of vacuum
energy density (in any cosmological model), which may also constitute a
solution to the problem of the unexplained coincidence between the
(model-dependent) experimental values of vacuum energy density and present-day,

show that the Einstein-Hilbert action, restricted to a space of Sasakian
metrics on a link L in a Calabi-Yau cone X, is the volume functional, which in
fact is a function on the space of Reeb vector fields. We relate this function
both to the Duistermaat-Heckman formula and also to a limit of a certain
equivariant index on X that counts holomorphic functions. Both formulae may be
evaluated by localisation. This leads to a general formula for the volume
function in terms of topological fixed point data. As a result we prove that
the volume of a Sasaki-Einstein manifold, relative to that of the round sphere,
is always an algebraic number. In complex dimension n=3 these results provide,
via AdS/CFT, the geometric counterpart of a-maximisation in four dimensional

describing Langmuir turbulence. We give an existence theorem for a class of
singular quasilinear equations. This theorem is valid for well-prepared initial

laser-plasma interactions, to obtain, in a high-frequency limit, an asymptotic
estimate that describes solutions of the Euler-Maxwell equations in terms of
WKB approximate solutions which leading terms are solutions of the Zakharov
equations. Because of transparency properties of the Euler-Maxwell equations,
this study is led in a supercritical (highly nonlinear) regime. In such a
regime, resonances between plasma waves, electromagnetric waves and acoustic
waves could create instabilities in small time. The key of this work is the
control of these resonances. The proof involves the techniques of geometric
optics of Joly, M\'etivier and Rauch, recent results of Lannes on norms of
pseudodifferential operators, and a semiclassical, paradifferential calculus.

detected near the $\Sigma$ production threshold in the $\Lambda N$ mass
spectrum.

cross-section data of the $^{12}$C+$^{24}$Mg system around the Coulomb barrier
and over energies by using the microscopic $\alpha$-$\alpha$ double folding
cluster potential within the framework of the optical model and the
coupled-channels formalism. The $\alpha$-$\alpha$ double folding cluster
potential is obtained by using the $\alpha$-cluster distribution densities of
the nuclei in the usual double folding procedure. The microscopic potential
results are compared with the findings of the phenomenological deep and shallow
potentials. It is subsequently shown that only phenomenological deep real,
microscopic nucleon-nucleon and $\alpha$-$\alpha$ double folding cluster
potentials provide a consistent description of the angular distributions and
fusion cross-section data simultaneously. The effect of the inclusion of the
excited states of the target nucleus $^{24}$Mg on the fusion cross-section
predictions is also determined by the coupled-channels calculations, which are
shown to improve the agreement.

being most efficient for (2n+1)pi-pulses.

of a considerable amount of recent attention in the physics literature. These
models divide into two classes, those in which individuals form their beliefs
based on the opinions of their neighbors in a social network of personal
acquaintances, and those in which, conversely, network connections form between
individuals of similar beliefs. While both of these processes can give rise to
realistic levels of agreement between acquaintances, practical experience
suggests that opinion formation in the real world is not a result of one
process or the other, but a combination of the two. Here we present a simple
model of this combination, with a single parameter controlling the balance of
the two processes. We find that the model undergoes a continuous phase
transition as this parameter is varied, from a regime in which opinions are
arbitrarily diverse to one in which most individuals hold the same opinion. We
characterize the static and dynamical properties of this transition.

additional variables (the particle positions) besides the wave function,
whereas the latter implements spontaneous collapses of the wave function by a
nonlinear and stochastic modification of Schr\""odinger's equation. Still, both
theories, when understood appropriately, share the following structure: They
are ultimately not about wave functions but about ``matter'' moving in space,
represented by either particle trajectories, fields on space-time, or a
discrete set of space-time points. The role of the wave function then is to
govern the motion of the matter.
