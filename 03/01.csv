windowing out the extended rotating component which dominates the photometric

spectroscopic fields spread over an 8 square degree region, and are expected to
fairly sample the halo to a radius of $\sim$70 kpc. The halo sample shows no
significant evidence for rotation. Fitting a simple model in which the velocity
dispersion of the component decreases with radius, we find a central velocity
dispersion of $152\kms$ decreasing by $-0.90\kms/\kpc$. By fitting a
cosmologically-motivated NFW halo model to the halo stars we constrain the
virial mass of M31 to be greater than $9.0 \times 10^{11} \msun$ with 99%

photometric observations which we obtained using the Magellan telescope and

detected in our Chandra data, with a 95 per cent confidence limit to the source
count rate of 1.2x10^-4 counts s^-1. For different spectral models this yields
an upper limit on the luminosity of 1.8x10^31 erg s^-1 (for an upper limit on
the distance of 10 kpc.) This luminosity limit makes 1H1905+000 the faintest
neutron star SXT in quiescence observed to date. The neutron star luminosity is
so low that it is similar to the lowest luminosities derived for black hole
SXTs in quiescence. This low luminosity for a neutron star SXT challanges the
hypothesis presented in the literature that black hole SXTs in quiescence have
lower luminosities than neutron star SXTs as a result of the presence of a
black hole event horizon. Furthermore, the limit on the neutron star luminosity
obtained less than 20 years after the outburst has ceased, constrains the
thermal conductivity of the neutron star crust. Finally, the neutron star core
must be so cold that unless the time averaged mass accretion rate is lower than
2x10^-12 M_sun yr^-1, core cooling has to proceed via enhanced neutrino
emission processes. We derive a limit on the absolute I-band magnitude of the
quiescent counterpart of M_I>7.8 assuming the source is at 10 kpc. This is in
line with 1H1905+000 being an ultra-compact X-ray binary, as has been proposed

constraints on local curvature to probe actual ridges in the galaxy

$\cal{L}$, in the SDSS survey is found to be ${\cal{L}}=(52500\pm6500) (L/{\rm

significantly sensitive to observational biases such as redshift distortion,

stars hotter than a threshold temperature have super-solar abundance, while the
cooler ones respect the nominal metallicity of the cluster, i.e. [Fe/H] ~ -1.1.
The threshold temperature is estimated to be about 12000 K, corresponding to
the so called u-jump, and coincides with the sudden departure of the cluster
horizontal branch from the models. The metallicity increases with temperature
for star hotter than the jump, confirming the hypothesis that the process
responsible for this abrupt metallic enhancement is the levitation due to the
strong radiation field in absence of a significative convective envelope. A
metallicity dependence of the abundance enhancement is also suggested, with
more metal poor clusters having a higher increase in metal content. The slope
in the temperature vs. abundance diagram is higher than the errors involved,
and the metal content of the cluster plays possibly a role in determining the
amplitude of the jump (more metal poor clusters show more enhancement after the
jump), although other parameters, such as clusters' characteristics and even
the atomic species involved, may also someway contribute.

local galaxies, and the available data show an empirical correlation between
bulge luminosity - or stellar velocity dispersion - and black hole mass,
suggesting a single mechanism for assembling black holes and forming spheroids
in galaxy halos. The evidence is therefore in favour of a co-evolution between
galaxies, black holes and quasars. In cold dark matter cosmogonies, small-mass
subgalactic systems form first to merge later into larger and larger
structures. In this paradigm galaxy halos experience multiple mergers during
their lifetime. If every galaxy with a bulge hosts a SMBH in its center, and a
local galaxy has been made up by multiple mergers, then a black hole binary is
a natural evolutionary stage. The evolution of the supermassive black hole
population clearly has to be investigated taking into account both the
cosmological framework and the dynamical evolution of SMBHs and their hosts.
The seeds of SMBHs have to be looked for in the early Universe, as very
luminous quasars are detected up to redshift higher than z=6. These black holes
evolve then in a hierarchical fashion, following the merger hierarchy of their
host halos. Accretion of gas, traced by quasar activity, plays a fundamental
role in determining the two parameters defining a black hole: mass and spin. A
particularly intriguing epoch is the initial phase of SMBH growth. It is very
challenging to meet the observational constraints at z=6 if BHs are not fed at
very high rates in their infancy.

constrained by the measured ratio of boron to carbon nuclei in cosmic rays, we
investigate the viability of the model using the DarkSUSY package to compute

The resulting data offer the best view yet obtained of the inner accretion flow
geometry in the low-hard state, which is thought to be analogous to the
geometry in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. The XMM-Newton spectra
clearly reveal the presence of a cool accretion disk component, and a
relativistic Fe K emission line. The results of fits made to both components
strongly suggest that a standard thin disk remains at or near to the innermost
stable circular orbit, at least in bright phases of the low-hard state. These
findings indicate that potential links between the inner disk radius and the
onset of a steady compact jet, and the paradigm of a radially-recessed disk in
the low-hard state, do not hold universally. The results of our observations
can best be explained if a standard thin accretion disk fuels a corona which is
closely related to, or consistent with, the base of a compact jet. In a brief
examination of archival data, we show that Cygnus X-1 supports this picture of
the low/hard state. We discuss our results within the context of disk-jet

colour temperature of the cold component slightly varies between 15.8 and 17.3
K (beta=2, Delta(T)=0.5 K). The ratio between the 200 microns emission of the

is significantly lower than that of the cold component. The Halpha emission and
Av correlate very well; a ratio I(Halpha)/Av=2.2 Rayleigh/mag is observed. This
correlation indicates the presence of a source of ionisation that can penetrate
deeply into the cloud. Using the ratio I(Halpha)/Av we have estimated a

this relatively high value as due to an enhanced cosmic ray flux of ~10 times

collimated jets from evolved stars before evolution to the planetary nebula
phase. The source of jet collimation in these stars is unknown. Magnetic fields
are thought to collimate outflows that are observed in many other astrophysical
sources, such as active galactic nuclei and proto-stars, although hitherto
there are no direct observations of both the magnetic field direction and
strength in any collimated jet. Theoretical models have shown that magnetic
fields could also be the dominant source of collimation of jet in evolved
stars. Here we report measurements of the polarization of water vapour masers
that trace the precessing jet emanating from the asymptotic giant branch star
W43A at 2.6 kpc from the Sun, which is undergoing rapid evolution into a
planetary nebula. The masers occur in two clusters at opposing tips of the
jets, ~1,000 AU from the star. We find direct evidence that the magnetic field
is collimating the jet.

  (Hawaii, October 2005)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  It has now been known for over a decade that low-mass stars located in
star-forming regions are very frequently members of binary and multiple
systems, even more so than main sequence stars in the solar neighborhood. This
high multiplicity rate has been interpreted as the consequence of the
fragmentation of small molecular cores into a few seed objects that accrete to
their final mass from the remaining material and dynamically evolve into stable
multiple systems, possibly producing a few ejecta in the process. Analyzing the
statistical properties of young multiple systems in a variety of environments
therefore represents a powerful approach to place stringent constraints on star
formation theories. In this contribution, we first review a number of recent
results related to the multiplicity of T Tauri stars. We then present a series
of studies focusing on the multiplicity and properties of optically-undetected,
heavily embedded protostars. These objects are much younger than the previously
studied pre-main sequence stars, and they therefore offer a closer look at the
primordial population of multiple systems. In addition to these observational
avenues, we present new results of a series of numerical simulations that
attempt to reproduce the fragmentation of small molecular cores into multiple
systems, and compare these results to the observations.

analysis to eliminate astronomical systems where light from a faint eclipsing

Trans-atlantic Exoplanet Survey, we identified a system presenting a
transit-like periodic signal. We obtained the proper motion and infrared color
of this target (GSC 03885-00829) from publicly available catalogs, which
suggested this star is an F dwarf, supporting our transit hypothesis. This
spectral classification was confirmed using spectroscopic observations from
which we determined the stellar radial velocity. The star did not exhibit any
signs of a stellar mass companion. However, subsequent multi-color photometry
displayed a color-dependent transit depth, indicating that a blend was the
likely source of the eclipse. We successfully modeled our initial photometric
observations of GSC 03885-00829 as the light from a K dwarf binary system
superimposed on the light from a late F dwarf star. High-dispersion
spectroscopy confirmed the presence of light from a cool stellar photosphere in
the spectrum of this system. With this candidate, we demonstrate both the
difficulty in identifying certain types of false positives in a list of
candidate transiting planets and our procedure for rejecting these imposters,

parameter-fitting model that assumes four sources of luminosity: a white dwarf

Although models with a truncated inner disk (R_in >> R_wd) result in a steeper
temperature profile, steady-state models with a temperature profile

mass ejections (CMEs), a major form of solar activity in the corona. The
mechanisms for magnetic energy storage are crucial in understanding how a field
may possess enough free energy to overcome the Aly limit and open up.
Previously, we have pointed out that the accumulation of magnetic helicity in
the corona plays a significant role in storing magnetic energy. In this paper,
we investigate another hydromagnetic consequence of magnetic-helicity
accumulation. We propose a conjecture that there is an upper bound on the total
magnetic helicity that a force-free field can contain. This is directly related
to the hydromagnetic property that force-free fields in unbounded space have to
be self-confining. Although a mathematical proof of this conjecture for any
field configuration is formidable, its plausibility can be demonstrated with
the properties of several families of power-law, axisymmetric force-free
fields. We put forth mathematical evidence, as well as numerical, indicating
that an upper bound on the magnetic helicity may exist for such fields. Thus,
the accumulation of magnetic helicity in excess of this upper bound would
initiate a non-equilibrium situation, resulting in a CME expulsion as a natural
product of coronal evolution.

general the inter-site Coulomb interaction stabilizes Wigner crystal-type
charge ordered states, where the charge localizes in an arranged manner
avoiding each other, and can drive the system insulating. The variety in the
lattice structures, represented by anisotropic networks in not only the
electron hopping but also in the inter-site Coulomb repulsion, brings about
diverse problems in low-dimensional strongly correlated systems. Competitions
and/or co-existences between the charge ordered state and other states are
discussed, such as metal, superconductor, and the dimer-type Mott insulating
state which is another typical insulating state in molecular conductors.
Interplay with magnetism, e.g., antiferromagnetic state and spin gapped state
for example due to the spin-Peierls transition, is considered as well. Distinct
situations are pointed out: influences of the coupling to the lattice degree of
freedom and effects of geometrical frustration which exists in many molecular
crystals. Some related topics, such as charge order in transition metal oxides
and its role in new molecular conductors, are briefly remarked.

increase to Tc. The extrapolation of these measured dependencies to the region
near superconducting transition allows to make a calibration of asymmetric

an amplitude of the quantum oscillations induced by this noise. It is found
that rectification efficiency, determined as relation of the maximum amplitude

below Tc is consequence of irreversibility of the current-voltage curves.
Increase of the rectification efficiency is achieved in multiple series

addition to be plausible), i.e. they are capable of drawing reasonable
conclusions which contain contradictions. We will provide in our general
framework syntactic characterizations of several families of pivotal relations.
In addition, we will provide, again in our general framework, characterizations
of several families of pivotal discriminative consequence relations. The latter
are defined exactly as the plain version, but contradictory conclusions are
rejected. We will also answer negatively a representation problem that was left
open by Makinson. Finally, we will put in evidence a connexion with X-logics
from Forget, Risch, and Siegel. The motivations and the framework of the
present paper are very close to those of a previous paper of the author which
is about preferential consequence relations.

that the effect which produces the NUT parameter in a more general situation
remains essentially the same as in the purely NUT solutions: it introduces the
semi-infinite singularities of infinite angular momenta and positive or
negative masses depending on the interrelations between the parameters; the
presence of the electromagnetic field additionally endows the singularities
with electric and magnetic charges. The exact formulae describing the mass,

derive from kinetic theory up to second order (Israel-Stewart theory) in a
systematic gradient expansion. In model studies, we then establish that for too
early initialization of the hydrodynamic evolution ($\tau_0 \lsim 1$ fm/c) or
for too high transverse momentum ($p_T \gsim 1$ GeV) in the final state, the
expected dissipative corrections are too large for a fluid description to be
reliable. Moreover, viscosity-induced modifications of hadronic transverse
momentum spectra can be accommodated to a significant degree in an ideal fluid
description by modifications of the decoupling stage. We argue that these
conclusions, drawn from model studies, can also be expected to arise in
significantly more complex, realistic fluid dynamics simulations of heavy ion
collisions.

hypercharge and local gauge invariance of the Lagrangian density under the
gauge group SU(2) x U(1). Taylor has remarked that U(1), being a
multiply-connected group, in general, should have different coupling strengths
for singlets and doublets. But in the development of the standard model, even
for U(1), the coupling strength has been taken to be the same for all the
multiplets without a priori justification. Wilczek has pointed out that the
assignment of hypercharge values to left- and right-handed leptons and quarks
is very peculiar. However, no solution has been provided. Ellis has also
reservations for the rather bizarre set up of group representations and
hypercharges. It has also been noticed that, in addition to the above weak
points of the model, the generator of the group U(1) is changed at different
stages during a single analysis. In this paper, a new basis is provided that
avoids these peculiar and odd concepts and hypercharge assignments, and a
satisfactory solution is given for the first time. This is done by generalising
the expression for the transformation law for 4-vector potential in
electromagnetism. It gives exactly the same results as obtained in the standard
model for electroweak interactions.

a two-throat geometry. We study KK mode wavefunctions of the full two-throat
system in the Randall--Sundrum (RS) approximation and find an interesting
subtlety in the calculation of the KK mode tunnelling rate. While wavepacket
tunnelling is suppressed unless the Standard Model throat is very long,
wavefunctions of modes localized in different throats have a non-zero overlap
and energy can be transferred between the throats by interactions between such
KK modes. The corresponding decay rates are calculated and found to be faster
than the tunnelling rates found in previously published works. However, it
turns out that the imaginary parts of the mode frequencies, induced by the
decay, slow the decay rates themselves down. The self-consistent decay rate
turns out to be given by the plane wave tunnelling rate considered previously
in the literature. We then discuss mechanisms that may enhance the energy
transfer between the throats over the RS rates. In particular, we study models
in which the warp factor changes in the UV region less abruptly than in the RS
model, and find that it is easy to build phenomenological models in which the
plane wave tunnelling rate, and hence the KK mode interaction rates, are
enhanced compared to the standard RS setup.

ordinary particles has led to a program to search for violations of Lorentz
invariance as a probe of quantum gravity. Initially it was expected that
observable macroscopic effects caused by microscopic violations of Lorentz
invariance would necessarily be suppressed by at least one power of the small
ratio between the Planck length and macroscopic lengths. Here we discuss the
implications of the fact that this expectation is in contradiction with
standard properties of radiative corrections in quantum field theories. In
normal field theories, radiative corrections in the presence of microscopic
Lorentz violation give macroscopic Lorentz violation that is suppressed only by
the size of Standard Model couplings, in clear conflict with observation. In
general, this conclusion can only be avoided by extreme fine tuning of the
parameters of the theory.

Ballmann and Wojtkovski proved that the dynamical entropy $h_{\mu}$ of the

Riemannian curvature of $M$, and $\mu$ is the normalized Liouville measure on

submanifold $N$ of $M,$ given by the regular level set of a Hamiltonian
function on $M$; moreover we consider a smooth Lagrangian distribution of rank
$n-1$ on $N,$ and we assume that the reduced curvature $\hat{R}_z^h$ of the

The aim is to classify subsets of Hilbert spaces that are contained in a
connected set of finite Hausdorff length. We do so by extending and improving
results of Peter Jones and Kate Okikiolu for sets in $\R^d$. Their results
formed the basis of quantitative rectifiability in $\R^d$. We prove a
quantitative version of the following statement: a connected set of finite
Hausdorff length (or a subset of one), is characterized by the fact that inside
balls at most scales around most points of the set, the set lies close to a
straight line segment (which depends on the ball). This is done via a quantity,
similar to the one introduced in \cite{Jones90}, which is a geometric analog of
the Square function. This allows us to conclude that for a given set $K$, the
$\ell_2$ norm of this quantity (which is a function of $K$) has size comparable
to a shortest (Hausdorff length) connected set containing $K$. In particular,
our results imply that, with a correct reformulation of the theorems, the
estimates in \cite{Jones90,Okik92} are {\bf independent of the ambient
dimension}.

recursively to uncover new features. We generate a variety of masking functions
and `extract' features with several generalized matching pursuit iterations. In
each iteration, the recursive process modifies several coefficients of the
transformed signal with the largest absolute values according to the specific
masking function; in this way the greedy pursuit is turned into a slow,
controlled, dissipation of the structure of the signal that, for some masking
functions, enhances separation among classes.

technologically constructed networks are scale free, that means a power law
degree distribution emerges from a growth model in which each new node attaches
to the existing network with a probability proportional to its number of links
(=degree). Little is known about whether the same principles of local
attachment and global properties apply to societies as well. Empirical evidence
from six ethnographic case studies shows that complex social networks have
significantly lower scaling exponents gamma ~ 1 than have been assumed in the
past. Apparently humans do not only look for the most prominent players to play
with. Moreover cooperation in humans is characterized through reciprocity, the
tendency to give to those from whom one has received in the past. Both
variables -- reciprocity and the scaling exponent -- are negatively correlated
($r=-0.767, sig=0.075$). If we include this effect in simulations of growing
networks, degree distributions emerge that are much closer to those empirically
observed. While the proportion of nodes with small degrees decreases
drastically as we introduce reciprocity, the scaling exponent is more robust
and changes only when a relatively large proportion of attachment decisions
follow this rule. If social networks are less scale free than previously
assumed this has far reaching implications for policy makers, public health
programs and marketing alike.

of the fundamental problems in large scale mining of spectra is to design

to avoid pair-wise comparisons. We first robustly embed spectra in a high

neighbor algorithms for tasks such as constructing filters for database search,
indexing and similarity searching. We formally prove that our embedding has low
distortion compared to the cosine similarity, and, along with locality
sensitive hashing (LSH), we design filters for database search that can filter

searching, which can then be used to detect tight clusters or replicates. On an
average, for a cluster size of 16 spectra, LSH only misses 1 spectrum and
admits only 1 false spectrum. In addition, our framework in conjunction with
dimension reduction techniques allow us to visualize large datasets in 2D

able to use different coreceptors, in particular the CCR5 and CXCR4 coreceptors
(R5 and X4 phenotypes, respectively). The switch in coreceptor usage has been
correlated with a faster progression of the disease to the AIDS phase. As
several pharmaceutical companies are starting large phase III trials for R5 and
X4 drugs, models are needed to predict the co-evolutionary and competitive
dynamics of virus strains. We present a model of HIV early infection which
describes the dynamics of R5 quasispecies and a model of HIV late infection
which describes the R5 to X4 switch. We report the following findings: after
superinfection or coinfection, quasispecies dynamics has time scales of several
months and becomes even slower at low number of CD4+ T cells. The curve of CD4+
T cells decreases, during AIDS late stage, and can be described taking into
account the X4 related Tumor Necrosis Factor dynamics. Phylogenetic inference
of chemokine receptors suggests that viral mutational pathway may generate R5
variants able to interact with chemokine receptors different from CXCR4. This
may explain the massive signaling disruptions in the immune system observed

that the underlying system dynamics represented by a quantum stochastic
differential equation must be known exactly in order that the corresponding
filter provides an optimal performance; however, this assumption is generally
unrealistic. Therefore, in this paper, we consider a class of linear quantum
systems subjected to time-varying norm-bounded parametric uncertainties and
then propose a robust observer such that the variance of the estimation error
is guaranteed to be within a certain bound. Although in the linear case much of
classical control theory can be applied to quantum systems, the quantum robust
observer obtained in this paper does not have a classical analogue due to the
system's specific structure with respect to the uncertainties. Moreover, by
considering a typical quantum control problem, we show that the proposed robust
observer is fairly robust against a parametric uncertainty of the system even
when the other estimators--the optimal Kalman filter and risk-sensitive
observer--fail in the estimation.

temperature correction to the Casimir force, for metallic plates of finite
conductivity. The very interesting result of this study is that the correction
from the TE mode is dominated by low frequencies, for which the dielectric
description of the metal is invalid. However, their analysis of the problem,
based on more appropriate low-frequency metallic boundary conditions, uses an
incorrect form of boundary conditions for TE modes. We repeat their analysis,
using the correct boundary conditions. Our computations confirm their most
important result: contrary to the result of the dielectric model, the thermal
TE mode correction leads to an increase in the TE mode force of attraction
between the plates. The magnitude of the correction has a value about twenty
times larger than that quoted by them.

quantum vacuum in the neighborhood of material systems. The model could help
resolve the cosmological paradox associated to the zero-point energy of
