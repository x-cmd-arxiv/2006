luminosities of these AGN are estimated to be -24 > M_B > -26, but optical
obscuration allows their host galaxies to be studied unencumbered by bright
nuclei. Each object has been imaged in three continuum filters (`UV', `blue'
and `yellow') placed between the strong emission lines. The spectacular, high
quality images reveal a wealth of details about the structure of the host
galaxies and their environments. Six of the nine galaxies in the sample are
ellipticals with de Vaucouleurs light profiles, one object has a well-defined
disk component and the remaining two have marginal disks. Stellar populations
of type II quasar hosts are more luminous (by a median of 0.3-0.7 mag,
depending on the wavelength) and bluer (by about 0.4 mag) than are M* galaxies
at the same redshift. When smooth fits to stellar light are subtracted from the
images, we find both positive and negative residuals that become more prominent
toward shorter wavelengths. We argue that the negative residuals are due to
kpc-scale dust obscuration, while most positive residuals are due to the light
from the nucleus scattered off interstellar material in the host galaxy.
Scattered light makes a significant contribution to the broad band continuum
emission and can be the dominant component of the extended emission in the UV
in extreme cases.

calibrated with Cepheid distances can be used to determine the Hubble constant.
The Cepheid distances to host galaxies of the calibrating supernovae are
usually obtained using the period-luminosity (PL) relation derived from Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) Cepheids. However recent empirical studies provide
evidence that the LMC PL relation is not linear. In this Letter we determine
the Hubble constant using both the linear and non-linear LMC Cepheid PL
relations as calibrating relations to four galaxies that hosted Type Ia
supernovae. Our results suggest that the obtained values of the Hubble constant
are similar. However a typical error of $\sim0.03$mag. has to be added (in
quadrature) to the systematic error for the Hubble constant when the linear LMC
PL relation is used, assuming that the LMC PL relation is indeed non-linear.
This is important in minimizing the total error of the Hubble constant in the
era of precision cosmology. The Hubble constants calibrated from the linear and
non-linear LMC PL relation are H_0 = 74.92+-2.28(random)+-5.06(systematic)

have made it necessary to put the summary on H_0 on a broader basis than
originally thought, making four preparatory papers necessary. The new Cepheid
distances of the subset of 10 galaxies, which were hosts of normal SNeIa, give
weighted mean luminosities in B, V, and I at maximum light of -19.49, -19.46,

21cm-line widths, and the tip of the red-giant branch (TRGB) all agree within
5% of our global value. This agreement of H_0 on all scales from 4 - 200 Mpc
finds its most obvious explanation in the smoothing effect of vacuum energy on
the otherwise lumpy gravitational field due to the non-uniform distribution of
the local galaxies. The physical methods of time delay of gravitational lenses
and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect are consistent (but with large errors) with
our global value. The present result is also not in contradiction with existing
analyses of CMB data, because they either lead to wide error margins of H_0 or
depend on the choice of unwarrented priors that couple the value of H_0 with a
number of otherwise free parameters in the CMB acoustic waves. Our value of H_0
is 14% smaller than the value of H_0 found by Freedman et al. (2001) because
our independent Cepheid distances to the six SNeIa-calibrating galaxies used in

$\Delta \log \sigma=0.15 \pm 0.03 \pm 0.06$, where the error bars include a

is a 3 by 2 square degree field centred on 09 51 36.0 -21 00 00 (J2000). This
paper presents K-band imaging of 142 of the 150 CENSORS sources. The primary
motivation for beginning infrared imaging of the sample was to identify the
host galaxies of the ~30% of sources for which the EIS I-band imaging failed to
produce a likely candidate. In addition, K-band magnitudes allow photometric
redshift estimation and I - K colours aid the identification of host galaxies
(which are typically old, red ellipticals). Of the sources observed in the I
and K-bands, four remain undetected, possibly indicating high redshifts for the
host galaxies, and eight involve complicated radio structures, or several
candidate host galaxies, which have yet to be resolved. Thus, the host galaxy
identifications are brought to 92% completeness.
  In conjunction with spectroscopic observations, the K-band magnitudes have
been aperture corrected and used to establish a K-z relation for the CENSORS
radio galaxies. This relation is of interest because of its variation, at z >
1, between radio surveys of different flux-density limit. Establishing this
relation for CENSORS may shed light on the origin of this variation and will
allow an appropriate K-z redshift estimator for any CENSORS source which
remains without a spectroscopic redshift. It is shown that whilst the K-z

majority of the BCGs are not particularly infrared-luminous compared with other
massive early-type galaxies, suggesting that the cluster environment has little
influence on the infrared luminosities of the BCGs. The exceptions, however,
are the BCGs in the three X-ray-brightest clusters in the sample, A1835, Z3146,
and A2390. These BCGs have a prominent far-infrared peak in their spectral
energy distributions (SEDs), and two of them (those in A1835 and Z3146) can be
classified as luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs: L_{IR} > 10^{11} L_{sun}).
Although radio AGNs are found to be prevalent among the BCGs, the infrared
luminosities of these three BCGs, judged from the infrared SED signatures, are
likely to be powered by star formation. Considering the overall trend that
clusters with shorter radiative gas cooling times harbor more infrared-luminous
BCGs, the enhanced star formation may be caused by the cooling cluster gas
accreting onto the BCGs.

autonomous slew to a newly detected Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) has yielded the
discovery of interesting new properties of GRB X-ray afterglows, such as the
steep early lightcurve decay and the frequent presence of flares detected up to
a few hours after the GRB trigger. We present observations of GRB 050607, the
fourth case of a GRB discovered by Swift with flares superimposed on the
overall fading X-ray afterglow. The flares of GRB 050607 were not symmetric as
in previously reported cases, showing a very steep rise and a shallower decay,
similar to the Fast Rise, Exponential Decay that are frequently observed in the
gamma-ray prompt emission. The brighter flare had a flux increase by a factor
of approximately 25,peaking for 30 seconds at a count rate of approximately 30
counts s-1, and it presented hints of addition short time scale activity during
the decay phase. There is evidence of spectral evolution during the flares. In
particular, at the onset of the flares the observed emission was harder, with a
gradual softening as each flare decayed. The very short time scale and the
spectral variability during the flaring activity are indicators of possible
extended periods of energy emission by the GRB central engine. The flares were
followed by a phase of shallow decay, during which the forward shock was being
refreshed by a long-lived central engine or by shells of lower Lorentz factors,
and by a steepening after approximately 12 ks to a decay slope considered
typical of X-ray afterglows.

annihilation line emission have been observed in the Galactic Center (GC)
region. Although X-ray observations indicate that the galactic black hole Sgr
A$^*$ is inactive now, we suggest that Sgr A$^*$ can become active when a
captured star is tidally disrupted and matter is accreted into the black hole.
As a consequence the galactic black hole could be a powerful source of
relativistic protons. We are able to explain the current observed diffuse
gamma-rays and the very detailed 511 keV annihilation line of secondary
positrons by $p-p$ collisions of such protons, with appropriate injection times
and energy. Relativistic protons could have been injected into the ambient
material if the black hole captured a 50M$_\odot$ star at several tens million
years ago. An alternative possibility is that the black hole continues to
capture stars with $\sim$1M$_\odot$ every hundred thousand years. Secondary
positrons produced by $p-p$ collisions at energies $\ga 30$ MeV are cooled down
to thermal energies by Coulomb collisions, and annihilate in the warm neutral
and ionized phases of the interstellar medium with temperatures about several
eV, because the annihilation cross-section reaches its maximum at these
temperatures. It takes about ten million years for the positrons to cool down
to thermal temperatures so they can diffuse into a very large extended region
around the Galactic center. A much more recent star capture may be also able to
account for recent TeV observations within 10 pc of the galactic center as well
as for the unidentified GeV gamma-ray sources found by EGRET at GC. The
spectral difference between the GeV flux and the TeV flux could be explained
naturally in this model as well.

of the CMB maps cross-correlate with the foregrounds, suggestion the presence
of residual contamination in the DLC map even on these large scales. We also

low-metallicity cold gaseous discs around small galaxies. Since the space
density of galaxies with low circular speeds is high, these discs dominate the
cross-section for the identification of DLAs at all redshifts. The combined
effects of star formation, outflows and infall in our models result in mild
evolution of the N_{HI}-weighted metallicity content in DLAs with redshift,
consistent with observations. According to our model, DLAs contribute only a
small fraction of the volume averaged star formation rate at redshifts z \simlt
5. Our model predicts weak evolution in Omega_{HI} over the redshift range
z=0-5. Furthermore, we show that the cosmological evolution of Omega_{HI} and
the cosmic star formation rate are largely disconnected and conclude that the
evolution of Omega_{HI} as a function of redshift is more likely to tell us
about feedback processes and the evolution of the outer gaseous components of
small galaxies than about the cosmic history of star formation.

containing a pair of giant planets engaged in a low order mean motion
resonance. Such a resonant condition protects the dynamics of these planets
resulting in very stable orbits. According to recent studies the capture into a
resonance is the result of a planetary migration process induced by the
interaction of the planets with a protoplanetary disk. If the migration is slow
enough (adiabatic) next to a mean motion resonance, the two planets will also
be in apsidal corotation.
  The recently refined orbital parameters of the system HD 128311 suggest that
the two giant planets are in a 2:1 mean motion resonance, however without
exhibiting apsidal corotation. Thus the evolution of this system can not be
described by an adiabatic migration process alone.
  We present possible evolution scenarios of this system combining migration
processes and sudden perturbations. We model migration scenarios through
numerical integration of the gravitational N-body problem with additional
non-conservative forces. Planet-planet scattering has been investigated by
N-body simulations.
  We show that the present dynamical state of the system HD128311 may be
explained by such evolutionary processes.

this detection is spurious, the 5 sigma upper limit would give a robust upper

similar to those of two previously identified RSG progenitors of the Type II-P

vapor in the source S140 in order to make models to plan for, and to interpret,
HIFI data. Level populations are calculated with the use of a three-dimensional
(multi-zone) escape probability method and with a long characteristic code that
uses Monte Carlo techniques with fixed directions. Homogeneous and
inhomogeneous models are used to compute the differences between water line
profiles across the S140 region. We find that when an outflow or infall
velocity field with a gradient of a few kms^{-1} is adopted, line profiles with
a FWHM of 6 kms^{-1} are found, in agreement with observations. Inhomogeneous
models are favoured to produce a single-peaked line profile. When zooming in on
smaller regions within the PDR, the shapes of the line profiles start to differ
due to the different temperature and density distributions there. The embedded
sources are traced by high excitation lines of, e.g., 3_{21}-2_{21},
3_{03}-2_{12}, 2_{12}-1_{01} and 2_{20}-1_{11}. The computed intensities are
roughly consistent with existing ISO observations. Water emission in a PDR
source like S140 requires a combination of a pure PDR and an embedded source in
order to match the observations. Because of its good angular resolution, HIFI
will be able to distinguish between a dense star forming region or a more
diffuse gas component. It is therefore important for future observing programs
to consider both in their predictions of the emission characteristics of water
in these environments.

angular momentum evolution of young stellar objects and brown dwarfs from a
primarily observational view point. Periods are typically accurate to 1% and
available for about 1700 stars and 30 brown dwarfs in young clusters.
Discussion of angular momentum evolution also requires knowledge of stellar
radii, which are poorly known for pre-main sequence stars. It is clear that
rotation rates at a given age depend strongly on mass; higher mass stars
(0.4-1.2 M$_\odot$) have longer periods than lower mass stars and brown dwarfs.
On the other hand, specific angular momentum is approximately independent of
mass for low mass pre-main sequence stars and young brown dwarfs. A spread of
about a factor of 30 is seen at any given mass and age. The evolution of
rotation of solar-like stars during the first 100 Myr is discussed. A broad,
bimodal distribution exists at the earliest observable phases ($\sim$1 Myr) for
stars more massive than 0.4 M$_\odot$. The rapid rotators (50-60% of the
sample) evolve to the ZAMS with little or no angular momentum loss. The slow
rotators continue to lose substantial amounts of angular momentum for up to 5
Myr, creating the even broader bimodal distribution characteristic of 30-120
Myr old clusters. Accretion disk signatures are more prevalent among slowly
rotating PMS stars, indicating a connection between accretion and rotation.
Disks appear to influence rotation for, at most, $\sim$5 Myr, and considerably
less than that for the majority of stars. If the dense clusters studied so far
are an accurate guide, then the typical solar-like star may have only $\sim$1
Myr for this task. It appears that both disk interactions and stellar winds are
less efficient at braking these objects.

sensitive to small changes of the microscopic interactions, while others, such
as the presence of more than one crystal or a possible phase transition between
two liquids with different local structures, are predicted not only in water,

relevant in biological processes, the possibility of a wide class of liquids

place in nuclei at low energies. In this paper we suggest some problems for
future experimental and theoretical work related to the resonance chemistry of
ultracold molecules. Molecular Bose-Einstein condensates are particularly
interesting because in this system collisions and chemical reactions are
extremely sensitive to weak fields; also, a preferred reaction channel may be
enhanced due to a finite number of final states. The sensitivity to weak fields
arises due to the high density of narrow compound resonances and the
macroscopic number of molecules with kinetic energy E=0 (in the ground state of
a mean-field potential). The high sensitivity to the magnetic field may be used
to measure the distribution of energy intervals, widths, and magnetic moments
of compound resonances and study the onset of quantum chaos. A difference in
the production rate of right-handed and left-handed chiral molecules may be
produced by external electric and magnetic fields and the finite width of the
resonance. The same effect may be produced by the parity-violating energy
difference in chiral molecules.

single quasiparticle is present in the qubit. Tunneling of a quasiparticle

coherences and populations. We find that the kinetics of the qubit can be
characterized by two time scales - quasiparticle escape time from reservoir to

former is determined by the dimensionless normal-state conductance $g_T$ of the

$\gamma>3$. However, $S(N,t)$ for $\gamma<3$ has a long-living tail on
tree-structured scale-free networks and decays exponentially on looped
scale-free networks. It suggests that the second moment of degree distribution
<k^2>$ is the relevant factor for the dynamical properties in diffusive capture
process. We numerically find that the normalized number of capture events at a
node with degree $k$, $n(k)$, decreases as $n(k)\sim k^{-\sigma}$. When
$\gamma<3$, $n(k)$ still increases anomalously for $k\approx k_{max}$. We
analytically show that $n(k)$ satisfies the relation $n(k)\sim k^2P(k)$ and the
total number of capture events $N_{tot}$ is proportional to <k^2>$, which
causes the $\gamma$ dependent behavior of $S(N,t)$ and <T>$.

showing grains whose diameters are smaller than on Earth dunes. In addition we
calculate the effect of cohesion and viscosity on the dynamic and static

recent works attribute the temperature dependence in the normal state to that

dependence arises from the zeroth order term in the `expansion', through the
temperature dependence of the spectral function, and the interaction parameters
contained therein. For low boson frequencies this circumstance causes a linear
T-dependence in the sum rule. We develop some analytical expressions and

(ML) detection is desirable to achieve high performance, but its complexity
grows exponentially with the spectral efficiency. The current state of the art
in MIMO detection is list decoding and lattice decoding. This paper proposes a
new class of lattice detectors that combines some of the principles of both
list and lattice decoding, thus resulting in an efficient parallelizable
implementation and near optimal soft-ouput ML performance. The novel detector
is called layered orthogonal lattice detector (LORD), because it adopts a new
lattice formulation and relies on a channel orthogonalization process. It
should be noted that the algorithm achieves optimal hard-output ML performance
in case of two transmit antennas. For two transmit antennas max-log bit
soft-output information can be generated and for greater than two antennas
approximate max-log detection is achieved. Simulation results show that LORD,
in MIMO system employing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and
bit interleaved coded modulation (BICM) is able to achieve very high
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gains compared to practical soft-output detectors
such as minimum-mean square error (MMSE), in either linear or nonlinear

violation of gauge invariance. However, it is possible to couple torsion to
Yang-Mills fields while maintaining gauge invariance provided one accepts that
the gauge couplings then become scalar fields. In the past this has been
untenable from experimental constraints at the current epoch for the
electromagnetic field at least. Recent researches on the ""landscape"" arising
out of string theory provides for many scalar fields which eventually determine
the various low energy parameters including gauge couplings in the universe.
With this scenario, we argue that the very early universe provides a
Riemann-Cartan geometry with non-zero torsion coupling to gauge fields. The
torsion is just the derivative of gauge coupling (scalar) fields. As a result,
in the evolution of the Universe, when the scalar (moduli) fields determine the
geometry of the universe to be Riemannian, torsion goes to zero, implying that
the associated modulus (and hence the gauge coupling) has a constant value. An
equivalent view is that the modulus fixes the gauge coupling at some constant
value causing the torsion to vanish as a consequence. Of course, when torsion
vanishes we recover Einstein's theory for further evolution of the universe.

extend our analysis to SPS heavy ion data. Again, we find that the nontrivial
centrality dependence of particle production (being stronger than at RHIC) is
simply due to an increasing corona contribution with decreasing centrality. The
core contribution shows no centrality dependence (concerning particle ratios),
and can be described in exactly the same way as at RHIC, with one exception:
there is somewhat less collective radial flow at SPS compared to RHIC. Apart of

gives rise to mixed higgsino dark matter (MHDM), which can efficiently

of neutralino dark matter relative to the mSUGRA model. The sparticle mass
spectrum is characterized by relatively light gluinos, frequently with
m(gl)<<m(sq). If scalar masses are large, then gluinos can be very light, with
gl->Z_i+g loop decays dominating the gluino branching fraction. Top squarks can
be much lighter than sbottom and first/second generation squarks. The presence
of low mass higgsino-like charginos and neutralinos is expected at the CERN
LHC. The small m(Z2)-m(Z1) mass gap should give rise to a visible
opposite-sign/same flavor dilepton mass edge. At a TeV scale linear e^+e^-

dynamical features not present in standard theories. Depending on the location

Randall-Sundrum (RS) system and avoiding both, the restriction to orbifold

obtain a thick brane solution that preserves 4D Poincar'e invariance and breaks
Z_2-symmetry along the extra dimension which, indeed, can be either compact or
extended, and supplements brane solutions previously found by other authors. In
the non-compact case, this field configuration represents a thick brane with
positive energy density centered at y=c_2, whereas pairs of thick branes arise
in the compact case. Remarkably, the Weylian scalar curvature is non-singular
along the fifth dimension in the non-compact case, in contraposition to the RS

field. The anti-de Sitter charges are found to involve a scalar field
contribution. Subtleties associated with the self-interactions of the scalar
field as well as its gravitational back reaction, not discussed in previous
treatments, are explicitly analyzed. In particular, it is shown that the fields
develop extra logarithmic branches for specific values of the scalar field mass
(in addition to the known logarithmic branch at the B-F bound).

a massive fermionic field due to the non-trivial topology of the global
monopole spacetime and boundary conditions imposed on this field. Specifically
we investigate the vacuum expectation values of the energy-momentum tensor and
fermionic condensate admitting that the field obeys the MIT bag boundary
condition on two concentric spherical shells. In order to develop this
analysis, we use the generalized Abel-Plana summation, which allows to extract
from the vacuum expectation values the contribution coming from a single sphere
geometry and to present the second sphere induced part in terms of
exponentially convergent integrals. In the limit of strong gravitational field
corresponding to small values of the parameter describing the solid angle
deficit in global monopole geometry, the interference part in the expectation
values are exponentially suppressed. The vacuum forces acting on spheres are
presented as the sum of self-action and interaction terms. Due to the surface
divergences, the first one is divergent and needs additional renormalization,
while the second one is finite for all non-zero distances between the spheres.
By making use of zeta function renormalization technique, the total Casimir
energy is evaluated in the region between two spheres. It is shown that the
interaction part of the vacuum energy is negative and the interaction forces
between the spheres are attractive. Asymptotic expressions are derived in
various limiting cases. As a special case we discuss the fermionic vacuum
densities for two spherical shells on background of the Minkowski spacetime.

consequence, Berry phase terms on both coordinates and momentum operators
naturally arise during the diagonalization procedure. This leads to new

forcing or a sheared velocity profile are involved. The calculation provides a
new relationship between the saturated island width and the $\Delta '$

other electromagnetic phenomena which have been associated with earthquakes.
The mechanism combines the critical earthquake concept and the concept of crust
acting as a charging electric battery under increasing stress. The electric
charges are released by activation of dormant charge carriers in the oxygen
anion sublattice, called peroxy bonds or positive hole pairs (PHP), where a PHP
represents an $O_3X/^{OO}\backslash YO_3$ with $X,Y = Si^{4+}, Al^{3+}...$,
i.e. an $O^-$ in a matrix of $O^{2-}$ of silicates. We propose that PHP are
activated by plastic deformations during the slow cooperative build-up of
stress and the increasingly correlated damage culminating in a large
``critical'' earthquake. Recent laboratory experiments indeed show that
stressed rocks form electric batteries which can release their charge when a
conducting path closes the equivalent electric circuit. We conjecture that the
intermittent and erratic occurrences of EM signals are a consequence of the
progressive build-up of the battery charges in the Earth crust and their
erratic release when crack networks are percolating throughout the stressed
rock volumes, providing a conductive pathway for the battery currents to
discharge. EM signals are thus expected close to the rupture, either slightly
before or after, that is, when percolation is most favored.

origin of species through sympatric speciation. In our model, sympatric
speciation is obtained as we tune up the strength of competition between
individuals with different phenotypes. As a function of this control parameter,
we can characterize, through the behavior of a macroscopic order parameter, a
phase transition from a non-speciation to a speciation state of the system. The
behavior of the first derivative of the order parameter with respect to the
control parameter is consistent with a phase transition and exhibits a sharp
peak at the transition point. For different resources distribution, the
transition point is shifted, an effect similar to pressure in PVT system. The
inverse of the parameter related to sexual selection strength behaves like an
external field in the system and, as thus, is also a control parameter. The
macroscopic effects of the biological parameters used in our model reveal thus

[D. A. Meyer and N. R. Wallach, J. Math. Phys. 43, 4273 (2002)]. Contrarily to
GE the main feature of this measure lies in the fact that we study the mean
linear entropy of all possible partitions of a multipartite system. This allows
the construction of an operational multipartite entanglement measure which is
able to distinguish among different multipartite entangled states that GE
failed to discriminate. Furthermore, it is also maximum at the critical point
of the Ising chain in a transverse magnetic field, being thus able to detect a
quantum phase transition.

role as its entanglement is maximally persistent and robust even under particle
loss. Such states are central as a resource in quantum information processing
and multiparty quantum communication. Here we report the scalable and
deterministic generation of four-, five-, six-, seven- and eight-particle
entangled states of the W type with trapped ions. We obtain the maximum
possible information on these states by performing full characterization via
state tomography, using individual control and detection of the ions. A
detailed analysis proves that the entanglement is genuine. The availability of
such multiparticle entangled states, together with full information in the form
of their density matrices, creates a test-bed for theoretical studies of
multiparticle entanglement. Independently, -Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-
entangled states with up to six ions have been created and analysed in Boulder.

through dense atomic media by means of quantum interference. Media exhibiting
electromagnetically induced transparency have very interesting properties, such
as extremely slow group velocities. Associated with the slow light propagation
are quasiparticles, the so-called dark polaritons, which are mixtures of a
photonic and an atomic contribution. We here demonstrate that these excitations
behave as particles with a nonzero magnetic moment, which is in clear contrast
to the properties of a free photon. It is found that light passing through a
rubidium gas cell under the conditions of electromagnetically induced
transparency is deflected by a small magnetic field gradient. The deflection
angle is proportional to the optical propagation time through the cell. The
observed beam deflection can be understood by assuming that dark state
polaritons have an effective magnetic moment. Our experiment can be described
in terms of a Stern-Gerlach experiment for the polaritons.

optical emitters and electromagnetic excitations in conducting nano-structures.
The excitations are optical plasmons that can be localized to sub-wavelength
dimensions. Under realistic conditions, the tight confinement causes optical
emission to be almost entirely directed into the propagating plasmon modes via
a mechanism analogous to cavity quantum electrodynamics. We first illustrate
this result for the case of a nanowire, before considering the optimized
geometry of a nanotip. We describe an application of this technique involving
efficient single-photon generation on demand, in which the plasmons are
efficiently out-coupled to a dielectric waveguide. Finally we analyze the
effects of increased scattering due to surface roughness on these
nano-structures.
