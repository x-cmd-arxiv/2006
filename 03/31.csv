simulations, which include cooling, star formation with feedback, and galactic

a way that follows the procedure applied to observations of distant, small, and
faint galaxies as closely as possible. We show that galaxy-galaxy mergers and
fly-bys disturb the velocity fields significantly and hence the RCs of the
interacting galaxies, leading to asymmetries and distortions in the RCs.
Typical features of disturbed kinematics are significantly rising or falling
profiles in the direction of the companion galaxy and pronounced bumps in the
RCs. In addition, tidal tails can leave strong imprints on the rotation curve.
All these features are observable for intermediate redshift galaxies, on which
we focus our investigations. We use a quantitative measure for the asymmetry of
rotation curves to show that the appearance of these distortions strongly
depends on the viewing angle. We also find in this way that the velocity fields
settle back into relatively undisturbed equilibrium states after unequal mass
mergers and fly-bys. About 1 Gyr after the first encounter, the RCs show no
severe distortions anymore. These results are consistent with previous
theoretical and observational studies. As an illustration of our results, we
compare our simulated velocity fields and direct images with rotation curves
from VLT/FORS spectroscopy and ACS images of a cluster at z=0.53 and find
remarkable similarities.

is modeled by the general relativistic analogue of the induction equation of

neglecting any of the non-linear interaction terms, and the non-linear

close to the magnetosonic mode. The magnetic and electric field oscillations
have very high amplitude, and a large amount of energy is absorbed from the GW
by the electromagnetic oscillations, of the order of $10^{23} $erg/cm$^3$ in

that the BAT spectrum, initially very hard (photon index Gamma ~ 0.7),
steepened to Gamma ~ 1.3 in a few months, together with a decrease of the
15--195 keV flux by a factor ~ 2. The 0.5--8 keV continuum is well described by
a power law with Gamma ~ 1.3, and spectral flattening below 1 keV. The latter
can be described with a column density in excess of the Galactic value with

dependent offset in the standard-candle relation of SN Ia. This leads to
overestimated luminosity distances compared to a dust-free universe.
Quantifying the amplitude of this systematic effect is crucial for an accurate
determination of the dark energy parameters. In this paper we model the gray
dust extinction in terms of the star-formation history of the universe and the
physical properties of the dust grains. We focus on a class of cosmic dust
models which satisfy current observational constraints. These can produce an
extinction as large as 0.08 mag at z=1.7 and potentially disrupt the dark
energy parameter inference from future SN surveys. In particular depending on
the dust model we find that an unaccounted extinction can bias the estimation
of a constant dark energy equation of state w by shifting its best fit value up
to 20% from its true value. Near-IR broadband photometry will hardly detect
this effect, while the induced decrement of the Balmer lines requires high
signal-to-noise spectra. Indeed IR-spectroscopy will be needed for high
redshift SNe. Cosmic dust extinction may also cause a detectable violation of
the distance-duality relation. A more comprehensive knowledge of the physics of
the IGM is necessary for an accurate modeling of intergalactic dust. Due to the
large magnitude dispersion current luminosity distance measurements are
insensitive to such possible extinction effects. In contrast these must be
taken into account if we hope to disclose the true nature of dark energy with
the upcoming generation of SN Ia surveys.

spectroscopy, we analyse the morphology and kinematics of the quiescent Lya
EELRs around the QSOs. We find evidence for the presence of EELRs around four
radio-quiet and one radio-loud QSO. All EELRs appear asymmetric and the
optically brightest QSOs also have the brightest Lya nebulae. For the two
brightest nebulae we find velocities between ~600 km s^-1 at the QSO position
to ~200 km s^-1 at a distance of 3-4 arcsec from the QSO and surface flux
densities up to 2-3*10^{-16} erg cm^-2 s^-1 arcsec^-2. The five EELRs have
total Lya luminosities which correspond to ~0.5% of the luminosities from the
QSOs broad Lya emission lines. This fraction is an order of magnitude smaller
than found for EELRs around radio-loud, steep spectrum QSOs reported in the
literature. While the nebulae luminosities are correlated with the QSO Lya
luminosities, we find that nebulae luminosities are not correlated with the
central QSO ionising fluxes. The presence of gas in the EELRs can be
interpreted based on two competing scenarios: either from quasar feedback
mechanisms, or from infalling matter. Apart from these two effects, the Lya
flux around radio-loud objects can be enhanced due to interactions with the
radio jets. The relatively fainter nebulae around radio-quiet QSOs compared to
lobe-dominated radio-loud QSOs can be ascribed to this effect, or to
significant differences in the environments between the two classes.

we assume that the Doppler factors of individual jets are constant in time as
justified by their relatively small changes in observed flux density. We find
that in their median-low brightness temperature state, the sources in our
sample have a narrow range of intrinsic brightness temperatures centered on a
characteristic temperature, T_int = 3 x 10^10 K, which is close to the value
expected for equipartition, when the energy in the radiating particles equals
the energy stored in the magnetic fields. However, in their maximum brightness
state, we find that sources in our sample have a characteristic intrinsic
brightness temperature greater than 2 x 10^11 K, which is well in excess of the
equipartition temperature. In this state, we estimate the energy in radiating
particles exceeds the energy in the magnetic field by a factor of ~ 10^5. We
suggest that the excess of particle energy when sources are in their maximum
brightness state is due to injection or acceleration of particles at the base
of the jet. Our results suggest that the common method of estimating jet
Doppler factors by using a single measurement of observed brightness
temperature and/or the assumption of equipartition may lead to large scatter or
systematic errors in the derived values.

dynamical masses as measured from velocity dispersions and half-light radii
with a scatter of 0.2 dex in the mass for early-type galaxies. When we restrict
our sample of members to high stellar masses, > 1e11.1 Msun (M* in the
Schechter mass function for cluster galaxies), we find that the fraction of
early-type galaxies is 79 +/- 6% at z=0.83 and 87 +/- 6% at z=0.023 for the
Coma cluster, consistent with no evolution. Previous work with
luminosity-selected samples finds that the early-type fraction in rich clusters
declines from =~80% at z=0 to =~60% at z=0.8. The observed evolution in the
early-type fraction from luminosity-selected samples must predominately occur
among sub-M* galaxies. As M* for field and group galaxies, especially
late-types, is below M* for clusters galaxies, infall could explain most of the
recent early-type fraction growth. Future surveys could determine the
morphological distributions of lower mass systems which will confirm or refute
this explanation.

combine HST imaging for early-type galaxies from the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey

compact stellar nuclei in the Local Group galaxies M33 and NGC205 are also
found to fall along this same scaling relation. These results indicate that a
generic by-product of galaxy formation is the creation of a Central Massive

  We take into account the complete evolutionary stages of PG1159 progenitors

Again Scenarios, the very late thermal pulse (VLTP) and the late thermal pulse
(LTP), that give rise to hydrogen-deficient compositions. The location of our
PG1159 tracks in the effective temperature - gravity diagram and their
comparison with previous calculations as well as the resulting surface
compositions are discussed at some length.
  Our results reinforce the idea that the different abundances of $^{14}$N
observed at the surface of those PG1159 stars with undetected hydrogen is an
indication that the progenitors of these stars would have evolved through a
VLTP episode, where most of the hydrogen content of the remnant is burnt, or
LTP, where hydrogen is not burnt but instead diluted to very low surface
abundances. We derive new values for spectroscopical masses based on these new
models. We discuss the correlation between the presence of planetary nebulae
and the $^{14}$N abundance as another indicator that $^{14}$N-rich objects
should come from a VLTP episode while $^{14}$N-deficient ones should be the
result of a LTP. Finally, we discuss an evolutionary scenario that could
explain the existence of PG1159 stars with unusually high helium abundances and
a possible evolutionary connection between these stars and the low mass O(He)

hr) consists of the millisecond (recycled) pulsar J1537+1155A (P_A=37.9 ms) and
a neutron star not detected in the radio. After the remarkable double pulsar
binary J0737-3039, it is the only other DNSB detected in X-rays. We measured
the flux of (2.2\pm 0.6)\times10^{-15} ergs s^{-1} cm^{-2} in the 0.3-6 keV
band. The small number of collected counts allows only crude estimates of
spectral parameters. The power-law fit yields the photon index of 3.2\pm 0.5
and the unabsorbed 0.2-10 keV luminosity L_X=6\times10^{29} ergs s^{-1} =
3\times 10^{-4}Edot_A, where Edot_A is the spin-down power of J1537+1155A.
Alternatively, the spectrum can be fitted by a blackbody model with T = 2.2 MK
and the projected emitting area of ~ 5\times 10^3 m^2. The distribution of
photon arrival times over binary orbital phase shows a deficit of X-ray
emission around apastron, which suggests that the emission is caused by
interaction of the relativistic wind from J1537+1155A with its neutron star
companion. We also reanalyzed the Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of
J0737-3039 and found that its X-ray spectrum is similar to the spectrum of
B1534+12, and its X-ray luminosity is about the same fraction of Edot_A, which
suggests similar X-ray emission mechanisms. However, the X-ray emission from
J0737-3039 does not show orbital phase dependence. This difference can be
explained by the smaller eccentricity of J0737-3039 or a smaller misalignment
between the equatorial plane of the millisecond pulsar and the orbital plane of
the binary.

effect of both the temperature and the interparticle interaction on the
equilibrium properties such as the total energy, the density profile, and the
superfluid fraction is discussed. We compare our accurate results with both the
semi-classical approximation and the exact results of an ideal Bose gas. Our
results show that for repulsive interactions, (i) the minimum value of the
aspect ratio, where the system starts to behave quasi-two dimensionally,
increases as the two-body interaction strength increases, (ii) the superfluid
fraction for a quasi-2D Bose gas is distinctly different from that for both a
quasi-1D Bose gas and a true 3D system, i.e., the superfluid fraction for a
quasi-2D Bose gas decreases faster than that for a quasi-1D system and a true
3D system with increasing temperature, and shows a stronger dependence on the
interaction strength, (iii) the superfluid fraction for a quasi-2D Bose gas
lies well below the values calculated from the semi-classical approximation,
and (iv) the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature decreases as the
strength of the interaction increases.

  nanoconfined water","20 pages, 10 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.75.011202",,"cond-mat.soft",,"  Much of the understanding of bulk liquids has progressed through study of the
limiting case in which molecules interact via purely repulsive forces, such as
a hard-core potential. In the same spirit, we report progress on the
understanding of confined water by examining the behavior of water-like
molecules interacting with planar walls via purely repulsive forces and compare
our results with those obtained for Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions between the
molecules and the walls. Specifically, we perform molecular dynamics
simulations of 512 water-like molecules which are confined between two smooth
planar walls that are separated by 1.1 nm. At this separation, there are either
two or three molecular layers of water, depending on density. We study two
different forms of repulsive confinements, when the interaction potential
between water-wall is (i) $1/r^9$ and (ii) WCA-like repulsive potential. We
find that the thermodynamic, dynamic and structural properties of the liquid in
purely repulsive confinements qualitatively match those for a system with a
pure LJ attraction to the wall. In previous studies that include attractions,
freezing into monolayer or trilayer ice was seen for this wall separation.
Using the same separation as these previous studies, we find that the crystal
state is not stable with $1/r^9$ repulsive walls but is stable with WCA-like
repulsive confinement. However, by carefully adjusting the separation of the
plates with $1/r^9$ repulsive interactions so that the effective space
available to the molecules is the same as that for LJ confinement, we find that
the same crystal phases are stable. This result emphasizes the importance of
comparing systems only using the same effective confinement, which may differ
from the geometric separation of the confining surfaces.

and heavy ion-irradiations. Single crystals were irradiated with 1 or 2-MeV
electrons, and 200-MeV 127I, or 200-MeV 197Au ions. Electron and ion beams
produce the same colour centres: namely i) an F+-like centre, ii) the so-called
T-centre (Zr3+ in a trigonal oxygen local environment), and iii) a hole center.
Isochronal annealing was performed up to 973 K. Isothermal annealing was
performed at various temperatures on samples irradiated with 2-MeV electrons.
The stability of paramagnetic centres increases with fluence and with a TCR
treatment at 1373 K under vacuum prior to the irradiations. Two distinct
recovery processes are observed depending on fluence and/or thermal treatment.
The single-stage type I process occurs for F+-like centres at low fluences in
as-received samples, and is probably linked to electron-hole recombination.
T-centres are also annealed according to a single-stage process regardless of
fluence. The annealing curves allow one to obtain activation energies for
recovery. The two-stage type II process is observed only for the F+-like
centres in as-received samples, at higher fluences, or in reduced samples.
These centres are first annealed in a first stage below 550 K, like in type I,
then transform into new paramagnetic centres in a second stage above 550 K. A
simple kinetics model is proposed for this process. Complete colour centre
bleaching is achieved at about 1000 K.

quasi-adiabatic evolution in the time-dependent field. Besides, we observe an
inverse-Josephson (Shapiro) current by applying an AC bias; a supercurrent in
the absence of electromotive force can also be excited. The qualitative
arguments are supported by explicit exact solutions in prototype 5-atom
clusters with on-site repulsion. These basic units are then combined in
ring-shaped systems, where one of the units sits at a higher potential and
works as a barrier. In this case the solution is found by mapping the
low-energy Hamiltonian into an effective anisotropic Heisenberg chain. Once

Josephson-junction-like behavior suggesting the build-up of an effective order

achieves the transmit diversity bound is still an open problem. In fact, all
previously proposed amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF)
schemes do not improve with the number of relays in terms of the diversity
multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) for multiplexing gains r higher than 0.5. In this
work, we study the class of slotted amplify-and-forward (SAF) schemes. We first
establish an upper bound on the DMT for any SAF scheme with an arbitrary number
of relays N and number of slots M. Then, we propose a sequential SAF scheme
that can exploit the potential diversity gain in the high multiplexing gain
regime. More precisely, in certain conditions, the sequential SAF scheme
achieves the proposed DMT upper bound which tends to the transmit diversity
bound when M goes to infinity. In particular, for the two-relay case, the
three-slot sequential SAF scheme achieves the proposed upper bound and
outperforms the two-relay non-orthorgonal amplify-and-forward (NAF) scheme of
Azarian et al. for multiplexing gains r < 2/3. Numerical results reveal a
significant gain of our scheme over the previously proposed AF schemes,
especially in high spectral efficiency and large network size regime.

action resembles the Einstein-Hilbert action for vacuum General Relativity: the
equations of motion for both are second order; the difference is that here the
dynamical variables are not the metric, but the embedding functions of the
worldvolume. We provide a novel Hamiltonian formulation for this model. The
Lagrangian, like that of General Relativity, is linear in the acceleration of
the extended object. As such, the model is not a genuine higher derivative
theory, a fact reflected in the order of the equations of motion. Nevertheless,
as we will show, it is possible as well as useful to treat it as a `fake'
higher derivative system, enlarging the phase space appropriately. The
corresponding Hamiltonian on this phase space is constructed: it is a
polynomial. The complete set of constraints on the phase space is identified.
The fact that the equations of motion are of second order in derivatives of the

appearance of additional constraints, both primary and secondary. These new
constraints are second class. In this formulation, the Lagrange multipliers
implementing the primary constraints get identified as accelerations. This is a

systems methods, we find the fixed points of the system and study their
stability. We find that models with standard non-phantom behavior are in
general asymptotic in the past to an isotropic fixed point IS, i.e. in these
models even an arbitrarily large anisotropy is suppressed in the past: the
singularity is matter dominated. Using covariant and gauge invariant variables,
we then study linear perturbations about the homogenous and isotropic spatially
flat models with a quadratic EoS. We find that, in the large scale limit, all
perturbations decay asymptotically in the past, indicating that the isotropic
fixed point IS is the general asymptotic past attractor for non phantom
inhomogeneous models with a quadratic EoS. (Abridged)

relevant to neutrinos both from the Earth's atmosphere or from a neutrino

which are sensitive to and allow precision measurements of the mixing angle
theta_23 and mass-squared difference delta_32 apart from the mixing angle

this capability can isolate these matter effects. In particular, we address the

maximal, and, if not, to explore how well its octant can be determined. When
realistic detector resolutions are included, we find that deviations of about

fundamental hypermultiplets. This theory supports 1/2-BPS domain walls and flux
tubes (strings), as well as their 1/4-BPS junctions. The effective
(2+1)-dimensional theory on the domain wall is known to be a U(1) gauge theory.
Previously, the wall-string junctions were shown to play the role of massive
charges in this theory. However, the field theory of the junctions on the wall
(for semi-infinite strings) appears to be inconsistent due to infrared
problems. All these problems can be eliminated by compactifying one spatial
dimension orthogonal to the wall and considering a wall-antiwall system on a
cylinder. We argue that for certain values of parameters this set-up provides
an example of a controllable bulk-brane duality in field theory. Dynamics of
the 4D bulk are mapped onto 3D boundary theory: 3D N=2 SQED with two matter
superfields and a weak-strong coupling constant relation in 4D and 3D,
respectively. The cylinder radius is seen as a ""real mass"" in 3D N=2 SQED. We
work out (at weak coupling) the quantum version of the world-volume theory on
the walls. Integrating out massive matter (strings in the bulk theory) one
generates a Chern-Simons term on the wall world volume and an interaction
between the wall and antiwall that scales as a power of distance. Vector and
scalar (classically) massless excitations on the walls develop a mass gap at
the quantum level; the long-range interactions disappear. The above duality
implies that the wall and its antiwall partner (at strong coupling in the bulk
theory) are stabilized at the opposite sides of the cylinder.

  concerning subsets of the Riemann surface",,,,"math.SP math.AP",,"  We consider the 3D Schr\""odinger operator $H = H_0 + V$ where $H_0 =
(-i\nabla - A)^2$, $A$ is a magnetic potential generating a constant magnetic
field of strength $b>0$, and $V$ is a short-range electric potential which
decays superexponentially with respect to the variable along the magnetic
field. We show that the resolvent of $H$ admits a meromorphic extension from
the upper half-plane to an appropriate complex manifold ${\mathcal M}$, and
define the resonances of $H$ as the poles of this meromorphic extension. We
study their distribution near any fixed Landau level $2bq$, $q \in {\mathbb
N}$. First, we obtain a sharp upper bound of the number of resonances in a
vicinity of $2bq$. Moreover, under appropriate hypotheses, we establish
corresponding lower bounds which imply the existence of an infinite number of
resonances, or the absence of resonances in certain sectors adjoining $2bq$.
Finally, we deduce a representation of the derivative of the spectral shift
function (SSF) for the operator pair $(H,H_0)$ as a sum of a harmonic measure
related to the resonances, and the imaginary part of a holomorphic function.
This representation justifies the Breit-Wigner approximation, implies a trace
formula, and provides information on the singularities of the SSF at the Landau
levels.

cohomology groups with coefficients in a suitably twisted free bimodule are
shown to be non-zero in the top dimension d, when A is an Artin-Schelter
regular noetherian Hopf algebra of global dimension d. (Twisted) Poincare
duality holds in this setting, as is deduced from a theorem of Van den Bergh.

construction requires differential graded (DG) algebras. If there exists an
isomorphism \rho : M \iso Sq_{B/A} M then the pair (M,\rho) is called a rigid
complex over B relative to A (there are some finiteness conditions). There is
an obvious notion of rigid morphism between rigid complexes.
  We establish several properties of rigid complexes, including their

f^{\flat}(M,\rho) (resp. f^{\sharp}(M,\rho)) along a finite (resp. essentially

applications. The interval smoothing problem updates all desired states within
a time interval using all available observations. The fixed-lag smoothing
problem updates only a fixed number of states prior to the observation at
current time. The fixed-lag smoothing problem is, in general, thought to be
computationally faster than a fixed-interval smoother, and can be an
appropriate approximation for long interval-smoothing problems. In this paper,
we use an ensemble-based approach to fixed-interval and fixed-lag smoothing,
and synthesize two algorithms. The first algorithm produces a linear time
solution to the interval smoothing problem with a fixed factor, and the second
one produces a fixed-lag solution that is independent of the lag length.
Identical-twin experiments conducted with the Lorenz-95 model show that for lag
lengths approximately equal to the error doubling time, or for long intervals
the proposed methods can provide significant computational savings. These
results suggest that ensemble methods yield both fixed-interval and fixed-lag
smoothing solutions that cost little additional effort over filtering and model
propagation, in the sense that in practical ensemble application the additional
increment is a small fraction of either filtering or model propagation costs.
We also show that fixed-interval smoothing can perform as fast as fixed-lag
smoothing and may be advantageous when memory is not an issue.

products based on GOES sounder data have been found to be especially useful in
the study of thermodynamic environments. However, addressed much less
frequently is the relationship between convective storm electrification,
lightning phenomenology and downburst generation. Previous research in
lightning production by convective storms has identified that electrification,
phenomenology (i.e. flash rate, density), and polarity are dependent upon the
thermodynamic structure of the ambient atmosphere, especially vertical moisture
stratification. Thus, relevant parameters to describe the thermodynamic setting
would include convective available potential energy (CAPE), due to its
influence on updraft strength, and cloud liquid water content, due to its
relationship to precipitation physical processes. It has already been addressed
that buoyant energy and moisture stratification are important factors in
convective storm development and downburst generation. This research effort
investigates and derives a qualitative relationship between lightning
phenomenology in convective storms and downburst generation.
Downburst-producing convective storms will be analyzed by comparing
pre-convective environments, as portrayed by GOES microburst products, storm
morphology, as portrayed by radar imagery, and electrical behavior, as
indicated by NLDN data.

question whether considering the neutron as a fundamental or a compound
particle still bothered the physicists and Chadwick himself for more than one
year. Instead, as soon as Majorana heard about Joliot-Curies' experiments he
guessed the existence of a ""neutral proton."" In 1933 he published some
""corrections"" to Heisenberg's theory. A very simple analysis shows that
Heisenberg's original version of exchange interactions and Majorana's version
clearly reflect, respectively, that the nucleus contained ""electrons"" and that
the nucleus was free from electrons. The emission of electrons from the nucleus
still needed to be accounted for. Fermi's theory of beta-decay settled the
question. Thanks to exchange interactions and beta-decay theory, quantum
mechanics could now be applied to the nucleus, which could be considered free
from electrons. Also the neutron could be considered free from electrons, and
treated as a fundamental particle.

  Environmental Implications","25 pages, 7 figures, for conference proceedings",,,"IBR-TH-34-05","physics.gen-ph",,"  By using a language as accessible to a broad audience as possible, in this
note we present evidence suggesting scientific caution prior to final claims
that neutrinos and quarks are actual physical particles existing in our
spacetime. We review historical and recent evidence dismissing the existence of
neutrinos and quarks as physical particles, and outline recent theories
representing experimental data without their existence. We also identify the
negative implications for environmental issues of the neutrino and quark
conjectures since they imply the suppression of due scientific process on new
clean energies predicted by new structure models of hadrons with massive
physical constituents produced free in spontaneous or stimulated decays. The
note ends with the need of continuing theoretical and experimental research on
neutrino and quark conjectures, but complemented, for evident scientific
democracy, accountability and societal needs, with theoretical and experimental
studies on alternative theories without the neutrino and quark conjectures and
their prediction of new clean energies.

Shanghai Index, we find the time series of prediction accurate rates is
sensitive to the initial strategy distributions of agents in group 2 who play
minority game, but less sensitive to the initial strategy distributions of
agents in group 1 who play majority game. And agents in group 2 tend to cluster
in full strategy space (FSS) if the real financial time series has obvious
tendency (upward or downward), otherwise they tend to scatter in FSS. We also
find that the initial strategy distributions and the number of agents in group

two-way transit time of light in vacuo, along the two perpendicular arms of
Michelson's interferometers (modern versions of Michelson's experiment), and
the anisotropy of the one-way speed of light in the Earth frame, two facts
supported today by strong experimental arguments, length contraction (in
Lorentz and FitzGerald's approach) should no longer be regarded as an ad hoc
hypothesis, it appears necessary and can be easily deduced. 2/ Builder and
Prokhovnik had the great merit of having shown that, as a result of to length
contraction, the two-way transit time of light along a rod is the same in all
directions in space (and not only in two privileged directions). We agree with
these authors up to this point, but, contrary to what is often believed, their
approach failed to reconcile aether theory with the invariance of the apparent
(measured) two-way speed of light. Yet, as we shall show, due to the systematic
measurement distortions entailed by length contraction and clock retardation
assumed by aether theory, the two-way speed of light, although anisotropic and
dependent on the absolute speed of the frame where it is measured, is always
found equal to C. The reasons of this paradoxical but important result will be
developed here. They confirm Lorentz-Fitzgerald's contraction and lend support
of the existence of a preferred aether frame.

information between a random variable encoded into quantum states, and the
probabilistic outcome of a quantum measurement of the encoding. Accessible
information is extremely difficult to characterize analytically; even bounds on
it are hard to place. The celebrated Holevo bound states that accessible
information cannot exceed chi(E), the quantum mutual information between the
random variable and its encoding. However, for general ensembles, the gap
between the acc(E) and chi(E) may be arbitrarily large.
  We consider the special case of a binary random variable, which often serves
as a stepping stone towards other results in information theory and
communication complexity. We give explicit lower bounds on the the accessible
information acc(E) of an ensemble E = {(p, rho_0), (1-p, rho_1)}, with 0 <= p
<= 1, as functions of p and chi(E). The bounds are incomparable in the sense
that they surpass each other in different parameter regimes.
  Our bounds arise by measuring the ensemble according to a complete orthogonal
measurement that preserves the fidelity of the states rho_0,rho_1. As an
intermediate step, therefore, we give new relations between the two quantities
acc(E), chi(E) and the fidelity B(rho_0,rho_1).
