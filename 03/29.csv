co-rotating with the underlying accretion disk, we study the shape and
normalisation of the primary and disc reflected continuum as well as the
dependence of the observed spectrum on the line of sight for various source
heights and radii. These calculations are performed using Monte-Carlo methods
to compute the angle dependent reflection spectrum from the disc. The effects
of general relativity are illustrated by a comparison with Newtonian and
Special Relativity calculations. We find that relativistic distortions can
strongly affect the shape of the reflected spectrum. Light bending can
dramatically increase the observable reflected flux and reduce the primary
emission. In addition, multiple reflections due to the reflected photons
deflected toward the disc can alter significantly the shape of the spectrum
above 10 keV. Large variations of the ring radius at constant height can lead
to an (unobserved) anti-correlation between primary and reflected flux. In
another side, the variability behaviour of several sources can be reproduced if
the ring source radius is small (<5 r_g), and its height varies by a large
factor. In particular, a non-linear flux-flux relation, similar to that
observed in several sources, can be produced. We compare our model with the
flux-flux plot of NGC4051, and find an agreement for low inclination angles

ranges correspond to qualitative as well as quantitative differences in
behavior. The fundamental questions involve the balance between nonequilibrium
and thermalized plasmas. When energy fluxes exceed a critical value $\sim
10^{29}$ erg/cm$^2$s, as in GRB, a black-body equilibrium pair plasma forms. At
the lower fluxes found in AGN, BHXRB and microquasars, accretion power
electrodynamically accelerates a small number of very energetic particles,
explaining their non-thermal spectra and the high energy gamma-ray emission of
blazars. Ultra-high energy cosmic rays may be accelerated by massive black
holes, otherwise undetectable, with very low thermal luminosities. New-born
fast high-field pulsars may be in the black-body equilibrium regime, resembling
SGR in permanent outburst. I also consider the question, significant for the
acceleration of nonthermal particles in GRB outflows, of whether collisionless
plasmas interpenetrate rather than forming hydrodynamic shocks, and propose
this as an alternative to internal shock models of GRB. A new appendix attempts

highly implausible. Irrespective of the origin of the core, reasonable
dynamical limits on the mass of the Fornax halo constrain its core radius to be

demanding that the central phase space density of Fornax not exceed that

Further, if the halo is composed of warm dark matter then phase-space
constraints force the core to be quite small in order to avoid conservative
limits from the Ly alpha forest power spectrum, implying a core radius < 85 pc.
We discuss our results in the context of the idea that the extended globular

finite stellar lifetimes. We derive the metallicity distribution functions, the
age-metallicity relation, and relative elemental abundances for a number of
alpha- and Fe-group elements. We find that the dispersion of the metallicity
distribution function of the outer halo is reproduced by contributions from
clouds with different initial conditions. Clouds with initial masses greater
than that of present globular clusters are found to survive the first 0.1 Gyr,
suggesting that such systems may have contributed to the formation of the first
stars, and could have been self-enriched. More massive clouds are only stable
when one assumes an initial mass function that is not biased towards massive
stars. The predicted relative abundances of some alpha- and Fe-group elements
show good agreement with the observed values down to metallicities below [Fe/H]
= -4 when the iron yields are reduced relative to stellar models. The observed
scatter is also reproduced for many elements including the observed bifurcation
in [alpha/Fe] for stars with low [Fe/H]. However, the predicted dispersion may
be too large for some alpha elements unless a limited range of progenitor

substantial abundance differences between the AGB and RGB in galactic globular

be consistent between clusters. Although most clusters appear to have CN-weak

complicate the picture, clusters often appear to have a combination of both
CN-strong and CN-weak stars on their AGBs -- although one population tends to
dominate. Again, all these assertions are however based on small sample

`Q' mode for the first time, at some 36.4$\pm$0.9 stellar rotation periods. The
onset of the `B' mode is then observed to commence similarly in all three
observations. The initial circulation time is about 36 periods and relaxes to
nearly 38 periods in a roughly exponential fashion with a characteristic time
of some 1.2 hours. This is the longest characteristic time ever found in a
mode-switching pulsar. Moreover, just after the `B'-mode onset the pulsar
exhibits a symmetrical resolved-double profile form with a somewhat stronger
trailing component, but this second component slowly dies away leaving the
usual single `B'-mode profile with the longitude of the magnetic axis falling
at about its trailing half power point. Thus it would appear that Q-to-B- and
B-to-Q-transitions have different characteristic times. Some speculations are
given on the nature of this slow modal alternation.

young open cluster NGC 6231. Our data set relies on an XMM-Newton campaign of a
nominal duration of 180 ks and reveals that NGC 6231 is very rich in the X-ray
domain too. Indeed, 610 X-ray sources are detected in the present field of
view, centered on the cluster core. The limiting sensitivity of our survey is
approximately 6E-15 erg/s/cm^2 but clearly depends on the location in the field
of view and on the source spectrum. Using different existing catalogues, over
85% of the X-ray sources could be associated with at least one optical and/or
infrared counterpart within a limited cross-correlation radius of 3 arcsec at
maximum. The surface density distribution of the X-ray sources presents a
slight N-S elongation. Once corrected for the spatial sensitivity variation of
the EPIC instruments, the radial profile of the source surface density is well
described by a King profile with a central density of about 8 sources per
arcmin^2 and a core radius close to 3.1arcmin. The distribution of the X-ray
sources seems closely related to the optical source distribution. The expected
number of foreground and background sources should represent about 9% of the
detected sources, thus strongly suggesting that most of the observed X-ray
emitters are physically belonging to NGC 6231. Finally, beside a few bright but
soft objects -- corresponding to the early-type stars of the cluster -- most of
the sources are relatively faint (~5E-15 erg/s/cm^2) with an energy
distribution peaked around 1.0-2.0 keV.

We found that the timescale for a \sigma-drop formation could be short (less

that the central region is continuously or regularly fed by fresh gas which
leads to a continuous star formation activity. Star formation in the central

magnetic field across the peak of the core that lies at an offset of 19 degrees
to the short axis of the core. This is similar to the offsets seen in previous
observations of prestellar cores. To the southeast of the peak, in the
filamentary tail of the core, we see that the magnetic field has rotated to lie
almost parallel to the long axis of the filament. We hypothesise that the field
in the core may have decoupled from the field in the filament that connects the
core to the rest of the cloud. We use the Chandrasekhar-Fermi (CF) method to
measure the plane-of-sky field strength in the core of L1498 to be 10 +/- 7 uG.
  In L1517B we see a more gradual turn in the field direction from the northern
part of the core to the south. This appears to follow a twist in the filament
in which the core is buried, with the field staying at a roughly constant 25
degree offset to the short axis of the filament, also consistent with previous
observations of prestellar cores. We again use the CF method and calculate the
magnetic field strength in L1517B also to be 30 +/- 10 uG. Both cores appear to
be roughly virialised. Comparison with our previous work on somewhat denser

emission is close to maximum. Using the observed thermal X-ray emission
together with the radio emission to constrain the mass-loss rates, we find that
the O-star mass-loss rate is consistent with recent reductions for O4-5
supergiants. We demonstrate that radio VLBI observations of the WCR fail to
constrain the opening angle. The observed low frequency turnover at ~3 GHz in
the radio emission is due to free-free absorption, since models based on the
Razin effect have an unacceptably large fraction of energy in non-thermal
particles. The index of the non-thermal electron energy distribution is flatter
than the canonical value for diffusive shock acceleration, namely p<2. Several
mechanisms are discussed that could lead to such an index. Tighter constraints
on p and the nature of the shocks in WR140 will be obtained from future
observations at MeV and GeV energies, for which we generally predict lower
fluxes than previous work. Since the high stellar photon fluxes prevent the
acceleration of electrons beyond gamma > 1e5-1e6, TeV emission from CWB systems
will provide unambiguous evidence of pion-decay emission from accelerated ions.

this effect we first analyze the net hamiltonian, H(N), of N conduction
electrons to identify its universal part, H_o(N) (independent of the nature of
a specific solid or a specific class of solids), and then study the states of
H_o(N) to conclude that superconductivity originates, basically, from an
inter-play between the zero- point force (f_o) of conduction electrons in their
ground state and the inter-atomic forces (f_a) which decide the lattice
structure. This renders a kind of mechanical strain in the lattice which serves
as the main source of phonon induced inter-electron attraction responsible for
the formation of Cooper type pairs and the onset of superconductivity below
certain temperature T_c. We determine the binding energy of such pairs and find
a relation for T_c which not only accounts for the highest experimental T_c =
135 K that we know to-day but also indicates that superconductivity may, in
principle, occur at room temperature. It is evident that electrical strain in
the lattice (i.e., electrical polarization of the lattice constituents produced
by the charge of conducting electrons) can have an added contribution to the
phonon induced attraction of two electrons. Our theoretical framework not only
incorporates BCS model but also provides microscopic basis for the two well
known phenomenologies of superconductivity, viz., the two fluid theory and
Psi-theory. In addition, it also corroborates a recent idea that
superconducting transition is basically a quantum phase transition.

branched iso-butane. For the linear molecule, well defined molecular layers
develop in the lubricant film when the width is of the order of a few atomic
diameters. The branched iso-butane forms more disordered structures which
permit it to stay liquid-like at smaller surface separations. During squeezing
the solvation forces show oscillations corresponding to the width of a
molecule. At low speeds (< 0.1 m/s) the last layers of iso-butane are squeezed
out before those of n-butane. Since the (interfacial) squeezing velocity in
most practical applications is very low when the lubricant layer has molecular
thickness, one expects n-butane to be a better boundary lubricant than
iso-butane. N-butane possessing a slightly lower viscosity at high pressures,
our result refutes the view that squeeze out should be harder for higher
viscosities, on the other hand our results are consistent with wear experiments
in which n-butane were shown to protect steel surfaces better than iso-butane.

the number of atoms, and $N_{\max}^{(S=1)}$ is the corresponding collapse
threshold. Stable vortices easily self-trap from arbitrary initial
configurations with embedded vorticity. In an adjacent interval, $(1/3)N_{\max

periodically splits in two fragments and recombines. At $N>$ $\allowbreak

itself. The results are compared with those in the full 3D Gross-Pitaevskii

$\sqrt{10}$, the stability interval of the S=1 vortices occupies $\approx 40%$

analysis in the next to leading order (NLO) QCD is developed. Within the method
one first directly extracts in NLO few first truncated (available to

these moments as an input to the proposed modification of the Jacobi polynomial
expansion method (MJEM), one eventually reconstructs the local quark helicity
distributions themselves. All numerical tests demonstrate that MJEM allows us
to reproduce with the high precision the input local distributions even inside
the narrow Bjorken $x$ region accessible for experiment. It is of importance
that only four first input moments are sufficient to achieve a good quality of
reconstruction. The application of the method to the simulated SIDIS data on
the pion production is considered. The obtained results encourage one that the
proposed NLO method can be successfully applied to the SIDIS data analysis. The
analysis of HERMES data on pion production is performed. To this end the pion
difference asymmetries are constructed from the measured by HERMES standard

point of view of first principles and from the TMT results are summarized.
Possible origin of the TMT and symmetries that protect the structure of TMT are
reviewed. It appears that four measure scalar fields treated as ""physical

resolution of the old cosmological constant problem as a possible direct
consequence of the TMT structure is discussed. Other applications of TMT to

Penner proved that the logarithm of the minimal dilatation for a pseudo-Anosov

smallest dilatation of any pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism of S_g acting trivially
on Gamma/Gamma_k, the quotient of Gamma = pi_1(S_g) by the k-th term of its
lower central series, k > 0. In contrast to Penner's asymptotics, we prove that
this minimal dilatation is bounded above and below, independently of g, with
bounds tending to infinity with k. For example, in the case of the Torelli
group I(S_g), we prove that L(I(S_g)), the logarithm of the minimal dilatation
in I(S_g), satisfies .197 < L(I(S_g))< 4.127. In contrast, we find
pseudo-Anosov mapping classes acting trivially on Gamma/Gamma_k whose
asymptotic translation lengths on the complex of curves tend to 0 as g tends

show how to constructively classify all groups satisfying such hypothesis, by a

approximate trajectories of some of the resulting symmetric minimizers.

representation of $G$ is attached to each orbital variety of $\calO$ in this
way. In the setting of classical groups, we show that whenever it is possible
to carry out the Graham-Vogan construction for an orbital variety of a

overestimates the RPA results. In the second part of this paper, we compare GCM

show that the discretized GCM works quite well and permits to obtain nearly

presented followed by a theoretical analysis of the phase and group speed of
the propagating fields. This theoretical prediction is then verified by a

superluminal propagation of transverse electromagnetic fields in the nearfield

small and the modulation method is known, it is shown that the information
speed can be approximately the same as the superluminal group speed. According
to relativity theory, it is known that between moving reference frames,
superluminal signals can propagate backwards in time enabling violations of
causality. Several explanations are presented which may resolve this dilemma.

transient and secondary growth of instability in channel flow is conducted. The
effect of viscosity stratification, heat diffusivity and of buoyancy are
estimated separately, with some unexpected results. From linear stability
results, it has been accepted that heat diffusivity does not affect stability.
However, we show that realistic Prandtl numbers cause a transient growth of
disturbances that is an order of magnitude higher than at zero Prandtl number.
Buoyancy, even at fairly low levels, gives rise to high levels of subcritical
energy growth. Unusually for transient growth, both of these are
spanwise-independent and not in the form of streamwise vortices. At moderate
Grashof numbers, exponential growth dominates, with distinct Rayleigh-Benard
and Poiseuille modes for Grashof numbers upto $\sim 25000$, which merge
thereafter. Wall heating has a converse effect on the secondary instability
compared to the primary, destabilising significantly when viscosity decreases
towards the wall. It is hoped that the work will motivate experimental and
numerical efforts to understand the role of wall heating in the control of
channel and pipe flows.

the hidden subgroup problem (HSP) over Z_2^n provided one of the first
algebraic problems for which quantum computers are exponentially faster than

Simon's problem to arbitrary groups. Fixing a finite group G, this is the
problem of recovering an involution m = (m_1, ..., m_n) in G^n from an oracle f
with the property that f(x) = f(xy) iff y equals m or the identity. In the
current parlance, this is the hidden subgroup problem (HSP) over groups of the
form G^n, where G is a nonabelian group of constant size, and where the hidden
subgroup is either trivial or has order two. Although groups of the form G^n
have a simple product structure, they share important representation-theoretic
properties with the symmetric groups S_n, where a solution to the HSP would
yield a quantum algorithm for Graph Isomorphism. In particular, solving their
HSP with the so-called ``standard method'' requires highly entangled
measurements on the tensor product of many coset states. Here we give quantum
algorithms with time complexity 2^O(sqrt(n log n)) that recover hidden
involutions m = (m_1, ..., m_n) in G^n where, as in Simon's problem, each m_i

result in mutually inequivalent quantum theories. In fact, we show here that
there exists a unitary map between the two representation spaces so that the
various quantizations are equivalent.

  information in equilibrium systems","6 pages, 2 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We prove a no-go theorem for storing quantum information in equilibrium
systems. Namely, quantum information cannot be stored in a system with
time-independent Hamiltonian interacting with heat bath of temperature $T>0$
during time that grows with the number of used qubits. We prove it by showing,
that storing quantum information for macroscopic time would imply existence of
perpetuum mobile of the second kind. The general results are illustrated by the
Kitaev model of quantum memory. In contrast, classical information can be
stored in equilibrium states for arbitrary long times. We show how it is
possible via phase-transition type phenomena. Our result shows that there is a
fundamental difference between quantum and classical information in {\it
physical} terms.

symmetry, and a time-reversal symmetry. We show that, even when these features
are taken into account, the asymptotic entangling power of the baker's map does
not always agree with the predictions of random matrix theory. We have verified
that the dimension of the Hilbert space is the crucial parameter which
determines whether the entangling properties of the baker are universal or not.
For power-of-two dimensions, i.e., qubit systems, an anomalous entangling power
is observed; otherwise the behavior of the baker is consistent with random
matrix theories. We also derive a general formula that relates the asymptotic
entangling power of an arbitrary unitary with properties of its reduced
eigenvectors.

sharpen the usual description of random ciphers to a particular mathematical
characterization suggested by the salient feature responsible for their
increased security. We describe a concrete system known as AlphaEta and show
that it is equivalent to a random cipher in which the required randomization is
effected by coherent-state quantum noise. We describe the currently known
security features of AlphaEta and similar systems, including lower bounds on
the unicity distances against ciphertext-only and known-plaintext attacks. We
show how AlphaEta used in conjunction with any standard stream cipher such as
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) provides an additional, qualitatively
different layer of security from physical encryption against known-plaintext
attacks on the key. We refute some claims in the literature that AlphaEta is
equivalent to a non-random stream cipher.

the use of a shared secret key extended via a pseudo-random number generator
may simultaneously enhance the security and efficiency of the cryptosystem.
This effect arises from the intrinsic performance difference between quantum
detectors with versus without knowledge of the key, a purely quantum effect and
a new principle for key generation. No intrusion level estimation is needed and
the method is directly applicable to realistic systems with imperfections.
Quantum direct encryption is also made possible by such use of a secret key.

pulses generated by an EPR source. For low (high) transmission losses the
highest degree of entanglement is obtained by probing with squeezed
(antisqueezed) light. In an asymmetric setup where light is only sent one way

allows the interaction to be decomposed as a beamsplitter transformation
between optical and material excitations on a mode-by-mode basis. A single,
dominant modefunction describes the dynamics for arbitrary control pulse
shapes.
  Complete transfer of the quantum state of the incident photon to a collective
dark state within the ensemble can be achieved by shaping the control pulse so
as to match the dominant mode to the temporal mode of the photon. Readout of
