matter component in the universe. Furthermore, the phenomenologically motivated
existence proof refrained from invoking the data on galactic rotational curves

deciphered from the studies on globular clusters. This claim has been

8 keV, M_{500c,8 keV}=(8.7 +/- 1.6) h^{-1} 10^{14} M_sun. This normalization is
consistent with previous lensing-based results based on smaller cluster

most normalizations based on X-ray derived cluster masses. Assuming the
theoretically expected slope alpha=3/2 of the mass-temperature relation, we
derive sigma_8 = 0.88 +/-0.09 for a spatially-flat LambdaCDM universe with
Omega_m = 0.3. The main systematic errors on the lensing masses result from
extrapolating the cluster masses beyond the field-of-view used for the
gravitational lensing measurements, and from the separation of
cluster/background galaxies, contributing each with a scatter of 20%. Taking
this into account, there is still significant intrinsic scatter in the
mass-temperature relation indicating that this relation may not be very tight,
at least at the high mass end. Furthermore, we find that dynamically relaxed
clusters are 75 +/-40% hotter than non-relaxed clusters.

induces a polarization signal proportional to the CMB quadrupole anisotropy at
the cluster's location and look-back time. A survey of such remote quadrupole
measurements provides information about large-scale cosmological perturbations.
This paper presents a formalism for calculating the correlation function of
remote quadrupole measurements in spherical harmonic space. The number of
independent modes probed by both single-redshift and volume-limited surveys is
presented, along with the length scales probed by these modes. In a remote
quadrupole survey sparsely covering a large area of sky, the largest-scale
modes probe the same length scales as the quadrupole but with much narrower
Fourier-space window functions. The largest-scale modes are significantly
correlated with the local CMB, but even when this correlation is projected out
the largest remaining modes probe gigaparsec scales (comparable to the CMB at
l=2-10) with narrow window functions. These modes may provide insight into the
possible anomalies in the large-scale CMB anisotropy. At fixed redshift, the
data from such a survey form an E-type spin-2 field on the sphere to a good
approximation; the near-absence of B modes will provide a valuable check on
systematic errors. A survey of only a few low-redshift clusters allows an
independent reconstruction of the five coefficients of the local CMB
quadrupole, providing a test for contamination in the WMAP quadrupole. The
formalism presented here is also useful for analyzing smaller-scale surveys to
probe the late integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and hence the properties of dark
energy

resolve the two active galactic nuclei in 3C 75, the well known double radio
source at the centre of Abell 400. Through analysis of the new Chandra
observation of Abell 400 along with 4.5 GHz and 330 MHz VLA radio data, we will
show new evidence that the Active Galactic Nuclei in 3C 75 are a bound system.
Methods. Using the high quality X-ray data, we map the temperature, pressure,
density, and entropy of the inner regions as well as the cluster profile
properties out to ~18'. We compare features in the X-ray and radio images to
determine the interaction between the intra-cluster medium and extended radio
emission. The Chandra image shows an elongation of the cluster gas along the
northeast-southwest axis; aligned with the initial bending of 3C 75's jets.
Additionally, the temperature profile shows no cooling core, consistent with a
merging system. There is an apparent shock to the south of the core consistent
with a Mach number of M~1.4 or speed of v~1200 km s^-1. Both Active Galactic
Nuclei, at least in projection, are located in the low entropy, high density
core just north of the shock region. We find that the projected path of the
jets does not follow the intra-cluster medium surface brightness gradient as
expected if their path were due to buoyancy. We also find that both central AGN
are extended and include a thermal component. Based on this analysis, we
conclude that the Active Galactic Nuclei in 3C 75 are a bound system from a
previous merger. They are contained in a low entropy core moving through the
intra-cluster medium at 1200 km s^-1. The bending of the jets is due to the
local intra-cluster medium wind.

AU. When intensely monitored over their peak, high-magnification events similar
to OGLE-2005-BLG-169 have nearly complete sensitivity to Neptune mass-ratio
planets with projected separations of 0.6 to 1.6 Einstein radii, corresponding
to 1.6--4.3 AU in the present case. Only two other such events were monitored
well enough to detect Neptunes, and so this detection by itself suggests that
Neptune mass-ratio planets are common. Moreover, another Neptune was recently
discovered at a similar distance from its parent star in a low-magnification
event, which are more common but are individually much less sensitive to
planets. Combining the two detections yields 90% upper and lower frequency
limits f=0.37^{+0.30}_{-0.21} over just 0.4 decades of planet-star separation.
In particular, f>16% at 90% confidence. The parent star hosts no Jupiter-mass
companions with projected separations within a factor 5 of that of the detected
planet. The lens-source relative proper motion is \mu~7--10 mas/yr, implying
that if the lens is sufficiently bright, I<23.8, it will be detectable by HST
by 3 years after peak. This would permit a more precise estimate of the lens
mass and distance, and so the mass and projected separation of the planet.
Analogs of OGLE-2005-BLG-169Lb orbiting nearby stars would be difficult to

rates and characteristics of tidal disruptions of extended stars by the MBH and
of inspirals of compact stars into the MBH, the latter being events of high

very faint compared to the predicted extrapolation of the X-ray afterglow to

consistent with this extrapolation (beta_KX ~ 0.6), demonstrating suppression
of the optical flux. Late time {\it HST} observations place stringent limits on

show that the burst occurred at the edge of a faint red galaxy which most
likely lies at a significantly higher redshift than the previous optically

red colors that are similarly suggestive of higher redshift. We consider

coupling, in which an electrical current flowing through a sample can lead to
spin transport in a perpendicular direction and spin accumulation at lateral

originate in a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic spin-orbit coupling
mechanisms and depend on geometry, dimension, impurity scattering, and carrier
density of the system--making the analysis of these effects a diverse field of
research. In this article, we give an overview of the theoretical background of
the spin Hall effects and summarize some of the most important results. First,
we explain effective spin-orbit Hamiltonians, how they arise from band
structure, and how they can be understood from symmetry considerations;
including intrinsic coupling due to bulk inversion or structure asymmetry or
due to strain, and extrinsic coupling due to impurities. This leads to
different mechanisms of spin transport: spin precession, skew scattering, and
side jump. Then we present the kinetic (Boltzmann) equations, which describe
the spin-dependent distribution function of charge carriers, and the diffusion
equation for spin polarization density. Next, we define the notion of spin
currents and discuss their relation to spin polarization. Finally, we explain
the electrically induced spin effects; namely, spin polarization and currents
in bulk and near boundaries (the focus of most current theoretical research
efforts), and spin injection, as well as effects in mesoscopic systems and in
edge states.

a net attractive force between negatively charged strands of DNA, and lead to
the formation of ion pairs in dilute ionic solutions. But the long range of the
Coulomb interactions impedes the development of a simple local picture. We
address this general problem by mapping the properties of a nonuniform system
with Coulomb interactions onto those of a simpler system with short ranged
intermolecular interactions in an effective external field that accounts for
the averaged effects of appropriately chosen long ranged and slowly varying
components of the Coulomb interactions. The remaining short ranged components
combine with the other molecular core interactions and strongly affect pair
correlations in dense or strongly coupled systems. We show that pair
correlation functions in the effective short ranged system closely resemble
those in the uniform primitive model of ionic solutions, and illustrate the
formation of ion pairs and clusters at low densities. The theory accurately
describes detailed features of the effective attraction between two equally
charged walls at strong coupling and intermediate separations of the walls. New
analytical results for the minimal coupling strength needed to get any
attraction and for the separation where the attractive force is a maximum are
presented.

post-Newtonian one, and must be pushed to high order in order to describe with
sufficient accuracy (given the sensitivity of the detectors) the inspiral phase
of compact bodies, which immediately precedes their final merger. The resulting

topological configurations seem to play an important role in the formation of
the static quark-anti-quark potential. On the other hand, when studying Green's

  To investigate whether a connection between both aspects exist, the
eigenspectrum of the Faddeev-Popov operator in an instanton and a center-vortex
background field are determined analytically in the continuum. It is found that
both configurations give rise to additional zero-modes. This agrees with
corresponding studies of vortices in lattice gauge theory. In the vortex case
also one necessary condition for the confinement of color is fulfilled. Some

justify a strong, and hitherto unnoticed, empirical correlation between the
spread and the volatility_per trade_, with R^2s exceeding 0.9. This correlation
suggests both that the main determinant of the bid-ask spread is adverse
selection, and that most of the volatilitycomes from trade impact. We argue
that the role of the time-horizon appearing in the definition of costs is
crucial and that long-range correlations in the order flow, overlooked in
previous studies, must be carefully factored in. We find that the spread is

(Russia) an non--stationary screw dynamo is intended to be realized with a
helical flow of liquid sodium in a torus. The flow is necessarily turbulent,
that is, may be considered as a mean flow and a superimposed turbulence. In
this paper the induction processes of the turbulence are investigated within
the framework of mean--field electrodynamics. They imply of course a part which
leads to an enhanced dissipation of the mean magnetic field. As a consequence
of the helical mean flow there are also helical structures in the turbulence.
They lead to some kind of $\alpha$--effect, which might basically support the
screw dynamo. The peculiarity of this $\alpha$--effect explains measurements
made at a smaller version of the device envisaged for the dynamo experiment.
The helical structures of the turbulence lead also to other effects, which in
combination with a rotational shear are potentially capable of dynamo action. A
part of them can basically support the screw dynamo. Under the conditions of
the experiment all induction effects of the turbulence prove to be rather weak
in comparison to that of the main flow. Numerical solutions of the mean--field
induction equation show that all the induction effects of the turbulence
together let the screw dynamo threshold slightly, at most by one per cent,
rise. The numerical results give also some insights into the action of the
individual induction effects of the turbulence.

  Rayleigh-Benard convection","37 pages, 34 figures. Submitted to the Journal of Fluid Mechanics",,"10.1017/S0022112006002540",,"physics.flu-dyn",,"  We present a broad range of measurements of the angular orientation
theta_0(t) of the large-scale circulation (LSC) of turbulent Rayleigh-Benard
convection as a function of time. We used two cylindrical samples of different
overall sizes, but each with its diameter nearly equal to its height. The fluid
was water with a Prandtl number of 4.38. The time series theta_0(t) consisted
of meanderings similar to a diffusive process, but in addition contained large
and irregular spontaneous reorientation events through angles Delta theta. We
found that reorientations can occur by two distinct mechanisms. One consists of
a rotation of the circulation plane without any major reduction of the
circulation strength. The other involves a cessation of the circulation,
followed by a restart in a randomly chosen new direction. Rotations occurred an
order of magnitude more frequently than cessations. Rotations occurred with a
monotonically decreasing probability distribution p(Delta theta), i.e. there
was no dominant value of Delta theta and small Delta theta were more common
than large ones. For cessations p(Delta theta) was uniform, suggesting that
information of theta_0(t) before the cessation is lost. Both rotations and
cessations have Poissonian statistics in time, and can occur at any theta_0.
The average azimuthal rotation rate increased as the circulation strength of
the LSC decreased. Tilting the sample relative to gravity significantly reduced
the frequency of occurrence of both rotations and cessations.

fluctuation in growth rate, which can undergo a nonequilibrium phase
transition. Three states as excited, sub-excited and non-excited states of a
tumor are defined to describe its growth. The multiplicative noise is found to
be double-face: The positive effect on a non-excited tumor and the negative
effect on an excited tumor.

solutions to this system which can be found by means of standard numerics. The
formalism already used in a former work is derived in detail and is applied to
resonant as well as off-resonant cavity oscillations.

several different ways for the simultaneous transmission of independent
messages. We begin by extending the technique of superposition coding to
quantum channels with a classical input to give a general achievable region. We
also give outer bounds to the capacity regions for various special cases from
the classical literature and prove that superposition coding is optimal for a
class of channels. We then consider extensions of superposition coding for
channels with a quantum input, where some of the messages transmitted are
quantum instead of classical, in the sense that the parties establish bipartite
or tripartite GHZ entanglement. We conclude by using state merging to give
achievable rates for establishing bipartite entanglement between different
pairs of parties with the assistance of free classical communication.

various QKD schemes, by coupling the photon sender's knowledge of a shared
secret and the QBER Bob observes, are presented. It is shown that Alice can
encrypt certain portions of the information needed for the QKD protocols, using
a sequence whose security is based on computational-complexity, without
compromising all of the sequence's entropy. It is then shown that after a
Man-in-the-Middle attack on the quantum and classical channels, there is still
enough entropy left in the sequence for Bob to detect the presence of Eve by
monitoring the QBER. Finally, it is shown that the principles presented can be
implemented to authenticate the quantum channel associated with any type of QKD
scheme, and they can also be used for Alice to authenticate Bob.

a natural scenario for the assembly of multipartite entanglement measures based
on Hopf bundle-like mappings obtained through Clifford algebra representations.
Then, given the non-factorizability of an arbitrary two-qubit density matrix,
we give an alternate quantity that allows the construction of two types of
entanglement measures based on their arithmetical and geometrical averages over
all pairs of qubits in a register of size N, and thus fully characterize its
degree and type of entanglement. We find that such an arithmetical average is
both additive and strongly super additive.
