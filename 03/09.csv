generation of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence that leads to enhanced outward
angular momentum transport in accretion discs. Here, we present the first
formal analytical proof showing that, during the exponential growth of the
instability, the mean (averaged over the disc scale-height) Reynolds stress is
always positive, the mean Maxwell stress is always negative, and hence the mean
total stress is positive and leads to a net outward flux of angular momentum.
More importantly, we show that the ratio of the Maxwell to the Reynolds
stresses during the late times of the exponential growth of the instability is
determined only by the local shear and does not depend on the initial spectrum
of perturbations or the strength of the seed magnetic. Even though we derived
these properties of the stress tensors for the exponential growth of the
instability in incompressible flows, numerical simulations of shearing boxes
show that this characteristic is qualitatively preserved under more general
conditions, even during the saturated turbulent state generated by the
instability.

efficient outward transfer of angular momentum and inward transfer of mass

spiral arms in an unstable disk form self-gravitating clumps. Whether gas giant
protoplanets can form by such a disk instability process is the primary
question addressed by this review. We discuss the wide range of calculations
undertaken by ourselves and others using various numerical techniques, and we

topics include -- triggering mechanisms for GI's, disk heating and cooling,
orbital survival of dense clumps, interactions of solids with GI-driven waves

treated in non-LTE for many transitions of hydrogen, helium and the Ca II ion
allowing the calculation of detailed line profiles and continuum radiation. Two
simulations were carried out, with electron beam fluxes corresponding to
moderate and strong beam heating. In both cases we find the dynamics can be
naturally divided into two phases: an initial gentle phase in which hydrogen
and helium radiate away much of the beam energy, and an explosive phase
characterized by large hydrodynamic waves. During the initial phase, lower
chromospheric material is evaporated into higher regions of the atmosphere
causing many lines and continua to brighten dramatically. The He II Lya line is
especially enhanced, becoming the brightest line in the flaring spectrum. The
hydrogen Balmer lines also become much brighter and show very broad line
widths, in agreement with observations. We compare our predicted Balmer
decrements to decrements calculated for several flare observations and find the
predictions to be in general agreement with the observations. During the
explosive phase both condensation and evaporation waves are produced. The
moderate flare simulation predicts a peak evaporation wave of 130 km/s and a
condensation wave of 30 km/s. The velocity of the condensation wave matches
velocities observed in several transition region lines.

the development of new codes and improvement of existing ones. To this aim all

computer modelling of an exoplanetary system. This is far too time consuming to
apply to all of the 150 or so systems already known, and to keep up with the

great detail, and developed a speedier means of obtaining the critical

ion is produced by exothermic reactions of C+ with HF. Because fluorine atoms
can react exothermically with H2, HF is predicted to be the dominant reservoir
of fluorine, not only in well-shielded regions but also in the surface layers
of molecular clouds where the C+ abundance is large. The observed CF+ line
intensities imply the presence of CF+ column densities of at least 1.E+12 cm-2

colour-density relation using the data from the First Epoch VIMOS-VLT Deep
Survey (VVDS). The size (6582 galaxies), depth (I_AB<=24) and redshift sampling
rate of the survey enable us to reconstruct the 3D galaxy environment on
relatively local scales (R=5 Mpc) up to z~1.5. Particular attention has been
devoted to calibrate a density reconstruction scheme, which factors out survey
selection effects and reproduces in an unbiased way the underlying `real'
galaxy environment. While at lower redshift we confirm the existence of a steep
colour-density relation, with the fraction of the reddest(/bluest) galaxies of
the same luminosity increasing(/decreasing) as a function of density, this
trend progressively disappears in the highest redshift bins investigated. The
rest frame u*-g' colour-magnitude diagram shows a bimodal pattern in both low
and high density environments up to z~1.5. We find that the bimodal
distribution is not universal but strongly depends upon environment: at lower
redshifts the colour-magnitude diagrams in low and high density regions are
significantly different while the progressive weakening of the colour-density
relation causes the two bimodal distributions to nearly mirror each other in
the highest redshift bin investigated. Both the colour-density and the
colour-magnitude-density relations appear to be a transient, cumulative product
of genetic and environmental factors operating over at least a period of 9 Gyr.
These findings support an evolutionary scenario in which star formation/gas
depletion processes are accelerated in more luminous objects and in high
density environments: star formation activity is shifting with cosmic time
towards lower luminosity (downsizing), and out of high density environments.

to filaments observed in the neighbouring L1688 cloud. These filaments are also
seen in the 13CO observations of L1689. The filaments contain all of the
star-formation activity in the cloud. L1689 lies next to the well studied L1688
cloud that contains the rho Oph-A core. L1688 has a much more active
star-formation history than L1689 despite their apparent similarity in 13CO
data. Hence we label L1689 as the dog that didn't bark. We endeavour to explain
this apparent anomaly by comparing the total mass of each cloud that is
currently in the form of dense material such as prestellar cores. We note
firstly that L1688 is more massive than L1689, but we also find that when
normalised to the total mass of each cloud, the L1689 cloud has a much lower
percentage of mass in dense cores than L1688. We attribute this to the
hypothesis of Loren (1989) that the star formation in the rho-Ophiuchi complex
is being affected and probably dominated by the external influence of the
nearby Upper Scorpius OB association and predominantly by sigma-Sco. L1689 is
further from sigma-Sco and is therefore less active. The influence of sigma-Sco
appears nonetheless to have created the filaments that we observe in L1689.

well fitted by four components: a primary component (either a simple power law
or thermal Comptonization) absorbed by cold matter with abundances different
than those of standard ISM; reprocessing from an ionized disc; emission and
absorption lines; and a soft X-ray excess around 1 keV. The latter is not
confirmed by RGS (which were used in the second observation only); if real, the
excess could be due to reflection from the optically thin, photoionized plasma
of a disc wind, in which case it may provide a way to disentangle intrinsic
from interstellar absorption. Indeed, the former is best traced by the higher

(FIR) Background at 70 and 160um. We provide new estimates of the Cosmic
Infrared Background (CIB), and compare it with the Cosmic Optical Background
(COB). Methods. Using Spitzer data at 24, 70 and 160um in three deep fields, we
stacked more than 19000 MIPS 24um sources with S24>60uJy at 70 and 160um, and
measured the resulting FIR flux densities. Results. This method allows a gain
up to one order of magnitude in depth in the FIR. We find that the Mid-Infrared
(MIR) 24um selected sources contribute to more than 70% of the CIB at 70 and
160um. This is the first direct measurement of the contribution of MIR-selected
galaxies to the FIR CIB. Galaxies contributing the most to the total CIB are
thus z~1 luminous infrared galaxies, which have intermediate stellar masses. We
estimate that the CIB will be resolved at 0.9 mJy at 70 and 3 mJy at 160um. By
combining the extrapolation of the 24um source counts below 60uJy, with 160/24
and 70/24 colors as measured with the stacking analysis, we obtain lower limits
of 7.1+/-1.0 and 13.4+/-1.7 nW/m2/sr for the CIB at 70 and 160um, respectively.
Conclusions. The MIPS surveys have resolved more than three quarters of the MIR
and FIR CIB. By carefully integrating the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL)
SED, we also find that the CIB has the same brightness as the COB, around 24
nW/m2/sr. The EBL is produced on average by 115 infrared photons for one
visible photon. Finally, the galaxy formation and evolution processes emitted a
brightness equivalent to 5% of the primordial electromagnetic background (CMB).

GRS 1915+105 when the source was in its variability class theta, characterized
by alternating soft and hard states on a time scale of a few hundred seconds.
The aim was to examine the high-frequency part of the power spectrum in order
to confirm the hecto-Hertz Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPO) previously
reported from observations from mixed variability behaviours. During the hard
intervals (corresponding to state C in the classification of Belloni et al.,
2000, A&A, 35, 271), we find a significant QPO at a frequency of ~170 Hz,
although much broader (Q~2) than previously reported. No other significant peak
is observed at frequencies >30 Hz. A time-resolved spectral analysis of
selected observations shows that the hard intervals from class theta show a
stronger and steeper (Gamma=2.8-3.0) power-law component than hard intervals
from other classes. We discuss these results in the framework of hecto-Hertz
QPOs reported from GRS 1915+105 and other black-hole binaries.

of sigma for perpendicular shocks. At low magnetizations the shock is mediated
mainly by the Weibel instability which generates transient magnetic fields that
can exceed the initial field. At larger magnetizations the shock is dominated
by magnetic reflections. We demonstrate where the transition occurs and argue
that it is impossible to have very low magnetization collisionless shocks in

perpendicular shocks do not efficiently accelerate nonthermal particles in 3D.

P2 and S/2005 P1, are significantly non-Keplerian, even if P2 and P1 have
negligible masses, because the mass ratio of Charon-Pluto is ~0.1. We present
an analytic theory with P2 and P1 treated as test particles. This analytic
theory shows that the azimuthal periods of P2 and P1 are shorter than the
Keplerian orbital periods and that the periapse and ascending node of each of
the satellites precess at nearly equal rates in opposite directions. The
deviation from Kepler's third law is already detected in the unperturbed
Keplerian fit of Buie and coworkers. We also present direct numerical orbit
integrations with different assumed masses for P2 and P1 within the ranges
allowed by the albedo uncertainties. If the albedos are as high as that of
Charon, the masses of P2 and P1 are sufficiently low that their orbits are well
described by the analytic theory. There is at present no evidence that P2 has
any significant epicyclic eccentricity. However, the orbit of P1 has a
significant epicyclic eccentricity, and its prograde periapse precession with a
period of 5300 days should be easily detectable. If the albedos are as low as
that of comets, the large inferred masses induce significant variations in the
epicyclic eccentricities and/or periapse longitudes on the 400-500-day
timescales, due to the proximity of P2 and P1 to the 3:2 mean-motion
commensurability. In fact, for the maximum inferred masses, P2 and P1 may be in
the 3:2 mean-motion resonance, with the resonance variable involving the
periapse longitude of P1 librating. Observations that sample the orbits of P2

the masses of P2 and P1 in the near future.

of ten lower than given by the collisionally excited [O {\sc iii}] forbidden
lines. The ionic abundances of heavy elements relative to hydrogen derived from
ORLs are about a factor of 70 higher than those deduced from collisionally
excited lines (CELs) from the same ions, the largest abundance discrepancy
factor (adf) ever measured for a PN. By comparing the observed O {\sc ii}
$\lambda$4089/$\lambda$4649 ORL ratio to theoretical value as a function of
electron temperature, we show that the O {\sc ii} ORLs arise from ionized
regions with an electron temperature of only $\sim 630$ K. The current
observations thus provide the strongest evidence that the nebula contains
another previously unknown component of cold, high metallicity gas, which is
too cool to excite any significant optical or UV CELs and is thus invisible via
such lines. The existence of such a plasma component in PNe provides a natural
solution to the long-standing dichotomy between nebular plasma diagnostics and
abundance determinations using CELs on the one hand and ORLs on the other.

more data than actually required, sacrificing sensitivity and image fidelity in

interferometer data to filter out measurements which are likely to be affected
by interference. Pieflag uses two algorithms to allow for data sets which are
either dominated by receiver noise or by source structure. Together, the
algorithms detect essentially all affected data whilst the amount of data which
is not affected by interference but falsely marked as such is kept to a
minimum. The sections marked by Pieflag are very similar to what would be
deemed affected by the observer in a visual inspection of the data. Pieflag
displays its results concisely and allows the user to add and remove flags
interactively. It is written in Python, is easy to install and use, and has a
variety of options to adjust its algorithms to a particular observing

different types of QSOs. Post-starburst stellar populations are potentially
present in the majority of QSO hosts. QSOs with far-infrared colors similar to
those of ultraluminous infrared galaxies invariably reside in merging galaxies
that have interaction-induced starbursts of a few hundred Myr or less. Similar,
but dramatically more luminous post-starburst populations are found in the
recently discovered class of QSOs known as post-starburst QSOs, or Q+A's. Both
of these classes, however, comprise only a small fraction (10-15%) of the total
QSO population. The so-called ""red"" QSOs generally suffer from strong
extinction at optical wavelengths, making them ideal candidates for the study
of hosts. Their stellar populations typically show a post-starburst component
as well, though with a larger range of ages. Finally, optical ""classical"" QSO
hosts show traces of major star formation episodes (typically involving >10% of

from maintaining the shock discontinuity inside the same grid zone in the

Universe. This is a non-Friedmann model with a non-uniform static space-time.
The major dynamical factor controlling the local expansion is the antigravity
produced by the omnipresent and permanent dark energy of the cosmic vacuum (or
the cosmological constant). The antigravity dominates at distances larger than
1-2 Mpc from the center of the Local Group. The model gives a natural
explanation of the two key quantitative characteristics of the local expansion
flow, which are the local Hubble constant and the velocity dispersion of the
flow. The observed kinematical similarity of the local and global flows of
expansion is clarified by the model. We demonstrate analytically the efficiency
of the vacuum cooling mechanism that allows one to see the Hubble flow so close
to the Local Group. Special significance is argued for the 'universal Hubble
constant' H_V, depending only on the vacuum density (H_V \approx 60 km/s/Mpc).
The model makes a number of testable predictions. It also shows unexpectedly
that it is the dwarf galaxies of the local flow with the shortest distances and
lowest redshifts that may be the most sensitive indicators of dark energy in
our neighborhood.

them. The peculiarity of these sources lies in the fact that these are the only
two cases among low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), besides the confirmed case of
GX 1+4, for which the companion can possibly be a M-type giant. We found that
in both cases the field M-type giant star is indeed the counterpart of these
X-ray sources. We also determined the distance to 4U 1954+319 to be about 1.7
kpc. This result suggests that a number of faint (L_X around 10^32-10^34 erg
s-1) Galactic X-ray sources are `symbiotic X-ray binaries', that is, wide-orbit
LMXBs composed of a compact object, most likely a neutron star, accreting from
the wind of a M-type giant.

widths in quasars are dependent on the source orientation, consistent with the
idea that the broad-line region is flattened or disc-like. This reinforces the
view derived from radio-selected samples, where the radio-core dominance has
been used as a measure of orientation. The results presented here show a highly
significant (>99.95%) correlation between radio spectral index (which we use as
a proxy for source orientation) and broad-line width derived from the H-beta
and MgII emission lines. This is the first time that this type of study has
used quasars derived from a large optically selected quasar sample, where the
radio-loud quasars (RLQs) and radio-quiet quasars (RQQs) have indistinguishable
distributions in redshift, bolometric luminosity and colour, and therefore
overcomes any biases which may be present in only selecting via radio emission.
We find that the mean FWHM for the flat-spectrum radio-loud quasars (FSQs) to
be <FWHM(FSQ)>= 4990 +/- 536km/s, which differs significant from the mean FWHM
of the steep-spectrum radio-loud quasars (SSQs), where <FWHM(SSQ)>=6464 +/-
506km/s. We also find that the distribution in FWHM for the FSQs is
indistinguishable from that of the radio-quiet quasars (RQQs), where
<FWHM(RQQ)>= 4831 +/-25km/s. Considering other observational results in the
literature we interpret this result in the context of a significant fraction of
the FSQs being derived from the underlying RQQ population which have their
radio flux Doppler boosted above the RLQ/RQQ divide. Under the assumption of a
disc-like broad-line region we find no evidence for a difference in the average
line-of-sight angle for RQQs and RLQs, implying that the difference is due to
black-hole mass. (abridged)

the expansion along the direction to that source. If there are preferred
directions in the underlying geometry one can define several expansion
parameters. We provide such definitions for the case of the Tolman-Bondi

surrounding cosmological fluid. Our framework is similar in spirit to the model
of spherical collapse. For an observer in the vicinity of a central
overdensity, the perceived local evolution is consistent with acceleration in
the direction towards the center of the overdensity, and deceleration
perpendicularly to it. A negative mass leads to deceleration along the radial
direction, and acceleration perpendicularly to it. If the observer is located
at the center of an overdensity the null geodesics are radial. The form of the
luminosity distance as a function of the redshift is consistent with
acceleration for a certain range of redshifts.

disks may greatly influence the migration patterns and survival probabilities
of nascent planets. Provided that the turbulence is a stationary stochastic
process with finite amplitude and correlation time, the resulting diffusive
migration can be described with a Fokker-Planck equation, which we reduce to an
advection-diffusion equation. We calibrate the coefficients with existing
turbulent-disk simulations and mean-migration estimates, and solve the equation
both analytically and numerically. Diffusion tends to dominate over advection
for planets of low-mass and those in the outer regions of proto-planetary
disks, whether they are described by the Minimum Mass Solar Nebula (MMSN) or by
T-Tauri alpha disks. Diffusion systematically reduces the lifetime of most
planets, yet it allows a declining fraction of them to survive for extended
periods of time at large radii. Mean planet lifetimes can even be formally
infinite (e.g. in an infinite steady MMSN), though median lifetimes are always
finite. Surviving planets may linger near specific radii where the combined
effects of advection and diffusion are minimized, or at large radii, depending
on model specifics. The stochastic nature of migration in turbulent disks
challenges deterministic planet formation scenarios and suggests instead that a
wide variety of planetary outcomes are possible from similar initial
conditions. This would contribute to the diversity of (extrasolar) planetary
systems.

$\rt$ of steps to reaction. The two reactants are distinguished by their mass
with the ""light"" walker performing a jump to a nearest-neighbor site in each
time step, while the ""heavy"" walker hops only with a probability $p$; we
associate $p$ with the ""temperature"" of the system. Lattices subject to
periodic and to confining boundary conditions are considered. For periodic
lattices, depending on the initial state, the reaction time either falls off
monotonically with $p$ or displays a local minimum with respect to $p$;
occurrence of the latter signals a regime where the efficiency of the reaction
effectively decreases with increasing temperature. Such behavior disappears if
the jump probability of the light walker falls below a characteristic threshold
value. In lattices subject to confining boundary conditions, the behavior is
more complex. Depending on the initial conditions, the reaction time as a
function of $p$ may increase monotonically, decrease monotonically, display a
single maximum or even a maximum and minimum. These inverted regions are a
consequence of a strictly classical interplay between excluded volume effects
implicit in the specification of the two reaction channels, and the system's
dimensionality and spatial extent. Our results highlight situations where the
description of an encounter-controlled reactive event cannot be described by a
single, effective diffusion coefficient. We also distinguish between the
inversion region identified here and the Marcus inverted region which arises in
electron transfer reactions.

of aggregation probabilities proportional to the squared number of occupied
sites ($k^2$). In the present work, we analyzed this algorithm using the noise
reduced version of the DLA model and large scale simulations. In the noiseless
limit, instead of isotropic patterns, a $45^\circ$ ($30^\circ$) rotation in the
anisotropy directions of the clusters grown on square (triangular) lattices was
observed. A generalized algorithm, in which the aggregation probability is
proportional to $k^\nu$, was proposed. The exponent $\nu$ has a nonuniversal
critical value $\nu_c$, for which the patterns generated in the noiseless limit
exhibit the original (axial) anisotropy for $\nu<\nu_c$ and the rotated one
(diagonal) for $\nu>\nu_c$. The values $\nu_c = 1.395\pm0.005$ and $\nu_c =
0.82\pm 0.01$ were found for square and triangular lattices, respectively.
Moreover, large scale simulations show that there are a nontrivial relation
between noise reduction and anisotropy direction. The case $\nu=2$ (\bogo's
rule) is an example where the patterns exhibit the axial anisotropy for small

which provide effective boundary conditions on the quasi-neutral bulk. We solve
the resulting nonlinear partial differential equations numerically for strong

of charge transport. Our results for the one-orbital case confirm and extend
previous recent investigations that showed the presence of robust peaks in the
resistivity vs. temperature curves for this model. Quenched disorder
substantially enhances the magnitude of the effect, while magnetic fields
drastically reduce the resistivity. A simple picture for the origin of these
results is presented. It is also shown that even for the case of just one
electron, the resistance curves present metallic and insulating regions by
varying the temperature, as it occurs at finite electronic density. Moreover,
in the present study these investigations are extended to the more realistic
two-orbital model for manganites. The transport results for this model show
large peaks in the resistivity vs. temperature curves, located at approximately
the Curie temperature, and with associated large magnetoresistance factors.
Overall, the magnitude and shape of the effects discussed here closely resemble
experiments for materials such as $\rm La_{0.70} Ca_{0.30} Mn O_{3}$, and they
are in qualitative agreement with the current predominant theoretical view that
competition between a metal and an insulator, enhanced by quenched disorder, is

resistance and $1/T_1T$ measured on an as-grown sample decrease below $T_{\rm

method is based on a better representation of the potential due to interacting
electrons that is obtained by specifying both the average and standard
deviation. The standard deviation is determined from a probabilistic
interpretation of the Coulomb interaction between electrons. This leads to a
better representation of orbital energies as Ei (plus-minus) delta(Ei), where
Ei is the Hartree-Fock orbital energy and delta(Ei), the spread, is an
indicator of the magnitude of correlation energy. This new representation of
the potential when combined with an empirical constant leads naturally to a new
method to determine electron correlation energy. Correlation energy is
determined within the independent electron approximation without any
contribution from higher energy unoccupied states. A consistent physical
interpretation that an electron occupies a given position when other electrons
are farther than on average can be made. It is a general technique that can be
used to determine correlation energy in any system of particles with
inter-particle interaction V(r1, r2) and can be considered to be universal
first step beyond mean-field theory.

are independent and isotropically distributed. It has been shown that the
randomly constructed codebook is asymptotically optimal. In this paper, we
consider two types of signature selection criteria. One is to select the
signature vector that minimizes the interference from other users. The other
one is to select the signature vector to match the weakest interference
directions. By letting the processing gain, number of users and feedback bits
approach infinity with fixed ratios, we derive the exact asymptotic formulas to
calculate the average interference for both criteria. Our simulations
demonstrate the theoretical formulas. The analysis can be extended to evaluate
the signal-to-interference plus noise ratio performance for both match filter

(q_R) on the left (right) boundary (brane). The theory then necessarily
contains a Chern-Simons term (anomaly flux) to cancel the fermionic anomalies

parameter, particle worldlines are traced out by the evolution of spacetime
events. In pre-Maxwell electrodynamics -- the local gauge theory associated
with this framework -- events induce five local off-shell fields, which mediate
interactions between instantaneous events, not between the worldlines which
represent entire particle histories. The fifth field, required to compensate
for dependence of gauge transformations on the evolution parameter, enables the
exchange of mass between particles and fields. In the equilibrium limit, these
pre-Maxwell fields are pushed onto the zero-mass shell, but during interactions
there is no mechanism regulating the mass that photons may acquire, even when
event trajectories evolve far into the spacelike region. This feature of the
off-shell formalism requires the application of some ad hoc mechanism for
controlling the photon mass in low energy classical Coulomb scattering of
charged events, and in the renormalization of off-shell quantum
electrodynamics. We discuss a nonlocal, higher derivative correction to the
photon kinetic term, which provides regulation of the photon mass in a manner
that preserves the gauge invariance and Poincare covariance of the original
theory. We demonstrate that the inclusion of this term is equivalent to an
earlier solution to the classical Coulomb problem, and that the resulting
quantum field theory is renormalized.

different metabolic states (basal and maximum) are described by considering
that the biological lengths and the physiological time are related by different

occurs by ballistic and diffusion processes. In $d=3$, the 3/4 law occurs if
the ballistic movement is the dominant process, while the 2/3 law appears when
both transport processes are equivalent. Accelerated movement during the
biological time is related to the maximum aerobic sustained metabolism, which
is characterized by the scaling exponent $2d/(2d+1)$ (6/7 in $d=3$). The
results are in good agreement with empirical data and a verifiable empirical

fluctuations rather than regularity is the common case. I show that this
temporal heterogeneity can be explained by two mechanisms: (i) humans have some
perception of their past activity rate and (ii) based on that they react by
accelerating or reducing their activity rate. Using these two mechanisms I
explain the inter-event time statistics of Darwin's and Einstein's

Moreover, they are typical examples of the the accelerating and reducing class,
respectively. These results are relevant to the system design of human oriented

namely, a zigzag pattern of successive increases followed by decreases on all

unpredictable (chaotic) fluctuations of dynamical systems exhibit underlying
order with the power spectra exhibiting inverse power law form, now identified
as self-organized criticality. The physics of self-organized criticality is not
yet identified. A general systems theory developed by the author shows that
self-similar fractal fluctuations are signatures of quantum-like chaos in
dynamical systems of all size scales ranging from the subatomic dynamics of
quantum systems to macro-scale fluid flows. The model predicts the universal
inverse power-law form of the statistical normal distribution for the power
spectra of fractal space-time fluctuations of dynamical systems. In this paper

shown that prediction of times of occurrence of maxima and minima during the

closures of braids at roots of unity. Next we provide a self-contained proof of
a result of Freedman et al. that any quantum computation can be replaced by an
additive approximation of the Jones polynomial, evaluated at almost any
primitive root of unity. Our proof encodes two-qubit unitaries into the
rectangular representation of the eight-strand braid group. We then give
QCMA-complete and PSPACE-complete problems which are based on braids. We
conclude with direct proofs that evaluating the Jones polynomial of the plat
closure at most primitive roots of unity is a #P-hard problem, while learning
its most significant bit is PP-hard, circumventing the usual route through the
Tutte polynomial and graph coloring.

"quant-ph/0603070","Alan Kadin","Alan M. Kadin","Wave-Particle Duality and the Coherent Quantum Domain Picture","13 pages",,,,"quant-ph",,"  It is proposed that the paradox of wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics
may be resolved using a physical picture analogous to magnetic domains. Within
this picture, a quantum particle represents a coherent region of a quantum wave
with characteristic total energy, momentum, and spin. The dynamics of such a
state are described by the usual linear quantum wave equations. But the
coherence is maintained by a nonlinear self-interaction term that is evident
only during transitions from one quantum state to another. This is analogous to
the self-organizing property of domains in a ferromagnetic material, in which a
single domain may appear as a stable macro-particle, but with rapid transitions
between different domain configurations also possible. For the quantum case,
this implies that the ""collapse of the wave function"" is a real dynamical
physical process that occurs continuously in spacetime. This picture may also
permit the resolution of apparent paradoxes associated with quantum measurement
and entangled states.

A {\bf 68}, 032308 (2003)] provides a natural and reliable indicator of quantum
chaotic behavior. Since generalized entanglement depends directly on a choice
of preferred observables, exploring how generalized entanglement increases
under dynamical evolution is possible without invoking an auxiliary coupled
system or decomposing the system into arbitrary subsystems. We find that, in
the chaotic regime, the long-time saturation value of generalized entanglement
agrees with random matrix theory predictions. For our system, we provide
physical intuition into generalized entanglement within a single system by
invoking the notion of extent of a state. The latter, in turn, is related to
other signatures of quantum chaos.

subsystem is slow, a vector potential is generated with a simple canonical
transformation. This vector potential, on one hand, gives rise to the familiar
Berry phase in the fast quantum dynamics; on the other hand, it yields a
Lorentz-like force in the slow classical dynamics. In this way, the pure phase
(Berry phase) of a wavefunction is linked to a physical force.

one dimension are considered. The first one is the most general quadratic
commutation relation. The corresponding nonzero minimal uncertainties in

eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator in an electric field is studied. The
second extension is a function-dependent generalization of the simplest
quadratic commutation relation with only a nonzero minimal uncertainty in
position. Such an uncertainty now becomes dependent on the average position.
With each function-dependent commutation relation we associate a family of
potentials whose spectrum can be exactly determined through supersymmetric
quantum mechanical and shape invariance techniques. Some representations of the
generalized Heisenberg algebras are proposed in terms of conventional position
and momentum operators $x$, $p$. The resulting Hamiltonians contain a
contribution proportional to $p^4$ and their $p$-dependent terms may also be
functions of $x$. The theory is illustrated by considering P\""oschl-Teller and
Morse potentials.
