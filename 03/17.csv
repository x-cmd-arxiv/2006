show that X-ray afterglow observations on day time scale constrain the

pre-shock density. This suggests that either the shock propagates into a highly

strongly amplified, most likely by the streaming of high energy shock
accelerated particles. More stringent constraints may be obtained by afterglow

from the northern lobe of a bipolar radio jet known to be associated with this

jet-like morphology as well, and it is argued that the mid-infrared emission
observed is dominated by thermal continuum emission from dust. The mid-infrared
emission nearest the central stellar source is believed to be directly heated
dust on the walls of the outflow cavity. The hydroxyl, water, and methanol
masers associated with G35.20-0.74 are spatially located along these

be the locations of the linear distribution of methanol masers that are found
associated with massive young stellar objects. The fact that G35.20-0.74 has
mid-infrared emission that is dominated by the outflow, rather than disk
emission, is a caution to those that consider mid-infrared emission from young
stellar objects as only coming from circumstellar disks.

a progressive photo-ionization. We investigate the environment of the burst and
constrain its density profile. We find that the overall behavior of the

delayed external shock from a thick shell, inverse Compton emission from

regions are indeed due to jets emanating from the explosion center, and not due
to polar cavities in the circumstellar medium at the time of explosion. We
place limits on the equivalent isotropic explosion energy in the polar regions
(around 2.3 x 10^52 ergs), and the opening angle of the x-ray emitting ejecta
(around 7 degrees), which give a total energy in the NE jet of order 10^50
ergs; an order of magnitude or more lower than inferred for ""typical"" GRBs.
While the Cas A progenitor and explosion exhibit many of the features
associated with GRB hosts, e.g. extensive presupernova mass loss and rotation,
and jets associated with the explosion, we speculate that the recoil of the
compact central object, with velocity 330 km/s, may have rendered the jet
unstable. In such cases the jet rapidly becomes baryon loaded, if not truncated
altogether. Although unlikely to have produced a gamma ray burst, the jets in
Cas A suggest that such outflows may be common features of core-collapse SNe.

the shock heated, thermal intracluster medium around the expanding cavity to
infer the properties of the radio synchrotron-emitting gas inside the cavity.
The gas along the N and S edges of the cavity is found to have an average
temperature of 6.0 keV, which is hotter than the temperature (4.6 keV) of the
adjacent intracluster gas. It is proposed that this hotter gas is intracluster
gas shocked by the expanding cavity. The shock is thus inferred to be weak
(Mach number 1.3, a value also inferred from the density jump at the cavity
edge) and its velocity 1,460 km/s. The total kinetic power of the expansion is
found to be 1.2 x 10^{46} erg/s, which is larger than both the total radio
power and the power emitted by the entire intracluster medium in the 2 -- 10
keV band. It appears that most of the power of the jets in Cygnus A is
currently going into heating the intracluster medium. From the derived pressure
inside the cavity, there is no conclusive evidence for a component contributing
pressure additional to the magnetic fields and relativistic particles
responsible for the synchrotron radio emission. Further, the ratio of energy
densities in positive to negative cosmic rays in Cygnus A is between 1 and 100

Proportional Counter Array (PCA) data of such a burst (but with a considerably
different intensity profile from the previous one) from the low mass X-ray
binary (LMXB) system 4U 1636-536, and show that this model can qualitatively
explain the observed burst profile and spectral evolution, if we assume an
off-polar, but high-latitude ignition, and burning front stalling at a higher
latitude compared to that for the previous burst. The off-polar ignition can
account for the millisecond period brightness oscillations detected from this

Our model can qualitatively explain the oscillation amplitude measured during
the first (weaker) peak, and the absence of oscillations during the second

of a signature of this stalling, which is the primary result of this work, and
may be useful for understanding thermonuclear flame spreading on neutron stars.

Survey at declination -60 to -70 were observed at up to three epochs during
2002-4, including near-simultaneous measurements at 5, 8 and 18 GHz in 2003. Of
the 173 sources detected, 65% are candidate QSOs, BL Lac objects or blazars,
20% galaxies and 15% faint (b > 22 mag) optical objects or blank fields.
  On a 1-2 year timescale, the general level of variability at 20 GHz appears
to be low. For the 108 sources with good-quality measurements in both 2003 and
2004, the median variability index at 20 GHz was 6.9% and only five sources
varied by more than 30% in flux density.
  Most sources in our sample show low levels of linear polarization (typically
1-5%), with a median fractional polarization of 2.3% at 20 GHz. There is a
trend for fainter sources to show higher fractional polarization.
  At least 40% of sources selected at 20GHz have strong spectral curvature over
the frequency range 1-20 GHz. We use a radio `two-colour diagram' to
characterize the radio spectra of our sample, and confirm that the radio-source
population at 20 GHz (which is also the foreground point-source population for
CMB anisotropy experiments like WMAP and Planck) cannot be reliably predicted
by extrapolating the results of surveys at lower frequencies. As a result,
direct selection at 20 GHz appears to be a more efficient way of identifying 90
GHz phase calibrators for ALMA than the currently-proposed technique of
extrapolation from all-sky surveys at 1-5 GHz.

very important to estimate the event rates of possible detection candidates. We
consider an additional possibility of GW bursts produced during parabolic
encounters (PEs) of stellar mass compact objects. We estimate the rate of
successful detections for specific detectors: the initial Laser Interferometric
Gravitational-Wave Observatory (InLIGO), the French-Italian gravitational-wave
antenna VIRGO, the near-future Advanced-LIGO (AdLIGO), the space-based Laser
Interferometric Space Antenna (LISA), and the Next Generation LISA (NGLISA).
Simple GC models are constructed to account for the compact object mass
function, mass segregation, number density distribution, and velocity
distribution. We calculate encounters both classically and account for general
relativistic corrections by extrapolating the results for infinite mass ratios.
We also include the cosmological redshift of waveforms and event rates. We find
that typical PEs with masses m_1=m_2=40 Msun are detectable with matched
filtering over a signal to noise ratio of 5 within a distance d_L~200Mpc for
InLIGO and VIRGO, z=1 for AdLIGO, 0.4Mpc for LISA, and 1Gpc for NGLISA. We
estimate single datastream total detection rates of 5.5 x 10^{-5} for InLIGO,
7.2 x 10^{-5} for VIRGO, 0.063 for AdLIGO, 2.9 x 10^{-6} for LISA, and 1.0 for
NGLISA per year, for reasonably conservative assumptions. These estimates are
subject to uncertainties in the GC parameters, most importantly the total
number and mass-distribution of black holes (BHs) in the cluster core. In
reasonably optimistic cases, we get >~1 detections for AdLIGO per year. The
regular detection of GWs during PEs would provide a unique observational probe
for constraining the stellar BH mass function of dense clusters. (abridged)

mass-losing, evolved stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. These stars were
selected to have high mass-loss rates and so contribute significantly to the
return of processed materials to the ISM. Our high-quality spectra enable the
determination of the chemistry of the circumstellar envelope from the mid-IR
spectral features and continuum. We have classified the spectral types of the
stars and show that the spectral types separate clearly in infrared color-color
diagrams constructed from 2MASS data and synthetic IRAC/MIPS fluxes derived
from our IRS spectra. We present diagnostics to identify and classify evolved
stars in nearby galaxies with high confidence levels using Spitzer and 2MASS
photometry. Comparison of the spectral classes determined using IRS data with
the IR types assigned based on NIR colors also revealed a significant number of
misclassifications and enabled us to refine the NIR color criteria resulting in
more accurate NIR color classifications of dust-enshrouded objects.

molecular cloud and the formation of a stellar cluster to study how the initial
conditions for star formation affect the resulting initial mass function (IMF).
In particular, we are interested in the relation between the thermal Jeans mass
in a cloud and the knee of the initial mass function, i.e. the mass separating
the region with a flat IMF slope from that typified by a steeper,
Salpeter-like, slope. In three isothermal simulations with M_J=1 solar mass,
M_J=2 solar masses and M_J=5 solar masses, the number of stars formed, at
comparable dynamical times, scales roughly with the number of initial Jeans
masses in the cloud. The mean stellar mass also increases (though less than
linearly) with the initial Jeans mass in the cloud. It is found that the IMF in
each case displays a prominent knee, located roughly at the mass scale of the
initial Jeans mass. Thus clouds with higher initial Jeans masses produce IMFs
which are shallow to higher masses. This implies that a universal IMF requires
a physical mechanism that sets the Jeans mass to be near 1 solar mass.
Simulations including a barotropic equation of state as suggested by Larson,
with cooling at low densities followed by gentle heating at higher densities,
are able to produce realistic IMFs with the knee located at approximately 1
solar mass, even with an initial M_J=5 solar masses. We therefore suggest that
the observed universality of the IMF in the local Universe does not require any
fine tuning of the initial conditions in star forming clouds but is instead
imprinted by details of the cooling physics of the collapsing gas.

one is a member of a small galaxy group at z~0.63, which also includes the
lensing galaxy in the B1608+656 system, and the second is a member of a
foreground group at z~0.43. By measuring the effective radii and surface
brightnesses of the two lens galaxies, we infer their velocity dispersions
based on the passively evolving Fundamental Plane (FP) relation. Elliptical
isothermal lens mass models are able to explain their image configurations
within the lens hypothesis, with a velocity dispersion compatible with that
estimated from the FP for a reasonable source-redshift range. Based on the
large number of massive early-type galaxies in the field and the number-density
of faint blue galaxies, the presence of two additional lens systems around
CLASS B1608+656 is not unlikely in hindsight. Gravitational lens galaxies are
predominantly early-type galaxies, which are clustered, and the lensed quasar
host galaxies are also clustered. Therefore, obtaining deep high-resolution
images of the fields around known strong lens systems is an excellent method of
enhancing the probability of finding additional strong gravitational lens
systems.

that any successful model needs to account for the many observed properties of
star forming regions including clustering, mass segregation and binarity.
Fragmentation involving the interplay of gravity, turbulence, and thermal
effects is probably responsible for setting the characteristic stellar mass.
Low-mass stars and brown dwarfs can form through the fragmentation of dense
filaments and disks, possibly followed by early ejection from these dense
environments which truncates their growth in mass. Higher-mass stars and the
Salpeter-like slope of the IMF are most likely formed through continued
accretion in a clustered environment. The effects of feedback and magnetic
fields on the origin of the IMF are still largely unclear. Lastly, we discuss a

``bulges'' which form through secular evolution, rather than mergers. In this
study, pseudobulges are identified using the presence of disk-like structure in
the center of the galaxy (nuclear spiral, nuclear bar, and/or high ellipticity
in bulge); classical bulges are those galaxy bulges with smooth isophotes which
are round compared to the outer disk, and show no disky structure in their
bulge. I show that galaxies structurally identified as having pseudobulges have
higher central star formation rates than those of classical bulges. Further, I
also show that galaxies identified as having classical bulges have remarkably
regular star formation profiles. The color profiles of galaxies with classical
bulges show a star forming outer disk with a sharp change, consistent with a
decline in star formation rates, toward the center of the galaxy. Classical
bulges have a nearly constant inner profile (r < 1.5 kpc) that is similar to
elliptical galaxies. Pseudobulges in general show no such transition in star
formation properties from the outer disk to the central pseudobulge. Thus I
conclude that pseudobulges and classical bulges do in fact form their stars via
different mechanisms. Further, this adds to the evidence that classical bulges
form most of their stars in fast episodic bursts, in a similar fashion to
elliptical galaxies; whereas, pseudobulges form stars from longer lasting
secular processes.

in spatial extent and over 17 orders of magnitude in density contrast. For
comparison, we calculate two models: resistive and ideal MHD models. Both
models have the same initial condition, but the former includes dissipation
process of magnetic field while the latter does not. The magnetic fluxes in

in resistive MHD model, rapidly rotating stellar core (the second core) is
formed. After stellar core formation, the magnetic field of the core is largely
amplified both by magneto-rotational instability and the shearing motion
between the stellar core and ambient medium. As a consequence, high speed
(simeq 45 km,s^-1) jets are driven by the second core, which results in strong
mass ejection. A cocoon-like structure around the second core also forms with

to contain any substantial number of hot stars. It was confirmed by following
space missions, ANS (de Boer 1982), IUE (Bertola et al. 1982) and HUT (Brown et
al. 1997). The positive correlation between the UV-to-optical colour (i.e., the
strength of the UV upturn) and the Mg2 line strength found by Burstein et al.
(1987) through IUE observations has urged theorists to construct novel
scenarios in which metal-rich ($\gtrsim Z_{\odot}$) old ($\gtrsim$ a few Gyr)
stars become UV bright (Greggio & Renzini 1990; Horch et al. 1992). Also
interesting was to find using HUT that, regardless of the UV strength, the UV
spectral slopes at 1000--2000\AA in the six UV bright galaxies were nearly
identical suggesting a very small range of temperatures of the UV sources in
these galaxies (Brown et al. 1997), which corresponds to $T_{\rm eff} \approx
20,000 \pm 3,000$ K. This, together with other evidence, effectively ruled out
young stars as the main driver of the UV upturn. A good review on the
observational side of the story is given in the next article by Tom Brown, as

maximum (FWHM) to their line dispersion, i.e., the second moment of the line
profile. We use this parameter to separate the reverberation-mapped AGNs into
two populations, the first with narrower H$\beta$ lines with relatively
extended wings, and the second with broader lines that are relatively
flat-topped. The first population is characterized by higher Eddington ratios
than the second. Within each population, we calibrate the black-hole mass scale
by comparison of the reverberation-based mass with that predicted by the bulge
velocity dispersion. We also use the distribution of ratios of the
reverberation-based mass to the velocity-dispersion mass prediction in a
comparison with a ``generalized thick disk'' model in order to see if
inclination can plausibly account for the observed distribution. We find that
the line dispersion is a less biased parameter in general than FWHM for black
hole mass estimation, although we show that it is possible to empirically
correct for the bias introduced by using FWHM to characterize the emission-line
width. We also argue that inclination effects are apparent in a small subset of
objects with the narrowest emission lines. Our principal conclusion is that the

and saturates through a balance between its growth and non-linear transfer. The
cosmic-ray resonant instability then takes over and is quenched by advection
through the shock. The level of turbulence is determined by the non-resonant
regime if the shock velocity $V_{\rm sh}$ is larger than a few times $\xi_{\rm

derived the properties of the MHD turbulence so generated, in particular its
anisotropic character, its amplitude and its spectrum. In the present paper, we
calculate the diffusion coefficients, also accounting for compression through
the shock, and show that the predicted three-dimensional turbulence spectrum
$k_\perp S_{3\rm d}(k_\parallel,k_\perp)\propto
k_\parallel^{-1}k_\perp^{-\alpha}$ (with $k_\parallel$ and $k_\perp$ the
wavenumber components along and perpendicular to the shock normal) generally
leads to Bohm diffusion in the parallel direction. However, if the anisotropy
is constrained by a relation of the form $k_\parallel \propto k_\perp^{2/3}$,
which arises when the turbulent energy cascade occurs at a constant rate
independent of scale, then the diffusion coefficient loses its Bohm scaling and
scales as in isotropic Kolmogorov turbulence. We show that these diffusion
coefficients allow to account for X-ray observations of supernova remnants.
This paper also calculates the modification of the Fermi cycle due to the
energy lost by cosmic rays in generating upstream turbulence and the
concomittant steepening of the energy spectrum. Finally we confirm that cosmic
rays can produced an amplified turbulence in young SNr during their free

  ed. Roberto Fabbri, Publisher: Research Signpost",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Following the detection of polarized diffuse Galactic emission in 1962 a
number of surveys were undertaken at low frequencies in the following years
resulting in important insights on the local magnetic field, polarization of
the giant radio loops and other Galactic structures, as well as on the
properties of the diffuse magnetized interstellar medium. This field of
research experienced a revival in the eighties and nineties by a number of high
resolution observations at low and high frequencies, which showed a large
variety of polarization structures having no corresponding signature in the
total intensity images. 'Canals' and 'Faraday screens' were reported, which
clearly indicate that Faraday rotation in the magneto-ionic medium may largely
vary on small scales. These findings called for a systematic approach and a
number of new unbiased polarization surveys were started. Also new attempts for
absolute calibration are under way, which is a critical issue when interpreting
polarization structures. This paper reviews polarization survey projects and
also summarizes recent results and interpretations of this rather active field
of research.

A Boltzmann weight $\omega_l$ is assigned to each $(l+1)$-fold visited lattice

of visits to any site via setting $\omega_l=0$ for $l\geq K$. In this paper we
study this model on the square and simple cubic lattices for the case K=3.
Moreover, we consider a variant of this model, in which we forbid immediate
self-reversal of the random walk. We perform simulations for random walks up to

in the problem of internet topology discovery using a large number (hundreds or
thousands) of measurement monitors. The standard way to obtain information
about the internet topology is to use the traceroute tool from a small number
of monitors. Recent papers have made the case that increasing the number of
monitors will give a more accurate view of the topology. However, scaling up
the number of monitors is not a trivial process. Duplication of effort close to
the monitors wastes time by reexploring well-known parts of the network, and
close to destinations might appear to be a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)

a source that generated a sequence is unknown, the inevitable cost of coding
the unknown alphabet symbols can be exploited to create the pattern of the
sequence. This pattern can in turn be compressed by itself. It is shown that if
the alphabet size $k$ is essentially small, then the average minimax and
maximin redundancies as well as the redundancy of every code for almost every
source, when compressing a pattern, consist of at least 0.5 log(n/k^3) bits per
each unknown probability parameter, and if all alphabet letters are likely to
occur, there exist codes whose redundancy is at most 0.5 log(n/k^2) bits per
each unknown probability parameter, where n is the length of the data
sequences. Otherwise, if the alphabet is large, these redundancies are
essentially at least O(n^{-2/3}) bits per symbol, and there exist codes that
achieve redundancy of essentially O(n^{-1/2}) bits per symbol. Two sub-optimal
low-complexity sequential algorithms for compression of patterns are presented

theory where the gravitational interaction of fermionic matter is reduced to

much larger than the dark energy density. In this case also the 5-th force
problem is solved automatically. In the opposite limit, where the magnitudes of
fermionic energy density and scalar field dark energy density become
comparable, nonrelativistic fermions can participate in the cosmological
expansion in a very unusual manner. Some of the features of such states in a
toy model of the late time universe filled with homogeneous scalar field and
uniformly distributed nonrelativistic neutrinos: neutrino mass increases as m ~
a^{3/2}; the neutrino gas equation-of-state approaches w=-1, i.e. neutrinos
behave as a sort of dark energy; the total (scalar field + neutrino)
equation-of-state also approaches w=-1; the total energy density of such
universe is less than it would be in the universe filled with the scalar field
alone. An analytic solution is presented. A domain structure of the dark energy
seems to be possible. We speculate that decays of the CLEP state neutrinos may
be both an origin of cosmic rays and responsible for a late super-acceleration
of the universe. In this sense the CLEP states exhibit simultaneously new
physics at very low densities and for very high particle masses.

It provides bound state wave equations with the simplicity of the

all complex structure moduli are stabilized by fluxes. The remaining 2 Kahler
moduli are stabilized by a nonperturbative superpotential, which has been
explicitly computed. For this model we identify situations for which a linear
combination of the axionic parts of the two Kahler moduli acts as an inflaton.
As in our previous scenario, inflation begins at a saddle point of the scalar
potential and proceeds as an eternal topological inflation. For a certain range
of inflationary parameters, we obtain the COBE-normalized spectrum of metric
perturbations and an inflationary scale of M = 3 x 10^{14} GeV. We discuss
possible changes of parameters of our model and argue that anthropic

it supports non-Abelian BPS strings which have internal (orientational) moduli.
If N_f>N these strings become semilocal, developing additional moduli \rho
related to (unlimited) variations of their transverse size.
  Using the U(2) gauge group with N_f=3,4 as an example, we derive an effective
low-energy theory on the (two-dimensional) string world sheet. Our derivation
is field-theoretic, direct and explicit: we first analyze the Bogomol'nyi
equations for string-geometry solitons, suggest an ansatz and solve it at large
\rho. Then we use this solution to obtain the world-sheet theory.
  In the semiclassical limit our result confirms the Hanany-Tong conjecture,
which rests on brane-based arguments, that the world-sheet theory is N=2
supersymmetric U(1) gauge theory with N positively and N_e=N_f-N negatively
charged matter multiplets and the Fayet-Iliopoulos term determined by the
four-dimensional coupling constant. We conclude that the Higgs branch of this
model is not lifted by quantum effects. As a result, such strings cannot
confine.
  Our analysis of infrared effects, not seen in the Hanany-Tong consideration,
shows that, in fact, the derivative expansion can make sense only provided the
theory under consideration is regularized in the infrared, e.g. by the quark
mass differences. The world-sheet action discussed in this paper becomes a bona

unions of spheres. Let N be a closed connected orientable 3-manifold. Our main
result is the following description of the set Emb^6(N) of embeddings N\to R^6
up to isotopy.
  The Whitney invariant W : Emb^6(N) \to H_1(N;Z) is surjective. For each u \in
H_1(N;Z) the Kreck invariant \eta_u : W^{-1}u \to Z_{d(u)} is bijective, where
d(u) is the divisibility of the projection of u to the free part of H_1(N;Z).
  The group Emb^6(S^3) is isomorphic to Z (Haefliger). This group acts on
Emb^6(N) by embedded connected sum. It was proved that the orbit space of this
action maps under W bijectively to H_1(N;Z) (by Vrabec and Haefliger's
smoothing theory). The new part of our classification result is determination
of the orbits of the action. E. g. for N=RP^3 the action is free, while for
N=S^1\times S^2 we construct explicitly an embedding f : N \to R^6 such that
for each knot l:S^3\to R^6 the embedding f#l is isotopic to f.

recently proposed framework. More specifically, the paper focuses on the
estimation of model parameters for a class of generalized Gibbs random fields,
i.e., Spartan Spatial Random Fields (SSRFs). The problem of parameter inference
is based on the minimization of a distance metric. The latter involves a
specifically designed distance between sample constraints (variance,
generalized ``gradient'' and ``curvature'') and their ensemble counterparts.
The general principles used in the construction of the metric are discussed and
intuitively motivated. In order to enable calculation of the metric from sample
data, estimators for generalized ``gradient'' and ``curvature'' constraints are
constructed. These estimators, which are not restricted to SSRFs, are
formulated using compactly supported kernel functions. An intuitive method for
kernel bandwidth selection is proposed. It is proved that the estimators are
asymptotically unbiased and consistent for differentiable random fields, under
specified regularity conditions. For continuous but non-differentiable random
fields, it is shown that the estimators are asymptotically consistent. The bias
is calculated explicitly for different kernel functions. The performance of the
sample constraint estimators and the SSRF inference process are investigated by
means of numerical simulations.

approach with partonic degrees of freedom, we adopt a model built on hadronic
degrees of freedom to perform a study of the PW relation at intermediate
energies (100 MeV to 2 GeV). With upcoming high-statistics scattering
experiments such as MINER$\nu$A and FINeSSE, a scrutiny of the PW relation is
timely. Employing a relativistic Glauber nucleon knockout model for the
description of quasielastic neutrino-nucleus reactions, the influence of
nuclear effects on the PW relation is investigated. We discuss nuclear-model
dependences and show that the PW relation is a robust ratio, mitigating the
effect of final-state interactions, for example to the 1% level. The role
played by a possible strangeness content of the nucleon is investigated. It
appears that the uncertainties arising from the poorly known strangeness
parameters and the difficulties in nuclear modelling seriously limit the
applicability of the PW relation as an intermediate-energy electroweak
precision tool. On the other hand, we show that nuclear effects may be
sufficiently well under control to allow the extraction of new information on
the axial strangeness parameter. Results are presented for $^{16} {O}$ and

previously [18] found that the distribution of absolute log-returns can be
approximated by the power-law distribution in the inflationary period, while
the distribution of absolute log-returns is well described by the exponential
distribution in the deflationary period.\par To further explore these empirical
findings, we have introduced a model of stock markets which was proposed in
[19,20]. In this model, the stock market is composed of two groups of traders:
{\it the fundamentalists}, who believe that the asset price will return to the
fundamental price, and {\it the interacting traders}, who can be noise traders.
We show through numerical simulation of the model that when the number of
interacting traders is greater than the number of fundamentalists, the
power-law distribution of absolute log-returns is generated by the interacting
traders' herd behavior, and, inversely, when the number of fundamentalists is
greater than the number of interacting traders, the exponential distribution of
absolute log-returns is generated.

the pattern match between two different, promiscuous protein surfaces. This

principle, such experiments may be feasible with current photonic technologies,
although they are limited by material properties. Our analysis of the
propagation equations is sufficiently general to be applicable to the study of
soliton formation, all-optical switching and can be extended to processes
involving other orders of the nonlinearity.

suggested in [quant-ph/0601033] and [quant-ph/0601034] is based on not
completely fair comparison that does not take into account the available
information in an equal way. We also argue that the method is not a new process
tomography scheme, but rather represents an interesting modification of ancilla
assisted process tomography method. In our opinion these modifications require
deeper understanding and further investigation.

quantum tunneling from a quantum dot to a ring array of quantum dots. By
modeling the total system with the Anderson-Fano-Lee model, it is found that
the transition from the quantum Zeno effect to quantum anti-Zeno effect can
happen as the magnetic flux and the gate voltage were adjusted.

experimentally and theoretically how coherent transport of light inside a cold
atomic vapour is affected by the residual motion of atomic scatterers. As the
temperature of the atomic cloud increases, the interference contrast
dramatically decreases emphazising the role of motion-induced decoherence for
resonant scatterers even in the sub-Doppler regime of temperature. We derive
analytical expressions for the corresponding coherence time.
