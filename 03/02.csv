which experience the short-lived luminous blue variable (LBV) phase toward the
end of their lives. The star, in fact, most resembles the LBV S Doradus in
outburst. The precursor of SN 2002kg is the irregular, bright blue variable
star 37 (V37), catalogued by Tammann & Sandage in 1968. Using high-quality
ground-based, multi-band images we can constrain the initial mass of V37 to be
M_ini >~ 40 M_sun. We find that, although the spectra indicate a nitrogen
enhancement, possibly revealing the products of CNO processing by V37 in the
ejecta, the star lacks a substantial LBV nebula. The outburst from SN
2002kg/V37 is not nearly as energetic as the giant eruptions of the eta
Carinae-like variables, such as SN 1954J/V12, also in NGC 2403. SN 2002kg/V37,

following later. Consequently, a small protostar will form early in the

accretion luminosity will heat the core and may substantially affect the
process of fragmentation. This is of particular interest for massive cores
that, at their initial temperatures, have masses much greater than a thermal
Jeans mass and thus might be expected to fragment into many stars during
collapse. Here I show that accretion luminosity can heat the inner parts of a
core to >100 K very early in the star formation process, and that this in turn
strongly suppresses fragmentation. This has implications for a number of
outstanding problems in star formation, including the mechanism of massive star
formation, the origin of the stellar initial mass function and its relationship
to the core mass function, the demographics of massive binaries, and the

stars with extreme values of Lx, more than 10 times higher than the average for

  PMS stars in NGC 2264 on radiative tracks have Lx/Lbol values that are
systematically lower by a factor of ~10 times than those found for stars of

structural changes which influence the efficiency of magnetic field generation
and thus the level of magnetic activity.
  As in the ONC, we find that stars with measured periods have, on average,
higher X-ray luminosities. However, there is a wide range in Lx and Lx/Lbol for
both periodic and non-periodic stars of similar mass. Among stars with measured

intermediate-mass elliptical galaxies in formation and in the process of
becoming moderate-luminosity optical quasars. The powerful galactic winds

NGC 5408 (L_X ~ 10^{40} erg/s). The radio spectrum is steep (index ~ -1),
consistent with optically-thin synchrotron emission, not with flat-spectrum
core emission. Its flux density (~ 0.28 mJy at 4.8 GHz, at a distance of 4.8
Mpc) was the same in the March 2000 and December 2004 observations, suggesting
steady emission rather than a transient outburst. However, it is orders of
magnitude higher than expected from steady jets in stellar-mass microquasar.
Based on its radio flux and spectral index, we suggest that the radio source is
either an unusually bright supernova remnant, or, more likely, a radio lobe
powered by a jet from the black hole. Moreover, there is speculative evidence
that the source is marginally resolved with a radius ~ 30 pc. A faint HII
region of similar size appears to coincide with the radio and X-ray sources,
but its ionization mechanism remains unclear. Using a self-similar solution for
the expansion of a jet-powered electron-positron plasma bubble, in the
minimum-energy approximation, we show that the observed flux and (speculative)
size are consistent with an average jet power ~ 7 x 10^{38} erg/s ~ 0.1 L_X ~
0.1 L_{Edd}, an age ~ 10^5 yr, a current velocity of expansion ~ 80 km/s. We
briefly discuss the importance of this source as a key to understand the

effects of interactions on their morphology, structure and stellar populations
as seen from the light concentration (C), asymmetry (A), and clumpiness (S)
parameters. We further compare these values to a control sample of 67 mostly
isolated, non-interacting E/S0 galaxies. The paired E/S0 galaxies occupy a more
scattered loci in CAS space than non-interacting E/S0's, and the structural
effects of interactions on E/S0's are minor, in contrast to disk galaxies
involved in interactions. This suggests that observational methods for
recognizing interactions at high z, such the CAS methodology, would hardly
detect E/S0's involved in interactions (related to early phases of the so
called `dry-mergers'). We however find statistical differences in A when
comparing isolated and interacting E/S0s. In the mean, paired E/S0 galaxies
have A values 2.96+-0.72 times larger than the ones of non-interacting E/S0's.
For the subset of presumably strongly interacting E/S0's, A and S can be
several times larger than the typical values of the isolated E/S0's. We show
that the asymmetries are consistent with several internal and external
morphological distortions. We conclude that the interacting E/S0s in pairs
should be dense, gas poor galaxies in systems spaning a wide range of
interaction stages, with typical merging timescales >~ 0.1-0.5 Gyr. We use the

  Structure in Quasars","accepted to ApJ","Astrophys.J. 644 (2006) 733-741","10.1086/503760",,"astro-ph",,"  Spectral differences between lensed quasar image components are common. Since
lensing is intrinsically achromatic, these differences are typically explained
as the effect of either microlensing, or as light path time delays sampling
intrinsic quasar spectral variability. Here we advance a novel third
hypothesis: some spectral differences are due to small line-of-sight
differences through quasar disk wind outflows. In particular, we propose that
variable spectral differences seen only in component A of the widest separation
lens SDSSJ1004+4112 are due to differential absorption along the sightlines.
The absorber properties required by this hypothesis are akin to known broad
absorption line (BAL) outflows but must have a broader, smoother velocity
profile. We interpret the observed CIV emission line variability as further
evidence for spatial fine structure transverse to the line of sight. Since
outflows are likely to be rotating, such absorber fine structure can
consistently explain some of the UV and X-ray variability seen in AGN. The
implications are many: (1) Spectroscopic differences in other lensed objects
may be due to this ``lens-aided multi-angle spectroscopy'' (LAMAS). (2)
Outflows have fine structure on size scales of arcsec as seen from the nucleus.
(3) Assuming either broad absorption line region sizes proposed in recent wind
models, or typically assumed continuum emission region sizes, LAMAS and/or
variability provide broadly consistent absorber sizescale estimates of about
10^15cm. (4) Very broad smooth absorption may be ubiquitous in quasar spectra,
even when no obvious troughs are seen.

subject to instabilities during the early evolutionary phase. The mean field is
generated in the neutron-finger unstable region where the Rossby number is
$\sim 1$ and mean-field dynamo is efficient. Depending on the rotation rate,
the mean-field dynamo can lead to the formation of three different types of
pulsars. If the initial period of the protoneutron star is short, then the
generated large-scale field is very strong ($> 3 \times 10^{13}$G) and exceeds
the small-scale field at the neutron star surface. If rotation is moderate,
then the pulsars are formed with more or less standard dipole fields ($< 3
\times 10^{13}$G) but with surface small-scale magnetic fields stronger than
the dipole field. If rotation is very slow, then the mean-field dynamo does not
operate, and the neutron star has no global field. Nevertheless, strong
small-scale fields are generated in such pulsars, and they can manifest
themselves as objects with very low spin-down rate but with a strong magnetic
field inferred from the spectral features.

curves do agree reasonably well with the observed ones for SNe Ia in the range
of low to normal luminosities, although the underlying hydrodynamical explosion
models produced only a modest amount of radioactive Ni56 and relatively low

simple and consist of either one or two prominent components. (2) The linearly
polarized fraction is nearly always in excess of 70 per cent. (3) In profiles
with two components the trailing component nearly always dominates, only the

core mass of AGB stars. Zijlstra (2004) reported that the initial-final-mass
relation steepens at low metallicity, due to low mass-loss efficiency. This
perhaps affects the model parameters of the AGB stars, e.g. the overlap factor
and the neutron irradiation time, in particular at low metallicity. The
calculated results show indeed that the overlap factor and the neutron
irradiation time are significantly small at low metallicities, especially for
3.0Msun AGB stars. The scatter of [Pb/hs] found in low metallicities can

only technique that can detect free-floating planets. Free-floating planets are
detected through the channel of short-duration isolated lensing events.
However, if a seemingly isolated planetary event is detected, it is difficult
to firmly conclude that the event is caused by a free-floating planet because a
wide-separation planet can also produce an isolated event. There were several
methods proposed to break the degeneracy between the isolated planetary events
produced by the free-floating and wide-separation planets, but they are
incomplete. In this paper, we show that free-floating planets can be securely
identified by conducting astrometric follow-up observations of isolated events
to be detected in future photometric lensing surveys by using high-precision
interferometers to be operated contemporarily with the photometric surveys. The
method is based on the fact that astrometric lensing effect covers much longer
range of the lens-source separation than the photometric effect. We demonstrate
that several astrometric follow-up observations of isolated planetary events
associated with source stars brighter than $V\sim 19$ by using the {\it Space
Interferometry Mission} with an exposure time of $\lesssim 10 {\rm min}$ for
each observation will make it possible to measure the centroid shift induced by
primaries with projected separations up to $\sim 100 {\rm AU}$. Therefore, the
proposed method is far more complete than previously proposed methods that are
flawed by the limited applicability only to planets with projected separations

two-dimensional velocity fields in these galaxies on scales corresponds to
\~0.5kpc (unlensed) at z=1. Four of the galaxies have stable disk-like
kinematics, whilst the other two resemble interacting or starburst galaxies.
These galaxies lie close to the mean rest-frame I-band Tully-Fisher relation
for nearby spirals suggesting a clear preference for hierarchical growth of
structure. In the rest-frame B-band, the observations suggest 0.5+/-0.3mag of
brightening, consistent with increased star-formation activity at z=1. However,
the galaxies with stable disk kinematics have more slowly rising rotation
curves than expected from galaxies with similar surface brightness in the local
Universe. We suggest that this may arise because the distant galaxies have
lower bulge masses than their local counter-parts. Whilst this study is based
on only six galaxies, the gain in flux and in spatial resolution achieved via
gravitational magnification provides a much more detailed view of the high
redshift Universe than possible with conventional surveys.

modifying the distribution function, and show that the system evolves into a

a toy model to account for such a halo evolution, based on the angular momentum
exchange due to dynamical friction; at the epoch of galaxy formation this is
efficiently exerted by the DM onto the gas clouds spiralling down the potential
well. The comparison between the angular momentum profile gained by the halo
through dynamical friction and that provided by the perturbed distribution
function reveals a surprising similarity, hinting at the reliability of the

cosmological observations hint that the equation-of-state parameter (EoS) of

energy models whose EoS can cross the phantom divide have been proposed.
However, to our knowledge, these models with crossing the phantom divide only
provide the possibility that $w_{de}$ can cross -1. They do not answer another
question, namely, {\em why crossing the phantom divide occurs recently?} Since
in many existing models whose EoS can cross the phantom divide, $w_{de}$
undulates around -1 randomly, {\em why are we living in an epoch $w_{de}<-1$?}

(AF), spin glass (SG) and Kondo effect. The model describes two Kondo
sublattices with an intrasite Kondo interaction strength $J_{K}$ and an
interlattice quantum Ising interaction in the presence of a transverse field
$\Gamma$. The interlattice coupling is a random Gaussian distributed variable
(with average $-2J_0/N$ and variance $32 J^{2}/N$) while the $\Gamma$ field is
introduced as a quantum mechanism to produce spin flipping. The path integral
formalism is used to study this fermionic problem where the spin operators are
represented by bilinear combinations of Grassmann fields. The disorder is
treated within the framework of the replica trick. The free energy and the
order parameters of the problem are obtained by using the static ansatz and by
choosing both $J_0/J$ and $\Gamma/J \approx (J_k/J)^2$ to allow, as previously,
a better comparison with the experimental findings.
  The results indicate the presence of a SG solution at low $J_K/J$ and for
temperature $T<T_{f}$ ($T_{f}$ is the freezing temperature). When $J_K/J$ is
increased, a mixed phase AF+SG appears, then an AF solution and finally a Kondo
state is obtained for high values of $J_{K}/J$. Moreover, the behaviors of the
freezing and Neel temperatures are also affected by the relationship between
$J_{K}$ and the transverse field $\Gamma$. The first one presents a slight
decrease while the second one decreases towards a Quantum Critical Point (QCP).
The obtained phase diagram has the same sequence as the experimental one for
$Ce_{2}Au_{1-x}Co_{x}Si_{3}$, if $J_{K}$ is assumed to increase with $x$, and
in addition, it also shows a qualitative agreement concerning the behavior of
the freezing and the Neel temperatures.

field suggest that it has three distinct vortex phases: a linearly confined
phase, a logarithmically confined phase, and a free vortex phase. In this work
we study spin-spin correlation functions in this model by analytical analysis
and numerical simulations to search for signatures of the various phases. In
all three phases, the order parameter is nonzero and $<\cos(\th({\bf

correlation function for transverse fluctuations of the spins,
$C(r)=<\sin(\th({\bf r}_1))\sin(\th({\bf r}_2))>$, falls exponentially in all

logarithmically confined phase should have a spatially anisotropic correlation
length. In addition, there is a generic anisotropy in the prefactor which is
always present. We find that this prefactor anisotropy becomes rather strong in
the presence of a magnetic field, masking the effects of any anisotropy in the

cuprate superconductors, where a random electrostatic potential exists in the

presence of a random potential can affect the unidirectionality of the CDW
order, characterized by an Ising order parameter. Coupling to a unidirectional
CDW, the random potential can lead to the formation of domains with 90 degree
relative orientation, thus tending to restore the rotational symmetry of the
underlying lattice. We find that the correlation length of the Ising order can
be significantly larger than the CDW correlation length. For a checkerboard CDW
on the other hand, disorder generates spatial anisotropies on short length
scales and thus some degree of unidirectionality. We quantify these disorder
effects and suggest new techniques for analyzing the local density of states

combines strong correlation effects with broadening and quantum coherence, and
illustrate it with a simple example (""spin blockade"") that clearly demonstrates
all three effects. The standard master equation method for Coulomb blockade
captures the first effect, while a number of different approaches such as the
non-equilibrium Green function (NEGF) method are available for handling the
last two. But there is a need for a method that captures all three and in this
paper we propose an approach that appears to fulfill this need. The equations
look similar to the NEGF formalism but one basic distinction is that all
quantities (like the Hamiltonian) appearing in our formalism are defined in
Fock space and as such are matrices of dimension (2^N by 2^N), N being the
number of basis functions describing the one-electron Hilbert space. Similar
quantities appearing in the NEGF formalism are of dimension (N by N). Other
important differences arise from the fact that in Fock space there is no need
to include the exclusion principle explicitly and that elastic processes in
one-electron space look like inelastic processes in Fock space. A simple
numerical example is presented to show that our approach includes strong
electron-electron interaction, broadening due to coupling to contacts and
quantum coherence effects due to spin polarization in directions other than the
z-direction. The basic equations for this ""Fock space Green's function"" (FSGF)
are quite general and should be applicable to more interesting and exotic
transport problems involving the entanglement of many-electron states. How
effective it will be remains to be assessed for different problems, but our

the electrons traveling nearby, thereby changing the conductance from point A
to point B. The simulations presented here show that by measuring the
transmission of electrons from A to B versus tip position, one can image the
electron flow. This forward scattering mechanism is well suited for imaging in
a magnetic field, in contrast to previous probes that depended on
backscattering. One could use this technique to image cyclotron orbits in an

phase transition between a free phase and a disorder dominated phase. For the
latter, Fisher and Huse have proposed a droplet theory based on the scaling of
the free energy fluctuations $\Delta F(l) \sim l^{\theta}$. On the other hand,
in related growth models belonging to the KPZ universality class, Forrest and
Tang have found that the height-height correlation function is logarithmic at
the transition. For the directed polymer model at criticality, this translates
into logarithmic free energy fluctuations $\Delta F_{T_c}(l) \sim (\ln
l)^{\sigma}$ with $\sigma=1/2$. In this paper, we propose a droplet scaling
analysis exactly at criticality based on this logarithmic scaling. Our main
conclusion is that the typical correlation length $\xi(T)$ of the low
temperature phase, diverges as $ \ln \xi(T) \sim (- \ln (T_c-T))^{1/\sigma}
\sim (- \ln (T_c-T))^{2} $. Furthermore, the logarithmic dependence of $\Delta
F_{T_c}(l)$ leads to the conclusion that the critical temperature $T_c$
actually coincides with the explicit upper bound $T_2$ derived by Derrida and
coworkers, where $T_2$ corresponds to the temperature below which the ratio
$\bar{Z_L^2}/(\bar{Z_L})^2$ diverges exponentially in $L$. Finally, since the
Fisher-Huse droplet theory was initially introduced for the spin-glass phase,
we briefly mention the similarities and differences with the directed polymer
model. If one speculates that the free energy of droplet excitations for
spin-glasses is also logarithmic at $T_c$, one obtains a logarithmic decay for
the mean square correlation function at criticality $\bar{C^2(r)} \sim 1/(\ln r
)^{\sigma}$.

Frank and Jan Naudts is considered and its quantum counterpart is used to
calculate purity of the Werner state in nonextensive formalism. It has been
observed that two different expressions arise due to two different forms of
quantum divergences. It is then argued that the difference is due to the fact
that the relative entropy of Bregman type is related to the first choice
thermostatistics whereas the one of Csisz\`{a}r type is related to the third
choice thermostatistics. The superiority of the third choice thermostatistics
to the first choice thermostatistics has been deduced by noticing that the
expression obtained by using the Bregman type leads to negative values for
q$\in (0,1)$ and fidelity F smaller than 1 whereas the one obtained by using
Csisz\`{a}r type is free from such anomalies. Moreover, it has been noted that
these two measures show different qualitative behavior with respect to F.
Contrary to the classical case, the violation of the positive definiteness of
the relative entropy immediately results in a choice between the two
constraints without any need of more abstract Shore-Johnson axioms. The
possibility of writing a relative entropy of Bregman type compatible with the
third choice has been investigated further. The answer turns out to be negative

is compared to a calculation with only pion and nucleon degrees of freedom. The
role of the delta(1232) for the low-energy constants of the latter theory is
elucidated. The consistency with the chiral perturbation theory analysis of

consistency can indeed be achieved if the delta(1232) dominance of the P-wave
pion-nucleon low-energy constant c3 is accounted for. Introduction of the
delta(1232) as an explicit propagating degree of freedom is not crucial in
order to describe the quark-mass dependence of the nucleon mass, in contrast to
the situation with spin observables of the nucleon. The dependence on finite
lattice volume is shown to yield valuable additional constraints. What emerges
is a consistent and stable extrapolation scheme for pion masses below 0.6 GeV.

Lorentz violation cannot be larger than about M ~ 100GeV due to an infrared
instability in the gravity sector. We show that Lorentz symmetry can be broken
at much higher scales in a non-minimal theory with additional degrees of
freedom, in particular if Lorentz symmetry is broken by the vacuum expectation
value of a vector field. This theory can be constructed by gauging ghost
condensation, giving a systematic effective field theory description that
allows us to estimate the size of all physical effects. We show that nonlinear
effects become important for gravitational fields with strength \sqrt{\Phi} >
g, where g is the gauge coupling, and we argue that the nonlinear dynamics is
free from singularities. We then analyze the phenomenology of the model,
including nonlinear dynamics and velocity-dependent effects. The strongest
bounds on the gravitational sector come from either black hole accretion or
direction-dependent gravitational forces, and imply that the scale of
spontaneous Lorentz breaking is M < Min(10^{12}GeV, g^2 10^{15}GeV). If the
Lorentz breaking sector couples directly to matter, there is a spin-dependent
inverse-square law force, which has a different angular dependence from the

Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN (European Center for Nuclear Research). Previous
pioneering measurements at the Berkeley Bevalac in the late 1970's and early
1980's were at much lower bombarding energies (~ 1 A GeV/c) where nuclear
breakup rather than particle production is the dominant inelastic process in
A+A collisions. More recently, starting in 2000, the Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider (RHIC) at BNL has produced head-on collisions of two 100A GeV beams of
fully stripped Au ions, corresponding to nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy,
sqrt(sNN)=200 GeV, total c.m. energy 200A GeV. The objective of this research
program is to produce nuclear matter with extreme density and temperature,
possibly resulting in a state of matter where the quarks and gluons normally
confined inside individual nucleons (r < 1 fm) are free to act over distances
an order of magnitude larger. Progress from the period 1992 to the present will
be reviewed, with reference to previous results from light ion and
proton-proton collisions where appropriate. Emphasis will be placed on the
measurements which formed the basis for the announcements by the two major
laboratories: ""A new state of matter"", by CERN on Feb 10, 2000 and ""The perfect
fluid"", by BNL on April 19, 2005.

  low resolution to avoid large fig. files",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.73.041604",,"physics.chem-ph cond-mat.soft physics.comp-ph",,"  We perform systematic molecular dynamics simulations of water confined
between two nanoscale plates at T=300 K. We investigate the effect of pressure
(-0.15 GPa <= P <= 0.2 GPa) and plate separation (0.4 nm <= d <= 1.6 nm) on the
phase behavior of water when the plates are either hydrophobic or hydrophilic.
When water is confined between hydrophobic plates, capillary evaporation occurs
between the plates at low enough P. The threshold value of d at which this
transition occurs decreases with P (e.g., 1.6 nm at P ~ -0.05 GPa; 0.5 nm at P
\~ 0.1 GPa), until, at high P, no capillary evaporation occurs. For d ~ 0.6 nm
and P >= 0.1 GPa, the system crystallizes into a bilayer ice.
  A P-d phase diagram showing the vapor, liquid, and bilayer ice phases is
proposed. When water is confined by hydrophilic (hydroxylated silica) plates,
it remains in the liquid phase at all P and d studied. Interestingly, we
observe, for this case, that even at the P at which bulk water cavitates, the
confined water remains in the liquid state. We also study systematically the
state of hydration at different P for both kinds of plates. For the range of
conditions studied here, we find that in the presence of hydrophobic plates the
effect of P is to enhance water structure and to push water molecules toward
the plates. The average orientation of water molecules next to the hydrophobic
plates does not change upon pressurization. In contrast, in the presence of
hydrophilic plates, water structure is insensitive to P. Hence, our results
suggest that upon pressurization, hydrophobic plates behave as `soft' surfaces
(in the sense of accommodating pressure-dependent changes in water structure)
while hydrophilic walls behave as `hard' surfaces.

formulation of Quantum Mechanics from a comprehensive definition of ""physical

specified by five simple Postulates. This accomplishes the program presented in
form of conjectures in the previous paper quant-ph/0506034. Pivotal roles are
played by the ""local observability principle"", which reconciles the holism of
nonlocality with the reductionism of local observation, and by the postulated
existence of ""informationally complete observables"" and of a ""symmetric
faithful state"". This last notion allows one to introduce an operational
definition for the real version of the ""adjoint""--i. e. the transposition--from
which one can derive a real Hilbert-space structure via either the
Mackey-Kakutani or the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal constructions. Here I analyze in
detail only the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction, which leads to a real
Hilbert space structure analogous to that of (classes of generally unbounded)
selfadjoint operators in Quantum Mechanics. For finite dimensions, general
dimensionality theorems that can be derived from a local observability
principle, allow us to represent the elements of the real Hilbert space as
operators over an underlying complex Hilbert space (see, however, a still open
problem at the end of the paper). The route for the present operational
axiomatization was suggested by novel ideas originated from Quantum Tomography.
