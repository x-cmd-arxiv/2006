that are more luminous than average and that eject material at very high

with GRBs, and therefore GRB-supernovae were thought to be rare events. Whether
X-ray flashes - analogues of GRBs, but with lower luminosities and fewer
gamma-rays - can also be associated with supernovae, and whether they are
intrinsically 'weak' events or typical GRBs viewed off the axis of the burst,
is unclear. Here we report the optical discovery and follow-up observations of
the type Ic supernova SN 2006aj associated with X-ray flash XRF 060218.
Supernova 2006aj is intrinsically less luminous than the GRB-supernovae, but
more luminous than many supernovae not accompanied by a GRB. The ejecta
velocities derived from our spectra are intermediate between these two groups,
which is consistent with the weakness of both the GRB output and the supernova
radio flux. Our data, combined with radio and X-ray observations, suggest that
XRF 060218 is an intrinsically weak and soft event, rather than a classical GRB
observed off-axis. This extends the GRB-supernova connection to X-ray flashes
and fainter supernovae, implying a common origin. Events such as XRF 060218 are
probably more numerous than GRB-supernovae.

regular fields are generally strongest in the interarm regions (up to \simeq
15\mu G), sometimes forming 'magnetic arms' parallel to the optical arms. The
field structure is spiral in almost every galaxy, even in flocculent and bright
irregular types which lack spiral arms. The observed large-scale patterns of
Faraday rotation in several massive spiral galaxies reveal coherent regular
fields, as predicted by dynamo models. However, in most galaxies observed so
far no simple patterns of Faraday rotation could be found. Either many dynamo
modes are superimposed and cannot be resolved by present-day telescopes, or
most of the apparently regular field is in fact anisotropic random, with
frequent reversals, due to shearing and compressing gas flows. In galaxies with
massive bars, the polarization pattern follows the gas flow. However, around
strong shocks in bars, the compression of the regular field is much lower than
that of the gas; the regular field decouples from the cold gas and is strong
enough to affect the flow of the diffuse warm gas. -- The average strength of
the total magnetic field in the Milky Way is 6\mu G near the sun and increases
to 20-40\mu G in the Galactic center region. The Galactic field is mostly
parallel to the plane, except in the center region. Rotation measure data from
pulsars indicate several field reversals, unlike external galaxies, but some
reversals could be due to distortions of the nearby field.

constructed using photometry from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Supernova

method used to measure distances to these supernovae is based on recent work by
Hamuy & Pinto (2002) and exploits a correlation between the absolute brightness
of SNe II-P and the expansion velocities derived from the minimum of the Fe II
516.9 nm P-Cygni feature observed during the plateau phases. We present three
refinements to this method which significantly improve the practicality of
measuring the distances of SNe II-P at cosmologically interesting redshifts.
These are an extinction correction measurement based on the V-I colors at day
50, a cross-correlation measurement for the expansion velocity and the ability
to extrapolate such velocities accurately over almost the entire plateau phase.
We apply this revised method to our dataset of high-redshift SNe II-P and find
that the resulting Hubble diagram has a scatter of only 0.26 magnitudes, thus
demonstrating the feasibility of measuring the expansion history, with present

extraordinarily bright explosions known as core-collapse supernovae. On
occasion, this stellar collapse also powers an even more brilliant relativistic
explosion known as a long-duration gamma-ray burst. One would then expect that
long gamma-ray bursts and core-collapse supernovae should be found in similar
galactic environments. Here we show that this expectation is wrong. We find
that the long gamma-ray bursts are far more concentrated on the very brightest
regions of their host galaxies than are the core-collapse supernovae.
Furthermore, the host galaxies of the long gamma-ray bursts are significantly
fainter and more irregular than the hosts of the core-collapse supernovae.
Together these results suggest that long-duration gamma-ray bursts are
associated with the most massive stars and may be restricted to galaxies of
limited chemical evolution. Our results directly imply that long gamma-ray
bursts are relatively rare in galaxies such as our own Milky Way.

spectrum of gamma-rays from the galactic center region which extends from
$\sim$200 GeV or lower, to at least $\sim$10 TeV. Although the source of this
radiation is not yet known, the spectrum appears to behave as a simple
power-law, which is not the expectation for gamma-rays generated through the
annihilation of dark matter particles. If instead we conclude that the source
of these gamma-rays is astrophysical in origin, this spectrum will constitute a
background for future dark matter searches using gamma-rays from this region.
In this paper we study how this background will affect the prospects for
experiments such as GLAST to detect dark matter in the galactic center. We find
that only a narrow range of dark matter annihilation rates are potentially
observable by GLAST given this newly discovered background and considering
current constraints from EGRET and HESS. We also find that a detection of line

around z=20, with masses M_halo=10^6 M_sun, and virial temperatures
T_vir<10^4K, relied on the presence of molecules for cooling. Several
theoretical studies have suggested that gas contraction and star-formation in
these minihalos was suppressed by radiative, chemical, thermal, and dynamical
feedback processes. The recent measurement by the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) of the optical depth to electron scattering,
tau=0.09+/-0.03, provides the first empirical evidence for this suppression.
The new WMAP result is consistent with vanilla models of reionization, in which
ionizing sources populate cold dark matter (CDM) halos down to a virial
temperature of T_vir=10^4K. On the other hand, we show that in order to avoid
overproducing the optical depth, the efficiency for the production of ionizing
photons in minihalos must have been about an order of magnitude lower than
expected and lower than the efficiency in large halos that can cool via atomic
hydrogen (T_vir > 10^4K). This conclusion is insensitive to assumptions about
the efficiency of ionizing photon production in the large halos, as long as
reionization ends by z=6, as required by the spectra of bright quasars at z<6.
Our conclusion is strengthened if the clumping of the ionized gas evolves with
redshift, as suggested by semi-analytical predictions and three-dimensional
numerical simulations.

decrease in the PVD with luminosity. At r=1 Mpc/h, the PVD has no dependence on
luminosity because satellite galaxies dominate the statistics for all objects.
Recent measurements of the PVD in Fourier space using the ""dispersion model""
have reported a strong decline in PVD with increasing luminosity at k=1 h/Mpc.
We test this method with our HOD models, finding that there is no consistent
comparison between the PVD at a given k and the true dispersion at a given
value of r. This results in a luminosity dependence in k-space that is stronger
than in configuration space. The luminosity dependence of the HOD results in
Fourier space are consistent with those measured at k=1 h/Mpc; thus the recent
measurements of the PVD are fully explainable in the context of halo occupation
models. The normalization of the PVD is lower than predicted by our fiducial
model, and reproducing it requires a lower value of Omega_m (~0.2 instead of
0.3), a lower value of sigma_8 (~0.7 instead of 0.9), or strong velocity bias.

complex with the Spitzer Space Telescope Infrared Array Camera (IRAC). The maps
show strong extended emission arising from shocked H2 in outflows in the region
and from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon features. More than 120,000 sources
are extracted toward the cloud. Based on their IRAC colors and comparison to
off-cloud and extragalactic fields, we identify 400 candidate young stellar
objects. About two thirds of these are associated with the young clusters IC348
and NGC1333, while the last third is distributed over the remaining cloud. We
classify the young stellar objects according to the traditional scheme based on
the slope of their spectral energy distributions. Significant differences are
found for the numbers of embedded Class I objects relative to more evolved
Class II objects in IC348, NGC1333 and the remaining cloud with the embedded
Class I and ""flat spectrum"" YSOs constituting 14%, 36% and 47% of the total
number of YSOs identified in each of these regions. The high number of Class I
objects in the extended cloud (61% of the Class I objects in the entire cloud)
suggests that a significant fraction of the current star formation is occuring
outside the two main clusters. Finally we discuss a number of outflows and
identify their driving sources, including the known deeply embedded Class 0
sources outside the two major clusters. The Class 0 objects are found to be
detected by Spitzer and have very red [3.6]-[4.5] colors but do not show
similarly red [5.8]-[8.0] colors. The Class 0 objects are easily identifiable
in color-color diagrams plotting these two colors but are problematic to
extract automatically due to the extended emission from shocked gas or
scattered light in cavities related to the associated outflows.

earliest known quasars. Theoretical simulations predict that the formation of
dwarf galaxies should have been suppressed after cosmic hydrogen was reionized,
leading to a drop in the cosmic star formation rate. Here we present evidence
for this suppression. We show that the post-reionization galaxies which
produced most of the ionizing radiation at a redshift z~5.5, must have had a
mass in excess of ~10^{10.6+/-0.4} solar masses or else the aforementioned
scatter would have been smaller than observed. This limiting mass is two orders
of magnitude larger than the galaxy mass that is thought to have dominated the
reionization of cosmic hydrogen (~10^8 solar masses). We predict that future
surveys with space-based infrared telescopes will detect a population of
smaller galaxies that reionized the Universe at an earlier time, prior to the

polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). The dust continuum and aromatic feature
emission are both strong in the well-known superwind region of this galaxy;
clearly the carrier of the aromatic features can survive in close proximity to

lithium abundance of metal-poor ([Fe/H]<-1.3) halo stars near the turnoff has
been attributed a cosmological origin. Closer analysis revealed that the
observed abundance lies at $\Delta$ Li~0.4 dex below the predictions of Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis. The measurements of deuterium abundances on the lines of
sight toward quasars and the recent data from the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe independently confirmed this gap. We suggest here that part of
the discrepancy is explained by the first generation of stars that efficiently
depleted lithium. Assuming that the models for lithium evolution in the halo
turnoff stars and $\Delta$ Li estimates are correct, we infer that between 1/3
and 1/2 of the baryonic matter of the early halo (~10^9 Mo) was processed
through Population III stars. This new paradigm proposes a very economical
solution to the lingering difficulty of understanding the properties of the
Spite Plateau and its lack of star-to-star scatter down to [Fe/H]=-2.5. It is
moreover in agreement both with the absence of lithium detection in the most
metal-poor star presently known (HE 1327-2326), and also with new trends of the
Plateau suggesting its low metallicity edge may be reached around [Fe/H]=-2.5.
We discuss the turbulent mixing associated with enhanced supernovae explosions
in the early interstellar medium in this picture. Finally we show that other
chemical properties of the extremely metal-poor stars are in agreement with a
significant Population III processing in the halo, provided these models
include mass-loss and rotationally-induced mixing.

cluster from high-resolution simulations is then used to assess the reality of
high-order singularities such as swallowtails and butterflies in caustics,

estimator using the galaxy studied by Bradac et al. (2004), and find good

high-order singularities are sensitive to not only the fluctuation amplitude of
the surface density, but also the detailed form of the underlying smooth
lensing potential (such as ellipticity and external shear).

emission of 14 z~2 UV-selected BM/BX galaxies obtained with SINFONI at ESO/VLT.
The mean Ha half-light radius r_1/2 is about 4kpc and line emission is detected
over > ~20kpc in several sources. In 9 sources, we detect spatially-resolved
velocity gradients, from 40 to 410 km/s over ~10kpc. The observed kinematics of
the larger systems are consistent with orbital motions. Four galaxies are well
described by rotating disks with clumpy morphologies and we extract rotation
curves out to radii > ~10kpc. One or two galaxies exhibit signatures more
consistent with mergers. Analyzing all 14 galaxies in the framework of rotating
disks, we infer mean inclination- and beam-corrected maximum circular
velocities v_c of 180+-90 km/s and dynamical masses of (0.5-25)x10^10 Msun
within r_1/2. On average, the dynamical masses are consistent with photometric
stellar masses assuming a Chabrier/Kroupa IMF but too small for a 0.1-100 Msun
Salpeter IMF. The specific angular momenta of our BM/BX galaxies are similar to
those of local late-type galaxies. The specific angular momenta of their
baryons are comparable to those of their dark matter halos. Extrapolating from
the average v_c at 10kpc, the virial mass of the typical halo of a galaxy in
our sample is 10^(11.7+-0.5) Msun. Kinematic modeling of the 3 best cases
implies a ratio of v_c to local velocity dispersion of order 2-4 and
accordingly a large geometric thickness. We argue that this suggests a mass
accretion (alternatively, gas exhaustion) timescale of ~500Myr. We also argue
that if our BM/BX galaxies were initially gas rich, their clumpy disks will
subsequently lose their angular momentum and form compact bulges on a timescale
of ~1 Gyr. [ABRIDGED]

phase in the early lives of massive stars. This most visible manifestation of
massive star formation begins when the Lyman continuum output from the massive
young stellar object becomes sufficient to ionize the surroundings from which
it was born. Knowledge of this environment is gained through an understanding
of the morphologies of UCHII regions and we examine the latest developments in
deep radio and mid-IR imaging. SPITZER data from the GLIMPSE survey are an
important new resource in which PAH emission and the ionizing stars can be
seen. We review the role played by strong stellar winds from the central stars
in sweeping out central cavities and causing the limb-brightened appearance. A
range of evidence from velocity structure, proper motions, the molecular
environment and recent hydrodynamical modeling indicates that cometary UCHII
regions require a combination of champagne flow and bow shock motion. Finally,
we discuss the class of hyper-compact H II regions or broad recombination line
objects. They are likely to mark the transition soon after the breakout of the
Lyman continuum radiation from the young star. Models for these objects are
presented, including photo-evaporating disks and ionized accretion flows that
are gravitationally trapped. Evolutionary scenarios tracing young massive stars
passage through these ionized phases are discussed.

mass of the component, M1 = 8.2 Ms indicates that it is a mid-B type star. The
mass-losing component is filling its critical lobe which means it is a G-type
supergiant with a mass M2 = 1.6 Ms. The disk is geometrically very extended and
its outer radius is about 80% of the primary's critical lobe. A reconstructed

for light curve distortions and asymmetries, as well as for secular changes.

also represent one of the most rapidly evolving populations of galaxies since
they represent up to 1/5 of the luminous galaxies at redshift z= 0.7 while
being almost absent in the local Universe. The measurement of their dynamics is
crucial to our understanding of LCGs since this has the potential of telling us
which physical process(es) that drives them, and ultimately to link them to the
existing present-day galaxies. Here we derive the 3 dimensional velocity fields
and velocity dispersion (sigma) maps of 17 Luminous Compact Galaxies selected
from the Canada France Redshift Survey and the Hubble Deep Field South with
redshifts ranging from z=0.4 to z=0.75. We find that only 18% of them show
rotational velocity fields typical of rotating disks, the others showing more
complex kinematics. Assuming that LCGs are not too far from equilibrium, about
half of LCGs then appear to be either non-relaxed objects, or objects that are
not supported by velocity dispersion alone. This supports the view that an
important fraction of LCGs are probably mergers. It brings additional support
to the ``spiral rebuilding scenario'' in which LCGs correspond to a previous or
post-merger phase before the disk re-building.

stripped gas of ~ 100 kpc behind the source galaxy. We present first 3D
hydrodynamical simulations of the evolution of such ram pressure stripped
tails.
  We find that if the ICM wind does not vary significantly over a period of a
few 100 Myr, subsonic galaxies produce a tail with regular features similar to
a von-Karman vortex street. In this case, the tail widens systematically by
about 45 kpc per 100 kpc distance behind the source galaxy. The widening rate
is independent of the galaxy's inclination for a large range of inclinations.
For supersonic galaxies, the tail is more irregular than for subsonic ones.
  The tail observed for NGC 4388 is narrower than the tails in our simulations.
Reasons for this difference may be additional physical processes such as heat
conduction or viscosity. In addition, we conclude that the observed S-shape of
this tail is not due to von Karman oscillations, because this galaxy is likely
to move supersonically. A reason for the observed shape may be motions in the
ambient ICM.
  Finally, we discuss implications for the distribution of metals in the ICM
due to ram pressure stipping.

superbursts provided certain constraints on the strange quark matter equation
of state are fulfilled. We derive corresponding constraints on the equation of
state for soft X-ray transients assuming their quiescent emission is powered in
the same way, and further discuss the time dependence of this heating mechanism
in transient systems. We approach this using a simple parametrized model for
deep crustal heating in strange stars assuming slow neutrino cooling in the
core and blackbody photon emission from the surface.The constraints derived for
hot frequently accreting soft X-ray transients are always consistent with those
for superbursters. The colder sources are consistent for low values of the
quark matter binding energy, heat conductivity and neutrino emissivity. The
heating mechanism is very time dependent which may help to explain cold sources
with long recurrence times. Thus deep crustal heating in strange stars can
provide a consistent explanation for superbursters and soft X-ray transients.

of the supernova. Our results indicate that the supernova-GRB connection

as well as to the Swendsen-Wang and Wolff cluster algorithms. The lattice sizes
of L=10-96 are analysed by a finite-size-scaling technique. The site dilution
concentration p=0.85 was chosen to minimize the correction-to-scaling effects.
We calculate numerical values of the dynamical critical exponents for the
integrated and exponential autocorrelation times for energy and magnetization.
As expected, cluster algorithms are characterized by lower values of dynamical
critical exponent than the local one: also in the case of dilution critical
slowing down is more pronounced for the Metropolis algorithm. However, the
striking feature of our estimates is that they suggest that dilution leads to
decrease of the dynamical critical exponent for the cluster algorithms. This
phenomenon is quite opposite to the local dynamics, where dilution enhances
critical slowing down.

direct variational method. The approximate analytical expression for the
paraelectric-ferroelectric transition temperature dependence on nanoparticle
sizes, polarization gradient coefficient, extrapolation length, effective
surface tension and electrostriction coefficient was derived. It was shown that
the transition temperature could be higher than the one of the bulk material

interface detachment, which immediately precedes the inception of frictional
sliding, is governed by three different types of detachment fronts. These
crack-like detachment fronts differ by both their propagation velocities and by
the amount of net contact surface reduction caused by their passage. The most
rapid fronts propagate at intersonic velocities but generate a negligible
reduction in contact area across the interface. Sub-Rayleigh fronts are
crack-like modes which propagate at velocities up to the Rayleigh wave speed,
VR, and give rise to an approximate 10% reduction in net contact area. The most
efficient contact area reduction (~20%) is precipitated by the passage of slow
detachment fronts. These fronts propagate at anomalously slow velocities, which
are over an order of magnitude lower than VR yet orders of magnitude higher
than other characteristic velocity scales such as either slip or loading
velocities. Slow fronts are generated, in conjunction with intersonic fronts,
by the sudden arrest of sub-Rayleigh fronts. No overall sliding of the
interface occurs until either of the slower two fronts traverses the entire
interface, and motion at the leading edge of the interface is initiated. Slip
at the trailing edge of the interface accompanies the motion of both the slow
and sub-Rayleigh fronts. We might expect these modes to be important in both
fault nucleation and earthquake dynamics.

structural transition from a cubic to tetragonal unit cell at 550 K. The
diffuse scattering is shown to be weak indicating that the structural
distortion is long-range in PMN-60PT and short-range polar correlations (polar
nanoregions) are not present. Even though polar nanoregions are absent, the
soft optic mode is short-lived for wavevectors near the zone-centre. Therefore,
PMN-60PT displays the same waterfall effect as prototypical relaxors PMN and
PZN. We conclude that it is random fields resulting from the intrinsic chemical
disorder which is the reason for the broad transverse optic mode observed in
PMN and PMN-60PT near the zone centre and not due to the formation of
short-ranged polar correlations. Through our comparison of PMN, PMN-60PT, and

temporal periodicity characterized by $K$ and $\Omega$. In the zero frequency

valley structures due to the opening up of energy gaps in the pumping region --
a consequence of the $K$ periodicity. These valley structures remain robust in
the regime of finite $\Omega$, while their energies of occurrence are shifted
by about $\hbar\Omega/2$. The direction of these energy shifts depend on the
directions of both the phase-velocity of the pumping potential and the

structures gives rise to both the asymmetry in the transmission coefficients
and the pumping current. An experimental setup is suggested for a possible

investigated via finite-temperature exact diagonalization (ED) and dynamical
mean field theory (DMFT). In contrast to the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method
which at low temperatures includes only Ising-like exchange interactions to
avoid sign problems, ED permits a treatment of Hund's exchange and other onsite
Coulomb interactions on the same footing. The role of finite-size effects
caused by the limited number of bath levels in this scheme is studied by
analyzing the low-frequency behavior of the subband self-energies as a function
of temperature, and by comparing with numerical renormalization group (NRG)
results for an effective one-band model. For half-filled, non-hybridizing
bands, the metallic and insulating phases are separated by an intermediate
mixed phase with an insulating narrow and a bad-metallic wide subband. The wide
band in this phase exhibits different degrees of non-Fermi-liquid behavior,
depending on the treatment of exchange interactions. Whereas for complete
Hund's coupling, infinite lifetime is found at the Fermi level, in the absence
of spin-flip and pair-exchange, this lifetime becomes finite. Excellent
agreement is obtained both with new NRG and previous QMC/DMFT calculations.
These results suggest that-finite temperature ED/DMFT might be a useful scheme
for realistic multi-band materials.

tensor and a spin current can be defined just by requiring the existence of a
well defined volume element instead of an induced metric, so as to allow for
generic torsion sources. In general, when the torsion is localized on the
domain wall, it is necessary to relax the continuity of the tangential
components of the vielbein. In fact it is found that the spin current is
proportional to the jump in the vielbein and the stress-energy tensor is
proportional to the jump in the spin connection. The consistency of the
junction conditions implies a constraint between the direction of flow of
energy and the orientation of the spin. As an application, we derive the
circularly symmetric solutions for both the rotating string with tension and
the spinning dust string in three dimensions. The rotating string with tension
generates a rotating truncated cone outside and a flat space-time with
inevitable frame dragging inside. In the case of a string made of spinning
dust, in opposition to the previous case no frame dragging is present inside,

left- and right-handed components of charge $Q=2/3$ quarks transform under the

and charged leptons transform under different ETC groups. The models thereby
suppress the masses $m_b$ and $m_\tau$ relative to $m_t$, and $m_s$ and $m_\mu$
relative to $m_c$ because the masses of the $Q=-1/3$ quarks and charged leptons
require mixing between the two ETC groups, while the masses of the $Q=2/3$
quarks do not. A related source of the differences between these mass
splittings is the effect of the two hierarchies of breaking scales of the two
ETC groups. We analyze a particular model of this type in some detail. Although
we find that this model tends to suppress the masses of the first two
generations of down-type quarks and charged leptons too much, it gives useful
insights into the properties of theories with more than one ETC group.

explored in unified theories based upon the quartification gauge group SU(3)^4.
These schemes encompass a quark-lepton exchange symmetry that results upon the

which the quartification gauge symmetry is broken down to the standard model
gauge group, gauge coupling constant unification can be achieved, and there is
no unique scenario. The same is also true when the leptonic colour gauge group
is only partially broken, leaving a remnant SU(2)_\ell symmetry at the standard

be possible to explain the NuTeV $\sin ^2 \theta_{\rm W}$ anomaly with quite
conventional physics, by introducing mutually different nuclear modifications
for the valence-$u$ and valence-$d$ quark distributions of the protons in iron.
Keeping the EKS98 nuclear modifications for $u_V+d_V$ as a baseline, we find
that some 20-30 % nuclear modifications to the $u_V$ and $d_V$ distributions
account for the change induced in the PW ratio by the NuTeV-suggested increase
$\Delta \sin ^2 \theta_{\rm W}=0.005$. We show that introduction of such
nuclear modifications in $u_V$ and $d_V$ individually, does not lead into
contradiction with the present global DGLAP analyses of the nuclear parton
distributions, where deep inelastic $lA$ scattering data and Drell-Yan dilepton
data from $pA$ collisions are used as constraints. We thus suggest that the
NuTeV result serves as an important further constraint in pinning down the
nuclear effects of the bound nucleon PDFs. We also predict that if the NuTeV
anomaly is explained by this mechanism, the NOMAD experiment should see an
increase in the weak mixing angle quite close to the NuTeV result.

scenarios can in principle be realized in models with universal extra space

these radiative decays show this expected relative enhancement to disappear due
to the near mass degeneracy of the heavy neutrinos from the different

calculation of the self-energy of the O($N$) model in the critical regime. The
purpose of the present paper is to extend this study to the next-to-leading
order of the approximation scheme. This involves the calculation of the 4-point
function at leading order, where new features arise, related to the occurrence
of exceptional configurations of momenta in the flow equations. These require a
special treatment, inviting us to improve the straightforward iteration scheme
that we originally proposed. The final result for the self-energy at
next-to-leading order exhibits a remarkable improvement as compared to the
leading order calculation. This is demonstrated by the calculation of the shift
$\Delta T_c$, caused by weak interactions, in the temperature of Bose-Einstein
condensation. This quantity depends on the self-energy at all momentum scales
and can be used as a benchmark of the approximation. The improved
next-to-leading order calculation of the self-energy presented in this paper
leads to excellent agreement with lattice data and is within 4% of the exact
large $N$ result.

typical Gribov-type behaviour, while the off-diagonal component is of the

agreement with available lattice data on the gluon propagators. The
off-diagonal ghost propagator exhibits an infrared enhancement due to the

explore these concepts also from the counterspace viewpoint. The exterior
(regressive) algebra is shown to share the exterior (progressive) algebra in
the direct sum of chiral and achiral subspaces. The duality between scalars and
volume elements, respectively under the progressive and the regressive products
is shown to have chirality, in the case when the dimension n of the Peano space
is even. In other words, the counterspace volume element is shown to be a
scalar or a pseudoscalar, depending on the dimension of the vector space to be
respectively odd or even. The de Rham cochain associated with the differential
operator is constituted by a sequence of exterior algebra homogeneous subspaces
subsequently chiral and achiral. Thus we prove that the exterior algebra over
the space and the exterior algebra constructed on the counterspace are only
pseudoduals each other, when we introduce chirality. The extended Clifford
algebra is introduced in the light of the periodicity theorem of Clifford
algebras context, wherein the Clifford and extended Clifford algebras Cl(p,q)
can be embedded in Cl(p+1,q+1), which is shown to be exactly the extended
Clifford algebra. Clifford algebras are constructed over the counterspace, and
the duality between progressive and regressive products is presented using the
dual Hodge star operator. The differential and codifferential operators are
also defined for the extended exterior algebras from the regressive product
viewpoint, and it is shown they uniquely tumble right out progressive and
regressive exterior products of 1-forms.

expressing the generating class as a union of decomposable submodels and
cycling through the decomposable models. We prove convergence of our proposed

analyze the proposed algorithms around the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) in

In the crystalline case, the Weil-Deligne group representation is unramified

significant and increasing with energy and atomic number fraction of its
initial energy as a result of dominance of inelastic interactions, causality
and energy-momentum conservation. We evaluate these energy losses and find them
to lead to the significant suppression of the forward jet production in the
central NA collisions at collider energies with a moderate suppression of
recoiling jet at central rapidities. We confront our expectations with the
recent RHIC data of the STAR collaboration on the probability, $P$, for
emission of at least one fast hadron at a central rapidity in association with
production of a very forward high $p_t$ neutral pion in $pp$ and $dAu$
collisions. We calculate the A-dependence of $P$, and find that the data imply
a strong suppression of leading pion production at central impact parameters.
We also conclude that production of recoil jets in the hard subprocess is not
suppressed providing further evidence for the dominance of peripheral
collisions. Both features of the data are consistent with the onset of BDR. We
suggest new phenomena and new observables to investigate BDR at RHIC and LHC.

pairing correlations. We obtain good agreement with the experimental data for

Rev. Lett. 90, 110601 (2003) is generalized to the biased case (non equal
numbers of zeros and unities in the chain). In the model, the conditional
probability that the i-th symbol in the chain equals zero (or unity) is a
linear function of the number of unities (zeros) among the preceding N symbols.
The correlation and distribution functions as well as the variance of number of
symbols in the words of arbitrary length L are obtained analytically and
verified by numerical simulations. A self-similarity of the studied stochastic
process is revealed and the similarity group transformation of the chain
parameters is presented. The diffusion Fokker-Planck equation governing the
distribution function of the L-words is explored. If the persistent
correlations are not extremely strong, the distribution function is shown to be
the Gaussian with the variance being nonlinearly dependent on L. An equation
connecting the memory and correlation function of the additive Markov chain is
presented. This equation allows reconstructing a memory function using a
correlation function of the system. Effectiveness and robustness of the
proposed method is demonstrated by simple model examples. Memory functions of
concrete coarse-grained literary texts are found and their universal power-law
behavior at long distances is revealed.

  Historical Analysis and Open Questions-Cesena 2004"", C. Garola, A. Rossi and
  S. Sozzo Eds., World Scientific, Singapore, 2006",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The term proposition usually denotes in quantum mechanics (QM) an element of
(standard) quantum logic (QL). Within the orthodox interpretation of QM the
propositions of QL cannot be associated with sentences of a language stating
properties of individual samples of a physical system, since properties are
nonobjective in QM. This makes the interpretation of propositions
problematical. The difficulty can be removed by adopting the objective
interpretation of QM proposed by one of the authors (semantic realism, or SR,
interpretation). In this case, a unified perspective can be adopted for QM and
classical mechanics (CM), and a simple first order predicate calculus L(x) with
Tarskian semantics can be constructed such that one can associate a physical
proposition (i.e., a set of physical states) with every sentence of L(x). The
set $P^{f}$ of all physical propositions is partially ordered and contains a
subset $P^{f}_{T}$ of testable physical propositions whose order structure
depends on the criteria of testability established by the physical theory. In
particular, $P^{f}_{T}$ turns out to be a Boolean lattice in CM, while it can
be identified with QL in QM. Hence the propositions of QL can be associated
with sentences of L(x), or also with the sentences of a suitable quantum
language $L_{TQ}(x)$, and the structure of QL characterizes the notion of
testability in QM. One can then show that the notion of quantum truth does not
conflict with the classical notion of truth within this perspective.
Furthermore, the interpretation of QL propounded here proves to be equivalent
to a previous pragmatic interpretation worked out by one of the authors, and
can be embodied within a more general perspective which considers states as
first order predicates of a broader language with a Kripkean semantics.

simulate, with exponential overhead, classical shared-randomness SMP protocols
by means of quantum SMP protocols without shared randomness
($Q^\parallel$-protocols). Our first result is to extend Yao's simulation to
the strongest possible model: every many-round quantum protocol with unlimited
shared entanglement can be simulated, with exponential overhead, by
$Q^\parallel$-protocols. We apply our technique to obtain an efficient
$Q^\parallel$-protocol for a function which cannot be efficiently solved
through more restricted simulations. Second, we tightly characterize the power
of the quantum fingerprinting technique by making a connection to arrangements
of homogeneous halfspaces with maximal margin. These arrangements have been
well studied in computational learning theory, and we use some strong results
obtained in this area to exhibit weaknesses of quantum fingerprinting. In
particular, this implies that for almost all functions, quantum fingerprinting
protocols are exponentially worse than classical deterministic SMP protocols.
