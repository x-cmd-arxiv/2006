content with location in the host cluster. The data are drawn from the NOAO
Fundamental Plane Survey. Our adopted method is a generalization of that
introduced by Nelan et al. to determine the global age-mass and
metallicity-mass relations from the same survey. We find strong evidence for a
change in galaxy properties, at fixed mass, over a range from the cluster
centre to the virial radius, R_200. For example, red-sequence galaxies further
out in the clusters have weaker Mgb5177 (at ~8 sigma significance) and stronger
Hbeta and Hgamma absorption (~3 sigma, ~4 sigma) than galaxies of the same
velocity dispersion in the cluster cores. The Fe5270 and Fe5335 indices show
only very weak trends with radius. Using a total of twelve indices, the pattern
of cluster-centric gradients is considered in light of their different
dependences on stellar age and chemical composition. The measured gradients for
all twelve indices can be reproduced by a model in which red-sequence galaxies
at ~1 R_200 have on average younger ages (by 15+/-4%) and lower alpha-element
abundance ratios (by 10+/-2%), than galaxies of the same velocity dispersion
but located near the cluster centre. For the total metallicity, Z/H, no
significant gradient is found (2+/-3% larger at R_200 than in the core). The
cluster-centric age and alpha/Fe gradients are in the sense expected if
galaxies in the cluster core were accreted at an earlier epoch than those at
larger radii, and if this earlier accretion contributed to an earlier cessation
of star formation. The size of the observed age trend is comparable to
predictions from semi-analytic models of hierarchical galaxy formation.

exponential expansion, where gravitationally bound structures will get
disconnected from each other, forming isolated `island universes'. In this
scenario, we present a theoretical criterion to determine the boundaries of
gravitationally bound structures and a physically motivated definition of
superclusters as the largest bound structures in the Universe. We use the
spherical collapse model self-consistently to obtain an analytical condition
for the mean density enclosed by the last bound shell of the structure (2.36
times the critical density in the present Universe, assumed to be flat, with 30
per cent matter and 70 per cent cosmological constant, in agreement with the
previous, numerical result of Chiueh and He). $N$-body simulations extended to
the future show that this criterion, applied at the present cosmological epoch,
defines a sphere that encloses $\approx 99.7$ per cent of the particles that
will remain bound to the structure at least until the scale parameter of the
Universe is 100 times its present value. On the other hand, $(28\pm 13)$ per
cent of the enclosed particles are in fact not bound, so the enclosed mass
overestimates the bound mass, in contrast with the previous, less rigorous
criterion of, e.~g., Busha and collaborators, which gave a more precise mass
estimate. We also verify that the spherical collapse model estimate for the
radial infall velocity of a shell enclosing a given mean density gives an
accurate prediction for the velocity profile of infalling particles, down to
very near the centre of the virialized core.

bands 1 and 3, and $FWHM_{(1)}$ denotes full width at half maximum of the pulse
in energy channel 1. To get insights into features of the RSLs, we investigate
in detail all the correlations between them and other parameters with a
sub-sample including nine long bursts. The general cross-correlation technique
is adopted to measure the lags between two different energy bands. We can
derive the below conclusions. Firstly, the distribution of RSLs is normal and
oncentrates on around the value of 0.1. Secondly, the RSLs are weakly
correlated with $FWHM$, asymmetry, peak flux ($F_{p}$), peak energy ($E_{p}$)
and spectral indexes ($\alpha$ and $\beta$), while they are uncorrelated with
$\tau_{31}$, hardness-ratio ($HR_{31}$) and peak time ($t_m$). The final but
important discovery is that redshift ($z$) and peak luminosity ($L_{p}$) are
strongly correlated with the RSLs which can be measured easily and directly. We
find that the RSL is a good redshift and peak luminosity estimator.

remains one of the most elusive and important goals of theoretical
astrophysics. The star-formation process is the outcome of the complex dynamics
of interstellar gas involving non-linear interactions of turbulence, gravity,
magnetic field and radiation. The evolution of protostellar condensations, from
the moment they are assembled by turbulent flows to the time they reach stellar
densities, spans an enormous range of scales, resulting in a major
computational challenge for simulations. Since the previous Protostars and
Planets conference, dramatic advances in the development of new numerical
algorithmic techniques have been successfully implemented on large scale
parallel supercomputers. Among such techniques, Adaptive Mesh Refinement and
Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics have provided frameworks to simulate the process
of low-mass star formation with a very large dynamic range. It is now feasible
to explore the turbulent fragmentation of molecular clouds and the
gravitational collapse of cores into stars self-consistently within the same
calculation. The increased sophistication of these powerful methods comes with
substantial caveats associated with the use of the techniques and the
interpretation of the numerical results. In this review, we examine what has
been accomplished in the field and present a critique of both numerical methods
and scientific results. We stress that computational simulations should obey
the available observational constraints and demonstrate numerical convergence.
Failing this, results of numerical simulations do not advance our understanding
of low-mass star formation.

Chandra Deep Field South (CDF-S), and seven HELLAS sources, to obtain a new
sample of 52 X-ray selected type-II active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Eighteen of
our sources are very luminous with a typical, absorption-corrected 2-10 keV
luminosity of few 10^{44} erg/sec (type-II QSOs). We compare the emission line
properties of the new sources with emission line and X-ray luminosities of
known low redshift, mostly lower luminosity AGNs by using a composite spectrum.
We find that ${\rm L_{[OIII]}}$/${\rm L_{2-10}}$ and ${\rm L_{[OII]}}$/${\rm
L_{2-10}}$ decrease with L(2-10 keV) such that ${\rm L_{[OIII]}}/{\rm L_{2-10}}
\propto {\rm L_{2-10}}^{-0.42}$. The trend was already evident, yet neglected
in past low redshift samples. This lead to erroneous calibration of the
line-to-X-ray luminosity in earlier AGN samples. The analysis of several type-I
samples shows the same trend with a similar slope but a median ${\rm
L_{[OIII]}}$/${\rm L_{2-10}}$ which is larger by a factor of about two compared
with optically selected type-II samples. We interpret this shift as due to
additional reddening in type-II sources and comment in general on the very
large extinction in many type-II objects and the significantly smaller average
reddening of the SDSS type-II AGNs. The decrease of ${\rm L_{[OIII]}}$/${\rm
L_{2-10}}$ with L(2--10 keV) is large enough to suggest that a significant
fraction of high luminosity high redshift type-II AGNs have very weak emission
lines that may have escaped detection in large samples. A related decrease of
EW([OIII]) with optical continuum luminosity is demonstrated by an analysis of
12,000 type-I SDSS AGNs.

latitude bright (F(2-10) = 3.6 10^{-11} erg/cm2/s) source 4U 1344-60. On the
basis of the optical data we propose to classify 4U 1344-60 as an intermediate
type Seyfert galaxy and we measure a value of z=0.012+/-0.001 for its redshift.
  From the XMM-Newton observation we find that the overall X-ray spectral shape
of 4U 1344-60 is complex and can be described by a power-law continuum (Gamma ~
1.55) obscured by two neutral absorption components (Nh(f) ~ 10^{22} cm^{-2}
and Nh(p) ~ 4 10^{22} cm^{-2}), the latter covering only the ~50% of the
primary X-ray source. The X-ray data therefore lend support to our
classification of 4U 1344-60. It exhibits a broad and skewed Fe Kalpha line at
6.4 keV, which suggests the existence of an accretion disk that is able to
reprocess the primary continuum down to a few gravitational radii. Such a line
represents one of the clearest examples of a relativistic line observed by
XMM-Newton so far. Our analysis has also revealed the marginal presence of two
narrow line-like emission features at ~4.9 and ~5.2 keV.

rigorously defined a volume limited sample of early-type galaxies in the

for each galaxy using a method which takes account of the redshift bias
introduced by survey boundaries if traditional methods are used. At
luminosities greater than our absolute r-band magnitude cutoff of -20.45 the
mean density of environment shows no trend with redshift. We calculate the Lick
indices for the entire sample and correct for aperture effects and velocity
dispersion in a model independent way. Although we find no dependence of
redshift or luminosity with environment we do find that the mean velocity
dispersion, sigma, of early-type galaxies in dense environments tends to be
higher than in low density environments. Taking account of this effect we find
that several indices show small but very significant trends with environment
that are not the result of the correlation between indices and velocity
dispersion. The statistical significance of the data is sufficiently high to
reveal that models accounting only for alpha-enhancement struggle to produce a
consistent picture of age and metallicity of the sample galaxies, whereas a
model that also includes carbon enhancement fares much better. We find that
early-type galaxies in the field are younger than those in environments typical
of clusters but that neither metallicity, alpha-enhancement nor carbon
enhancement are influenced by the environment. The youngest early-type galaxies
in both field and cluster environments are those with the lowest sigma.
However, there is some evidence that the objects with the largest sigma are
slightly younger, especially in denser environments.

that there is a spectral asymmetry between the two. For the eastern hot spot, a
low-energy cutoff in the electron energy spectrum appears to explain the
flattening, which implies a cutoff Lorentz factor \gamma_min ~ 300, though we
cannot exclude the possibility that there might be a moderate level of

galactic nuclei (AGN), including quasars, blazars, Seyfert galaxies and radio

unify the radio-loud and radio-quiet categories of AGN is based upon three
parameters: black hole mass, accretion rate, and our orientation to the
accretion flow. Some recent evidence from optical microvariability of several
classes of AGN points in favor of a strong unification scheme that unites both
radio-loud and radio-quiet categories. An important question concerning the
nature of blazars and other AGN whose jet emission appears to dominate their
spectral energy distributions involves the velocities of those flows. A variety
of apparently contradictory observations can be reconciled if such flows are
ultrarelativistic but have an opening angle of a few degrees. Radio galaxies
(RGs) were much more numerous at redshifts ~2 than they are today. Combining
this fact with the realization that older RGs at such redshifts are very
difficult to detect, and with cosmological simulations of the growth of
structure in the universe has led us to propose that RG lobes have impacted a
significant fraction of the cosmic web of baryons. These impacts may have
triggered extensive star formation and perhaps even engendered new galaxies;
they also probably played important roles in the spreading of magnetic fields
and heavier elements into the intergalactic medium.

improved age estimates for these systems. We found that practically all disks

X-ray binaries (XRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) independently of the
X-ray luminosity. The radio emission of the jet is used as a tracer for the
accretion rate and is normalised using sources of known accretion rates: island
state neutron stars and efficiently radiating black holes close to a state
transition. We show that the radio power in black holes and neutron stars is
comparable for a given mass accretion rate and verify empirically the assumed
analytic scaling of the radio luminosity with accretion rate. As our accretion
measure is independent of the X-ray luminosities, we can search for radiatively
inefficient accretion in black holes by comparing the X-ray luminosities with
the accretion rate in XRBs and AGN. While the X-ray luminosity of efficiently
radiating objects scales linearly with accretion rate, the scaling of hard
state black holes is quadratical, in agreement with theoretical models. We show
that the turnover from the inefficient quadratic scaling to the linear scaling
has to occur at accretion rates of 1-10 % Eddington both in XRBs and AGN. The
comparison of both accretion states supports the idea that in a black hole in
the hard state some accretion power is advected into the black hole while the
jet power exceeds the X-ray luminosity: these are therefore jet-dominated
advective systems.

condensates, one with and the other without a singly quantized vortex. It is
well-known that in a spin-1 BEC in a quadrupole trap a doubly quantized vortex
is produced topologically by a ``slow'' reversal of bias magnetic field $B_z$.
We find that in the magnetic trap considered it is also possible to produce a
4- and 1-quantized vortex in a spin-1 BEC. The latter is possible, for example,
during the magnetic field switching-off process. We therefore provide a
possible explanation for the unexpected interference patterns in the
experiment. We also give an example of the creation of singly quantized
vortices due to ``fast'' splitting, which is a possible alternative mechanism
of the interference pattern.

By progressively replacing the Sr with the smaller Ca, while keeping fixed the
hole-concentration due to the divalent dopant, the 'size effect' of the cation
itself on the structural, transport and magnetic properties of the bilayered
manganite has been analysed. Two different annealing treatments of the solid
solution, in pure oxygen and in pure argon, allowed also to study the effect of
the oxygen content variation. Structure and electronic properties of the
samples have been investigated by means of X-ray powder diffraction and X-ray
absorption spectroscopy measurements. Magnetoresistivity and static
magnetization measurements have been carried out to complete the samples
characterization. Oxygen annealing of the solid solution, that showed a limit
for about y=0.5, induces an increase of the Mn average valence state and a
transition of the crystal structure from tetragonal to orthorhombic while the
argon annealing induces an oxygen under-stoichiometry and, in turn, a reduction
of the Mn average valence state. Along with the Ca substitution, the
Jahn-Teller distortion of the MnO6 octahedra is reduced. This has been directly
connected to a general enhancement of the transport properties induced by the
Ca-doping. For the same cation composition, oxygen over-stoichiometry leads to
higher metal-insulator transition temperatures and lower resistivity values.
Curie temperatures (TC) reduce by increasing the Ca-doping. The lower TC for
all the annealed samples with respect to the 'as prepared' ones are connected
to the strong influence on the magnetic interaction of the point defects due to
the oxygen content variation.

external modulating field generating nonequilibrium nonground-state

antiferromagnetic (AF), ferromagnetic (FM), or AF-FM phase separated (PS)
state. At high temperatures, there can exist two types of the paramagnetic (PM)

consider models of a lattice of harmonic oscillators connected by spring

more than one weak bond, so that a realistic model should consider oscillators
with several weak springs. In this paper, a t-matrix formalism is used to study
the effect of such correlated weak springs in a scalar model on a simple cubic
lattice with a binary distribution of spring constants. Our results, which are
confirmed by computer simulations, show that a concentration of c oscillators
with z weak springs and 6-z strong ones leads to a low frequency peak in the
reduced density of states (Boson peak) even when the total concentration of
weak springs cz is less than 10%., No such peak has been found at these low

The scaling variable z is fractal measure which depends on kinematical
characteristics of the underlying sub-process expressed in terms of the
momentum fractions x1 and x2 of the incoming protons. In the generalized
approach, the x1 and x2 are functions of the momentum fractions ya and yb of
the scattered and recoil constituents carried out by the inclusive particle and
recoil object, respectively. The scaling function psi(z) for charged and
identified hadrons produced in proton-proton collisions is constructed. The
fractal dimensions and heat capacity of the produced medium entering definition
of the z are established to obtain energy, angular and multiplicity
independence of the psi(z). The scheme allows unique description of data on
inclusive cross sections of charged particles, pions, kaons, antiprotons and
lambdas at high energies. The obtained results are of interest to use z-scaling
as a tool for searching for new physics phenomena of particle production in
high transverse momentum and high multiplicity region at proton-proton
colliders RHIC and LHC.

the results of [1] are correct and in this case we need a revolution in

condition. The result extends to Hardy-Orlicz spaces contained in the scale of
classical Hardy spaces $H^p$, $p>0$. For the Smirnov and the Nevanlinna
classes, interpolating sequences have been characterized in a recent paper in
terms of the existence of harmonic majorants (quasi-bounded in the case of the
Smirnov class). Since the Smirnov class can be regarded as the union over all
Hardy-Orlicz spaces associated with a so-called strongly convex function, it is
natural to ask how the condition changes from the Carleson condition in
classical Hardy spaces to harmonic majorants in the Smirnov class. The aim of
this paper is to narrow down this gap from the Smirnov class to ``big''
Hardy-Orlicz spaces. More precisely, we characterize interpolating sequences
for a class of Hardy-Orlicz spaces that carry an algebraic structure and that
are strictly bigger than $\bigcup_{p>0} H^p$. It turns out that the
interpolating sequences are again characterized by the existence of
quasi-bounded majorants, but now the weights of the majorants have to be in
suitable Orlicz spaces. The existence of harmonic majorants in such Orlicz
spaces will also be discussed in the general situation. We finish the paper
with an example of a separated Blaschke sequence that is interpolating for
certain Hardy-Orlicz spaces without being interpolating for slightly smaller
ones.

the major breakthroughs of the 20th century in particle and nuclear physics.
These outstanding contributions go beyond the Dalitz Plot, Dalitz Pair and CDD

resonances, of baryon spectroscopy in the quark model, and of hypernuclei, to
all of which he made lasting contributions. His formulation of the
""$\theta-\tau$ puzzle"" led to the discovery that parity is not a symmetry of
the weak interactions. A brief scientific evaluation of Dalitz's major
contributions to particle and nuclear physics is hereby presented, followed by
the first comprehensive list of his scientific publications, as assembled from
several sources. The list is divided into two categories: the first, main part
comprises Dalitz's research papers and reviews, including topics in the history
of particle physics, biographies and reminiscences; the second part lists book
reviews, public lectures and obituaries authored by Dalitz, and books edited by
him. This provides the first necessary step towards a more systematic research
of the Dalitz heritage in modern physics.

leads to the contradiction of terrestrial planets having insufficiently massive
cores. By contrast, that prognosis is considerably enhanced (i) by the new
vision I have disclosed of Earth formation as a Jupiter-like gas giant; (ii) by
core formation contemporaneous with raining out from within a giant gaseous
protoplanet rather than through subsequent whole-Earth re-melting after loss of
gases; (iii) by the consequences of whole-Earth decompression dynamics, which
obviates the unfounded assumption of mantle convection, and; (iv) by the
process of mantle decompression thermal-tsunami. The latter, in addition to
accounting for much of the heat leaving the Earth's surface, for the geothermal
gradient observed in the crust, for substantial volcanism, and possibly for
earthquake generation as well, also might enhance the prognosis for future
abiotic energy supplies by pressurizing and heating the base of the crust, a
potential collection point for abiotic mantle methane or other mantle-derived
carbon-containing matter.

small fraction. The connectivity between peers, including undirected, directed
(out and in) and weighted connections, is scale-free and the social networks of
all peers and major peers are small world networks. The analysis also confirms
that peer social networks show in general disassortative correlations, except
that active providers are connected between each other and by active
requesters. The study presented in this paper gives a better understanding of
peer relationships in resource sharing, which may help a better design of
future P2P networks and open the path to the study of transport processes on

by comparing known response functions derived relativistically (by Jancovici)

one-photon pair creation, which leads to logarithmic singularities in the
response functions. Dispersion curves for longitudinal waves have a similar
tongue-like appearance in the relativistic and nonrelativistic case, with the
main relativistic effects being on the Fermi speed and the cutoff frequency.
For transverse waves the nonrelativistic treatment has a nonphysical feature
near the cutoff frequency for large Fermi momenta, and this is attributed to an
incorrect treatment of the electron spin. We find (with two important provisos)
that one-photon pair creation is allowed in superdense plasmas, implying
relatively strong coupling between transverse waves and pair creation.

of the coefficient matrix of the state in an arbitrary product basis. We
illustrate this approach in detail with the well-known bi- and tripartite
systems, obtaining as a by-product a systematic criterion to establish the
entanglement class of a given pure state without resourcing to any entanglement
measure. The general case is proved by induction, allowing us to find an upper
bound for the number of N-partite entanglement classes in terms of the number
of entanglement classes for N-1 qubits.

generalize the scheme to higher dimensions. We show that the protocol
preservers entanglement between qubits to be encoded and environment and can be
also applied to mixed states. We present the protocol which enables encoding of
n qudits to one qudit of dimension smaller than the Hilbert space of the
original system and then probabilistically but error-free decode any subset of
k qudits. We give a formula for the probability of successful decoding.
