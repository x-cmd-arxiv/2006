strength of structure formation shocks during cosmological smoothed particle
hydrodynamics simulations. Shocks not only play a decisive role for the
thermalization of gas in virialising structures but also for the acceleration
of relativistic cosmic rays (CRs) through diffusive shock acceleration. Our
formalism is applicable both to ordinary non-relativistic thermal gas, and to
plasmas composed of CRs and thermal gas. To this end, we derive an analytical
solution to the one-dimensional Riemann shock tube problem for a composite
plasma of CRs and thermal gas. We apply our methods to study the properties of
structure formation shocks in high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of the
LCDM model. We find that most of the energy is dissipated in weak internal
shocks with Mach numbers M~2 which are predominantly central flow shocks or
merger shock waves traversing halo centres. Collapsed cosmological structures
are surrounded by external shocks with much higher Mach numbers up to M~1000,
but they play only a minor role in the energy balance of thermalization. We
show that after the epoch of cosmic reionisation the Mach number distribution
is significantly modified by an efficient suppression of strong external shock
waves due to the associated increase of the sound speed of the diffuse gas.
Invoking a model for CR acceleration in shock waves, we find that the average
strength of shock waves responsible for CR energy injection is higher than that
for shocks that dominate the thermalization of the gas. When combined with
radiative dissipation and star formation, our formalism can also be used to
study CR injection by supernova shocks, or to construct models for
shock-induced star formation in the interstellar medium. (abridged)

be the reason of enhanced low energy axion production. Such an axion component
could be the as yet unknown origin of the strong quiet Sun X-ray luminosity at
energies below 1 keV. Solar axion telescopes should lower their threshold,
aiming to copy processes that might occur near the solar surface, be it due to

dominates at low energies while the footpoint (FP) sources dominate the high
energy emission. At intermediate energies, both the LT and FPs may be seen, but
during certain intervals emission from the legs of the loop dominates, in
contrast to the commonly observed LT and FP emission. The hard X-ray emission
tends to rise above the FPs and eventually merge into a single LT source. This
evolution starts first at low energies and proceeds to higher energies. The
spectrum of the resultant LT source becomes more and more dominated by a
thermal component with an increasing emission measure as the flare proceeds.
The soft and hard X-rays show a Neupert-type behavior. With a non-thermal
bremsstrahlung model the brightness profile along the loop is used to determine
the density profile and its evolution, which reveals a gradual increase of the
gas density in the loop. These results are evidence for chromospheric
evaporation and are consistent with the qualitative features of hydrodynamic
simulations of this phenomenon. However, some observed source morphology and
its evolution cannot be accounted for by previous simulations. Therefore
simulations with more realistic physical conditions are required to explain the
results and the particle acceleration and plasma heating processes.

  2005 (FAST '05), San Francisco, CA",,,"cs.DL cs.IR",,"  Data compression algorithms change frequently, and obsolete decoders do not
always run on new hardware and operating systems, threatening the long-term
usability of content archived using those algorithms. Re-encoding content into
new formats is cumbersome, and highly undesirable when lossy compression is
involved. Processor architectures, in contrast, have remained comparatively
stable over recent decades. VXA, an archival storage system designed around
this observation, archives executable decoders along with the encoded content
it stores. VXA decoders run in a specialized virtual machine that implements an
OS-independent execution environment based on the standard x86 architecture.
The VXA virtual machine strictly limits access to host system services, making
decoders safe to run even if an archive contains malicious code. VXA's adoption
of a ""native"" processor architecture instead of type-safe language technology
allows reuse of existing ""hand-optimized"" decoders in C and assembly language,
and permits decoders access to performance-enhancing architecture features such
as vector processing instructions. The performance cost of VXA's virtualization
is typically less than 15% compared with the same decoders running natively.
The storage cost of archived decoders, typically 30-130KB each, can be
amortized across many archived files sharing the same compression method.

peer-to-peer (P2P) communication, since the peers involved may not be reachable
at any globally valid IP address. Several NAT traversal techniques are known,
but their documentation is slim, and data about their robustness or relative
merits is slimmer. This paper documents and analyzes one of the simplest but
most robust and practical NAT traversal techniques, commonly known as ""hole
punching."" Hole punching is moderately well-understood for UDP communication,
but we show how it can be reliably used to set up peer-to-peer TCP streams as
well. After gathering data on the reliability of this technique on a wide
variety of deployed NATs, we find that about 82% of the NATs tested support
hole punching for UDP, and about 64% support hole punching for TCP streams. As
NAT vendors become increasingly conscious of the needs of important P2P
applications such as Voice over IP and online gaming protocols, support for
hole punching is likely to increase in the future.

  October 2002, Pittsburgh, PA",,,"cs.DS cs.CC cs.PL",,"  Packrat parsing is a novel technique for implementing parsers in a lazy
functional programming language. A packrat parser provides the power and
flexibility of top-down parsing with backtracking and unlimited lookahead, but
nevertheless guarantees linear parse time. Any language defined by an LL(k) or
LR(k) grammar can be recognized by a packrat parser, in addition to many
languages that conventional linear-time algorithms do not support. This
additional power simplifies the handling of common syntactic idioms such as the
widespread but troublesome longest-match rule, enables the use of sophisticated
disambiguation strategies such as syntactic and semantic predicates, provides
better grammar composition properties, and allows lexical analysis to be
integrated seamlessly into parsing. Yet despite its power, packrat parsing
shares the same simplicity and elegance as recursive descent parsing; in fact
converting a backtracking recursive descent parser into a linear-time packrat
parser often involves only a fairly straightforward structural change. This
paper describes packrat parsing informally with emphasis on its use in
practical applications, and explores its advantages and disadvantages with
respect to the more conventional alternatives.

increasing disorder. On the other hand, the BEC suppression at integer
densities may disappear, if disorder increases. For a continuous distribution
we prove that the BEC critical temperature decreases for small on-site

ecological & social conditions actively changed & challenged conditions through
the political process. Villagers were faced with many important forcing
functions that they could not control. Most of the variables defined by
villagers were related to agriculture and animal husbandry. Conservation
policies & ecosystem management must encompass larger environmental issues &
villagers' cognitive maps must be reconciled with that of NGOs & government
officials. Cognitive maps can serve as a basis for discussion when policies &
management options are formulated. A villager-centered cognitive mapping
approach is not only necessary because villagers resist conservation projects,
or because top down projects that do not take local knowledge systems into
account fail, but because it is the ethical and responsible way of doing
ecosystem management.

reaction-diffusion systems and equations of the form $u_t = \epsilon^2 D \Delta
u + f(u,x,\epsilon t)$, that are used in modeling pattern formation. We analyze
the diffusion neutral and the diffusion dependent situations that, in the time
autonomous case, are distinguished by considering the attractors of the shorted
equation $u_t = f(u,x)$. We discuss the consequences of being in one or in the
other of the two situations and present examples from developmental biology and
from fluid mechanics.

the shortest path between two points in a certain curved geometry. By recasting
the problem of finding quantum circuits as a geometric problem, we open up the
possibility of using the mathematical techniques of Riemannian geometry to
suggest new quantum algorithms, or to prove limitations on the power of quantum
computers.

formalism of matrix product states and the formalism of contracting tensor
networks. We provide simplified direct proofs of many of these results,
extending an explicit class of efficiently simulable circuits (log depth
circuits with 2-qubit gates of limited range) to the following: let C be any
poly sized quantum circuit (generally of poly depth too) on n qubits comprising
1- and 2- qubit gates and 1-qubit measurements (with 2-qubit gates acting on
arbitrary pairs of qubit lines). For each qubit line j let D_j be the number of
2-qubit gates that touch or cross the line j i.e. the number of 2-qubit gates
that are applied to qubits i,k with i \leq j \leq k. Let D=max_j D_j. Then the
quantum process can be classically simulated in time n poly(2^D). Thus if
D=O(log n) then C may be efficiently classically simulated.

dynamics of the interacting fermions in QED. The state of the fermions appears
to collapse continuously, due to their interaction with the photonic degrees of
freedom. Even the formal study is instructive for the foundations of quantum
mechanics and of field theory as well.
