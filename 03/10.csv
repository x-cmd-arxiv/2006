high spatial and mass resolution and include radiative cooling, star formation,
and other processes accompanying galaxy formation. Our analysis shows that
simulated clusters exhibit a high degree of regularity and tight correlations
between the considered observables and total mass. The normalizations of the
M-Tx, Mg-Tx, and M-Yx relations agree to better than 10-15% with the current
observational measurements of these relations. Our results show that Yx is the
best mass proxy with a remarkably low scatter of only ~5-7% in M500 for a fixed
Yx, at both low and high redshifts and regardless of whether clusters are
relaxed or not. In addition, we show that redshift evolution of the Yx-M500
relation is close to the self-similar prediction, which makes Yx a very
attractive mass indicator for measurements of the cluster mass function from
X-ray selected samples.

  version","Astrophys.J.650:102-127,2006","10.1086/506508",,"astro-ph",,"  Chandra X-ray observations revealed the presence of cold fronts (sharp
contact discontinuities between gas regions with different temperatures and
densities) in the centers of many, if not most, relaxed clusters with cool
cores. We use high-resolution simulations of idealized cluster mergers to show
that they are due to sloshing of the cool gas in the central gravitational
potential, which is easily set off by minor mergers and can persist for
gigayears. The only necessary condition is a steep entropy profile, as observed
in cooling flow clusters. Even if the infalling subcluster has no gas during
core passage, the gravitational disturbance sets the main mass peak (gas and
dark matter together) in motion relative to the surrounding gas. A rapid change
in the direction of motion causes a change in ram pressure, which pushes the
cool gas away from the dark matter peak and triggers sloshing. For nonzero
impact parameters, the cool gas acquires angular momentum, resulting in a
characteristic spiral pattern of cold fronts. There is little visible
disturbance outside the cool core in such a merger. If the subcluster retains
its gas during core passage, the cool central gas of the main cluster is more
easily decoupled from the dark matter peak. Subsequently, some of that gas, and
often the cool gas from the subcluster, falls back to the center and starts
sloshing. However, in such a merger, global disturbances are readily visible in
X-rays for a long time. We conclude that cold fronts at the centers of relaxed
clusters, often spiral or concentric-arc in shape, are probably caused by
encounters with small subhalos stripped of all their gas at the early infall
stages.

some measure the limits on four of the time-varying mode amplitudes are quite
tight, they are consistent with the expectation that the dark energy density
does not vary on timescales shorter than a Hubble time. Since we do not expect

for luminosity evolution, this means that the black holes grew in mass faster
than their hosts, with the MBH/M* mass ratio being a factor of > 4(+2)(-1)

The simulation resolves a 0.014 Msun parent ``SUSY'' halo at z=75 with 14
million particles. On these scales the effective index of the power spectrum
approaches -3, and a range of mass scales collapse almost simultaneously.
Compared to a z=0 galaxy cluster substructure within our SUSY host is less
evident both in phase-space and in physical space, and it is less resistant
against tidal disruption. As the universe expands by a factor of 1.3, we find
that between 20 and 40 percent of well-resolved SUSY substructure is destroyed,
compared to only about 1 percent in the low-redshift cluster. Nevertheless SUSY
substructure is just as abundant as in z=0 galaxy clusters, i.e. the normalized
mass and circular velocity functions are very similar. The dark matter
self-annihilation gamma-ray luminosity from bound subhalos and other deviations
from a smooth spherical configuration is at least comparable to the
spherically-averaged signal in the SUSY host, and at least three times larger
than the spherically-averaged signal in the cluster host. Such components must
be taken into account when estimating the total cosmological extragalactic

high-resolution, g and z-band images for 100 early-type members of the Virgo
Cluster, spanning a range of ~460 in blue luminosity. Based on this large,
homogeneous dataset, we present a sharp upward revision in the frequency of
nucleation in early-type galaxies brighter than M_B ~ -15 (66 < f_n < 82%), and
find no evidence for nucleated dwarfs to be more concentrated to the center of
Virgo than their non-nucleated counterparts. Resolved stellar nuclei are not
present in galaxies brighter than M_B ~ -20.5, however, there is no clear
evidence from the properties of the nuclei, or from the overall incidence of
nucleation, for a change at M_B ~ -17.6, the traditional dividing point between
dwarf and giant galaxies. On average, nuclei are ~3.5 mag brighter than a
typical globular cluster and have a median half-light radius ~4.2 pc. Nuclear
luminosities correlate with nuclear sizes and, in galaxies fainter than M_B ~
-17.6, nuclear colors. Comparing the nuclei to the ""nuclear clusters"" found in
late-type spiral galaxies reveals a close match in terms of size, luminosity
and overall frequency, pointing to a formation mechanism that is rather
insensitive to the detailed properties of the host galaxy. The mean
nuclear-to-galaxy luminosity ratio is indistinguishable from the mean
SBH-to-bulge mass ratio, calculated in early-type galaxies with detected
supermassive black holes (SBHs). We argue that compact stellar nuclei might be
the low-mass counterparts of the SBHs detected in the bright galaxies, and that
one should think in terms of ""Central Massive Objects"" -- either SBHs or
compact stellar nuclei -- that accompany the formation of almost all early-type
galaxies and contain a mean fraction ~0.3% of the total bulge mass.

incorrectly neglect the direct field after the inner disc has drained, at late
times in the evolution. We construct models of the photoevaporative wind
produced by the direct field, first using simple analytic arguments and later
using detailed numerical hydrodynamics. We find that the wind produced by the
direct field at late times is much larger than has previously been assumed, and
we show that the mass-loss rate scales as $R_{in}^{1/2}$ (where $R_{in}$ is the
radius of the instantaneous inner disc edge). We suggest that this result has
important consequences for theories of disc evolution, and go on to consider
the effects of this result on disc evolution in detail in a companion paper

consider the effect of stellar radiation directly incident on the inner disc

that the entire disc is dispersed on a time-scale of order $10^5$yr after a
disc lifetime of a few Myr, consistent with observations of T Tauri (TT) stars.
We use a simple prescription to model the spectral energy distribution of the
evolving disc, and demonstrate that the model is consistent with observational
data across a wide range of wavelengths. We note also that the model predicts a
short ``inner hole'' phase in the evolution of all TT discs, and make
predictions for future observations at mid-infrared and millimetre wavelengths.

the cold neutral medium surrounded by the warm neutral medium. We focus on
clouds smaller than 1pc, which corresponds to tiny HI clouds recently
discovered by Braun & Kanekar and Stanimirovi{\'c} & Heiles. By performing
one-dimensional spherically symmetric numerical simulations of the two-phase
interstellar medium (ISM), we derive the timescales as a function of the cloud
size and of pressure of the ambient warm medium. We find that the evaporation
timescale of the clouds of 0.01 pc is about 1Myr with standard ISM pressure,
$p/k_{B}\sim 10^{3.5}$ K cm$^{-3}$, and for clouds larger than about 0.1 pc it
depends strongly on the pressure. In high pressure cases, there exists a
critical radius for clouds growing as a function of pressure, but the minimum
critical size is $\sim$ 0.03 pc for a standard environment. If tiny HI clouds
exist ubiquitously, our analysis suggests two implications: tiny HI clouds are
formed continuously with the timescale of 1Myr, or the ambient pressure around
the clouds is much higher than the standard ISM pressure. We also find that the
results agree well with those obtained by assuming quasi-steady state
evolution. The cloud-size dependence of the timescale is well explained by an
analytic approximate formula derived by Nagashima, Koyama & Inutsuka. We also
compare it with the evaporation rate given by McKee & Cowie.

  evolution"", Specola Vaticana, Castel Gandolfo, Italy, 3-6 October 2005",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We summarize some recent results on the metallicity and dust properties of
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at high redshift (1<z<6.4). By using the spectra
of more than 5000 QSOs from the SDSS we find no evidence for any metallicity
evolution in the redshift range 2<z<4.5, while there is a significant
luminosity-metallicity dependence. These results are confirmed by the spectra
of a smaller sample of narrow line AGNs at high-z (QSO2s and radio galaxies).
The lack of metallicity evolution is interpreted both as a consequence of the
cosmic downsizing and as a selection effect resulting from the joint QSO-galaxy
evolution. The luminosity-metallicity relation is interpreted as a consequence
of the mass-metallicity relation in the host galaxies of QSOs, but a
relationship with the accretion rate is also possible. The lack of metallicity
evolution is observed even in the spectra of the most distant QSOs known (z~6).
This result is particularly surprising for elements such as Fe, C and Si, which
are subject to a delayed enrichment, and requires that the hosts of these QSOs
formed in short bursts and at very high redshift (z>10). The properties of dust
in high-z QSOs are discussed within the context of the dust production
mechanisms in the early universe. The dust extinction curve is observed to
evolve beyond z>4, and by z~6 it is well described by the properties expected
for dust produced by SNe, suggesting that the latter is the main mechanism of
dust production in the early universe. We also show that the huge dust masses
observed in distant QSOs can be accounted for by SN dust within the
observational constraints currently available. Finally, we show that QSO winds,
which have been proposed as an alternative mechanism of dust production, may
also contribute significantly to the total dust budget at high redshift.

of the counterpart is that of a hydrogen atmosphere, showing Balmer absorption
lines upto H12, and we identify the counterpart as a helium-core white dwarf of

Rwd=0.043+-0.009 Rsun. Combined with the mass ratio, this constrains the pulsar

worth noting: four of them, namely AO 0235+164, PKS 1127-145, S5 0836+710 and

of a cluster of galaxies, and a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. The
novel feature of our hybrid model is that the chemical properties of the
diffuse gas in the underlying simulation are dynamically and consistently
generated from stars in the galaxies. We follow the production of several
chemical elements, provided by low- and intermediate-mass stars, core collapse
and type Ia supernovae. We analyse the spatial distribution of metals in the
ICM, investigate the way in which the chemical enrichment proceeds, and use
iron emissivity as a tracer of gas motions. Fe and O radial abundance profiles
are enhanced in the inner 100 h^-1 kpc in the last Gyr because of the
convergence of enriched gas clumps to the cluster centre. Our results support a
scenario in which part of the central intracluster gas comes from gas clumps
that, in the redshift range of z~0.2 to ~0.5, have been enriched to solar
values and are at large distances from the cluster centre (from ~1 to ~6 h^-1
Mpc) moving at very high velocities (from ~1300 to ~2500 km s^-1). The
turbulent gas motions within the cluster, originated in the inhomogeneous gas
infall during the cluster assembly, are manifested in emission-weighted
velocity maps as gradients that can be as large as ~1000 km s^-1 over distances
of a few hundred kpc. Gradients of this magnitude are also seen in velocity
distributions along sightlines through the cluster centre. Doppler shifting and
broadening suffered by the Fe K 6.7 keV emission line along such sightlines
could be used to probe these gas large-scale motions when they are produced
within an area characterised by high iron line emissivity.

two-body and the many-body calculations show that the system always has two
branches of solutions: one corresponds to a deeply bound molecule state; and
the other, the one accessed by the current experiments, corresponds to a weakly
bound state with population always dominantly in the open channel. For 6Li,
there is only a unique solution with the standard crossover from the weakly
bound Cooper pairs to the deeply bound molecules as one sweeps the magnetic
field through the crossover region. Because of this difference, for the
experimentally accessible state of 40K, there is a quantum phase transition at
zero temperature from the superfluid to the normal fermi gas at the positive
detuning of the magnetic field where the s-wave scattering length passes its
zero point. For 6Li, however, the system changes continuously across the zero

tight binding. A crucial aspect of the model is decomposition of the $d$-band
into contributions from the five $d$ atomic orbitals. This provides a
representation of the energy levels of the substrate that are directly relevant
to the chemisorption bond, leading to accurate prediction of chemisorption
trends.

arbitrary dimension n and p, while previous results pertained only to p=1, or a
fixed p with asymptotically large n. Based on this result, several quantization
bounds are derived for sphere packing and rate distortion tradeoff. We
establish asymptotically equivalent lower and upper bounds for the rate
distortion tradeoff. Since the upper bound is derived by constructing random

  Feedback Using Beamforming and Power On/Off Strategy","44 pages, 8 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information
  Theory in 2005",,,,"cs.IT math.IT",,"  It is well known that Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems have high
spectral efficiency, especially when channel state information at the
transmitter (CSIT) is available. When CSIT is obtained by feedback, it is
practical to assume that the channel state feedback rate is finite and the CSIT
is not perfect. For such a system, we consider beamforming and power on/off
strategy for its simplicity and near optimality, where power on/off means that
a beamforming vector (beam) is either turned on with a constant power or turned
off. The main contribution of this paper is to accurately evaluate the
information rate as a function of the channel state feedback rate. Name a beam
turned on as an on-beam and the minimum number of the transmit and receive
antennas as the dimension of a MIMO system. We prove that the ratio of the
optimal number of on-beams and the system dimension converges to a constant for
a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when the numbers of transmit and receive
antennas approach infinity simultaneously and when beamforming is perfect.
Asymptotic formulas are derived to evaluate this ratio and the corresponding
information rate per dimension. The asymptotic results can be accurately
applied to finite dimensional systems and suggest a power on/off strategy with
a constant number of on-beams. For this suboptimal strategy, we take a novel
approach to introduce power efficiency factor, which is a function of the
feedback rate, to quantify the effect of imperfect beamforming. By combining
power efficiency factor and the asymptotic formulas for perfect beamforming
case, the information rate of the power on/off strategy with a constant number
of on-beams is accurately characterized.

data structures. Previous lower bounds used a reduction to communication games,
which was known not to be tight by counting arguments. We give the first lower
bound for an explicit problem which breaks this communication complexity
barrier. In addition, our bounds give the first separation between polynomial
and near linear space. Such a separation is inherently impossible by
communication complexity.
  Using our lower bound technique and new upper bound constructions, we obtain
tight bounds for searching predecessors among a static set of integers. Given a
set Y of n integers of l bits each, the goal is to efficiently find
predecessor(x) = max{y in Y | y <= x}, by representing Y on a RAM using space
S.
  In external memory, it follows that the optimal strategy is to use either
standard B-trees, or a RAM algorithm ignoring the larger block size. In the
important case of l = c*lg n, for c>1 (i.e. polynomial universes), and near
linear space (such as S = n*poly(lg n)), the optimal search time is Theta(lg
l). Thus, our lower bound implies the surprising conclusion that van Emde Boas'
classic data structure from [FOCS'75] is optimal in this case. Note that for
space n^{1+eps}, a running time of O(lg l / lglg l) was given by Beame and Fich
[STOC'99].

phases that may arise in cold dense, but not asymptotically dense, three-flavor
quark matter. At present the only approximation within which it seems possible
to compare the free energies of the myriad possible crystal structures is the
Ginzburg-Landau approximation. Here, we test this approximation on a
particularly simple ""crystal"" structure in which there are only two condensates
$<us > \sim \Delta \exp(i {\bf q_2}\cdot {\bf r})$ and $<ud > \sim \Delta
\exp(i {\bf q_3}\cdot {\bf r})$ whose position-space dependence is that of two
plane waves with wave vectors ${\bf q_2}$ and ${\bf q_3}$ at arbitrary angles.
For this case, we are able to solve the mean-field gap equation without making
a Ginzburg-Landau approximation. We find that the Ginzburg-Landau approximation
works in the $\Delta\to 0$ limit as expected, find that it correctly predicts
that $\Delta$ decreases with increasing angle between ${\bf q_2}$ and ${\bf
q_3}$ meaning that the phase with ${\bf q_2}\parallel {\bf q_3}$ has the lowest
free energy, and find that the Ginzburg-Landau approximation is conservative in
the sense that it underestimates $\Delta$ at all values of the angle between
${\bf q_2}$ and ${\bf q_3}$.

substantial improvement in experimental sensitivity would be required for
observation. A substantial flux of energetic gamma rays is produced in the

that one can in principle make sense out of a gravitational path integral

derivative formula is the one that yields no effect of K-conservation on the
differentiation of K-independent functionals, which gives the basis for its

forest-fireprocesses, the self-destructive percolation model (abbreviated as
sdp model). A typical configuration for the sdp model with parameters p and
delta is generated in three steps: First we generate a typical configuration
for the ordinary percolation model with parameter p. Next, we make all sites in
the infinite occupied cluster vacant. Finally, each site that was already
vacant in the beginning or made vacant by the above action, becomes occupied
with probability delta (independent of the other sites).
  Let theta(p, delta) be the probability that some specified vertex belongs, in
the final configuration, to an infinite occupied cluster. In our earlier paper
we stated the conjecture that, for the square lattice and other planar
lattices, the function theta has a discontinuity at points of the form (p_c,
delta), with delta sufficiently small. We also showed remarkable consequences
for the forest-fire models.
  The conjecture naturally raises the question whether the function theta is
continuous outside some region of the above mentioned form. We prove that this
is indeed the case. An important ingredient in our proof is a (somewhat
stronger form of a) recent ingenious RSW-like percolation result of
Bollob\'{a}s and Riordan.

positive ions. It consists of continuity equations for the charged particles
including drift, diffusion and reaction in the local electric field, coupled to
the Poisson equation for the electric potential. The model generates field
enhancement and steep propagating ionization fronts at the tip of growing
ionized filaments. An adaptive grid refinement method for the simulation of
these structures is presented. It uses finite volume spatial discretizations
and explicit time stepping, which allows the decoupling of the grids for the
continuity equations from those for the Poisson equation. Standard refinement
methods in which the refinement criterion is based on local error monitors fail
due to the pulled character of the streamer front that propagates into a
linearly unstable state. We present a refinement method which deals with all
these features. Tests on one-dimensional streamer fronts as well as on
three-dimensional streamers with cylindrical symmetry (hence effectively 2D for
numerical purposes) are carried out successfully. Results on fine grids are
presented, they show that such an adaptive grid method is needed to capture the
streamer characteristics well. This refinement strategy enables us to
adequately compute negative streamers in pure gases in the parameter regime
where a physical instability appears: branching streamers.

Schr{\""o}dinger picture are derived, taking into account the effects of loss,
group-velocity dispersion, temporal phase modulation, linear coupling among
different optical modes, and four-wave mixing. Inspired by the formalism, we
propose the concept of quantum temporal imaging, which uses dispersive elements
and temporal phase modulators to manipulate the temporal correlation of two
entangled photons. We also present the exact solution of a two-photon vector
soliton, in order to demonstrate the ease of use and intuitiveness of the
proposed formulation.

mutually by a nonlinear interaction. The system is excited by an external
coherent field that is resonant to the frequency of one of the oscillators. We
show that the coupler evolution can be closed within a finite set of $n$-photon
states, analogously as in the \textit{nonlinear quantum scissors} model.
Moreover, for this type of evolution our system can be treated as a
\textit{Bell-like states} generator. Thanks to the nonlinear nature of both:
oscillators and their internal coupling, these states can be generated even if
the system exhibits its energy dissipating nature, contrary to systems with
linear couplings.

Hamiltonian, H = p^2/2m + v(x), into the complex plane yields a particular
complex classical dynamical system. For an analytic potential v, we show that
the resulting complex system admits a description in terms of the phase space
R^4 equipped with an unconventional symplectic structure. This in turn allows
for the construction of an equivalent real description that is based on the
conventional symplectic structure on R^4, and establishes the equivalence of
the complex extension of classical mechanics that is based on the
above-mentioned analytic continuation with the conventional classical
mechanics. The equivalent real Hamiltonian turns out to be twice the real part
of H, while the imaginary part of H plays the role of an independent integral
of motion ensuring the integrability of the system. The equivalent real
description proposed here is the classical analog of the equivalent Hermitian
description of unitary quantum systems defined by complex, typically
PT-symmetric, potentials.

constant force performs Bloch oscillations. Modulating every second period of
the potential, the original Bloch band splits into two subbands. The dynamics
of quantum particles shows a coherent superposition of Bloch oscillations and
Zener tunneling between the subbands, a Bloch-Zener oscillation. Such a system
is modelled by a tight-binding Hamiltonian, a system of two minibands with an
easily controllable gap. The dynamics of the system is investigated by using an
algebraic ansatz leading to a differential equation of Whittaker-Hill type. It
is shown that the parameters of the system can be tuned to generate a periodic
reconstruction of the wave packet and thus of the occupation probability. As an
application, the construction of a matter wave beam splitter and a Mach-Zehnder
interferometer is briefly discussed.

the atomic ensemble, whilst for the resonantly accelerated atoms the fidelity
is predicted to decay slowly according to a power law.
