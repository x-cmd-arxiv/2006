  Journal (issue 131, April 2006)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We report a study of the spectra and structure of the accretion disk of the
dwarf nova V2051 Ophiuchi while the star was in an unusual faint brightness
state during 1996. The differences between the UV resonant lines and continuum
disk surface brightness distributions indicate a vertically extended disk with
the emission from these lines arising from the upper atmospheric layers.
Distinct emission along the stream trajectory suggests the occurrence of gas
stream overflow. Spatially resolved spectra show that the lines are in emission
at all disk radii. The Balmer decrement becomes shallower with increasing
radius. The FWHMs of the emission lines show differences with respect to that
expected for a gas in Keplerian rotation and the line intensities drop with a
radial dependency of $I\propto R^{-1.78}$. The uneclipsed light contributes
about 5 - 10 per cent of the total flux, and its spectrum is dominated by a
Balmer jump and strong lines in emission. Broad absorption bands, possibly due
to Fe II, are present in the spectra of the disk side farther away from the
secondary star, suggesting it arises from absorption by a extended gas region
above the disk; the differences between the spectra of the hemisphere farther
from and nearer to the secondary star are interpreted in terms of chromospheric
emission from a disc with a non-negligible opening angle (limb brightening
effect). Stellar atmosphere model fits to the extracted white dwarf spectrum
lead to a temperature $T_{WD}= 9500 ^{+2900}_{-1900} K$ and a distance of $d =
67 ^{+22}_{-25} pc$ if the inner disk is opaque, or $d = 92 ^{+30}_{-35} pc$ if
the inner disk is optically thin.

physical processes that influence star formation (SF). MC formation appears to
occur during large-scale compression of the diffuse ISM driven by supernovae,
magnetorotational instability, or gravitational instability in galactic disks
of stars and gas. The compressions generate turbulence that can accelerate
molecule production and produce the observed morphology. We then review the
properties of MC turbulence, including density enhancements observed as clumps
and cores, magnetic field structure, driving scales, the relation to observed
scaling relations, and the interaction with gas thermodynamics. We argue that
MC cores are dynamical, not quasistatic, objects with relatively short
lifetimes not exceeding a few megayears. We review their morphology, magnetic
fields, density and velocity profiles, and virial budget. Next, we discuss how
MC turbulence controls SF. On global scales turbulence prevents monolithic
collapse of the clouds; on small scales it promotes local collapse. We discuss
its effects on the SF efficiency, and critically examine the possible relation
between the clump mass distribution and the initial mass function, and then
turn to the redistribution of angular momentum during collapse and how it
determines the multiplicity of stellar systems. Finally, we discuss the
importance of dynamical interactions between protostars in dense clusters, and
the effect of the ionization and winds from those protostars on the surrounding
cloud. We conclude that the interaction of self-gravity and turbulence controls
MC formation and behavior, as well as the core and star formation processes
within them.

emission features near 117 nm in the solar spectrum. They discuss the observed
properties of these features in detail but do not identify the source of this
emission.
  We show that the broad autoionizing transitions of neutral sulfur are
responsible for these emission features. Autoionizing lines of \ion{S}{i} occur
throughout the spectrum between Lyman alpha and the Lyman limit. Sulfur is a
normal contributor to stellar spectra.
  We use non-LTE chromospheric model calculations with line data from the
Kurucz 2004 \ion{S}{i} line list to simulate the solar spectrum in the range
116 to 118 nm. We compare the results with SUMER disk-center observations from
Curdt et al. and limb observations from Wilhelm et al.
  Our calculations generally agree with the SUMER observations of the broad
autoionizing \ion{S}{i} emission features, the narrow \ion{S}{i} emission
lines, and the continuum in this wavelength region, and agree with basic
characteristics of the center-to-limb observations. In addition to modeling the
average spectrum, we show that a change of $\pm$ 200 K in the temperature
distribution causes the intensity to change by a factor of 4. This exceeds the
observed intensity variations 1) with time in quiet regions at these
wavelengths, and 2) with position from cell centers to bright network. These
results do not seem compatible with current dynamical models that have temporal
variations of 1000 K or more in the low chromosphere.

evolution of the electron spectrum. We assume that all investigated spectra are
generated inside a spherical, homogeneous source and also analyse the
synchrotron and inverse Compton emission generated by such an object. The
stochastic acceleration is treated as the diffusion of the particle momentum
and is described by the momentum-diffusion equation. We investigate the
stationary and time dependent solutions of the equation for several different
evolutionary scenarios. The scenarios are divided into two general classes.
First, we analyse a few cases without injection or escape of the particles
during the evolution. Then we investigate the scenarios where we assume
continuous injection and simultaneous escape of the particles. In the case of
no injection and escape the acceleration process, competing with the radiative
cooling, only modifies the initial particle spectrum. The competition leads to
a thermal or quasi-thermal distribution of the particle energy. In the case of
the injection and simultaneous escape the resulting spectra depend mostly on
the energy distribution of the injected particles. In the simplest case, where
the particles are injected at the lowest possible energies, the competition
between the acceleration and the escape forms a power-law energy distribution.
We apply our modeling to the high energy activity of the blazar Mrk 501
observed in April 1997. Calculating the evolution of the electron spectrum
self-consistently we can reproduce the observed spectra well with a number of
free parameters that is comparable to or less than in the ""classic stationary""
one--zone synchrotron self-Compton scenario.

of Niemiec & Ostrowski (2004, 2006) has been augmented here by a
large-amplitude short-wave downstream component, imitating that generated by
plasma instabilities at the shock front. Following Niemiec & Ostrowski (2006),
we have considered ultrarelativistic shocks with the mean magnetic field
oriented both oblique and parallel to the shock normal. For both cases
simulations have been performed for different choices of magnetic field
perturbations, represented by various wave power spectra within a wide
wavevector range. The results show that the introduction of the short-wave
component downstream of the shock is not sufficient to produce power-law
particle spectra with the ""universal"" spectral index 4.2. On the contrary,
concave spectra with cutoffs are preferentially formed, the curvature and
cutoff energy being dependent on the properties of turbulence. Our results
suggest that the electromagnetic emission observed from astrophysical sites

state and presents a steep X-ray spectrum, while in all the other epochs it is
faint and the spectrum is hard. The soft X-ray spectrum appears to be strongly
absorbed, likely by the intervening system at z=0.524, which also absorbs the
optical-UV radiation. We find that models that consider spectral curvature are
superior to single power law ones in fitting the X-ray spectrum. In particular,
we favour a double power law model, which agrees with the assumption of a
superposition of two different components in the X-ray domain. Both in the
Chandra and in one of the XMM-Newton observations, a tentative detection of the
redshifted Fe Kalpha emission line may suggest its origin from the inner part
of an accretion disc. Thermal emission from this accretion disc might explain
the UV-soft-X-ray bump that appears in the spectral energy distributions, when
the X-ray spectra are complemented with the optical-UV data from the Optical
Monitor onboard XMM-Newton. More likely, the bump can be interpreted in terms
of an additional synchrotron component emitted from an inner region of the jet
with respect to that where the lower-energy emission comes from. An inspection
of the X-ray light curves reveals that intraday variability occurs only when
the source is in a bright state.

shown that they are 100-1000 times larger than expected for standard pulsar
slowdown low. Moreover, the second derivatives as well as braking indices are
even negative for about half of pulsars. We explain these paradoxical results
on the basis of the statistical analysis of the rotational parameters $\nu$,
$\dot \nu$ and $\ddot \nu$ of the subset of 295 pulsars taken mostly from the
ATNF database. We have found strong correlation of $\ddot \nu$ and $\dot \nu$
either for $\ddot\nu > 0$ (correlation coefficient $r\approx0.9$) and $\ddot\nu
< 0$ ($r\approx0.85$), and of $\nu$ and $\dot\nu$ ($r\approx0.7$). We interpret
these dependencies as evolutionary ones due to $\dot\nu$ being nearly
proportional to characteristic age $\tau_{ch}$. The derived statistical
relations as well as ""anomalous"" values of $\ddot\nu$ are well explained in the
framework of the simple model of cyclic evolution of the rotational frequency
of the pulsars. It combines the secular change of $\nu_{tr}(t)$,
$\dot\nu_{tr}(t)$ and $\ddot\nu_{tr}(t)$ according to the power law with
$n\approx5$ and harmonic oscillations of 100--1000 years period with an
amplitude from $10^{-3}$ Hz for young pulsars to $10^{-10}$ Hz for elder ones.
The physical nature of these cyclic variations of the rotational frequency may
be similar to the well-known red timing noise, however, with much larger

indicate the presence (or absence) of a core of solid material, which in turn
would speak to the canonical formation model of gas accretion onto a core of
ice and rock embedded in a protoplanetary disk. Furthermore, the radii of
planets in close proximity to their stars are affected by tidal effects and the
intense stellar radiation. As a result, some of these ""hot Jupiters"" are
significantly larger than Jupiter in radius. Precision follow-up studies of
such objects (notably with the space-based platforms of the Hubble and Spitzer

surrounding red giant and supergiant stars, a concept known as a MOLsphere.
Spectroscopic and interferometric analyses have often corroborated this general
picture. Here, we present high-resolution spectroscopic data of pure rotational
lines of water vapor at 12 microns for the supergiant mu Cephei. This star has
often been used to test the concept of molecular layers around supergiants.
Given the prediction of an isothermal, optically thick water-vapor layer in
Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium around the star (MOLsphere), we expected the 12
micron lines to be in emission or at least in absorption but filled in by
emission from the molecular layer around the star. Our data, however, show the
contrary; we find definite absorption. Thus, our data do not easily fit into
the suggested isothermal MOLsphere scenario. The 12 micron lines, therefore,
put new, strong constraints on the MOLsphere concept and on the nature of water
seen in signatures across the spectra of early M supergiants. We also find that
the absorption is even stronger than that calculated from a standard,
spherically symmetric model photosphere without any surrounding layers. A cool
model photosphere, representing cool outer layers is, however, able to
reproduce the lines, but this model does not account for water vapor emission
at 6 microns. Thus, a unified model for water vapor on mu Cephei appears to be
lacking. It does seem necessary to model the underlying photospheres of these
supergiants in their whole complexity. The strong water vapor lines clearly
reveal inadequacies of classical model atmospheres.

and phase-angle) with that for the Galactic interstellar dust and HI gas; (iii)
the Sun seems not to fall on the line of nodes. The stellar warp phase-angle

coincidence with the Southern stellar maximum warp occurring near l=240. We
present evidence to conclude that all observed parameters (e.g. number density,
radial velocities, proper motion etc) of CMa are consistent with it being a
normal Milky Way outer-disk population, thereby leaving no justification for a
more complex interpretations of its origin. The present analysis does not

large variety of emission features of the HI and HeI recombination and CO

rate value is derived along with other parameters whose values are typical of
an accreting T Tauri star. In addition, we have used X-ray data from the XMM

parameters which confirm the T Tauri nature of the source. In the near-IR the

confirming that variable extinction does not contribute to brightness
variations. The lack of both a significant amount of circumstellar material and
any evidence of IR cooling from collimated jet/outflow driven by the source,

accretion onto the relativistic star (most likely a black hole), which has lead

are determined by their interaction with the disk wind. The precession of the
disk and jets, as well as the eclipsing in the binary system, make SS433 a
unique laboratory for studies of mechanisms for the microquasar phenomenon.
Essentially all photometric and spectroscopic properties of SS433 are
determined by the accretion disk and its orientation, but the disk itself is
not observed, being located beneath the photosphere of the dense wind.
Observational manifestations of the wind and of gas flows in the system are

depth in the disk of a spiral galaxy. Another way to estimate the quantity of
dust in a spiral disk is the ""Synthetic Field Method"" (SFM, Gonzalez et al.

the nearby spiral. The optical depth estimated from this method can be compared
to the values derived from the FIR emission. Since the two techniques depend on
different assumptions regarding the dust geometry and emissivity, this
comparison between the optical depth profiles can potentially shed light on the
structure and quantity of the ISM in spiral disks, especially any colder

appears to be predominantly cold (T < 20 K.). The differences between the

reviews the current status of the field, concentrating on the first two, more

provided by Mn, which makes the systems particularly favorable for realizing

the perspective provided by the nanosciences. It is shown how the properties of
relaxation toward a state of equilibrium can be derived from Liouville's
equation for Hamiltonian dynamical systems. The relaxation rates can be
conceived in terms of the so-called Pollicott-Ruelle resonances. In spatially
extended systems, the transport coefficients can also be obtained from the
Pollicott-Ruelle resonances. The Liouvillian eigenstates associated with these
resonances are in general singular and present fractal properties. The singular
character of the nonequilibrium states is shown to be at the origin of the
positive entropy production of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Furthermore,
large-deviation dynamical relationships are obtained which relate the transport
properties to the characteristic quantities of the microscopic dynamics such as
the Lyapunov exponents, the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy per unit time, and the
fractal dimensions. We show that these large-deviation dynamical relationships
belong to the same family of formulas as the fluctuation theorem, as well as a
new formula relating the entropy production to the difference between an
entropy per unit time of Kolmogorov-Sinai type and a time-reversed entropy per
unit time. The connections to the nonequilibrium work theorem and the transient
fluctuation theorem are also discussed. Applications to nanosystems are
described.

Based on this fact, the complete set of critical exponents characteristic of a
second-order phase transition was evaluated. Also, the dynamic exponent $\theta

$z$ shows a systematic decrease when the segmentation step is increased, i.e.,

smaller than the Hausdorff dimension. Even when the behavior of the

autocorrelation (in the case of the disordered initial state) with time are

traveling fronts with steep gradients. However, the governing Gross-Pitaevskii
(GP) equation that describes the mean field of a BEC admits no dissipation
hence classical dissipative shock solutions do not explain the phenomena.
Instead, wave dynamics with small dispersion is considered and it is shown that
this provides a mechanism for the generation of a dispersive shock wave (DSW).
Computations with the GP equation are compared to experiment with excellent
agreement. A comparison between a canonical 1D dissipative and dispersive shock
problem shows significant differences in shock structure and shock front speed.
Numerical results associated with the three dimensional experiment show that

Here, we report on electronic Raman scattering results, which show that the gap
function in the underdoped regime is characterized by two energy scales,
depending on doping in opposite manners. Their ratios to the maximum critical
temperature are found to be universal in cuprates. Our experimental results
also reveal two different quasiparticle dynamics in the underdoped
superconducting state, associated with two regions of momentum space: nodal
regions near the zeros of the superconducting gap and antinodal regions. While
antinodal quasiparticles quickly loose coherence as doping is reduced, coherent
nodal quasiparticles persist down to low doping levels. A theoretical analysis
using a new sum-rule allows us to relate the low-frequency-dependence of the
Raman response to the temperature-dependence of the superfluid density, both

transferability of the parameters is investigated applying them to different

quantitatively with DFT-GW calculations and PES/IPES experiments demonstrating
their robustness to environmental changes. We further apply the silicon

compute the fluid permeabilities of these and other triply periodic
bicontinuous structures at a porosity $\phi=1/2$ using the immersed boundary
finite volume method. The other triply periodic porous media that we study
include the Schoen gyroid (G) minimal surface, two different pore-channel

cubic lattice. We find that the Schwartz P porous medium has the largest fluid
permeability among all of the six triply periodic porous media considered in

the corresponding specific surfaces for these structures. This leads to the
conjecture that the maximal fluid permeability for a triply periodic porous

by the structure that globally minimizes the specific surface.

such restrictions, and allow for possible occurrence highly general
relativistic regime, z >> 1, we show that, it is possible to have radiation
pressure supported stars at arbitrary value of M. Since radiation pressure
supported stars necessarily radiate at the Eddington limit, in Einstein
gravity, they are never in strict hydrodynamical equilibrium. Further, it is
believed that sufficiently massive or dense objects undergo continued
gravitational collapse to the Black Hole stage characterized by z =infty. Thus,
late stages of Black Hole formation, by definition, will have, z >> 1, and
hence would be examples of quasi-stable general relativistic RPSSs. This result
is also supported by with our previous finding that that trapped surfaces are
not formed in gravitational collapse and the value of the integration constant
in the vacuum Schwarzschild solution is zero. Hence the supposed observed BHs
are actually ECOs.

two components -- a soft Pomeron Regge pole for the tensor glueball, and a hard
BFKL Pomeron in leading order at weak coupling. On the basis of gauge/string
duality, we present a coherent treatment of the Pomeron. In large-N QCD-like
theories, we use curved-space string-theory to describe simultaneously both the
BFKL regime and the classic Regge regime. The problem reduces to finding the
spectrum of a single j-plane Schrodinger operator. For ultraviolet-conformal
theories, the spectrum exhibits a set of Regge trajectories at positive t, and
a leading j-plane cut for negative t, the cross-over point being
model-dependent. For theories with logarithmically-running couplings, one
instead finds a discrete spectrum of poles at all t, where the Regge
trajectories at positive t continuously become a set of slowly-varying and
closely-spaced poles at negative t. Our results agree with expectations for the
BFKL Pomeron at negative t, and with the expected glueball spectrum at positive
t, but provide a framework in which they are unified. Effects beyond the single
Pomeron exchange are briefly discussed.

zero as $p^2$ increases to the discretization scale $1/a^2$ and remains zero

decreases upto a certain value of $\alpha'$ and then increases with $\alpha'$

are useful for integrating natural cohomology classes on $\bar{\mathfrak

to compute the genus-one Gromov-Witten invariants of complete intersections and
classical enumerative invariants of projective spaces involving genus-one

obtained by sequentially blowing up $\bar{\mathfrak M}_{1,k}(\Bbb{P}^n,d)$
along ``bad'' subvarieties. At the end of the process, we are left with a
modification of the main component, which turns out to be nonsingular.

q such that x is covered by occurrences of q (such a q is called a quasiperiod
of x). Using the notion of derivation, we show that this definition is not
sufficient to imply any symmetry in an infinite word. Therefore we introduce
multi-scale quasiperiodic words, i.e. quasiperiodic words that admit an
infinite number of quasiperiods. Such words are uniformly recurrent, this
allows us to study the subshift they generate. We prove that multi-scale
quasiperiodic subshifts are uniquely ergodic and have zero topological entropy
as well as zero Kolmogorov complexity. Sturmian subshifts are shown to be
multi-scale quasiperiodic.

protein domain sequences coming from two families of the Pfam database are
significantly different. We model protein sequences as realizations of Variable
Length Markov Chains (VLMC) and we use the context trees as a signature of each
protein family. Our approach is based on a Kolmogorov--Smirnov-type
goodness-of-fit test proposed by Balding et al. [Limit theorems for sequences
of random trees (2008), DOI: 10.1007/s11749-008-0092-z]. The test statistic is
a supremum over the space of trees of a function of the two samples; its
computation grows, in principle, exponentially fast with the maximal number of
nodes of the potential trees. We show how to transform this problem into a
max-flow over a related graph which can be solved using a Ford--Fulkerson
algorithm in polynomial time on that number. We apply the test to 10 randomly
chosen protein domain families from the seed of Pfam-A database (high quality,
manually curated families). The test shows that the distributions of context
trees coming from different families are significantly different. We emphasize
that this is a novel mathematical approach to validate the automatic clustering
of sequences in any context. We also study the performance of the test via
simulations on Galton--Watson related processes.

and its impact on particle physics. The point of departure is a historical
review of four decades of string theory within the broader context of six
decades of failed attempts at an autonomous S-matrix approach to particle
theory. The central message, contained in sections 5 and 6, is that string
theory is not what its name suggests, namely a theory of of objects in
spacetime whose localization is string- instead of point-like. Contrary to
popular opinion the oscillators corresponding to the Fourier models of a
quantum mechanical string do not cause a stringlike spatial extension of the
object under discussion and neither does the ""range space"" of a chiral
conformal QFT acquire the interpretation of string-like localized quantum
matter. Rather the superstring represents a solution of a problem which enjoyed
some popularity in the 60s: the construction of infinite component wave
function with a (realistic) mass/spin spectrum. The mass/spin tower ""sits"" over
one point and does not arise from a string in spacetime. The widespread
acceptance of a theory whose interpretation has been based on metaphoric
reasoning had a corroding influence on particle theory, a point which will be
illustrated in the last section with some remarks of a more sociological
nature.

but addressable. The major challenge is that such breakthroughs are still only
notional concepts rather than being specific methods from which performance can
be rigorously quantified. A recent assessment by Tajmar and Bertolami used the
rocket equation to correct naive misconceptions, but a more fundamental
analysis requires the use of energy as the basis for comparison. The energy of
a rocket is compared to an idealized space drive for the following cases:
Earth-to-orbit, interstellar transit, and levitation. The space drive uses 3.6
times less energy for Earth to orbit. For deep space travel, space drive energy
scales as the square of delta-v, while rocket energy scales exponentially. This
has the effect of rendering a space drive 150-orders-of-magnitude better than a
17,000-sec Specific Impulse rocket for sending a modest 5000 kg probe to
traverse 5 light-years in 50 years. Indefinite levitation, which is impossible
for a rocket, could conceivably require 62 MJ/kg for a space drive. Assumption
sensitivities and further analysis options are listed to guide further

estimate the effect of magnetic substrates on the achievable impedance
bandwidth. Microwave composites filled with thin ferromagnetic films are
considered as a prospective antenna substrate. We calculate the impedance
bandwidth for a $\lambda/2$-patch antenna loaded with the proposed substrate,

with the proposed substrate even in the presence of realistic losses. Estimates
for the radiation efficiency are given as a function of the magnetic loss

Despite structural peculiarities of the fetal cardiovascular system, the fetal

tissues and its interaction with other neural controllers. In this paper, we
investigate the event and time scale characteristics of the normal and two

Unit Time Block Entropy(UTBE), which approximates the entropy at each event and
time scale based on symbolic dynamics. This method enables us to match the

also find that in the large event scale and the small time scale, the presumed

scalable quantum computing. Recently various schemes have been proposed for

tolerate these error types we cause an exponential blow-out in depolarizing
noise. We discuss several examples and propose techniques for minimizing this
problem. In general this introduces a tradeoff with other undesirable effects.
In some cases this is physical resource requirements, while in others it is
noise rates.

classical algorithms, of having a fixed-point, i.e. a monotonic convergence
towards the solution. Here we present two variations of the quantum search
algorithm, which get around this limitation. The first replaces selective
inversions in the algorithm by selective phase shifts of $\frac{\pi}{3}$. The
second controls the selective inversion operations using two ancilla qubits,
and irreversible measurement operations on the ancilla qubits drive the
starting state towards the target state. Using $q$ oracle queries, these
variations reduce the probability of finding a non-target state from $\epsilon$
to $\epsilon^{2q+1}$, which is asymptotically optimal. Similar ideas can lead
to robust quantum algorithms, and provide conceptually new schemes for error
correction.

whether every classical protocol may be transformed to a ``simpler'' quantum
protocol--one that has similar efficiency, but uses fewer message exchanges.
  We show that for any constant k, there is a problem such that its k+1 message
classical communication complexity is exponentially smaller than its k message
quantum communication complexity. This, in particular, proves a round hierarchy
theorem for quantum communication complexity, and implies, via a simple
reduction, an Omega(N^{1/k}) lower bound for k message quantum protocols for
Set Disjointness for constant k.
