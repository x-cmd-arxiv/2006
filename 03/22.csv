brighter than 15.9 mag in the r-band and below redshift ~ 0.1, and so can be
reliably classified morphologically. We find that the fractions of
interacting/merging and spiral galaxies are ~ 48% and ~ 40% respectively. Our
results complement and confirm the decline (increase) in the fraction of spiral
(interacting/merging) galaxies from z ~1 to z ~ 0.1, as found by Melbourne, Koo

indicating that bars may play an important role in triggering star formation
rates > 20 M_{sun}/yr in the local universe. Compared with high redshift LIRGs,
local LIRGs have lower specific star formation rates, smaller cold gas
fractions and a narrower range of stellar masses. Local LIRGs appear to be
either merging galaxies forming intermediate mass ellipticals or spiral
galaxies undergoing high star formation activities regulated by bars.

[$\alpha$/Fe], [Ba/Fe] and [Eu/Fe], and the metallicity distribution of stars
are compared to the predictions of our models adopting the observationally
derived star formation histories in these galaxies. These new comparisons
confirm our previously suggested scenario for the evolution of these galaxies,
and allow us to better fix the star formation and wind parameters. In
particular, for Carina the comparisons indicate that the best efficiency of
star formation is $\nu = 0.15 Gyr^{-1}$, that the best wind efficiency
parameter is $w_i$ = 5 (the wind rate is five times stronger than the star
formation rate), and that the star formation history, which produces the best
fit to the observed metallicity distribution of stars is characterized by
several episodes of activity. In the case of Sagittarius our results suggest
that $\nu=3 Gyr^{-1}$ and $w_i=9$, again in agreement with our previous work.
Finally, we show new predictions for [N/Fe] and [C/Fe] ratios for the two
galaxies suggesting a scenario for Sagittarius very similar to the one of the
solar vicinity in the Milky Way, except for a slight decrease of [N/Fe] ratio
at high metallicities due to the galactic wind. For Carina we predict a larger
[N/Fe] ratio at low metallicities, reflecting the lower star formation
efficiency of this galaxy relative to Sagittarius and the Milky Way.

responsible for the clump mass functions that have been observed in several
regions of embedded star formation, which have been shown to be described by a
Salpeter type slope. The flows presented here, which comprise a population of
initially identical clumps and the calculations are performed with and without
the inclusion of self-gravity. When the shock region is at its densest, we find
that the clump mass spectrum is always well modelled by a Salpeter type slope.
This is true regardless of whether the self-gravity is included in the
simulations or not. In the non-self-gravitating simulations, this slope is
retained at lower Mach numbers (Mach 5 and 10) as the simulations progress past
the densest phase. In the simulations which include self-gravity, we find that
low Mach number runs yield a flatter mass function after the densest phase.
This is simply a result of increased coagulation due to gravitational collapse
of the flows. In the high Mach number runs (Mach 20) the Salpeter slope is
always lost. The self gravitating calculations also show that the sub-group of
gravitationally bound clumps in which star formation occurs, always contain the
most massive clumps in the population. The mass function of these bound star
forming clumps is not at all similar to the Salpeter type mass function
observed for stars in the field. We conclude that the clump mass function may
not only have nothing to do with gravity, but also nothing to do with the star
formation process and the resulting mass distribution of stars. This raises
doubt over the claims that the clump mass function is the origin of the stellar
IMF, for regions such as rho Oph, Serpens and the Orion B cloud.

emission on scales from 1 pc to several kpc is comparable to that of other
quasars, as expected by AGN unification schemes. The observed weakness of the
X-ray emission supports the hypothesis of a synchrotron self-Compton origin for
the jet component. There is a clear soft-excess and we find evidence for a very
broad iron line which could be emitted in a disk around a Kerr black hole.

using a few prominent emission lines. Various theoretical models have been used
to predict the relationship between emission line fluxes and metallicity,
suggesting that some line ratios can be used as diagnostics of the gas
metallicity in galaxies. However, accurate empirical calibrations of these
emission line flux ratios from real galaxy spectra spanning a wide metallicity
range are still lacking. In this paper we provide such empirical calibrations
by using the combination of two sets of spectroscopic data: one consisting of
low-metallicity galaxies with a measurement of [OIII]4363, and the other one
consisting of galaxies in the SDSS DR4 whose metallicity has been determined
from various strong emission lines in their spectra. This combined data set
constitutes the largest sample of galaxies with information on the gas
metallicity available so far and spanning the widest metallicity range. Our
empirical diagrams show that the line ratio [OIII]/[OII] is a useful tool to
break the degeneracy in the R_23 parameter when no information on the [NII]
line is available. The line ratio [NeIII]/[OII] also results to be a useful
metallicity indicator for high-z galaxies. Finally, we compare these empirical
relations with photoionization models. We find that the empirical
R_23-metallicity sequence is strongly discrepant with respect to the trend
expected by models with constant ionization parameter, which is interpreted as
a consequence of a strong metallicity dependence of the average ionization
parameter in galaxies. This result should warn about the use of theoretical
models with constant ionization parameter to infer metallicities from observed
line ratios. (abbreviated)

seamless tracking of the evolution of the H_2 gas phase, its precursor Cold

survey tools. The results presented here provided crucial supporting data used
by Cohen et al (2006) to derive the frequency of C-stars among EMP stars.
  C-enhancement in these EMP C-stars appears to be independent of
Fe-metallicity and approximately constant at ~1/5 the solar C/H. The mostly low
C12/C13 ratios (~4) and the high N abundances in many of these stars suggest
that material which has been through proton burning via the CN cycle comprises
most of the stellar envelope. C-enhancement is associated with strong
enrichment of heavy nuclei beyond the Fe-peak for 12 of the 16 stars. The
remaining C-stars from the HES, which tend to be the most Fe-metal poor, show
no evidence for enhancement of the heavy elements. Very high enhancements of
lead are detected in some of the C-stars with highly enhanced Ba. (We show
that) the s-process is responsible for the enhancement of the heavy elements
for the majority of the C-stars in our sample.
  We suggest that both the s-process rich and Ba-normal C-stars result from
phenomena associated with mass transfer in binary systems. This leads directly
to the progression from C-stars to CH stars and then to Ba stars as the
Fe-metallicity increases. (abridged and slightly edited to shorten)

gaseous disc around a supermassive black hole. We find that once the surface
density of the disc exceeds a critical value, the disc fragments into dense
clumps. The clumps accrete material from the remaining disc and merge into
larger clumps; the upper mass of a merged clump is a few tens to a few hundreds
of solar mass. This picture fits well with the observed young stellar discs
near the SgrA* black hole in the Galactic Center. In particular, we show how
the masses and spatial distribution of the young stars, and the total mass in
the Galactic Center discs can be explained. However, explaining the origin of
the several young stars closest to the black hole (the S-stars) is more
problematic: their orbits are compact, eccentric, and have random orientation.
We propose that the S-stars were born in a previous starburst(s), and then
migrated through their parent disc via type I or runaway migration. Their
orbits were then randomized by the Rauch-Tremaine resonant relaxation. We then
explore the consequences of the star-formation scenario for AGN discs, which
are continuously resupplied with gas. We argue that some compact remnants
generated by the starburst will get embedded in the disc. The disc-born
stellar-mass black holes will interact gravitationally with the massive
accretion disc and be dragged towards the central black hole. Merger of a
disc-born black hole with the central black hole will produce a burst of
gravitational waves. If the central black hole is accreting at a rate
comparable to the Eddington limit, the gas drag from the accretion disc will
not alter significantly the dynamics of the final year of merger, and the
gravitational waves should be observable by LISA.

exploiting any direct detection of fundamental tensor modes by a BBO-style

J0148.3--2758. It was observed for 41.6 ks in 2005 May and for 15.8 ks in 2005
December. On short as well as on long timescales RX J0148.3--2758 is a highly
variable source. It doubles its X-ray flux within 18-25 ks. The observation of
2005 December 09, which had a flux 4 times lower than during the 2005 May
observations, shows a significant hardening of the X-ray hardness ratio
compared with the 2005-May and 2005-December 20/21 observations. A detailed
analysis of the X-ray spectra shows that we actually observe two spectral
changes in RX J0148.3-2758: First a decrease of the soft X-ray component
between 2005 May and December 09, which is most likely due to an increase of
the intrinsic absorber column, and second a decrease of the hard X-ray flux in
the December 20/21 observations. The soft X-ray spectral slope $\alpha_{\rm X,
soft}$=2.58$^{+0.15}_{-0.12}$ during the high state in 2005 May agrees well
with that measured by ROSAT (\axs=2.54\plm0.82). In contrast to the strong
X-ray variability, the analysis of the Swift UVOT photometry from December 2005
of RX J0148.3--2758 shows no significant variability in any of the 6 UVOT
filters. From the simultaneous X-ray and UV observations in 2005 December we
measured the X-ray loudness alpha-ox varies between alpha-ox=1.5 and 1.8. Our

moderate-resolution optical spectrophotometry (4000-9000A) and broad-band
colors (V-R, V-K). The results from the dereddened V-R colors are in good
agreement with those derived from the spectrophotometry, but the dereddened V-K
colors give temperatures that are 3-4% warmer for the SMC data, with the LMC
and Milky Way showing a smaller but similar effect. We conclude that this
discrepancy is due to the limitations of 1D models. Our newly derived effective
temperatures and bolometric luminosities bring the Magellanic Cloud RSGs into
good agreement with stellar evolutionary models that include the effects of
rotation. A typical M2~I in the SMC is about 150 K cooler than its Galactic
counterpart; one in the LMC is about 50 K cooler. This is in the sense expected
due to the lower chemical abundances in the SMC and LMC, although it is not
sufficient to explain the shift in average RSG spectral type seen between the
SMC, LMC, and Milky Way. Instead, that is due primarily to the change in
Hayashi limit with metallicity, as first proposed by Elias et al. (1985).
Finally, our study confirms that many RSGs in the Magellanic Clouds are
significantly more reddened than OB stars, consistent with our recent findings
for Galactic stars that circumstellar dust may contribute several magnitudes of
extra visual extinction.

spectra from an ensemble of SNRs is calculated both in the inner (330<l<30) and

H$^{13}$CO$^+$ lines. A phenomenological model of prestellar core evolution, a
time-dependent chemical model, and a radiative transfer simulation for
molecular lines are combined to reconstruct the chemical and kinematical
structure of this core. We developed a general criterion that allows to
quantify the difference between observed and simulated spectral maps. By
minimizing this difference, we find that very high and very low values of the
effective sticking probability $S$ are not appropriate for the studied
prestellar core. The most probable $S$ value for CB17 is 0.3--0.5. The spatial
distribution of the intensities and self-absorption features of optically thick
lines is indicative of UV irradiation of the core. By fitting simultaneously
optically thin and optically thick transitions, we isolate the model that
reproduces all the available spectral maps to a reasonable accuracy. The line
asymmetry pattern in CB17 is reproduced by a combination of infall, rotation,
and turbulent motions with velocities $\sim0.05$ km s$^{-1}$, $\sim0.1$ km
s$^{-1}$, and $\sim0.1$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively. These parameters corresponds
to energy ratios $E_{\rm rot}/E_{\rm grav}\approx0.03$, $E_{\rm therm}/E_{\rm
grav}\approx0.8$, and $E_{\rm turb}/E_{\rm grav}\approx0.05$ (the rotation
parameters are determined for $i=90^\circ$). The chemical age of the core is
about 2 Myrs. In particular, this is indicated by the central depletion of CO,
CS, and HCO$^+$. Based on the angular momentum value, we argue that the core is
going to fragment, i.e., to form a binary (multiple) star. (abridged)

`top' of the horse's head, which we label B33-SMM1. We characterise the
physical parameters of the extended dust responsible for this emission, and
find that B33-SMM1 contains a more dense core than was previously suspected. We
compare the SCUBA data with data from the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) and
find that the emission at 6.75-\mum is offset towards the west, indicating that
the mid-infrared emission is tracing the PDR while the submillimetre emission
comes from the molecular cloud core behind the PDR. We calculate the virial
balance of this core and find that it is not gravitationally bound but is being
confined by the external pressure from the HII region IC434, and that it will
either be destroyed by the ionising radiation, or else may undergo triggered
star formation. Furthermore we find evidence for a lozenge-shaped clump in the
`throat' of the horse, which is not seen in emission at shorter wavelengths. We
label this source B33-SMM2 and find that it is brighter at submillimetre
wavelengths than B33-SMM1. SMM2 is seen in absorption in the 6.75-\mum ISO
data, from which we obtain an independent estimate of the column density in
excellent agreement with that calculated from the submillimetre emission. We
calculate the stability of this core against collapse and find that it is in
approximate gravitational virial equilibrium. This is consistent with it being
a pre-existing core in B33, possibly pre-stellar in nature, but that it may
also eventually undergo collapse under the effects of the HII region.

the faint end of the colour-magnitude relation is neither empty nor
underpopulated. The effect is quantified by the computation of the luminosity
function (LF) of red galaxies. We found a flat slope, showing that the
abundance of red galaxies is similar at faint and at intermediate magnitudes.
Comparison with present-day and z~0.4 LFs suggests that the slope of the LF is
not changed, within the errors, between z=0.831 and z=0. Therefore, the
analysis of the LF shows no evidence for a decreasing (with magnitude or
redshift) number of faint red galaxies. The presence of faint red galaxies in
high redshift clusters disfavours scenarios where the evolution of red galaxies
is mass-dependent, because the mass dependency should differentially
depauperate the red sequence, while the MS1054-0321 colour-magnitude relation
is populated as in nearby clusters and as in z~0.4 clusters. The presence of
abundant faint red galaxies in the high redshift cluster MS1054-0321 restricts
the room for allocating descendants of Butcher-Oemler galaxies, because they

idea that fossil groups are old galaxy systems with no recent mergers. However,
the diffuse X-ray emission shows signs of asymmetries in the core of the
system. With a mean gas temperature of ~ 4.0 keV and total gravitational mass
of 3.1 x 10^14 solar mass, within the virial radius, this is better described
as a fossil galaxy cluster rather than a fossil group. The temperature profile
shows no sign of a significant cooler core despite a cooling time dropping to 5
Gyr within the resolved core. We find a mass concentration parameter c_200 ~ 11
which is relatively high for a cluster of this mass, indicative of an early
formation epoch. Using the spectroscopically identified cluster members we
present the galaxy luminosity function for this fossil system. We measure the
velocity dispersion of the galaxies to be ~ 700 km/s based on 18 confirmed
members. The dynamical mass is nearly twice the total gravitational mass

these sources are carbon stars. An examination of the near- and mid-infrared
photometry shows that the carbon-rich and oxygen-rich dust sources follow two
easily separated sequences. A comparison of the spectra of the 19 carbon stars
in the SMC to spectra from the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) of carbon stars
in the Galaxy reveals significant differences. The absorption bands at 7.5 um
and 13.7 um due to C2H2 are stronger in the SMC sample, and the SiC dust
emission feature at 11.3 um is weaker. Our measurements of the MgS dust
emission feature at 26-30 um are less conclusive, but this feature appears to
be weaker in the SMC sample as well. All of these results are consistent with
the lower metallicity in the SMC. The lower abundance of SiC grains in the SMC
may result in less efficient carbon-rich dust production, which could explain
the excess C2H2 gas seen in the spectra. The sources in the SMC with the
strongest SiC dust emission tend to have redder infrared colors than the other
sources in the sample, which implies more amorphous carbon, and they also tend
to show stronger MgS dust emission. The weakest SiC emission features tend to

Lawrence et al. (2006), being undertaken with the UK Infra-red Telescope
(UKIRT) Wide Field Camera (WFCAM). The programme began in May 2005 and has an
expected duration of seven years. Each survey uses some or all of the broadband
filter complement ZYJHK. The EDR is the first public release of data to the
European Southern Observatory (ESO) community. All worldwide releases occur
after a delay of 18 months from the ESO release. The EDR provides a small
sample dataset, ~50 sq.deg (about 1% of the whole of UKIDSS), that is a lower
limit to the expected quality of future survey data releases. In addition, an
EDR+ dataset contains all EDR data plus extra data of similar quality, but for
areas not observed in all of the required filters (amounting to ~220 sq.deg).
The first large data release, DR1, will occur in mid-2006. We provide details
of the observational implementation, the data reduction, the astrometric and
photometric calibration, and the quality control procedures. We summarise the
data coverage and quality (seeing, ellipticity, photometricity, depth) for each
survey and give a brief guide to accessing the images and catalogues from the
WFCAM Science Archive.

that such distortions may coexist with long range magnetic order, in contrast
to the one-dimensional case. Similarly, the coupling to Einstein phonons is
found to reduce, but not to eliminate the staggered magnetic moment. In
addition, we consider the renormalization of the square lattice phonon spectrum
due to spin-phonon coupling in the adiabatic approximation. Towards low
temperatures significant softening mainly of zone boundary phonons is found,
especially around the $(\pi,0)$ point of the Brillouin zone. This result is
compatible with the tendency to plaquette formation in the static limit. We
also point out the importance of a ""magnetic pressure"" on the lattice due to
spin-phonon coupling. At low temperatures, this results in a tendency towards
shear instabilities of the lattice.

organization. This model doesn't scale well when there is tight integration of
multiple hierarchies. In a case where there is joint-tenancy and a requirement
for different levels of disclosure based upon a user's hierarchy, or in our
case, organization or company, basic RBAC requires these hierarchies to be
effectively merged. Specific roles that effectively represent both the user's
organizations and roles must be translated to fit within the merged hierarchy
to be used to control access. Essentially, users from multiple organizations
are served from a single role base with roles designed to constrain their
access as needed.
  Our work proposes, through parameterized roles and privileges, a means for
accurately representing both users' roles within their respective hierarchies
for providing access to controlled objects. Using this method will reduce the
amount of complexity required in terms of the number of roles and privileges.
The resulting set of roles, privileges, and objects will make modeling and
visualizing the access role hierarchy significantly simplified. This paper will
give some background on role based access control, parameterized roles and
privileges, and then focus on how RBAC with parameterized roles and privileges
can be leveraged as an access control solution for the problems presented by
joint tenancy.

constant Lambda_0, Lambda_eff = 0 is an attractor of the semiclassical Einstein

The X-product equals twice the parallelizing torsion, given by the torsion

also been used to obtain triality maps and G2 actions, and it leads naturally
to remarkable geometric and topological properties, for instance the Hopf

octonions in the search for unification is based, for instance, in the fact
that by extending the division-algebra-valued superalgebras to octonions, in

velocity $\Omega(r)$ are obtained analytically. First, a necessary instability
criterion for centrifugal flows is derived as $\xi'(\Omega-\Omega_s)<0$ (or
$\xi'/(\Omega-\Omega_s)<0$) somewhere in the flow field, where $\xi$ is the
vorticitiy of profile and $\Omega_s$ is the angular velocity at the inflection
point $\xi'=0$. Second, a criterion for stability is found as
$-(\mu_1+1/r_2)<f(r)=\frac{\xi'}{\Omega-\Omega_s}<0$, where $\mu_1$ is the
smallest eigenvalue. The new criteria are the analogues of the criteria for
parallel flows, which are special cases of Arnol'd's nonlinear criteria.
Specifically, Pedley's cirterion is proved to be an special case of Rayleigh's
criterion. Moreover, the criteria for parallel flows can also be derived from
those for the rotating flows. These results extend the previous theorems and
would intrigue future research on the mechanism of hydrodynamic instability.

the same parameter set is linked to the birefringent nature of the medium

regulator of cellular growth and differentiation. The principal intracellular
mediators of TGF-beta signalling are the Smad proteins, which upon TGF-beta
stimulation accumulate in the nucleus and regulate transcription of target
genes. To investigate the mechanisms of Smad nuclear accumulation, we developed
a simple mathematical model of canonical Smad signalling. The model was built
using both published data and our experimentally determined cellular Smad
concentrations (isoforms 2, 3, and 4). We found in mink lung epithelial cells
that Smad2 (8.5-12 x 10^4 molecules/cell) was present in similar amounts to
Smad4 (9.3-12 x 10^4 molecules/cell), while both were in excess of Smad3
(1.1-2.0 x 10^4 molecules/cell). Variation of the model parameters and
statistical analysis showed that Smad nuclear accumulation is most sensitive to
parameters affecting the rates of RSmad phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
and Smad complex formation/dissociation in the nucleus. Deleting Smad4 from the
model revealed that rate-limiting phospho-R-Smad dephosphorylation could be an
important mechanism for Smad nuclear accumulation. Furthermore, we observed
that binding factors constitutively localised to the nucleus do not efficiently
mediate Smad nuclear accumulation if dephosphorylation is rapid. We therefore
conclude that an imbalance in the rates of R-Smad phosphorylation and
dephosphorylation is likely an important mechanism of Smad nuclear accumulation
during TGF-beta signalling.

motion and internal dynamics to obtain analytic expressions for the optical

frequencies where the light field extracts kinetic energy from the atomic
motion, the dynamics combines optical lasing and motional cooling. From the
corresponding momentum diffusion coefficient we predict sub-Doppler
temperatures in the stationary state. This generalizes the theory of cavity
enhanced laser cooling to active cavity systems. We identify the gain induced
reduction of the effective resonator linewidth as key origin for the faster
cooling and lower temperatures, which implys that a bad cavity with a gain
medium can replace a high-Q cavity. In addition, this shows the importance of
light forces for gas lasers in the low-temperature limit, where atoms can
arrange in a periodic pattern maximizing gain and counteracting spatial hole
burning. Ultimately, in the low temperature limit, such a setup should allow to
combine optical lasing and atom lasing in single device.

suitably choose the parameters of the beam, a mean-square phase uncertainty
scaling as (N/kappa)^{-5/8} is possible, where kappa is the linewidth of the
beam resulting from the fluctuating phase. This is an improvement over the
(N/kappa)^{-1/2} scaling found previously for coherent beams. In the

possible, the variance will be reduced below that for coherent beams, though
the scaling is unchanged.
