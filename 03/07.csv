degrees of deuterium fractionation in molecules are observed in star forming
regions with enhancements that can reach 13 orders of magnitude, which current
models have difficulties to account for.
  Aims : Multi-isotopologue observations are a very powerful constraint for
chemical models. The aim of our observations is to understand the processes
forming the observed large abundances of methanol and formaldehyde in low-mass
protostellar envelopes (gas-phase processes ? chemistry on the grain surfaces
?) and better constrain the chemical models. Methods : Using the IRAM 30m
single-dish telescope, we observed deuterated formaldehyde (HDCO and D2CO) and
methanol (CH2DOH, CH3OD, and CHD2OH) towards a sample of seven low-mass class 0
protostars. Using population diagrams, we then derive the fractionation ratios
of these species (abundance ratio between the deuterated molecule and its main
isotopologue) and compare them to the predictions of grain chemistry models.
Results : These protostars show a similar level of deuteration as in
IRAS16293-2422, where doubly-deuterated methanol -- and even triply-deuterated
methanol -- were first detected. Our observations point to the formation of
methanol on the grain surfaces, while formaldehyde formation cannot be fully
pined down. While none of the scenarii can be excluded (gas-phase or grain
chemistry formation), they both seem to require abstraction reactions to
reproduce the observed fractionations.

  A*","15 pages 4 figures","2006, ApJ, 648, 1020","10.1086/506194",,"astro-ph",,"  The near-IR and X-ray flares in Sagittarius A* are believed to be produced by
relativistic electrons via synchrotron and synchrotron self-Comptonization,
respectively. These electrons are likely energized by turbulent plasma waves
through second-order Fermi acceleration that, in combination with the radiative
cooling processes, produces a relativistic Maxwellian distribution in the
steady state. This model has four principal parameters, namely the magnetic
field B, the electron density n and temperature \gamma_c mec2, and the size of
the flare region R. In the context of stochastic acceleration, the quantities
Rn^1/2B and \gamma_cRn should remain nearly constant in time. Therefore,
simultaneous spectroscopic observations in the NIR and X-ray bands can readily
test the model, which, if proven to be valid, may be used to determine the
evolution of the plasma properties during an eruptive event with spectroscopic
observations in either band or simultaneous flux density measurements in both
bands. The formulae can be applied to other isolated or confined systems, where
electrons are accelerated to relativistic energies by plasma wave turbulence
and produce most of the emission via synchrotron processes.

magnetic field in a small accretion torus appears to be the likely mechanism
responsible for much of Sagittarius A*'s millimeter and shorter wavelength
spectrum. The longer wavelength radiation is produced at larger radii by
electrons either diffusing from smaller scales or accelerated in situ. An
important prediction of this model is the ejection of a significant flux of
relativistic protons from a magnetic-field-dominated acceleration site into the
wind-shocked medium surrounding the black hole. Recently, several air Cerenkov
telescopes, notably HESS, have detected TeV emission from the Galactic center,
with characteristics hinting at a p-p-induced pion decay process for the
\gamma-ray emission. Given (1) the size of this acceleration region measured in
the radio band and (2) the wind-injected ISM mapped with Chandra using the
diffuse X-rays, it is feasible to test the idea that protons accelerated within
\~20 Schwarzschild radii of the black hole produce the TeV emission farther
out. We show a fraction of TeV protons scattering about once within ~3 pc of
Sagittarius A* and the proton power (~10^37 erg s^-1) produced in concert with
the 7 mm radio emission matches the TeV luminosity well. This model explains
why the TeV source does not vary on a timescale of a year or less. The particle
cascade generated by the p-p scatterings also produces bremsstrahlung, inverse
Compton, and synchrotron emission at longer wavelengths from secondary
particles. We compare these with current measurements and demonstrate that
GLAST will detect this source during its one-year all-sky survey.

the goal of discerning the cluster's formation mechanism. Outside of the
Trapezium, the distribution of stellar masses is remarkably uniform, and is not
accurately described by the field-star initial mass function. The deconvolved,
three-dimensional density of cluster members peaks at the Trapezium stars,
which are truly anomalous in mass. Using theoretical pre-main-sequence tracks,
we confirm the earlier finding that star formation has accelerated over the
past 10 Myr. We further show that the rate of acceleration has been the same
for all masses. Thus, there is no correlation between stellar age and mass,
contrary to previous claims. Finally, the acceleration has been spatially
uniform throughout the cluster. Our reconstruction of the parent molecular
cloud spawning the cluster shows that it had a mass of 6700 solar masses prior
to its destruction by the Trapezium. If the cloud was supported against
self-gravity by mildly dissipative turbulence, then it contracted in a
quasi-static, but accelerating manner. We demonstrate this contraction
theoretically through a simple energy argument. The mean turbulent speed
increased to its recent value, which is reflected in the present-day stellar
velocity dispersion. The current ONC will be gravitationally unbound once cloud
destruction is complete, and is destined to become a dispersing OB association.
We hypothesize that similarly crowded groups seen at the centers of distant OB
associations are also unbound, and do not give rise to the Galactic population
of open clusters. Finally, accelerating star formation implies that most clumps
within giant molecular complexes should have relatively low formation activity.
Sensitive infrared surveys could confirm this hypothesis.

engine of short-duration gamma-ray bursts. Hybrid equations of state (EOSs) are
adopted mimicking realistic, stiff nuclear EOSs, for which the maximum allowed
gravitational mass of cold and spherical neutron stars (NSs), M_sph, is larger
than 2M_sun. For the simulations, we focus on BNSs of the ADM mass M>2.6M_sun.
For M>M_thr, the merger results in prompt formation of a BH irrespective of the
mass ratio Q_M with 0.65<Q_M<1. The value of M_thr is approximately written as
1.3-1.35M_sph for the chosen EOSs. For the BH formation case, we evolve the
spacetime using a BH excision technique and determine the mass of a
quasistationary disk surrounding the BH. The disk mass steeply increases with
decreasing the value of Q_M for given ADM mass and EOS. For M<M_thr, the
outcome is a hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) of a large ellipticity. If the
HMNS collapses to a BH after the longterm angular momentum transport, the disk
mass may be >0.01M_sun. Gravitational waves (GWs) are computed in terms of a
gauge-invariant wave extraction technique. In the formation of the HMNS,
quasiperiodic GWs of frequency (3-3.5kHz) are emitted. The effective amplitude
of GWs can be >5x10^{-21} at a distance of 50 Mpc. For the BH formation case,
the BH excision technique enables a longterm computation and extraction of
ring-down GWs associated with a BH quasinormal mode. It is found that the

M_r<-19 and M_r<-21 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we predict the
void probability function (VPF) and underdensity probability function (UPF) of
these samples by populating the halos of a large, high-resolution N-body

of large scale environment at fixed halo mass, then models constrained to match
n_gal and w_p predict nearly identical void statistics, independent of the
scatter between halo mass and central galaxy luminosity or uncertainties in HOD
parameters. Models with sigma_8=0.7 and sigma_8=0.9 also predict very similar
void statistics. However, the VPF and UPF are sensitive to environmental
variations of the HOD in a regime where these variations have little impact on
w_p. For example, doubling the minimum host halo mass in regions with large
scale (5 Mpc/h) density contrast delta<-0.65 has a readily detectable impact on
void probabilities of M_r<-19 galaxies, and a similar change for delta<-0.2
alters the void probabilities of M_r<-21 galaxies at a detectable level. The
VPF and UPF provide complementary information about the onset and magnitude of
density- dependence in the HOD. By detecting or ruling out HOD changes in low
density regions, void statistics can reduce systematic uncertainties in the
cosmological constraints derived from HOD modeling, and, more importantly,
reveal connections between halo formation history and galaxy properties.

net increase in the mass fraction of subhalos is roughly 10%, and the extra
substructures tending to reside in the inner parts of the system. Finally, we
compare the subhalo populations of halos to the sub-subhalo populations of
subhalos, finding the two distributions to be similar. This is a new and
interesting result, suggesting a self-similarity in the hierarchy substructures

segmented detectors, and a Compton camera consisting of a stack of strip
detectors. Each of these exhibits distinct advantages and disadvantages
regarding fundamental instrumental characteristics such as detection efficiency
or background rejection, which ultimately determine achievable sensitivities.
We conclude that the Compton camera is the most promising detector for MAX in
particular, and for Laue lens gamma-ray telecopes in general.

particles in protoplanetary disks. We vary the size of the particles and relate
the dust evolution to the turbulent velocity fluctuations. We performed
numerical simulations using two Eulerian MHD codes, both based on finite
difference techniques: ZEUS--3D and NIRVANA. These were local shearing box
simulations incorporating vertical stratification. Both ideal and non ideal MHD
simulations with midplane dead zones were carried out. The codes were extended
to incorporate different models for the dust as an additional fluid component.
Good agreement between results obtained using the different approaches was
obtained. The simulations show that a thin layer of very small dust particles
is diffusively spread over the full vertical extent of the disk. We show that a
simple description obtained using the diffusion equation with a diffusion
coefficient simply expressed in terms of the velocity correlations accurately
matches the results. Dust settling starts to become apparent for particle sizes
of the order of 1 to 10 centimeters for which the gas begins to decouple in a
standard solar nebula model at 5.2 AU. However, for particles which are 10
centimeters in size, complete settling toward a very thin midplane layer is
prevented by turbulent motions within the disk, even in the presence of a
midplane dead zone of significant size. These results indicate that, when
present, MHD turbulence affects dust dynamics in protoplanetary disks. We find
that the evolution and settling of the dust can be accurately modelled using an
advection diffusion equation that incorporates vertical settling. The value of
the diffusion coefficient can be calculated from the turbulent velocity field
when that is known for a time of several local orbits.

the second route, we explore the constraints on quintessence models where the
acceleration is driven by a slow-rolling scalar field. The analysis focuses on
cosmic shear, combined with supernovae Ia and CMB data. Using a Boltzmann code
including quintessence models and the computation of weak lensing observables,
we determine several two-point shear statistics. The non-linear regime is
described by two different mappings. The likelihood analysis is based on a grid
method. The data include the ""gold set"" of supernovae Ia, the WMAP-1 year data
and the VIRMOS-Descart and CFHTLS-deep and -wide data for weak lensing. This is
the first analysis of high-energy motivated dark energy models that uses weak
lensing data. We explore larger angular scales, using a synthetic realization
of the complete CFHTLS-wide survey as well as next space-based missions
surveys. Two classes of cosmological parameters are discussed: i) those
accounting for quintessence affect mainly geometrical factors; ii) cosmological
parameters specifying the primordial universe strongly depend on the
description of the non-linear regime. This dependence is addressed using wide
surveys, by discarding the smaller angular scales to reduce the dependence on
the non-linear regime. Special care is payed to the comparison of these

JCMT SCUBA 850 micron images of the Sombrero Galaxy (NGC 4594), an Sa galaxy
with a 10^9 M_solar low luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN). The brightest
infrared sources in the galaxy are the nucleus and the dust ring. The spectral
energy distribution of the AGN demonstrates that, while the environment around
the AGN is a prominent source of mid-infrared emission, it is a relatively weak
source of far-infrared emission, as had been inferred for AGN in previous
research. The weak nuclear 160 micron emission and the negligible polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon emission from the nucleus also implies that the nucleus is
a site of only weak star formation activity and the nucleus contains relatively
little cool interstellar gas needed to fuel such activity. We propose that this
galaxy may be representative of a subset of low ionization nuclear emission
region galaxies that are in a quiescent AGN phase because of the lack of gas
needed to fuel circumnuclear star formation and Seyfert-like AGN activity.
Surprisingly, the AGN is the predominant source of 850 micron emission. We
examine the possible emission mechanisms that could give rise to the 850 micron
emission and find that neither thermal dust emission, CO line emission,
bremsstrahlung emission, nor the synchrotron emission observed at radio
wavelengths can adequately explain the measured 850 micron flux density by
themselves. The remaining possibilities for the source of the 850 micron
emission include a combination of known emission mechanisms, synchrotron
emission that is self-absorbed at wavelengths longer than 850 microns, or
unidentified spectral lines in the 850 micron band.

Our maps typically cover the bulge dominated region. We find a significant
fraction of kinematically decoupled components (12/24), many of them displaying
central velocity dispersion minima. They are mostly aligned and co-rotating
with the main body of the galaxies, and are usually associated with dust discs
and rings detected in unsharp-masked images. Almost all the galaxies in the
sample (22/24) contain significant amounts of ionised gas which, in general, is
accompanied by the presence of dust. The kinematics of the ionised gas is
consistent with circular rotation in a disc co-rotating with respect to the
stars. The distribution of mean misalignments between the stellar and gaseous
angular momenta in the sample suggest that the gas has an internal origin. The
[OIII]/Hbeta ratio is usually very low, indicative of current star formation,
and shows various morphologies (ring-like structures, alignments with dust
lanes or amorphous shapes). The star formation rates in the sample are
comparable with that of normal disc galaxies. Low gas velocity dispersion
values appear to be linked to regions of intense star formation activity. We
interpret this result as stars being formed from dynamically cold gas in those
regions. In the case of NGC5953, the data suggest that we are witnessing the
formation of a kinematically decoupled component from cold gas being acquired
during the ongoing interaction with NGC5954.

discrepancy: the competition between degenerate antiferromagnetic and

renormalize it up to one loop in a perturbative expansion. We solve the various

one-loop order, and we argue that this would be the case to all orders in

higher values, a suppression of its intensity, as well as a noticeable change
of its asymmetry leading to a more symmetric shape at high pressures. The
pressure-induced Boson peak frequency shift agrees very well with the
predictions of the soft potential model over the whole pressure range studied.

The occurrence of a SC phase is investigated both at T=0 and T\neq 0, in the
case of a local interaction, when the theory must be renormalized and also in
the situation where a natural physical cutoff is present in the system. In both
cases, at T=0, we find a quantum phase transition connecting the normal and SC
phases at a certain critical coupling. The phase structure is shown to be
robust against quantum fluctuations. The SC gap is determined for T=0 and T\neq
0, both with and without a physical cutoff and the interplay between the gap
and the SC order parameter is discussed. Our theory qualitatively reproduces
the SC phase transition occurring in the underdoped regime of the high-Tc
cuprates. This fact points to the possible relevance of Dirac electrons in the
mechanism of high-Tc superconductivity.

  Fields",,,,"MIT LIDS Technical Report 2687","cs.IT math.IT",,"  We examine the issue of separation and code design for networks that operate
over finite fields. We demonstrate that source-channel (or source-network)
separation holds for several canonical network examples like the noisy multiple
access channel and the erasure degraded broadcast channel, when the whole
network operates over a common finite field. This robustness of separation is
predicated on the fact that noise and inputs are independent, and we examine
the failure of separation when noise is dependent on inputs in multiple access
channels.
  Our approach is based on the sufficiency of linear codes. Using a simple and
unifying framework, we not only re-establish with economy the optimality of
linear codes for single-transmitter, single-receiver channels and for
Slepian-Wolf source coding, but also establish the optimality of linear codes
for multiple access and for erasure degraded broadcast channels. The linearity
allows us to obtain simple optimal code constructions and to study capacity
regions of the noisy multiple access and the degraded broadcast channel. The
linearity of both source and network coding blurs the delineation between
source and network codes. While our results point to the fact that separation
of source coding and channel coding is optimal in some canonical networks, we
show that decomposing networks into canonical subnetworks may not be effective.
Thus, we argue that it may be the lack of decomposability of a network into
canonical network modules, rather than the lack of separation between source
and channel coding, that presents major challenges for coding over networks.

among both massive and massless brane matter (in contrast to much simpler
generalization of the Einstein gravity, f(R), which influences only the massive
matter), and therefore, can be probed via various scattering processes at

In addition to collision processes which proceed with tree-level gravi-particle
exchange, effective interactions among brane matter are found to exhibit a
strong sensitivity to higher-curvature gravity via the gravi-particle loops.
Furthermore, particle collisions with missing energy in their final states are
found to be sensitive to additional gravi-particles not found in Einstein

mass, respectively sigma(theta) = sigma (1 + s_2 theta^2 + ...) and M(theta) =
M (1 + g_2 theta^2 + ...), where sigma and M are the values at theta=0. For
this purpose we use numerical simulations of the Wilson lattice formulation of

very small for all N>=3. For example, s_2=-0.08(1) and g_2=-0.06(2) for N=3.
Their absolute values decrease with increasing N. Our results are suggestive of
a scenario in which the theta dependence in the string and glueball spectrum
vanishes in the large-N limit, at least for sufficiently small values of
|theta|. They support the general large-N scaling arguments that indicate
(theta/N) as the relevant Lagrangian parameter in the large-N expansion.

trivial, this distance coincides with the horizontal distance defined by the

rather surprising properties. Specifically we exhibit an elementary example on
a 2-torus in which the noncommutative metric d is somehow more interesting than
the horizontal one since d preserves the S^1-structure of the fiber and also
guarantees the smoothness of the length function at the cut-locus. In this
sense the fiber appears as an object ""smoother than a circle"". As a
consequence, from a intrinsic metric point of view developed here, any observer
whatever his position on the fiber can equally pretend to be ""the center of the
world"".

  503-521",,,"math.PR",,"  V.A. Rohlin asked in 1949 whether 2-fold mixing implies 3-fold mixing for a
stationary process indexed by Z, and the question remains open today. In 1978,
F. Ledrappier exhibited a counterexample to the 2-fold mixing implies 3-fold
mixing problem, the so-called ""3-dot system"", but in the context of stationary
random fields indexed by ZxZ. In this work, we first present an attempt to
adapt Ledrappier's construction to the one-dimensional case, which finally
leads to a stationary process which is 2-fold but not 3-fold mixing
conditionally to the sigma-algebra generated by some factor process. Then,
using arguments coming from the theory of joinings, we will give some strong
obstacles proving that Ledrappier's counterexample can not be fully adapted to
one-dimensional stationary processes.

have been studied before with the Potts model for the values q=3, ferromagnetic

network consists of two parallel networks: i) a chain-like network of securely
communicating, electrically isolated Kirchhoff-loops with Johnson-like noise
and driven by a specific switching process of the resistances; ii) and a
regular non-secure data network with a Coordinator-server. If the classical
network is fast enough, the chain-like network of N communicators can generate

exchanges used by quantum communication or RSA-like key exchange methods. This
is a teleportation-type multiple telecloning of the classical information bit
because the information transfer can take place without the actual presence of
the information bit at the intermediate points of the network. With similar
quantum schemes the telecloning of classical bits via quantum communicator
networks without telecloning the quantum states is also possible.

0.033 (typical to this site), total suspended particulate (TSP) concentration
was in the range 15 - 40 micro g m^(-3) (mean value 27.1 $\pm$ 8.3 micro g
m^(-3)). Interestingly, aerosol BC had a mean concentration of 1.36 $\pm$ 0.99
micro g m^(-3), contributed to ~5.0 $\pm$ 1.3 % to the composite aerosol mass.
This large abundance of BC is found to have linkages to the human activities in
the adjoining valley and to the boundary layer dynamics. Consequently, the
inferred single scattering albedo lies in the range of 0.87 to 0.94 (mean value
0.90 $\pm$ 0.03), indicating significant aerosol absorption. The estimated
aerosol radiative forcing was as low as 4.2 W m^(-2) at the surface, +0.7 W
m^(-2) at the top of the atmosphere, implying an atmospheric forcing of +4.9 W
m^(-2). Though absolute value of the atmospheric forcing is quite small, which
arises primarily from the very low AOD (or the column abundance of aerosols),
the forcing efficiency (forcing per unit optical depth) was $\sim$88 W m^(-2),
which is attributed to the high BC mass fraction.

stability of the electrostatic wave (ESW) with increasing non-relativistic beam
velocities and an improved wave stability for increasing relativistic beam
velocities, both in accordance with previous findings. At the highest beam
speeds, we find the system to be stable again for a period of ~160 plasma
periods. Furthermore we observe a, to our knowledge, previously unreported
secondary electron acceleration mechanism at low beam speeds. We believe that
it is the result of parametric couplings to produce high phase velocity ESW's
which then trap electrons, accelerating them to higher energies. This allows
electrons in our simulation study to achieve the injection energy required for
Fermi acceleration, for beam speeds as low as 0.15c in unmagnetised plasma.

DNA changes and the amplitude of Brownian motion of the tethered bead is
reduced compared to that of unbent DNA. We detected individual binding and
dissociation events and derived kinetic parameters for the process.
Dissociation was induced by increasing the salt concentration or by directly
pulling on the tethered bead using optical tweezers. In addition to the
well-defined free and bound classes of Brownian motion, we observed another two
classes of motion. These extra classes were identified with intermediate states
on a three-step, linear binding pathway. Biological implications of the
intermediate states are discussed.

gene-protein interaction network module that also connects to a simplified cell
cycle description. The simulation results show that over time proliferative and
migratory cell populations not only oscillate but also directly impact the
spatio-temporal expansion patterns of the entire cancer system. The percentage
change in the concentration of the sub-cellular interaction network's molecular
components fluctuates, and, for the proliferation-to-migration switch we find
that the phenotype triggering molecular profile to some degree varies as the
tumor system grows and the microenvironment changes. We discuss potential
implications of these findings for experimental and clinical cancer research.

frames? It is a difficult question, but it is still possible to study this
problem in the microscopic world. In the hydrogen atom, the uncertainty can be
considered to be entirely associated with the ground-state. However, is there
an uncertainty associated with the time-separation variable between the proton
and electron? This time-separation variable is a forgotten, if not hidden,
variable in the present form of quantum mechanics. The first step toward the
simultaneity problem is to study the role of this time-separation variable in
the Lorentz-covariant world. It is shown possible to study this problem using
harmonic oscillators applicable to hadrons which are bound states of quarks. It
is also possible to derive consequences that can be tested experimentally.

reduced Wigner function of an open quantum system at zero temperature. Our
model consists of a particle trapped in a cubic potential interacting with an
environment characterized by dissipative and normal and anomalous diffusion
coefficients. A representation based on the energy eigenfunctions of the
isolated system, i.e. the system uncoupled to the environment, is used to write
the reduced Wigner function, and the master equation becomes simpler in that
representation. The energy eigenfunctions computed in a WKB approximation
incorporate the tunneling effect of the isolated system and the effect of the
environment is described by an equation that it is in many ways similar to a
Fokker-Planck equation. Decoherence is easily identified from the master
equation and we find that when the decoherence time is much shorter than the
tunneling time the master equation can be approximated by a Kramers like
equation describing thermal activation due to the zero point fluctuations of
the quantum environment. The effect of anomalous diffusion can be dealt with
perturbatively and its overall effect is to inhibit tunneling.

$R\_{\clubsuit}$ is not a local ring, the neighbour (or parallel) relation is
not an equivalence relation so that the sets of neighbour points to two distant

forming three disjoint families under the reduction modulo either of two
maximal ideals of the ring. Two of the families contain four points each and
they swap their roles when switching from one ideal to the other; the points of
the one family merge with (the image of) the point in question, while the
points of the other family go in pairs into the remaining two points of the
