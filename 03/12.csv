the interstellar magnetic field, including paramagnetic dissipation, radiative
torques, and supersonic gas-grain streaming. These must compete with
disaligning processes, including randomly directed torques arising from
collisions with gas atoms. I describe a novel disalignment mechanism for grains
that have a time-varying electric dipole moment and that drift across the
magnetic field. Depending on the drift speed, this mechanism may yield a much
shorter disalignment timescale than that associated with random gas atom
impacts. For suprathermally rotating grains, the new disaligning process may be
more potent for carbonaceous dust than for silicate dust. This could result in
efficient alignment for silicate grains but poor alignment for carbonaceous
grains.

provide information about the shocked, hot gas which emits the X-radiation, and
about the bulk of comparably cool stellar wind material which partly absorbs
this radiation. In this paper, we synthesize X-ray line profiles with a model
of a clumpy stellar wind. We find that the geometrical shape of the wind
inhomogeneities is important: better agreement with the observations can be
achieved with radially compressed clumps than with spherical clumps. The
parameters of the model, i.e. chemical abundances, stellar radius, mass-loss
rate and terminal wind velocity, are taken from existing analyses of UV and
optical spectra of the programme stars. On this basis, we also calculate the
continuum-absorption coefficient of the cool-wind material, using the Potsdam
Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmosphere code. The radial location of X-ray emitting
gas is restricted from analysing the fir line ratios of helium-like ions. The
only remaining free parameter of our model is the typical distance between the
clumps; here, we assume that at any point in the wind there is one clump
passing by per one dynamical time-scale of the wind. The total emission in a
model line is scaled to the observation. There is a good agreement between
synthetic and observed line profiles. We conclude that the X-ray emission line
profiles in O stars can be explained by hot plasma embedded in a cool wind
which is highly clumped in the form of radially compressed shell fragments.

ridges in the bar. Sharp velocity gradients are apparent across the ridges.
Analyses of the CO data and the newborn stellar clusters revealed in HST images
indicate the existence of unresolved molecular clouds with masses of
10^4-6Msun. The observed shear velocity gradient across the ridges is too small
to break up giant molecular clouds. Therefore, the clouds are likely to survive
passage through the ridges. We discuss a cloud orbit model in a bar potential.
The model reproduces the narrow offset ridges and sharp velocity gradients
across the ridges in NGC 4303. We discuss cloud-cloud collisions (and close
interactions) as a possible triggering mechanism for star formation. The
newborn stellar clusters in NGC 4303 are located predominantly at the leading
sides of the offset ridges, where cloud orbits are densely populated and
suggest a high collisional frequency and possibly a high rate of triggered star
formation. Cloud-based dynamics is less dissipative than smooth hydrodynamic
models, possibly extending the timescales of gas dynamical evolution and gas
fueling to central regions in barred galaxies.

resulting psf has a slightly narrower core and broader wings than a single

restricting the sample to within 80 pc and to M_V \leq 3.5. We find that the

This represents the first exactly solvable disordered sphere-packing model in

the ghost RSA packing implies that there may be disordered sphere packings in
sufficiently high $d$ whose density exceeds Minkowski's lower bound for Bravais
lattices, the dominant asymptotic term of which is $1/2^d$. Indeed, we report
on a conjectural lower bound on the density whose asymptotic behavior is
controlled by $2^{-(0.77865...) d}$, thus providing the putative exponential
improvement on Minkowski's 100-year-old bound. Our results suggest that the
densest packings in sufficiently high dimensions may be disordered rather than

degenerate, it is also possible to arrive at a quasi-fixed point in the RGE

the regularization of the theory, yielding a finite euclidean action and finite
conserved charges. The choice of the boundary term is justified on the grounds
that an enhanced 'almost off-shell' local AdS/Conformal symmetry arises for
that very special choice. One may say that the boundary term is dictated by a
guiding symmetry principle. Two sets of boundary conditions are considered,
which yield regularization procedures analogous to (but different from) the
standard 'background substraction' and 'counterterms' regularization methods.
The Noether charges are constructed in general. As an application it is shown
that for Schwarszchild-AdS black holes the charge associated to the time-like
Killing vector is finite and is indeed the mass. The Euclidean action for
Schwarzschild-AdS black holes is computed, and it turns out to be finite, and
to yield the right thermodynamics. The previous paragraph may be interpreted in
the sense that the boundary term dictated by the symmetry principle is the one
that correctly regularizes the action.

This allows us to formulate an alternative solution to the traditional damped

is now expanded in a truncated Slepian function basis set. We discuss the
relative performance of both methods with regard to standard statistical

  manuscript to meet PRL submission guidelines. Details in previous edition",,,,"q-bio.BM q-bio.SC",,"  A chemical kinetic model of the elongation dynamics of RNA polymerase along a
DNA sequence is introduced. The proposed model governs the discrete movement of
the RNA polymerase along a DNA template, with no consideration given to elastic
effects. The model's novel concept is a ``look-ahead'' feature, in which
nucleotides bind reversibly to the DNA prior to being incorporated covalently
into the nascent RNA chain. Results are presented for specific DNA sequences
that have been used in single-molecule experiments of the random walk of RNA
polymerase along DNA. By replicating the data analysis algorithm from the
experimental procedure, the model produces velocity histograms, enabling direct
comparison with these published results.

we present a quantum secure direct communication scheme using single photons.
The security of the present scheme is ensured by quantum no-cloning theory and
the secret transmitting order of photons. The present scheme is efficient in
that all of the polarized photons are used to transmit the sender's secret
message except those chosen for eavesdropping check. We also generalize this
scheme to a multiparty controlled quantum secret direct communication scheme
which the sender's secret message can only be recovered by the receiver under
the permission of all the controllers.

approximation for an atom is induced by the spontaneously generated coherence.
The spontaneously generated coherence considered in a lambda-type atomic system
causes an indirect coupling between the lower two levels which acts
equivalently as a DC-field and therefore makes possible the existence of
second-order susceptibility.
