for accurate computation of the ionization history of the early Universe given
by Seager et al. (1999,2000). It is shown that strong dependence of ionization
and recombination rates on the density and temperature of plasma provides the
significant deviations of amplitudes of ionization fractions relative
perturbations from ones of baryon matter density adiabatic perturbations. Such
deviations are most prominent for cosmological adiabatic perturbations of
scales larger than sound horizon at recombination epoch. The amplitudes of
relative perturbations of number densities of electrons and protons at last
scattering surface exceed by factor of $\simeq$5 the amplitude of relative
perturbation of baryons total number density, for helium ions this ratio
reaches the value of $\simeq$18. For subhorizon cosmological perturbations
these ratios appear to be essentially lesser and depend on oscillation phase at
the moment of decoupling. These perturbations of number densities of ions and
electrons at recombination epoch do not contribute to the intrinsic plasma
temperature fluctuations but cause the ''corrugation'' of last scattering
surface in optical depth, $\delta z_{dec}/(z_{dec}+1)\approx -\delta_b/3$, at
scales larger than sound horizon. It may result into noticeable changes of
precalculated values of CMB polarization pattern at several degrees angular

extending down to MeV energies. In addition, deflections in cosmic magnetic
fields can influence the spectrum and sky distribution of primary cosmic rays

modify the form of the stellar initial mass function in starbursts in order to
match the observed number of sub-mm sources, if we are to retain the previous

accreting close to, or above, the Eddington limit. The radio-loud NLS1s of our
sample are remarkable in that they occupy a previously rarely populated regime
in NLS1 multi-wavelength parameter space. While their [OIII]/H_beta and
FeII/H_beta intensity ratios almost cover the whole range observed in NLS1
galaxies, their radio properties extend the range of radio-loud objects to
those with small widths of the broad Balmer lines. Among the radio-detected
NLS1 galaxies, the radio index R distributes quite smoothly up to the critical
value of R ~ 10 and covers about 4 orders of magnitude in total. Statistics
show that ~7% of the NLS1 galaxies are formally radio-loud while only 2.5%
exceed a radio index R > 100. Several mechanisms are considered as explanations
for the radio loudness of the NLS1 galaxies and for the lower frequency of
radio-louds among NLS1s than quasars. While properties of most sources (with
2-3 exceptions) generally do not favor relativistic beaming, the combination of
accretion mode and spin may explain the observations. (abbreviated)

overall characteristics of the flare emission are interpreted in terms of the
plasmon model of Van der Laan (1966) by considering the ejection and
adiabatically expansion of a uniform, spherical plasma blob due to flare
activity. The observed peak of the flare emission with a spectral index
$\nu^{-\alpha}$ of $\alpha$=1.6 is consistent with the prediction that the peak
emission shifts toward lower frequencies in an adiabatically-expanding
self-absorbed source. We present the expected synchrotron light curves for an
expanding blob as well as the peak frequency emission as a function of the
energy spectral index constrained by the available flaring measurements in
near-IR, sub-millimeter, millimeter and radio wavelengths. We note that the
blob model is consistent with the available measurements, however, we can not
rule out the jet of Sgr A*. If expanding material leaves the gravitational
potential of Sgr A*, the total mass-loss rate of nonthermal and thermal
particles is estimated to be $\le 2\times10^{-8}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. We
discuss the implication of the mass-loss rate since this value matches closely

characterize the long-term X-ray flux and spectral variability of the source

correlation on long timescales. The spectral and temporal variability
properties appear to be markedly different compared to those of
non-jet-dominated radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN monitored with RXTE. To
investigate the X-ray/TeV correlation on long timescales we compared RXTE data
with HEGRA and Whipple historical light curves. We confirm the presence of a
direct correlation, which appears to be stronger when the source is brighter.
The analysis of individual flares shows that the X-ray\TeV correlated activity
is heterogeneous. However, more sensitive TeV observations are necessary to
confirm these findings, and to put tighter constraints on jet models

simulations. The system is equilibrated without attraction and instantaneously
``quenched'', at constant colloid volume fraction, to one of two states beyond
the glass transition; one is close to the transition, and the other one deep in
the glass. The evolution of structural properties shows that bonds form in the
system, increasing the local density, creating density deficits (holes)
elsewhere. This process slows down with the time elapsed since the quench. As a
consequence of bond formation, there is a slowing down of the dynamics, as
measured by the mean squared displacement and the density, bond, and
environment correlation functions. The density correlations can be
time-rescaled to collapse their long time (structural) decay. The time scale
for structural relaxation shows for both quenches a super-linear dependence on
waiting time; it grows faster than the bond lifetime, showing the collective
origin of the transition. At long waiting times and high attraction strength,
we observe {\rem completely} arrested dynamics for more than three decades in
time, although individual bonds are not permanent on this time scale. The
localization length decreases as the state moves deeper in the glass; the
non-ergodicity parameter oscillates in phase with the structure factor. Our
main results are obtained for systems with a barrier in the pair potential that
inhibits phase separation. However, when this barrier is removed for the case
of a deep quench, we find changes in the static structure but almost none in
the dynamics. Hence our results for the aging behavior remain relevant to
experiments in which the glass transition competes with phase separation.

production with decays T Tbar -> W+ b H tbar / H t W- bbar -> W+ b W- bbar H

this signal. Both analyses are carried out with particle-level simulations of

the main background by far. Our estimate for SM Higgs discovery in t tbar H
production, 0.4 sigma significance for M_H = 115 GeV and an integrated
luminosity of 30 fb^-1, is similar to the most recent ones by CMS which also
include the full t tbar nj background. We show that, if a quark singlet with a

final state is reduced by more than two orders of magnitude, and 5 sigma
significance can be achieved already with 8 fb^-1. This new Higgs signal will
not be seen unless we look for it: with this aim, a new specific final state
reconstruction method is presented. Finally, we consider the sensitivity to
search for Q=2/3 singlets. The combination of these three decay modes allows to
discover a 500 GeV quark with 7 fb^-1 of luminosity.

decays. Using this method, all amplitudes for such decays can be expressed in
terms of contractions, though the matrix elements are not evaluated. Many years
ago, Buras and Silvestrini proposed a similar approach. However, our technique
goes beyond theirs in several ways. First, we include recent theoretical and
experimental developments which indicate which contractions are negligible, and
which are expected to be smaller than others. Second, we show that all B-decay
diagrams can be simply expressed in terms of contractions. This constitutes a
formal proof that the diagrammatic method is rigourous. Third, we show that one
reproduces the relations between tree and electroweak-penguin diagrams
described by Neubert and Rosner, and by Gronau, Pirjol and Yan. Fourth,
although the previous results hold to all orders in alpha_s, we show that it is
also possible to work order-by-order in this approach. In this way it is
possible to make a connection with the matrix-element evaluation methods of QCD
factorization (QCDfac) and perturbative QCD (pQCD). Finally, using the
contractions approach, we re-evaluate the question of whether there is a ``B ->
pi K puzzle.'' At O(alpha_s^0), we find that the diagram ratio |C'/T| is about
0.17, a factor of 10 too small to explain all the B -> pi K data. Both QCDfac
and pQCD find that, at O(\alpha_s^1), the value of |C'/T'| may be raised to
only about 2-3 times its lowest-order value. We therefore conclude that,
assuming the effect is not a statistical fluctuation, it is likely that the
value of |C'/T'| is similar to its O(\alpha_s^0) result, and that there really
is a B -> pi K puzzle.

as an alternative to the domain wall localization arising in continuous five

neutrosophic N-loops. We introduce several new, related definitions. In fact we
construct a new class of neutrosophic loops using modulo integer Z_n, n > 3,

groupoids and neutrosophic N-groupoids. Sixth chapter innovatively gives mixed

construction of outer actions of a {\cdag} on an AFD factor of type {\threel},
sharpening the result in \cite{KtT2: \S4}. The periodicity of the flow of
weights on a factor $\sM$ of type {\threel} allows us to introduce an
equivariant commutative square directly related to the discrete core. But this
makes it necessary to introduce an enlarged group $\Aut(\sM)_\txm$ relative to
the modulus homomorphism $\txm=\mod: \Aut(\sM)\mapsto \rt'z$. We then discuss
the reduced {\mhjr}, which allows us to describe the invariant of outer action
$\a$ in a simpler form than the one for a general AFD factor: for example, the
cohomology group $\tH_{\txm, \fs}^\out(G, N, \T)$ of modular obstructions is a
compact abelian group. Making use of these reductions, we prove the

Examples observed include scattering from low frequency electron acoustic waves

capability in this area is assisted by the development of Vlasov codes, which
offer high velocity space resolution in high energy regions of particle phase
space, and do not require analytical pre-processing of the fundamental
equations. A direct Vlasov solver, capable of resolving these kinetic
processes, is used here to address fundamental aspects of the existence and
stability of the electron acoustic wave, together with its collective
scattering properties. These simulations are extended to realistic laser and
plasma parameters characteristic of single hot-spot experiments. Results are in
qualitative agreement with experiments displaying both stimulated Raman and
stimulated electron acoustic scattering. The amplitude of simulated EAWs is
greater than that observed experimentally, and is accompanied by a higher phase
velocity. These minor differences can be attributed to the limitations of a
one-dimensional collisionless model.

transmembrane receptors is driven by an oscillating optical trap, and the
viscoelastic coefficient $G_e(\omega)$ is retrieved. Both $J(t)$ and
$G_e(\omega)$ exhibit power law behavior: $J(t)= A(t/t_0)^\alpha$ and $\bar
G_e(\omega)\bar = G_0 (\omega/\omega_0)^\alpha$, with the same exponent
$\alpha\approx 0.2$. This power law behavior is very robust ; $\alpha$ is
distributed over a narrow range, and shows almost no dependance on the cell
type, on the nature of the protein complex which transmits the mechanical
stress, nor on the typical length scale of the experiment. On the contrary, the
prefactors $A_0$ and $G_0$appear very sensitive to these parameters. Whereas
the exponents $\alpha$ are normally distributed over the cell population, the
prefactors $A_0$ and $G_0$ follow a log-normal repartition. These results are
compared with other data published in the litterature. We propose a global
interpretation, based on a semi-phenomenological model, which involves a broad
distribution of relaxation times in the system. The model predicts the power
law behavior and the statistical repartition of the mechanical parameters, as
experimentally observed for the cells. Moreover, it leads to an estimate of the

computation and many of the techniques one can use to understand it. The
techniques which are described include the stabilizer formalism and the logical
Heisenberg picture. We highlight ways in which it is useful to understand
one-way computation beyond simple equivalence with the quantum circuit model.
We briefly review current proposals of implementations and experimental
progress and summarize some recent related theoretical developments.
  Although the chapter is primarily didactic in focus, we include a number of
new methods and observations. These include: a simpler and more compact
formulation of one-way quantum computation in the stabilizer formalism; A new
way of implementing unitaries diagonal in the computational basis; New results
on the family of operations which may be implemented in a single round of
measurements; A method for constructing compact one-way patterns by decomposing
unitaries in terms of diagonal unitaries and Clifford group transformations.

  long-range dipole-dipole interaction between qubits","31 pages",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.73.062336",,"quant-ph",,"  Creation of entanglement is considered theoretically and numerically in an
ensemble of spin chains with dipole-dipole interaction between the spins. The
unwanted effect of the long-range dipole interaction is compensated by the
optimal choice of the parameters of radio-frequency pulses implementing the
protocol. The errors caused by (i) the influence of the environment,(ii)
non-selective excitations, (iii) influence of different spin chains on each
other, (iv) displacements of qubits from their perfect locations, and (v)
fluctuations of the external magnetic field are estimated analytically and
calculated numerically. For the perfectly entangled state the z component, M,
of the magnetization of the whole system is equal to zero. The errors lead to a
finite value of M. If the number of qubits in the system is large, M can be
detected experimentally. Using the fact that M depends differently on the
parameters of the system for each kind of error, varying these parameters would
allow one to experimentally determine the most significant source of errors and
to optimize correspondingly the quantum computer design in order to decrease
the errors and M. Using our approach one can benchmark the quantum computer,
decrease the errors, and prepare the quantum computer for implementation of
more complex quantum algorithms.

transfer of quantum state information. In this paper, we investigate the
efficiency of such quantum spin channels which work in a decoherence
environment. Our results show that, the decoherence will significantly reduce
the fidelity of quantum communication through the spin channels. Generally
speaking, as the distance increases, the decoherence effects become more
serious, which will put some constraints on the spin chains for long distance
quantum state transfer.
