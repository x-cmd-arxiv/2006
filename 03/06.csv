been supported by the extension of the empirical radio/X-ray correlation from
X-ray binaries to active galactic nuclei through the inclusion of a mass term.
This has lead to the so-called fundamental plane of black hole activity in the
black hole mass, radio and X-ray luminosity space. Two incarnations of this
fundamental plane have so far been suggested using different underlying models
and using two different samples of accreting black holes. We present revised
samples for both studies together with a refined statistical analysis using
measured errors of the observables. This method is used to compare the two
samples, discuss selection effects, and infer parameters for the fundamental
plane in a homogeneous way. We show that strongly sub-Eddington objects in a
state equivalent to the low/hard state of X-ray binaries follow the fundamental
plane very tightly; the scatter is comparable to the measurement errors.
However, we find that the estimated parameters depend strongly on the
assumptions made on the sources of scatter and the relative weight of the
different AGN classes in the sample. Using only hard state objects, the
fundamental plane is in agreement with the prediction of a simple uncooled
synchrotron/jet model for the emitted radiation. Inclusion of high-state
objects increases the scatter and moves the correlation closer to a disk/jet
model. This is qualitatively consistent with a picture where low-state objects
are largely dominated by jet emission while high-state objects have a strong
contribution from an accretion disk.

aligned with the star near the base of the jet. The high resolution of the

of the Rosette Nebula are at heliocentric velocities of 13 and 40 km s$^{-1}$,
while the jet reaches a maximum velocity offset at a heliocentric velocity of

the stellar H$\alpha$ line is dominated by a broad absorption profile with
little or no emission component, indicating a lack of substantial circumstellar

the strong UV radiation field in the Rosette Nebula. The evaporation time scale
is 10$^3$ -- 10$^4$ yr. The Rosette HH1 jet source provides evidence for an

Collisions appear to play a major role in the Main Belt. Rotational and/or

mechanism. High angular resolution observations from space and from the ground

contains the most energetic pulsar known (PSR J0537-6910), which is surrounded
by a bright nonthermal nebula that likely represents a toroidal pulsar wind
terminal shock observed edge-on. We confirm the non-thermal nature of the
comet-shaped X-ray emission feature and show that the spectral steepening of
this feature away from the pulsar is quantitatively consistent with synchrotron
cooling of shocked pulsar wind particles flowing downstream at a bulk velocity
close to the speed of light. Around the cometary nebula we unambiguously detect
a thermal component, which accounts for about 1/3 of the total 0.5 - 10 keV
flux from the remnant. This thermal component is distributed among various
clumps of metal-enriched plasma embedded in the low surface brightness
X-ray-emitting diffuse gas. The relative metal enrichment pattern suggests that
the mass of the supernova progenitor is >~ 20M_sun. A comparison of the X-ray
data with HST optical images suggests that the explosion site is close to a
dense cloud, against which a reflection shock is launched. The interaction
between this reflection shock and the nebula has likely produced both its
cometary shape and the surrounding thermal emission enhancement. SNR N157B is
apparently expanding into the hot low-density interior of a surrounding
superbubble formed by the young OB association LH99, as revealed by Spitzer

neutron stars (atolls and millisecond pulsars) from the RXTE database. We show
that while these all have similar spectral evolution as a function of mass
accretion rate, there are also subtle differences. There are two different
types of hard/soft transition, those where the spectrum softens at all
energies, leading to a diagonal track on a colour-colour diagram, and those
where only the higher energy spectrum softens, giving a vertical track. The
luminosity at which the transition occurs is correlated with this spectral
behaviour, with the vertical transition at L/L_Edd ~0.02 while the diagonal one
is at ~0.1. Superimposed on this is the well known hysteresis effect, but we
show that classic, large scale hysteresis occurs only in the outbursting
sources, indicating that its origin is in the dramatic rate of change of mass
accretion rate during the disc instability. We show that the long term mass
accretion rate correlates with the transition behaviour, and speculate that
this is due to the magnetic field being able to emerge from the neutron star
surface for low average mass accretion rates. While this is not strong enough
to collimate the flow except in the millisecond pulsars, its presence may
affect the inner accretion flow by changing the properties of the jet.

O stars, in terms of synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons
accelerated in wind-embedded shocks. These shocks are associated with an
unstable, chaotic wind. The main improvement with respect to earlier models is
the inclusion of the radial dependence of the shock velocity jump and
compression ratio, based on 1D hydrodynamical simulations. The decrease of the
velocity jump and the compression ratio as a function of radius produces a
rapidly decreasing synchrotron emissivity. This effectively prohibits the
models from reproducing the spectral shape of the observed non-thermal radio
emission. We investigate a number of ""escape routes"" by which the
hydrodynamical predictions might be reconciled with the radio observations.
Although these escape routes reproduce the observed spectral shape, none of
these escape routes are physically plausible. In particular, re-acceleration by
feeding an electron distribution through a number of shocks, is in
contradiction with current hydrodynamical simulations. These hydrodynamical
simulations have their limitations, most notably the use of 1D. At present, it
is not feasible to perform 2D simulations of the wind out to the distances
required for synchrotron-emission models. Based on the current hydrodynamic
models, we suspect that the observed non-thermal radio emission from O stars
cannot be explained by wind-embedded shocks associated with the instability of
the line-driving mechanism. The most likely alternative mechanism is
synchrotron emission from colliding winds. That would imply that all O stars
with non-thermal radio emission should be members of binary or multiple
systems.

appearance of countable particles in quantum field theory in terms of stable
localized field configurations. As an exception Skyrme's model succeeded to
describe nuclear particles as localized states, so-called 'skyrmions', within a
non-linear field theory. Skyrmions are a characteristic of non-linear continuum
models ranging from microscopic to cosmological scales. Skyrmionic states have
been found under non-equilibrium conditions, or when stabilised by external
fields or the proliferation of topological defects. Examples are Turing
patterns in classical liquids, spin textures in quantum Hall magnets, or the
blue phases in liquid crystals, respectively. However, it is believed that
skyrmions cannot form spontaneous ground states like ferromagnetic or
antiferromagnetic order in magnetic materials. Here, we show theoretically that
this assumption is wrong and that skyrmion textures may form spontaneously in
condensed matter systems with chiral interactions without the assistance of
external fields or the proliferation of defects. We show this within a
phenomenological continuum model, that is based on a few material-specific
parameters that may be determined from experiment. As a new condition not
considered before, we allow for softened amplitude variations of the
magnetisation - a key property of, for instance, metallic magnets. Our model
implies that spontaneous skyrmion lattice ground states may exist quite
generally in a large number of materials, notably at surfaces and in thin films
as well as in bulk compounds, where a lack of space inversion symmetry leads to
chiral interactions.

that eta is significantly reduced for the latter two systems. It is suggested
that particle-hole excitations are at the root of this longitudinal softness in

by the surface diffusion during the epitaxial growth process. Taking into
account both interfaces, a disorder potential for the exciton motion in the

using either a time-propagation of the excitonic polarization with a
phenomenological dephasing, or a full exciton eigenstate model including
microscopic radiative decay and phonon scattering rates. While the results of
the two methods are generally similar, the eigenstate model does predict a
distribution of dephasing rates and a somewhat modified spectral response.
Comparing the results with measured absorption and resonant Rayleigh scattering
in GaAs/AlAs quantum wells subjected to growth interrupts, their specific
disorder parameters like correlation lengths and interface flatness are
determined. We find that the long-range disorder in the two heterointerfaces is
highly correlated, having rather similar average in-plane correlation lengths

nonlinearity. Here, we present evidence for the use of stochastic resonance as
a means of coherent signal amplification for use in nanomechanical devices.

function of depth, revealing a significant enhancement in the first two layers,

metal-insulator transition occurring in conditions of the excess
non-equilibrium carrier density under the applied electric field. First, this
mechanism is developed on the basis of a phenomenological approach. This model
not only allows the qualitative description of the switching mechanism, but it
is in quantitative agreement with the experimental results, in particular, with
those concerning the critical concentration and threshold field. The mechanism
takes into account the dependence of the carrier density on electric field, as
well as the scaling of the critical field. Next, we show that such a
'macroscopic' approach can be supported by some microscopic model. The
quintessence of this approach consists in the fact that an electronically
induced metal-insulator transition may be described in terms of
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) formalism developed earlier for the charge
density wave concept. It is shown that for the combination of both the types of
interaction (electron-electron and electron-phonon), the formation of a
collective excitation - an electron crystal of charge density wave - in the
model of exciton insulator is possible, which, in a general case, can also be
accompanied by a structural transition. The results for vanadium dioxide are
examined within the frameworks of the developed approach.

solutions are discussed. Particular attention is paid on the modelling of the
co-existing phases in the vicinity of the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB),
where local symmetry is often significantly lower than the average symmetry.
According to recent studies, two-phase co-existence in the vicinity of the MPB
is a thermodynamical necessity. Significantly different structural models for
PZT with $x$ in the vicinity of the MPB have recently been published.
Structural models, based on x-ray, neutron and electron diffraction studies,
are reviewed and two essentially different approaches were identified: (i) a
method where space group symmetry was decreased untill the features due to the
local distortions were 'modelled' and (ii) a method where the highest space
group symmetry compatible with the powder diffraction data was used together
with a model for a local disorder. Related to the method (ii), the essential
features of a model taking the hkl-dependent line broadening into account are
summarized. The underlying theme is to consider how local regions, with
symmetry lower than the average symmetry, should be modelled. Method (i) often
introduces unjustified structural parameters and should be avoided. By studying
the temperature and composition dependence of the structural parameters,
including line shape parameters and phase fractions in the case of the two
phase samples, one can further test the proposed models. The significance of
the local structure for electrical properties (switchable polarization and
electrical conductivity) is discussed by considering the local Pb ion
displacements and their dependence on the neighbouring B-cation configuration.

stationary states of the model, which are the counterparts of the Ising
equilibrium states, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem breaks down due to the
lack of time reversal invariance. In the non-stationary phase ordering kinetics
the parametric plot of the integrated response function $\chi (t,t_w)$ versus
the autocorrelation function is different from that of the kinetic Ising model.
However, splitting $\chi (t,t_w)$ into a stationary and an aging term $\chi
(t,t_w)=\chi_{st}(t-t_w)+\chi_{ag}(t,t_w)$, we find $\chi_{ag}(t,t_w)\sim

designed for sparse longitudinal data, where both the predictor and response
are functions of a covariate such as time. Predictor and response processes
have smooth random trajectories, and the data consist of a small number of
noisy repeated measurements made at irregular times for a sample of subjects.
In longitudinal studies, the number of repeated measurements per subject is
often small and may be modeled as a discrete random number and, accordingly,
only a finite and asymptotically nonincreasing number of measurements are
available for each subject or experimental unit. We propose a functional
regression approach for this situation, using functional principal component
analysis, where we estimate the functional principal component scores through
conditional expectations. This allows the prediction of an unobserved response
trajectory from sparse measurements of a predictor trajectory. The resulting
technique is flexible and allows for different patterns regarding the timing of
the measurements obtained for predictor and response trajectories. Asymptotic
properties for a sample of $n$ subjects are investigated under mild conditions,
as $n\to \infty$, and we obtain consistent estimation for the regression
function. Besides convergence results for the components of functional linear
regression, such as the regression parameter function, we construct asymptotic
pointwise confidence bands for the predicted trajectories. A functional
coefficient of determination as a measure of the variance explained by the
functional regression model is introduced, extending the standard $R^2$ to the
functional case. The proposed methods are illustrated with a simulation study,
longitudinal primary biliary liver cirrhosis data and an analysis of the
longitudinal relationship between blood pressure and body mass index.

reaction as described by the Lengyel-Epstein model are investigated. We find a
surprising competition between two oscillating patterns, where one is harmonic
and the other subharmonic with respect to the spatially periodic forcing. The
occurrence of a subharmonic pattern is remarkable as well as its preference up
to rather large values of the modulation amplitude. For small modulation
amplitudes we derive from the model system a generic equation for the envelope
of the oscillating reaction that includes an additional forcing contribution,
compared to the amplitude equations known from previous studies in other
systems. The analysis of this amplitude equation allows the derivation of
analytical expressions even for the forcing corrections to the threshold and to
the oscillation frequency, which are in a wide range of parameters in good
agreement with the numerical analysis of the complete reaction equations. In
the nonlinear regime beyond threshold, the subharmonic solutions exist in a

The model is based on the eikonal approximation and can accomodate both optical
potentials and the Glauber method for dealing with the initial- and final-state
interactions (IFSI). At lower nucleon energies, the optical-potential
philosophy is preferred, whereas at higher energies the Glauber method is more
natural. This versatility in dealing with the IFSI allows one to describe
A(p,pN) reactions in a wide energy range. Most results presented here use
optical potentials as this approach is argued to be the optimum choice for the
kinematics of the experiments considered in the present paper. The properties
of the IFSI factor, a function wherein the entire effect of the IFSI is
contained, are studied in detail. The predictions of the presented framework
are compared with two kinematically different experiments. First, differential
cross sections for quasielastic proton scattering at 1 GeV off 12C, 16O, and

formalism is applied to the analysis of a 4He(p,2p) experiment at 250 MeV. The

chaos in real complex system. Recently we have achieved the following result.
In real complex systems the informational measure of chaotic chatacter (IMC)
can serve as a reliable quantitative estimation of the state of a complex
system and help to estimate the deviation of this state from its normal
condition. As the IMC we suggest the statistical spectrum of the non-Markovity
parameter (NMP) and its frequency behavior. Our preliminary studies of real
complex systems in cardiology, neurophysiology and seismology have shown that
the NMP has diverse frequency dependence. It testifies to the competition
between Markovian and non-Markovian, random and regular processes and makes a
crossover from one relaxation scenario to the other possible. On this basis we
can formulate the new concept in the study of the manifestation of chaoticity.
We suggest the statistical theory of discrete non-Markov stochastic processes
to calculate the NMP and the quantitative evaluation of the IMC in real complex
systems. With the help of the IMC we have found out the evident manifestation
of chaosity in a normal (healthy) state of the studied system, its sharp
reduction in the period of crises, catastrophes and various human diseases. It
means that one can appreciably improve the state of a patient (of any system)
by increasing the IMC of the studied live system. The given observation creates
a reliable basis for predicting crises and catastrophes, as well as for
diagnosing and treating various human diseases, Parkinson's disease in
particular.

homogeneous (exchangeable) credit portfolio, which is introduced by Witt, to
the case of inhomogeneous portfolios. As inhomogeneous portfolios, we consider
two cases. In the first case, we treat a portfolio whose assets have uniform
default correlation and non-uniform default probabilities. We obtain the
default probability distribution and study the effect of the inhomogeneity on
it. The second case corresponds to a portfolio with inhomogeneous default
correlation. Assets are categorized in several different sectors and the
inter-sector and intra-sector correlations are not the same. We construct the
joint default probabilities and obtain the default probability distribution. We
show that as the number of assets in each sector decreases, inter-sector
correlation becomes more important than intra-sector correlation. We study the
maximum values of the inter-sector default correlation. Our generalization
method can be applied to any correlated binomial default distribution model
which has explicit relations to the conditional default probabilities or
conditional default correlations, e.g. Credit Risk${}^{+}$, implied default
distributions. We also compare some popular CDO pricing models from the
viewpoint of the range of the implied tranche correlation.

for optical tweezers with back-focal-plane photo detection. The method combines
power spectral measurements of thermal motion and the response to a sinusoidal
motion of a translation stage. It consequently does not use the drag
coefficient of the trapped ob ject as an input. Thus, neither the viscosity,
nor the size of the trapped ob ject, nor its distance to nearby surfaces need
to be known. The method requires only a low level of instrumentation and can be
applied in situ in all spatial dimensions. It is both accurate and precise:
true values are returned, with small error-bars. We tested this experimentally,
near and far from surfaces. Both position- and force-calibration were accurate
to within 3%. To calibrate, we moved the sample with a piezo-electric
translation stage, but the laser beam could be moved instead, e.g. by
acousto-optic deflectors. Near surfaces, this precision requires an improved
formula for the hydrodynamical interaction between an infinite plane and a
micro-sphere in non-constant motion parallel to it. We give such a formula.

evaluate seven protein structure comparison methods and two protein sequence
comparison methods. One result is that Krasnogor-Pelta method has less domain
discriminant power than any one of the methods considered by Sierk and Pearson
when using these simple contact maps. In another test, we found that the USM

benchmark of Sierk and Pearson. In any case, its agreement is lower than the
one of a standard sequential alignment method, SSEARCH. Finally, we manually
found lots of small subsets of the database that are better clustered using
SSEARCH than USM, to confirm that Krasnogor-Pelta's conclusions were based on

  quant-ph/0504085 by generalizing both main theorems",,,,"quant-ph cs.CC",,"  Local Search problem, which finds a local minimum of a black-box function on
a given graph, is of both practical and theoretical importance to combinatorial
optimization, complexity theory and many other areas in theoretical computer
science. In this paper, we study the problem in the randomized and quantum
query models and give new lower and upper bound techniques in both models.
  The lower bound technique works for any graph that contains a product graph
as a subgraph. Applying it to the Boolean hypercube {0,1}^n and the constant
dimensional grids [n]^d, two particular product graphs that recently drew much
attention, we get the following tight results:
  RLS({0,1}^n) = \Theta(2^{n/2}n^{1/2}), QLS({0,1}^n) = \Theta(2^{n/3}n^{1/6}),
  RLS([n]^d) = \Theta(n^{d/2}) for d \geq 4, QLS([n]^d) = \Theta(n^{d/3}) for d
\geq 6.
  Here RLS(G) and QLS(G) are the randomized and quantum query complexities of
Local Search on G, respectively. These improve the previous results by Aaronson
[STOC'04], Ambainis (unpublished) and Santha and Szegedy [STOC'04].
  Our new algorithms work well when the underlying graph expands slowly. As an
application to [n]^2, a new quantum algorithm using O(\sqrt{n}(\log\log
n)^{1.5}) queries is given. This improves the previous best known upper bound
of O(n^{2/3}) (Aaronson, [STOC'04]), and implies that Local Search on grids
exhibits different properties in low dimensions.

the case of mixed states by utilizing the kronecker product approximate
technique. As applications, we give the analytic approximation of the criterion
