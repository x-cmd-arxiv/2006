gravitationally-lensed QSO APM 08279+5255 was obtained with the IRCS mounted on
the Subaru Telescope using the AO system. We detected strong NaI D 5891,5897
doublet absorption in high-redshift DLAs at z=1.062 and 1.181, confirming the
presence of NaI, which was first reported for the rest-frame UV NaI
3303.3,3303.9 doublet by Petitjean et al. This is the first detection of NaI D
absorption in a high-redshift (z>1) DLA. In addition, we detected a new NaI
component in the z=1.062 DLA and four new components in the z=1.181 DLA. Using
an empirical relationship between NaI and HI column density, we found that all
""components"" have large HI column density, so that each component is classified
as DLA absorption. We also detected strong NaI D absorption associated with a
MgII system at z=1.173. Because no other metal absorption lines were detected
in this system at the velocity of the NaI absorption in previously reported
optical spectra (observed 3.6 years ago), we interpret this NaI absorption
cloud probably appeared in the line of sight toward the QSO after the optical
observation. This newly found cloud is likely to be a DLA based upon its large
estimated HI column density. We found that the N(NaI)/N(CaII) ratios in these
DLAs are systematically smaller than those observed in the Galaxy; they are
more consistent with the ratios seen in the Large Magellanic Cloud. This is
consistent with dust depletion generally being smaller in lower metallicity
environments. However, all five clouds of the z=1.181 system have a high
N(NaI)/N(CaII) ratio, which is characteristic of cold dense gas. We tentatively
suggest that the host galaxy of this system may be the most significant
contributor to the gravitational-lens toward APM 08279+5255.

monitored the star with the RXTE, the X-ray flux varied in phase with its

30--40% larger than the B amplitudes, suggesting the seat of the cycles is
circumstellar. The cycle lengths constantly change and can damp or grow on

of massive stars as supernovae is provided by the accumulating evidence for
asymmetry in the explosion. Indirect evidence comes from high pulsar
velocities, associations of supernovae with long-soft gamma-ray bursts, and
asymmetries in late-time emission-line profiles. Spectropolarimetry provides a
direct probe of young supernova geometry, with higher polarization generally
indicating a greater departure from spherical symmetry. Large polarizations
have been measured for 'stripped-envelope' (that is, type Ic) supernovae, which
confirms their non-spherical morphology; but the explosions of massive stars
with intact hydrogen envelopes (type II-P supernovae) have shown only weak
polarizations at the early times observed. Here we report multi-epoch
spectropolarimetry of a classic type II-P supernova that reveals the abrupt
appearance of significant polarization when the inner core is first exposed in
the thinning ejecta (~90 days after explosion). We infer a departure from
spherical symmetry of at least 30 per cent for the inner ejecta. Combined with
earlier results, this suggests that a strongly non-spherical explosion may be a
generic feature of core-collapse supernovae of all types, where the asphericity
in type II-P supernovae is cloaked at early times by the massive, opaque,
hydrogen envelope.

ratio. The modes are the result of polarization evolution of the original
natural waves in the hot magnetized weakly inhomogeneous plasma of pulsar
magnetosphere. In the course of wave mode coupling, the linearly polarized
natural waves acquire purely orthogonal elliptical polarizations. Further on,
as the waves pass through the cyclotron resonance, they become non-orthogonal.
The pulse-to-pulse fluctuations of the final polarization characteristics and
the intensity ratio of the modes are attributed to the temporal fluctuations in
the plasma flow.
  The model suggested allows to reproduce the basic features of the
one-dimensional distributions of the individual-pulse polarization
characteristics. Besides that, propagation origin of pulsar polarization
implies a certain correlation between the mode ellipticity and position angle.
On a qualitative level, for different sets of parameters, the expected
correlations appear compatible with the observed ones. Further theoretical
studies are necessary to establish the quantitative correspondence of the model
to the observational results and to develop a technique of diagnostics of

power-law relation having the same index (1.2) as previously reported for the
hard state, but shifted by a factor ~2. Furthermore, it is shown that the
change in the frequency relation seen during the transitions can be explained
by invoking a shift of one Lorentzian component to a higher harmonic, and we
explore the possible support for this interpretation in the other component
parameters. With the improved soft state results we study the evolution of the
fractional variance for each temporal component. This approach indicates that
the two Lorentzian components are connected to each other, and unrelated to the
power-law component in the power spectrum, pointing to at least two separate
emission components.

characterized in the classic Becker-D\""oring kinetic equations with the

number of monomers decreases, many clusters of small size are produced and a
continuous size distribution is created. During the second era, nucleii are
increasing steadily in size in such a way that their distribution appears as a
wave front advancing towards the critical size for steady nucleation. The
nucleation rate at critical size is negligible during this era. After the wave
front reaches critical size, it ignites the creation of supercritical clusters
at a rate that increases monotonically until its steady value is reached.
Analytical formulas for the transient nucleation rate and the time lag are
obtained that improve classical ones and compare very well with direct
numerical solutions. In addition, we propose and solve numerically a modified

truncated power law. The measured crossover time is indistinguishable within
experimental uncertainty for core and core/shell NRs, and for core NRs with
different ligands, indicating that surface passivation does not affect the
blinking statistics significantly. We find that at fixed excitation intensity,
the inverse crossover time increases approximately linearly with increasing NR
aspect ratio; for a given sample, the inverse crossover time increases very
gradually with increasing excitation intensity. The measured per-particle
absorption cross section for all samples indicates that the change in NR
absorption cross-section with sample size can account for some but not all of

impurities strongly influences the low-energy physics. The diversity of energy
scales and the competition of correlations in interacting Fermi systems can be
treated very efficiently with the functional renormalization group (fRG),
describing the gradual evolution from a microscopic model Hamiltonian to the
effective low-energy action as a function of a continuously decreasing energy
cutoff. The fRG provides the universal low-energy asymptotics as well as
nonuniversal properties, and in particular an answer to the important question
at what scale the ultimate asymptotics sets in.
  We investigate the influence of impurities on spectral and transport
properties of fermionic lattice models with short-range interactions. The
results capture relevant energy scales and crossover phenomena, in addition to
the universal low-energy asymptotics. For weak and intermediate impurity
strengths the asymptotic behavior is approached only at rather low energy
scales, accessible only for very large systems. For spin-1/2 systems
two-particle backscattering leads to striking effects, which are not captured
if the bulk system is approximated by its low-energy fixed point, the Luttinger
model. In particular, the expected decrease of spectral weight near the
impurity and of the conductance at low energy scales is often preceded by a
pronounced increase, and the asymptotic power laws are modified by logarithmic
corrections.

state evolving from the Mott insulator for high-Tc cuprates. Casting the
Coulomb interaction in terms of composite-fermions via the gauge flux
attachment facility, we show that instanton events in the Matsubara ""imaginary
time,"" labeled by topological winding numbers, are essential configurations of
the phase field dual to the charge. In analogy to the usual phase transition
that is characterized by a sudden change of the symmetry, the topological phase
transitions are governed by a discontinuous change of the topological numbers
signaled by the divergence of the zero-temperature topological susceptibility.
This defines a quantum criticality ruled by topologically conserved numbers
rather than the Landau principle of the symmetry breaking. We show that in the
limit of strong correlations topological charge is linked to the average
electronic filling number and the topological susceptibility to the electronic
compressibility of the system. We exploit the impact of these nontrivial U(1)
instanton phase field configurations for the cuprate phase diagram which
displays the ""hidden"" quantum critical point covered by the superconducting
lobe in addition to a sharp crossover between a compressible normal ""strange

marks the Mott insulator. Finally, we argue that the existence of robust
quantum numbers explains the stability against small perturbation of the system

emphasis is laid on the investigation of the effect of geometric frustration,
which is generated by the competition between Heisenberg- and Ising-type
exchange interactions. It is found that an interplay between the geometric
frustration and quantum effects gives rise to several quantum ground states
with entangled spin states in addition to some semi-classically ordered ones.
Among the most interesting results to emerge from our study one could mention a
rigorous evidence for quantized plateux in magnetization curves, an appearance
of the round minimum in the thermal dependence of susceptibility times
temperature data, double-peak zero-field specific heat curves, or an enhanced
magnetocaloric effect when the frustration comes into play. The triple-peak
specific heat curve is also detected when applying small external field to the

conclusion that for infinite-dimensional topologies the critical frequency for

describes the relaxation of the initial coil into a flat-shaped layer for the
cases of both Rouse and Zimm dynamics. For Rouse dynamics the characteristic
times for attaining equilibrium values of the gyration radius components
perpendicular and parallel to the interface are predicted to scale with block
length $M$ and chain length $N$ as $\tau_{\perp} \propto M^{1+2\nu}$ (here
$\nu\approx 0.6$ is the Flory exponent) and as $\tau_{\parallel} \propto N^2$,
although initially the characteristic coil flattening time is predicted to
scale with block size as $\propto M$. Since typically $N\gg M$ for multiblock
copolymers, our results suggest that the flattening dynamics proceeds faster
perpendicular rather than parallel to the interface, in contrast to the case of
Zimm dynamics where the two components relax with comparable rate, and proceed
considerably slower than in the Rouse case.
  We also demonstrate that, in the case of Rouse dynamics, these scaling
predictions agree well with the results of Monte Carlo simulations of the
localization dynamics. A comparison to the localization dynamics of {\em
random} copolymers is also carried out.

the information about the matter that made it? We treat the states of the

caustics are shifted and acquire a finite diamond shape. Sources inside the
caustics produce four sequences of relativistic images. On the other hand,
retro-lensing caustics are only shifted while remaining point-like to the

based on calculations that rely on Vector Meson Dominance (VMD). VMD was
invented in order to describe the interaction of electrons with hadrons (the
rho meson and pions). The method has been used also as a tool in the study of
Technicolor phenomenology. Nevertheless there are evidences in the sense that,
even in its original, context VMD is not completely realized. In this work we
investigate the consequences of a deviation from complete VMD for the
phenomenology of colored technihadrons. We focus specially on the production of
the color octet technirho and color triplet technipions. We found that a
relative small direct coupling of the proto-technirho to quarks is enough to
suppress or even eliminate the interaction among quarks and the physical
technirho. On the other hand, it is possible to suppress the coupling of the
physical technirho to technipions but in this case a large interaction among
the technipions and the proto-gluon must be introduced. The consequences for
the limits on the mass of the color octet technirho are also investigated.

successes of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). However the
successful regions of parameter space allowed by WMAP and collider constraints

and Electroweak Symmetry Breaking (EWSB) and explore regions of MSSM parameter
space with non-universal gaugino and third family scalar masses in which
neutralino dark matter may be implemented naturally. In particular allowing
non-universal gauginos opens up the bulk region that allows Bino annihilation
via t-channel slepton exchange, leading to ``supernatural dark matter''
corresponding to no fine-tuning at all with respect to dark matter. By contrast
we find that the recently proposed ``well tempered neutralino'' regions involve
substantial fine-tuning of MSSM parameters in order to satisfy the dark matter
constraints, although the fine tuning may be ameliorated if several
annihilation channels act simultaneously. Although we have identified regions
of ``supernatural dark matter'' in which there is no fine tuning to achieve
successful dark matter, the usual MSSM fine tuning to achieve EWSB always
remains.

twistor string theory, trying to be self-contained. We first review the
construction of non-anticommutative N=4 super Yang-Mills theory and discuss a
Drinfeld-twist which allows to regain a twisted supersymmetry in the
non-anticommutative setting. This symmetry then leads to twisted chiral rings
and supersymmetric Ward-Takahashi identities, which, when combined with the
usual naturalness argument by Seiberg, could yield non-renormalization theorems
for non-anticommutative field theories. The major part of this thesis consists
of a discussion of various geometric aspects of the Penrose-Ward transform. We
present in detail the case of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory and its self-dual
truncation. Furthermore, we study reductions of the supertwistor space to
exotic supermanifolds having even nilpotent dimensions as well as dimensional
reductions to mini-supertwistor and mini-superambitwistor spaces. Eventually,
we present two pairs of matrix models in the context of twistor string theory,

another example. Assuming that such an open system is all one wants to observe,

complex) is relevant to the observations, or, in other words, how big a part of

coupling and its coupled and decoupled components, showing, in particular, that
it is only the system's unique minimal extension that is relevant to its
dynamics, and this extension often is tiny part of the original conservative
system. We also give a scenario explaining why certain degrees of freedom of a

compound, ignition delay times of hydrocarbon-oxygen-argon mixtures with fuel
equivalence ratios from 0.5 to 2 were measured behind reflected shock waves for
temperatures from 1330 to 1800 K and pressures from 6.7 to 9 bar. The results
show a similar reactivity for the three isomers. A detailed kinetic mechanism
has been proposed, which reproduces our experimental results, as well as some
literature data obtained in a plug flow reactor at 1155 K showing a clear
difference of reactivity between the three isomers of xylene. The main reaction
paths have been determined by sensitivity and flux analyses and have allowed
the differences of reactivity to be explained.

  Geometry, Moments and Gaussization",,,,,"physics.soc-ph cond-mat.other q-fin.ST",,"  This paper continues a series of studies devoted to analysis of the bivariate
probability distribution P(x,y) of two consecutive price increments x (push)
and y (response) at intraday timescales for a group of stocks. Besides the
asymmetry properties of P(x,y) such as Market Mill dependence patterns
described in preceding paper [1], there are quite a few other interesting
geometrical properties of this distribution discussed in the present paper,
e.g. transformation of the shape of equiprobability lines upon growing distance
from the origin of xy plane and approximate invariance of P(x,y) with respect
to rotations at the multiples of $\pi/2$ around the origin of xy plane. The
conditional probability distribution of response P(y|x) is found to be markedly
non-gaussian at small magnitude of pushes and tending to more gauss-like
behavior upon growing push magnitude. The volatility of P(y|,x) measured by the
absolute value of the response shows linear dependence on the absolute value of
the push, and the skewness of P(y|x) is shown to inherit a sign of the push.
The conditional dynamics approach applied in this study is compared to
regression models of AR-ARCH class.

"physics/0603104","Daniela Mugnai","D. Mugnai","Bessel-X waves: superluminal propagation and the Minkowski space-time","4 pages, 3 figures",,,,"physics.optics",,"  Superluminal behavior has been extensively studied in recent years,
especially with regard to the topic of superluminality in the propagation of a
signal. Particular interest has been devoted to Bessel-X waves propagation,
since some experimental results showed that these waves have both phase and
group velocities greater that light velocity c. However, because of the lack of
an exact definition of signal velocity, no definite answer about the signal
propagation (or velocity of information) has been found. The present paper is a
short note that deals in a general way with this vexed question. By analyzing
the field of existence of the Bessel X-wave in pseudo-Euclidean space-time, it
is possible to give a general description of the propagation, and to overcome
the specific question related to a definition of signal velocity.

relationship with quantum phase transitions. Focusing on the concurrence which
characterizes the two-spin entanglement, we show that for first-order
transition, this quantity is singular but continuous at the transition point,
contrary to the common belief. We also propose a conjecture for the concurrence
of arbitrary symmetric states which connects it with a recently proposed
criterion for bipartite entanglement.
