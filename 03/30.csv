(Dall'Osso et al. 2005) and compare it to observed properties of the two
candidate ultrashort period binaries RX J0806+15 and RX J1914+24 . We consider
the measured orbital periods, period derivatives and inferred X-ray
luminosities of these two sources and find constraints on system parameters in
order for the model to account for them. We find that these properties point to
the two sources being in different regimes of the UIM, with the requirement of
low magnetic moment primaries ($\sim 10^{30} G cm^3$) for both. Given this weak
magnetization, RX J0806+15 has a sufficiently low luminosity that it can be
interpreted as having a primary spin almost synchronous to and just slightly
slower than the orbital motion. Its measured orbital spin-up is only slightly
affected by spin-orbit coupling and is mostly due to GW emission. RX J1914+24,
on the other hand, is too bright in X-rays and has too slow an orbital spin-up
for the same regime to apply. We suggest that this binary system may be
emitting GWs at a significantly higher rate than implied by its measured
$\dot{\omega}_o = 6 \times 10^{-17} rad s^{-2}$. The latter is explained, in
this framework, by the primary spin being slightly faster than the orbital
motion ($\alpha <or= 1.1$). In this case, the associated spin-orbit coupling
transfers to the orbit a significant amount of angular momentum, thus partially
balancing that lost to GW emission. All expectations can be tested in the near
future to confirm the viability of the model.

microwave background radiation, as well as the expansion of the universe, cause
cosmic rays to lose energy in a way that depends on the distance from the
cosmic nray source to the earth. Because of this, there is a correlation
between cosmic ray energies and the average redshift of their origin. This
correlation may be exploited to measure the evolution of the sources of cosmic
rays.
  Sky surveys of Quasi Stellar Objects (QSO's) and Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN's), made at optical and x-ray wavelengths, are consistent in showing that
the evolution of such objects exhibits a break at a redshift, z, of about 1.6.
At smaller redshifts, the luminosity density of QSO's and AGN's follows a
$(1+z)^m$ distribution, with $m \sim 2.6$, and exhibit a much flatter
distribution above the break. Measurements of the star formation rate are also
consistent with this picture.
  If QSO's and AGN's are sources of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays the break in
their evolution should appear in the cosmic ray spectrum at an energy of about
$10^{17.6}$ eV. This is the energy of the second knee.

the accretion stream-disc impact region. The He II emission is strongly
phase-dependent, suggesting it originates exclusively within a hot cavity at
the initial impact. We map the ionization structure of the stream-disc
interaction region. One possible interpretation of this is that the Balmer
hotspot lies downstream of the He II hotspot in the outer accretion disc, with
the He I and Ca II hotspots at intermediate locations between the two. This
suggests that Balmer emission is suppressed until material has cooled somewhat
downstream of the impact site and is able to recombine. We favour a phase
offset of 0.15+/-0.04 between the photometric ephemeris and inferior
conjunction of the mass donor. The white dwarf contributes significantly to the
optical continuum, with broad Balmer absorption and narrow Mg II 4481

relate to a snapshot distribution of supernova-remnant voids, although somewhat
artificially constrained by the non-overlap criterion. In the second approach,
a simplified time evolution (considering momentum conservation as the only
governing constraint during interactions) is followed as SN populate the space
with the associated input mass and energy.

dynamics of atomic and molecular clouds in the interstellar medium (ISM).
Nonlinear hydrodynamic flows are a key component to the ISM. One route by which
nonlinear flows arise is the onset and evolution of interfacial instabilities.
Interfacial instabilities act to modify the interface between gas components at
different densities and temperatures. Such an interface may be subject to a
host of instabilities, including the Rayleigh-Taylor, Kelvin-Helmholtz, and
Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities. Recently, a new density interface instability
was identified. This self-gravity interfacial instability (SGI) causes any
displacement of the interface to gr ow on roughly a free-fall time scale, even
when the perturbation wavelength is much less than the Jeans length. In
previous work, we used numerical simulations to confirm the expectations of
linear theory and examine the nonlinear evolution of the SGI. We now continue
our study by generalizing our initial conditions to allow the acceleration due
to self-gravity to be non-zero across the interface. We also consider the
behaviour of the SGI for perturbation wavelengths near the Jeans wavelength. We
conclude that the action of self-gravity across a density interface may play a
significant role in the ISM either by fueling the growth of new instabilities
or modifying the evolution of existing instabilities.

dynamical and hydrodynamical interaction between the Clouds about ~ 0.2 Gyr ago
can form the apparently off-center bar and peculiar HI spirals of the LMC. The
present spatial distributions of young stars with ages less than 20 Myr in the
LMC can be significantly asymmetric and clumpy owing to the interaction. A
small but non-negligible fraction of stellar and gaseous components can be
transferred from the SMC into the LMC during the interaction to form diffuse
halo components around the LMC. The burst of star formation in the SMC can be
synchronized with that of the LMC about 0.2 Gyr ago in some models. New stars
can form from gas in the SMC's tidal tails, one of which can be observed as the
Magellanic Bridge (MB). The metallicity distribution function of new stars in
the MB has a peak of [Fe/H] ~ -0.8, which is significantly smaller than the
stellar metallicity of the SMC. Based on these results, we discuss the origin
of 30 Doradus, the southern molecular ridge of the LMC, the globular cluster

\~90 degrees. One outflow exhibits a cone-like red-shifted morphology with a
jet-like blue-shifted counterpart where a blue counter-cone can only be
tentatively identified. The SiO(1-0) data suggest the presence of a third

opacities with increasing velocities. The other seven detected molecular
species - also high-density tracers like CH3CN, CH3OH, HCOOCH3 - are all ~1-2''
offset from the mm continuum peak, but spatially associated with a strong
molecular outflow peak and a cm emission feature indicative of a thermal jet.
This spatial displacement between the molecular lines and the mm continuum
emission could be either due to an unresolved sub-source at the position of the
cm feature, or the outflow/jet itself alters the chemistry of the core
enhancing the molecular abundances toward that region. A temperature estimate
based on the CH3CN(12_k-11_k) lines suggests temperatures of the order 150K. A
velocity analysis of the high-density tracing molecules reveals that at the
given spatial resolution none of them shows any coherent velocity structure
which would be consistent with a rotating disk. We discuss this lack of
rotation signatures and attribute it to intrinsic difficulties to
observationally isolate massive accretion disks from the surrounding dense gas
envelopes and the molecular outflows.

galaxy formation in which the higher is the mass of the galaxy, the shorter are
the infall and the star formation timescales. In particular, by means of our
model, we are able to reproduce the overabundance of Mg relative to Fe,
observed in the nuclei of bright ellipticals, and its increase with galactic

form stars and develop a galactic wind very quickly, compared to the central

This range is found to be limited (i) by the size of the dark matter simulation
used -- which introduces finite volume effects at large scales -- and by the
mass resolution of this simulation -- which introduces incompleteness at
apparent magnitudes fainter than $r\sim 20$. We then focus on the small scale
clustering properties of galaxies and investigate the behaviour of three
different prescriptions for positioning galaxies within haloes of dark matter.
We show that galaxies are poor tracers both of DM particles or DM
sub-structures, within groups and clusters. Instead, SDSS data tells us that
the distribution of galaxies lies somewhat in between these two populations.
This confirms the general theoretical expectation from numerical simulations

immersed in a medium with the dielectric constant $\epsilon$ and a certain
elasticity, which could be determined by measured sonic speed in the metal. The
obtained expression of effective electron-electron interaction (EEI) potential
unambiguously implied that, contrary to the suggestions of BCS theory, it is
its long-wave limit which is responsible for the emergence of bound
two-electron states and, consequently, for gap formation in one-electron
spectrum of the metal. However, the existence of singularities in the EEI
potential expression continued to pose a problem, which did not allow a
calculation of the gap value for specific superconducting materials, first of
all, for metals belonging to periodic table (PT). In the present work, I
suggest taking into account matrix elements traditionally attributed to
electron scattering in EEI effective potential calculations. For
superconductors that has been made on the basis of a semiconductor material by
implanting electro-active defects into it, this inclusion results in the
appearance of an uncertainty of electron momentum $\delta p \sim l^{- 1}$,
where $l$ is the electron free path. When considering pure PT metals,
Hamiltonian terms relating to creation and annihilaton of phonons should be
taken into account, which also produces an uncertainty of electron momentum.
This uncertainty results in a regularization of EEI potential expression and,
therefore, in a possibility of examination of physical properties of specific
superconductors. Results of calculation of superconductivity gap value for a
range of simple metals (Al, Zn, Pb, Sn) confirm the consistency of the
developed approach.

N fluctuation by invoking discreteness of spacetime at the Planck scale due to
quantum gravity. In this paper we shed light on these questions by developing
an analogy between the cosmological constant and the surface tension of
membranes. The ``cosmological constant problem'' has a natural analogue in the
membrane context: the vanishingly small surface tension of fluid membranes
provides an example where question a) above arises and is answered. We go on to
find a direct analogue of Sorkin's proposal for answering question b) in the

the Universe within supersymmetry. In a non-supersymmetric case the inflaton
usually decays via preheating unless its couplings to other fields are very
small. Naively one would expect that supersymmetry enhances bosonic preheating
as it introduces new scalars such as squarks and sleptons. On the contrary, we
point out that preheating is unlikely within supersymmetry. The reason is that
flat directions in the scalar potential, classified by gauge invariant
combinations of slepton and squark fields, are generically displaced towards a
large vacuum expectation value (VEV) in the early Universe. They induce
supersymmetry preserving masses to the inflaton decay products through the
Standard Model Yukawa couplings, which kinematically blocks preheating for VEVs
$> 10^{13}$ GeV. The decay will become allowed only after the flat directions
start oscillating, and once the flat direction VEV is sufficiently redshifted.
For models with weak scale supersymmetry, this generically happens at a Hubble
expansion rate: $H \simeq (10^{-3}-10^{-1}) {\rm TeV}$, at which time the
inflaton decays in the perturbative regime. This is to our knowledge first
analysis where the inflaton decay to the Standard Model particles is treated
properly within supersymmetry. There are number of important consequences: no
overproduction of dangerous supersymmetric relics (particularly gravitinos), no
resonant excitation of superheavy dark matter, and no non-thermal leptogenesis
through non-perturbative creation of the right-handed (s)neutrinos. Finally
supersymmetric flat directions can even spoil hybrid inflation all together by
not allowing the auxiliary field become tachyonic.

transmission rate $\epsilon$. For small values of $\epsilon $ a critical-like
behaviour could be observed, when the acceleration due to radiation pressure
and the deceleration induced by the increasing self-gravity of the brane
roughly compensate each other, and cosmological evolution is approximately the
same as without radiation. Lighter (heavier) branes than those with the
critical energy density will recollapse slower (faster). This feature is
obstructed at high values of $\epsilon $, where the overall effect of the
radiation is to speed-up the recollapse. We determine the maximal value of the
transmission rate for which the critical-like behaviour is observed. We also
study the effect of transmission on the evolution of different source terms of

fermions of negative energy and holes in the sea are identified as

vacuum consists of a sea filled by negative energy bosonic states, while
physical probabilities become always positive definite. We introduce a method

exists a finite R-group scheme, which is a model of Pic_{CK}[r] over R; in
other words, we establish when the N\'eron model of Pic_{CK}[r] is finite. To
this effect, one needs to analyse the points of the N\'eron model over R,
which, in general, do not represent r-torsion line bundles on a semistable
reduction of CK. Instead, we recast the notion of models on a stack-theoretic
base: there, we find finite N\'eron models, which represent r-torsion line
bundles on a stack-theoretic semistable reduction of CK. This allows us to
quantify the lack of finiteness of the classical N\'eron models and finally to
provide an efficient criterion for it.

location of the $i$-th motion is affixed to the initial point of the

permutation of $1,...,N$. Such systems play an important role in quantum
physics in the description of Boson systems at positive temperature $1/\beta$.
  In this paper, we describe the large-N behaviour of the empirical path

the normalised occupation measures of the $N$ motions in terms of large
deviations principles. The rate functions are given as variational formulas
involving certain entropies and Fenchel-Legendre transforms. Consequences are

rate function for the occupation measures of one motion in the limit of
diverging time. This enables us to prove a simple formula for the large-N

Bose Einstein condensate, depends strongly on the number of particles at the
start of the evaporation. A high efficiency can be reached by filling the
magneto-optical trap with a large number of atoms and subsequently transferring
these atoms to the magnetic trap as efficiently as possible. In our case (for
sodium) this efficiency is limited to 1/3, because the magnetic substates of
the F = 1 state, which is used in the trapping process, are equally populated.
This limit can be overcome by spin-polarizing the sample before the transfer.
For sodium atoms, however, the improvement is very small when it is done in a
small magnetic field due to the large number of optical transitions in
combination with the high optical density. In this article we describe
spin-polarizing sodium atoms in a high magnetic field. The transfer efficiency
is increased by a factor of 2. The high magnetic field makes the process also
more robust against variations in the magnetic field, the laser frequency and
the polarization of the laser beam.

particular, an alternative derivation of the effects described by special
relativity is provided, which is based on a description that assumes a
privileged reference frame. The present theory follows the ideas of Lorentz and
Poincare, abandoning a strict view of Einstein's ""equivalence"" of all inertial
frames. The meaning of the Principle of Relativity is discussed and elucidated,
and it is shown that it is not incompatible with the existence of a preferred,
absolute, frame. Most scientists nowadays still consider the basic assumptions
of the theory proposed here to be plain wrong. Moreover, they tend to see an
irreconcilable conflict between the Lorentz-Poincare and the Einstein-Minkowski
formulations. However, as stated by John Bell [Bell1988], although there is a
stringent ""difference in philosophy"" between both views, ""the facts of physics
do not oblige us to accept one philosophy rather than the other"". The validity
of Bell's assertion is unambiguously demonstrated, and it is shown how and why
both approaches do indeed agree in the description of (most of?) the physical
phenomena. Evidently, the physical meaning of the different physical quantities
- such as ""time"", ""speed"", ""simultaneity"" and ""synchronization"" - is quite
different in both programmes. And yet, for perplexing it may look at first
sight, the present theory, developed under the Lorentz-Poincare assumption of a
preferred reference frame, somehow encompasses Einstein's theory. There is no
conflict, as there is one theory. It is stressed that reality is not changed by
the choices one makes to describe it, so it is not changed by the particular
way in which the clocks have been set.
