observations of the host galaxy of GRB 050904 at z=6.295. The host is detected
in the H-band and marginally at 3.6 micron. From these detections, and limits
in the z'-band and 4.5 micron, we infer an extinction-corrected absolute
magnitude, M(UV)=-20.7 mag, or ~L*, a substantial star formation rate of 15
solar masses per year, and a stellar mass of a few 10^9 solar masses. A
comparison to the published sample of spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at
z>5.5 reveals that the host of GRB 050904 would evade detection and/or
confirmation in any of the current surveys due to the lack of detectable
Ly-alpha emission, which is likely the result of dust extinction (A[1200]~1.5
mag). This suggests that not all luminous starburst galaxies at z~6 are
currently being accounted for. Most importantly, using the metallicity of
Z~0.05 solar inferred from the afterglow absorption spectrum, our observations
indicate for the first time that the observed evolution in the mass- and
luminosity-metallicity relations from z=0 to z~2 continues on to z>6. The ease
of measuring redshifts and metallicities from the afterglow emission suggests
that in tandem with the next generation ground- and space-based telescopes, a
GRB mission with dedicated near-IR follow-up can provide unique information on
the evolution of stars and galaxies through the epoch of re-ionization.

requires knowledge of the redshift distribution of the source galaxies. Current
lensing surveys are often calibrated using external redshift samples which span
a significantly smaller sky area in comparison to the lensing survey, and are
thus subject to sample variance. Some future lensing surveys are expected to be
calibrated in the same way, in particular the fainter galaxy populations where
the entire color coverage, and hence photometric redshift estimate, could be
challenging to obtain. Using N-body simulations, we study the impact of this
sample variance on cosmic shear analysis and show that, to first approximation,
it behaves like a shear calibration error 1+/-epsilon. Using the Hubble Deep
Field as a redshift calibration survey could therefore be a problem for current
lensing surveys. We discuss the impact of the redshift distribution sampling
error and a shear calibration error on the design of future lensing surveys,
and find that a lensing survey of area Theta square degrees and limiting
magnitude m_lim}, has a minimum shear and redshift calibration accuracy
requirements given by epsilon = epsilon_0 10^{beta(m_lim-24.5)} / sqrt(Theta/
200). Above that limit, lensing surveys would not reach their full potential.
Using the galaxy number counts from the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, we find
(epsilon_0,beta)=(0.015,-0.18) and (epsilon_0,beta)=(0.011,-0.23) for ground
and space based surveys respectively. Lensing surveys with no or limited
redshift information and/or poor shear calibration accuracy will loose their
potential to analyse the cosmic shear signal in the sub-degree angular scales,
and therefore complete photometric redshift coverage should be a top priority
for future lensing surveys.

Monitor (ASM) on-board the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, however, reprocessing
of the ASM data shows that the source was in fact detected and it was active
for about 50 days. The X-ray spectrum of this transient is fitted equally well
by an absorbed power-law (with a spectral index of 2.5) or multi-colour disk
blackbody model (with kT ~ 2 keV), where we find that the source is highly
absorbed. We detect an unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV flux in the range (2-5)E-9 ergs
cm^{-2} s^{-1}, which at a distance of 8 kpc corresponds to a 0.5-10 keV
luminosity of (1-4)E37 ergs s^{-1}. No pulsations were detected by timing
analysis. A colour-colour diagram from ASM data of different accreting objects
suggests that the transient is a high-mass X-ray binary, as is also suggested
by the high absorption compared to the average interstellar value in the
direction of the source. However, the power-law spectral index is far more
typical of a low-mass X-ray binary. Thus, we are unable to conclusively
identify the nature of the transient. We also report on three sources first
detected by the ASCA Galactic Plane Survey that are close to this transient.

supernova connected with a gamma-ray burst, namely GRB060218/SN2006aj. The
gamma-ray emission and the power-law decaying X-ray afterglow are ascribed to a
highly relativistic jet, while the thermal soft X-rays are thought to be
produced when the radiation-dominated shock breaks from the optically thick
stellar wind. We study the inverse Compton emission of the breakout thermal
soft X-rays scattered by relativistic electrons in the jet forward shock, which
is expected to be at larger radii than the breakout shock. This IC emission
produces sub-GeV to GeV photons, which may be detectable by GLAST. The
detection of such GeV photons simultaneously with the supernova shock breakout
emission would give evidence for the presence of a GRB jet ahead of the shock
while the shock is breaking out. The anisotropic scattering between the X-rays
and relativistic electrons may lead to large angle emission outside of the jet
opening angle. This has implications for the detection of GeV photons from
burstless type Ib/c hypernova shock breakout, which due to its more isotropic
emission might be observed with wide-field X-ray cameras such as LOBSTER.

supernova remnants (SNRs) are derived from the observed thickness of their

electrons, assuming uniform and isotropic turbulence. It is shown that the
magnetic field must be amplified up to values between 250 and 500 microGauss in
the case of Cas A, Kepler, and Tycho, or ~ 100 microGauss in the case of SN
1006 and G347.3-0.5. The diffusion coefficient at the highest electron energy
can also be derived from the data, by relating the X-ray energy cutoff to the
acceleration timescale. Values typically between 1 and 10 times the Bohm
diffusion coefficient are found to be required. We also find interesting
constraints on the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient. This favours
diffusion regimes between the Kraichnan and the Bohm regime, and rejects
turbulence spectrum indices larger than ~ 3/2. Finally, the maximum energy of
the accelerated particles is found to lay between 10^13 and 5 10^13 eV for
electrons, and around Z \times 8 10^14 eV at most for nuclei (or ~ 2.5 times
less if a Bohm diffusion regime is assumed), roughly independently of the
compression ratio assumed at the shock. Even by taking advantage of the
uncertainties on the measured parameters, it appears very difficult for the
considered SNRs in their current stage of evolution to produce protons up to
the knee of the cosmic-ray spectrum, at ~ 3 10^15 eV, and essentially
impossible to accelerate Fe nuclei up to either the ankle at ~ 3 10^18 eV or

analysis of the early and late afterglow emission in both the X-ray and optical
bands, as observed by Swift, a robotic telescope, and the VLT. We compare early
observations with late afterglow observations obtained with Swift and the VLT
in different bands in order to constrain the density of the medium in which the
fireball is expanding. Methods. We have analyzed both the X-ray and the optical
light curves and compared the spectral energy distribution of the afterglow at
two different epochs. Results. We observed an intense rebrightening in the
optical band at about one day after the burst which was not seen in the X-ray
band. This is the first observation of a GRB afterglow in which a rebrightening
is observed in the optical but not in the X-ray band. The lack of detection in
X-ray of such a strong rebrightening at lower energies can be described with a
variable external density profile. In such a scenario, the combined X-ray and
optical observations allow us to derive the matter density at 10^15 cm from the
burst. This is about a factor of 10 higher than in the inner region.

narrow field instruments only 64.5 s after the burst onset. Its very soft
spectrum classifies this event as an X-ray flash. The afterglow X-ray emission
was monitored up to 74 days after the burst. The X-ray light curve initially
decays very fast, subsequently flattens and eventually steepens again, similar
to many X-ray afterglows. The first and second phases end about 172 and 1450 s
after the burst onset, respectively. We find evidence of spectral evolution
from a softer emission with photon index Gamma ~ 3.0 during the initial steep
decay, to a harder emission with Gamma ~ 2.0 during the following evolutionary
phases. The spectra show intrinsic absorption in the host galaxy. The
consistency of the initial photon index with the high energy BAT photon index
suggests that the initial phase of the X-ray light curve may be the low-energy
tail of the prompt emission. The lack of jet break signatures in the X-ray
afterglow light curve is not consistent with empirical relations between the
source rest-frame peak energy and the collimation-corrected energy of the
burst. The standard uniform jet model can give a possible description of the
XRF 050416A X-ray afterglow for an opening angle larger than a few tens of
degrees, although numerical simulations show that the late time decay is
slightly flatter than expected from on-axis viewing of a uniform jet. A
structured Gaussian-type jet model with uniform Lorentz factor distribution and
viewing angle outside the Gaussian core is another possibility, although a full
agreement with data is not achieved with the numerical models explored.

neutron stars that are born with Keplerian frequencies. Employing different
equations of state (EOS), we determine the minimum and maximum neutron star
masses that will allow for deconfinement via spin-down only. We find that the
time to reach deconfinement is strongly dependent on the magnetic field and
that this time is least for EOS that support the largest minimum mass at zero
spin, unless rotational effects on stellar structure are large. For a fiducial
critical density of $5\rho_0$ for the transition to the quark phase
($\rho_0=2.5\times10^{14}$g/cm$^3$ is the saturation density of nuclear
matter), we find that neutron stars lighter than $1.5M_{\odot}$ cannot reach a
deconfined phase. Depending on the EOS, neutron stars of more than
$1.5M_{\odot}$ can enter a quark phase only if they are spinning faster than
about 3 milliseconds as observed now, whereas larger spin periods imply that
they are either already quark stars or will never become one.

stratified, self-gravitating, galactic gas disks, using local numerical MHD
simulations. Our new models extend our previous 2D studies (Kim & Ostriker
2002), which showed that a magnetized spiral shock in a thin disk can undergo
magneto-Jeans instability (MJI), resulting in interarm spur structures and
massive fragments. Similar spur features have recently been seen in
high-resolution observations of several galaxies. Here, we consider two sets of
numerical models: 2D models that use a thick-disk gravitational kernel, and 3D
runs with explicit vertical stratification. When disks are sufficiently
magnetized and self-gravitating, the result in both sorts of models is the
growth of spiral-arm substructure similar to that in our previous razor-thin
models. Reduced self-gravity in thick disks increases the spur spacing to ~10
times the Jeans length at the arm peak. Bound clouds that form from spur
fragmentation have masses ~(1-3)x10^7 Msun each, a factor ~3-8 times larger
than in razor-thin models with the same gas surface density and stellar spiral
arm strength. We find that unmagnetized or weakly magnetized 2D models are
unstable to the wiggle instability (WI) previously identified by Wada & Koda
(2004), and proposed as a potential spur- and clump-forming mechanism.
However,our fully 3D models do not show this effect. Non-steady motions and
strong vertical shear prevent coherent vortical structures from forming,
evidently suppressing the WI that appears in 2D (isothermal) runs. We also find
no clear traces of Parker instability in the nonlinear spiral arm substructures
that emerge (in self-gravitating models), although conceivably Parker modes may
help seed the MJI at early stages since azimuthal wavelengths are similar.

around 0.3 keV, and the long--term spectral evolution. By fitting the
parameters of our realistic self--consistent models to all archival XMM--Newton
observations and available optical data, we show that all observed properties
are consistent with a normal neutron star with a proper radius of about 12 km,
a temperature at the magnetic pole of about 100 eV and a magnetic field
strength of 2-3 x 10^{13} G, with no need to invoke additional emission and
absorption components nor exotic internal composition. The observed variability
of the effective temperature, strength of the spectral feature, and pulsed
fraction are in good agreement with the predictions of our model in which the
star is subject to free precession, producing changes in the angle between the
magnetic field and the rotation axis of tens of degrees with a periodicity of 7
years, as pointed out by other authors on the basis of phenomenological models.
In addition to the evidence of internal toroidal components, we also find
strong evidence of non-dipolar magnetic fields, since all spectral properties
are better reproduced with models with strong quadrupolar components.

time-resolved Stromgren uvy photometry was acquired for KZ Mus. All three stars
are multi-periodic variables, with three (Beta CMa) and four (15 CMa, KZ Mus)
independent pulsation modes. Two of the mode frequencies of 15 CMa are new
discoveries and one of the known modes showed amplitude variations over the
last 33 years. Taken together, this explains the star's diverse behaviour
reported in the literature fully.
  Mode identification by means of the amplitude ratios in the different
passbands suggests one radial mode for each star. In addition, Beta CMa has a
dominant l=2 mode while its third mode is nonradial with unknown l. The
nonradial modes of 15 CMa, which are l <= 3, form an almost equally split
triplet that, if physical, would imply that we see the star under an
inclination angle larger than 55 degrees. The strongest nonradial mode of KZ
Mus is l=2, followed by the radial mode and a dipole mode. Its weakest known
mode is nonradial with unknown l, confirming previous mode identifications for
the star's pulsations.
  The phased light curve for the strongest mode of 15 CMa has a descending
branch steeper than the rising branch. A stillstand phenomenon during the rise
to maximum light is indicated. Given the low photometric amplitude of this
nonradial mode this is at first sight surprising, but it can be explained by
the mode's aspect angle.

hydrodynamic simulations of stellar core collapse and post-bounce evolution.
Different formulations of a modified Newtonian gravitational potential are
presented. Such an effective relativistic potential can be used in an otherwise
standard Newtonian hydrodynamic code. An alternative approximation of general
relativity is the assumption of conformal flatness for the three-metric, and
its extension by adding second post-Newtonian order terms. Using a code which
evolves the coupled system of metric and fluid equations, we apply the various
approximation methods to numerically simulate axisymmetric models for the
collapse of rotating massive stellar cores. We compare the collapse dynamics
and gravitational wave signals (which are extracted using the quadrupole
formula), and thereby assess the quality of the individual approximation
method. It is shown that while the use of an effective relativistic potential
already poses a significant improvement compared to a genuinely Newtonian
approach, the two conformal-flatness-based approximation methods yield even
more accurate results, which are qualitatively and quantitatively very close to
those of a fully general relativistic code even for rotating models which
almost collapse to a black hole.

present a model for the evolution of star-forming clouds enriched by metals and

self-consistent approach, we show that: (i) metals depleted onto dust grains
play a fundamental role, enabling fragmentation to solar or sub-solar mass
scales already at metallicities Zcr = 10^{-6} Zsun; (ii) even at metallicities
as high as 10^{-2} Zsun, metals diffused in the gas-phase lead to fragment mass
scales which are ~ 100 Msun; (iii) C atoms are strongly depleted onto amorphous
carbon grains and CO molecules so that CII plays a minor role in gas cooling,
leaving OI as the main gas-phase cooling agent in low-metallicity clouds. These
conclusions hold independently of the assumed supernova progenitors and suggest
that the onset of low-mass star formation is conditioned to the presence of
dust in the parent clouds.

its sample-to-sample fluctuations inside the spin-glass region ($p_c \le p \le

fluctuations exhibit a cusp-like singularity at $p_c$. Inside the spin-glass

effects are visible, which can be explained for all $p$ by a single exponent
$\omega\approx 2/3$, provided higher-order corrections to scaling are included.

interaction and consequently they are proportional to the electron-electron
interaction constant. We present detailed calculations of the magnitude of the
effect as a function of the temperature, and the direction of the magnetic
field. We show that in the case of a magnetic field oriented parallel to the
sample, the effect exists entirely due to spin-orbit scattering. The
temperature dependence of the magnitude of the effect has an oscillating
character with a characteristic period on the order of the temperature itself.

Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). GPE is a nonlinear Schroedinger equation which
describes the order parameter of such systems at the mean field level. In the
present work, we describe a Fortran 90 computer program developed by us, which
solves the GPE using a basis set expansion technique. In this technique, the
condensate wave function (order parameter) is expanded in terms of the
solutions of the simple-harmonic oscillator (SHO) characterizing the atomic
trap. Additionally, the same approach is also used to solve the problems in
which the trap is weakly anharmonic, and the anharmonic potential can be
expressed as a polynomial in the position operators x, y, and z. The resulting
eigenvalue problem is solved iteratively using either the self-consistent-field
(SCF) approach, or the imaginary time steepest-descent (SD) approach. Our
results for harmonic traps are also compared with those published by other
authors using different numerical approaches, and excellent agreement is
obtained. GPE is also solved for a few anharmonic potentials, and the influence
of anharmonicity on the condensate is discussed. Additionally, the notion of
Shannon entropy for the condensate wave function is defined and studied as a
function of the number of particles in the trap. It is demonstrated numerically
that the entropy increases with the particle number in a monotonic way.

detail to the bare spectrum $\epsilon_{\bf k} = \sqrt{Dk^2 (Dk^2 +
S\omega_0\sin^2\theta_{\bf k})}$, where $D$ is the spin-wave stiffness,
$\theta_{\bf k}$ is the angle between $\bf k$ and the magnetization and
$\omega_0$ is the characteristic dipolar energy. In accordance with previous
results we obtain the thermal renormalization of constants $D$ and $\omega_0$
in the expression for the bare spectrum. Besides, a number of previously
unknown features are revealed. We observe terms which depend on azimuthal angle
of the momentum $\bf k$. It is obtained an isotropic term proportional to $k$
which makes the spectrum linear rather than quadratic when $\sin\theta_{\bf
k}=0$ and $k \ll \omega_0/D$. In particular a spin-wave gap proportional to
$\sin\theta_{\bf k}$ is observed. Essentially, thermal contribution from the
Hartree-Fock diagram to the isotropic correction as well as to the spin-wave
gap are proportional to the demagnetizing factor in the direction of domain
magnetization. This nontrivial behavior is attributed to the long-range nature
of the dipolar interaction. It is shown that the gap screens infrared
singularities of the first 1/S-corrections to the spin-wave stiffness and
longitudinal dynamical spin susceptibility (LDSS) obtained before. We
demonstrate that higher order 1/S-corrections to these quantities are small at
$T\ll\omega_0$. However the analysis of the entire perturbation series is still
required to derive the spectrum and LDSS when $T\gg\omega_0$.

rapidly with decreasing temperature, resulting in the apparent low-$T$ downturn
of the thermal conductivity. We obtain the temperature and magnetic field

temperature range over which the phonon thermal conductivity varies as $T^2$.
This behaviour comes from the fact that transverse phonons propagating along

to be required by the symmetry of the crystal and the superconducting gap,
independent of the model used for the electron-phonon interaction. The

constitute a major obstacle for the operation of superconducting phase qubits.
Since these TLSs can possess remarkably long decoherence times, we show that
such TLSs can themselves be used as qubits, allowing for a well controlled
initialization, universal sets of quantum gates, and readout. Thus, a single
current-biased Josephson junction (CBJJ) can be considered as a multiqubit
register. It can be coupled to other CBJJs to allow the application of quantum
gates to an arbitrary pair of qubits in the system. Our results indicate an
alternative way to realize superconducting quantum information processing.

Non-linear mixing terms of the scalar with a tensor also survive. Because of
these terms physics of DGP is different from that of the scalar sigma model. We
show that the static spherically-symmetric solution of the scalar model found

a consequence of this, the interesting result on hidden superluminality
uncovered recently in the scalar model in hep-th/0602178, is not applicable to
the DGP model of gravity. While the sigma model violates positivity constraints
imposed by analyticity and the Froissart bound, the latter cannot be applied
here because of the long-range tensor interactions that survive in the
decoupling limit. We discuss further the properties of the Schwarzschild
solution that exhibits the gravitational mass-screening phenomenon.

between a stack of N D3-branes and a single probe brane. When using light cone
gauge, it is clear that the sum of planar diagrams (relevant in the large-N

calculation suggests that the Hamiltonian of the closed string is of the form H
= H0 - (g_s N) P. The same form of the Hamiltonian follows from considering the
bosonic part of the closed string action propagating in the full D3-brane
background suggesting the naive calculation captures the correct information.
Further, we compute explicitly P from the open string side in the bosonic
sector and show that, in a certain limit, the result agrees with the closed
string expectations up to extra terms due to the fact that we ignored the
fermionic sector. We briefly discuss extensions of the results to the
superstring and to the sum of planar diagrams in field theory. In particular we
argue that the calculations seem valid whenever one can define a sigma <-> tau
dual Hamiltonian in the world-sheet which in principle does not require the
existence of a string action. This seems more generic than the existence of a
string dual in the large-N limit.

traced out through the parameterized evolution of spacetime events, advancing
or retreating with respect to the laboratory clock, with negative energy
trajectories appearing as antiparticles when the observer describes the
evolution using the laboratory clock. The associated gauge theory describes
local interactions between events (correlated by the invariant parameter)
mediated by five off-shell gauge fields. These gauge fields are shown to
transform tensorially under under space and time reflections, unlike the
standard Maxwell fields, and the interacting quantum theory therefore remains
manifestly Lorentz covariant. Charge conjugation symmetry in the quantum theory
is achieved by simultaneous reflection of the sense of evolution and the fifth
scalar field. Applying this procedure to the classical gauge theory leads to a
purely classical manifestation of charge conjugation, placing the CPT
symmetries on the same footing in the classical and quantum domains. In the
resulting picture, interactions do not distinguish between particle and
antiparticle trajectories -- charge conjugation merely describes the
interpretation of observed negative energy trajectories according to the

simultaneously orbifolding the Gepner and the torus internal sectors, is
performed. The embedding of the orbifold action in the brane sector breaks the
original gauge groups and leads to N=1 supersymmetric chiral spectra. Whenever
even orbifold action on the torus is considered, new branes, with worldvolume
transverse to torus coordinates, must be included. The detailed rules for

observed, so that a clear leader and follower cannot be identified. We define
an algorithm to determine which laser leads the other when the synchronization

social, technological, and information networks? Many studies have discovered
patterns in static graphs, identifying properties in a single snapshot of a
large network, or in a very small number of snapshots; these include heavy
tails for in- and out-degree distributions, communities, small-world phenomena,
and others. However, given the lack of information about network evolution over
long periods, it has been hard to convert these findings into statements about
trends over time.
  Here we study a wide range of real graphs, and we observe some surprising
phenomena. First, most of these graphs densify over time, with the number of
edges growing super-linearly in the number of nodes. Second, the average
distance between nodes often shrinks over time, in contrast to the conventional
wisdom that such distance parameters should increase slowly as a function of
the number of nodes (like O(log n) or O(log(log n)).
  Existing graph generation models do not exhibit these types of behavior, even
at a qualitative level. We provide a new graph generator, based on a ``forest
fire'' spreading process, that has a simple, intuitive justification, requires
very few parameters (like the ``flammability'' of nodes), and produces graphs
exhibiting the full range of properties observed both in prior work and in the
present study.
  We also notice that the ``forest fire'' model exhibits a sharp transition
between sparse graphs and graphs that are densifying. Graphs with decreasing
distance between the nodes are generated around this transition point.

cross sections - are presented. The impedance dependence on the beam velocity
exhibits some unusual features: for example, the reactive impedance, which
dominates in the ultrarelativistic limit, can vanish at a certain beam
velocity, or its magnitude can exceed the ultrarelativistic value many times.

electrical properties of liquid helium are expected to be sufficient to meet

application of the necessary voltages from an external source to the

pressure corresponding to 4.38 K. These fields hold for more than 11 hours with

important part of many devices involving charged particle beams. The space
charge effect imposes a limit on the current that can be transported through a
drift space. A reasonable estimate of the space charge limited current density
(J_{SCL}^{c}) in 'closed' drift tubes can be obtained from electrostatic
considerations despite the fact that charge particle transport results in
electromagnetic radiation. We deal here with the situation where the drift tube
is 'open' to electromagnetic radiation, for instance due to the presence of a
dielectric window. In such cases, electromagnetic radiation leaks out of the
window which results in a decrease in the average kinetic energy of electrons.
If the injected current density is much lower than J_{SCL}^{c}, power loss does
not result in a change in the transmitted current. As the injected current
density is increased, power loss increases and at a critical value lower than
J_{SCL}^{c}, reflection of electrons begins to occur. We also show that the
lowering of the space charge limited current on account of power loss can be
incorporated in the standard electrostatic picture by introducing an effective
voltage for the collection plate.

agreement with the experimental results has been obtained both for autoignition
delay times and for the distribution of products. A flow rate analysis reveals
that the crossed reactions between species coming from both reactants (like
H-abstractions or combinations) are negligible in the main flow consumption of
the studied hydrocarbons. The ways of formation of the main primary products
observed and the most sensitive rate constants have been identified.

  systems","29 pages, 0 figure, Transformation to format of AMTP for submission
  to Advances in Mathematical and Theoretical Physics",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The formalism of the particle dynamics in the space-time, where motion of
free particles is primordially stochastic, is considered. The conventional
dynamic formalism, obtained for the space-time, where the motion of free
particles is primordially deterministic, seems to be unsuitable. The
statistical ensemble of stochastic (or deterministic) systems is considered to
be the main object of dynamics. At such a logical reloading the statistical
description becomes a component of dynamics, and capacities of dynamics
increase. At such an approach one can describe deterministic, stochastic and
quantum particles by means of the uniform technique. The quantum particle is
described as a stochastic particle, i.e. without a reference to the quantum
principles. Besides, by means of this technique one can describe classical
inviscid fluid. There are four different versions of the formalism: (1)
description in Euler dynamic variables, (2) description in Lagrange dynamic
variables, (3) description in terms of the generalized stream function, (4)
description in terms of the wave function. The uniform formalism is purely
dynamic. Even describing stochastic systems, it does not refer to probability
and probabilistic structures. In relativistic case the uniform formalism can
describe pair production and pair annihilation.

time dependent. An analytic solution for the system operators is obtained. We
show that different nonclassical effects arise in the dynamics of the
population inversion, depending on the initial states of the vibrational
motion. We study in detail the entanglement degree and demonstrate how the
input pair cat state is required for initiating the long living entanglement.
This long living entanglement is damp out with an increase in the number
difference $q$. Owing to the properties of entanglement measures, the results
are checked using another entanglement measure (high order linear entropy).

transition linewidth is smaller than the trap frequency, hence when sideband
cooling could be implemented. We show that quantum correlations between the
mechanical actions of laser and cavity field can lead to an enhancement of the
cooling efficiency with respect to sideband cooling. Such interference effects
are found when the resonator losses prevail over spontaneous decay and over the
rates of the coherent processes characterizing the dynamics.

that it is protected from a given set of error operators. Both involve encoding
information by means of subsystems. One is initialization-based error
protection, which involves a quantum operation that is applied before error
events occur. The other is operator quantum error correction, which uses a
recovery operation applied after the errors. Together, the two approaches make
it clear how quantum information can be stored at all stages of a process
involving alternating error and quantum operations. In particular, there is
always a subsystem that faithfully represents the desired quantum information.
We give a definition of faithful realization of quantum information and show
that it always involves subsystems. This justifies the ""subsystems principle""
for realizing quantum information. In the presence of errors, one can make use
of noiseless, (initialization) protectable, or error-correcting subsystems. We
give an explicit algorithm for finding optimal noiseless subsystems. Finding
optimal protectable or error-correcting subsystems is in general difficult.
Verifying that a subsystem is error-correcting involves only linear algebra. We
discuss the verification problem for protectable subsystems and reduce it to a
simpler version of the problem of finding error-detecting codes.

textbooks used to teach Quantum Mechanics, that it is a difficult task to apply
the time evolution operator Exp{-itH/h} on an initial wave function. That is to
say, because the hamiltonian operator generally is the sum of two operators,
then it is a difficult task to apply the time evolution operator on an initial
wave function f(x,0), for it implies to apply terms operators like (a+b)^n. A
possible solution of this problem is to factorize the time evolution operator
and then apply successively the individual exponential operator on the initial
wave function. However, the exponential operator does not directly factorize,
i. e. Exp{a+b} is not equal to Exp{a}Exp{b}. In this work we present a useful
procedure for factorizing the time evolution operator when the argument of the
exponential is a sum of two operators, which obey specific commutation
relations. Then, we apply the exponential operator as an evolution operator for
the case of elementary unidimensional potentials, like the particle subject to
a constant force and the harmonic oscillator. Also, we argue about an apparent
paradox concerning the time evolution operator and non-spreading wave packets
addressed previously in the literature.

formulated. Three designs were proposed to test the entangled photon states
created by the spontaneous parametric down conversion. The time allocations
between the measurement vectors were designed to consider the anisotropic
deviation of the generated photon states from the maximally entangled states.
The designs were evaluated in terms of the p-value based on the observed data.
It has been experimentally demonstrated that the optimal time allocation
between the coincidence and anti-coincidence measurement vectors improves the
entanglement test. A further improvement is also experimentally demonstrated by
optimizing the time allocation between the anti-coincidence vectors. Analysis
on the data obtained in the experiment verified the advantage of the
entanglement test designed by the optimal time allocation.
