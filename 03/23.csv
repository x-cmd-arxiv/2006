that a Schechter function is not an ideal fit to the true luminosity

magnetic stars, we define a larger and bias-free sample of Ap and Bp stars with
accurate Hipparcos parallaxes and reliably determined longitudinal magnetic

usually employed in computing the white dwarf luminosity function and other
methods have not been applied so far to the observational sample of
spectroscopically identified white dwarfs. Moreover, the statistical
significance of the white dwarf luminosity function has also received little
attention and a thorough study still remains to be done. In this paper we
study, using a controlled synthetic sample of white dwarfs generated using a
Monte Carlo simulator, which is the statistical significance of the white dwarf
luminosity function and which are the expected biases. We also present a
comparison between different estimators for computing the white dwarf
luminosity function. We find that for sample sizes large enough the V/Vmax
method provides a reliable characterization of the white dwarf luminosity
function, provided that the input sample is selected carefully. Particularly,
the V/Vmax method recovers well the position of the cut-off of the white dwarf
luminosity function. However, this method turns out to be less robust than the
Choloniewski method when the possible incompletenesses of the sample are taken
into account. We also find that the Choloniewski method performs better than
the V/Vmax method in estimating the overall density of white dwarfs, but misses
the exact location of the cut-off of the white dwarf luminosity function.

defined as the star-formation rate per unit stellar mass, as a function of
integrated stellar mass for samples of field galaxies, groups of galaxies, and
galaxy clusters at 0.18 < z < 0.85. The star formation rate (SFR) is derived
from the ultraviolet continuum for the galaxies and group members, and from
emission line fluxes for the cluster galaxies. The stellar masses are computed
from multi-band photometry including the near-infrared bands for the galaxies

  Results: For the first time, integrated SSFRs for clusters and groups are
presented and related to the SSFRs of field galaxies. Tentatively, we find a
continuous upper limit for galaxies, groups, and clusters in the SSFR-stellar
mass plane over seven orders of magnitude in stellar mass. This might indicate
that the physical processes which control star formation in dark matter haloes

with upper limits from KASCADE and CASA-MIA ground arrays at PeV energies. Such
a long ""lever arm"", spanning at least six orders of magnitude in energy,
reveals a ""TeV excess"" in the diffuse Galactic Plane gamma-ray spectrum. While
the origin of this excess is unknown, it likely implies also enhanced TeV
neutrino fluxes, significantly improving the prospects for their detection. We
show that unresolved point sources are a possible source of the TeV excess. In
fact, the spectra of the unidentified EGRET sources in the Milagro region must
break between ~10 GeV and ~1 TeV to avoid strongly overshooting the Milagro
measurement; this may have important implications for cosmic-ray acceleration.
  Finally, we use our approach to examine the recent suggestion that
dark-matter annihilation may account for the observed excess in diffuse
Galactic gamma-rays detected by EGRET at energies above 1 GeV. Within our

out; however we point out how a long ""lever arm"" can be used to constrain the

substellar objects targeted in a deep millimeter continuum survey to date.
Under standard assumptions, the masses of brown dwarf disks range from ~<0.4 to
several Jupiter masses. Their relative disk masses are comparable to those
derived for coeval low-mass stars: most of them are in the ~<1-5% range, and
there is no clear change of relative disk mass with object mass from 0.015 to 3
solar masses. Specifically, we do not find evidence for disk truncation, as
would be expected in the ejection scenario for brown dwarf origin, although the
signature of ejection may be hidden in our non-detections. We use the derived
mm fluxes, complemented by mid-infrared data from the Spitzer Space Telescope
and ground-based near-infrared images, to construct spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) for six of our sources, and model those SEDs with a Monte
Carlo radiative transfer code. While the model fits are by no means unique,
they allow us to investigate disk properties such as the degree of flaring and
minimum radii. In several cases, we find that the SEDs in the mid-infrared
exhibit lower flux levels than predicted by hydrostatic models, implying dust
settling to the disk midplane. What's more, at least 25% of our targets are
likely to have disks with radii >10 AU; models with smaller disks cannot
reproduce the mm fluxes even if they are very massive. This finding is in
contrast to the results of some simulations of the ejection scenario for brown
dwarf formation that suggest only ~5% of ejected objects would harbor disks
larger than 10 AU. Our findings imply that ejection is probably not the
dominant formation process, but may still be relevant for some brown dwarfs.

that SS UMi entered a period of untypical behavior manifested by a growth in
the quiescent magnitude of the star and a series of frequent, low-amplitude,
normal outbursts observed from July to September 2004.

OIII emission lines to determine diagnostic line ratios, oxygen abundances, and
extinction-corrected star formation rates. The star-forming galaxies in
intermediate-redshift clusters display emission line equivalent widths which
are, on average, significantly smaller than measured for field galaxies at
comparable redshifts. However, a contrasting fraction of our cluster galaxies
have equivalent widths similar to the highest observed in the field. This
tentatively suggests a bimodality in the star-formation rates per unit
luminosity for galaxies in distant clusters. We find no evidence for further
bimodalities, or differences between our cluster and field samples, when
examining additional diagnostics and the oxygen abundances of our galaxies.
This maybe because no such differences exist, perhaps because the cluster
galaxies which still display signs of star-formation have recently arrived from
the field. In order to examine this topic with more certainty, and to further
investigate the way in which any disparity varies as a function of cluster
properties, larger spectroscopic samples are needed.

highly ionized gas called ""Warm Absorber"" (WA). Such a material appears to be
stratified, displaying zones of different density, temperature, and ionization.
In this paper, we investigate the possibility of modelling the WA gas in NGC
3783 as a single medium in total pressure equilibrium, in contrast to the
current descriptions that are based on the presence of multiple regions, each
in constant density. The assumption of total pressure equilibrium yields a more
physical description of the WA, resulting in the natural stratification of the
ionized gas, and providing an explanation for the presence of lines from
different ionization states, as observed in WA spectra. We have used the
photoionization code TITAN to compute a grid of constant total pressure models
with the purpose of fitting the WA in NGC 3783. We have compared our models to
the 900 ks Chandra spectrum of NGC 3783 and to previous studies where the WA
was described by multiple zones of constant density. Our results show that the
WA features in NGC 3783 can be well reproduced by a clumpy, ionized gas with
cosmic abondances, ionization parameter = 2500 erg cm s^-1, column density = 4
10^22 cm^-2, and constant total pressure. We have shown that the WA in NGC3783
can be modelled by a single medium in total pressure equilibrium; this is
probably the case for other WAs currently described by multi-zone, constant
density models.

local energies are allocated. At each time step, a region is randomly chosen
and a new local energy is drawn from a distribution that self-consistently
depends on the global energy of the system. Then, the transition is accepted or
not according to the Metropolis rule. Within this scheme, we model an energy
threshold leading to a mode-coupling glass transition as in the p-spin model.
The glassy dynamics is characterized by a two-step relaxation of the energy
autocorrelation function. The aging scaling is fully determined by the
evolution of the global energy and linear violations of the fluctuation

Assuming first that the equilibirum state has long-range phase order, the
effective action $\mathcal{S}_{eff}$ is derived perturbatively for small
fluctuations within a path integral formalism, in the presence of the Coulomb

$\mathcal{S}_{eff}$ is performed in terms of a gradient expansion which only
assumes that the gradients of the order parameter are small whereas the value
of the phase may be large. We show that in the phase-only approximation the

of semi-grandcanonical Monte Carlo (SGMC) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) methods
near a liquid-liquid critical temperature $T_c$. Choosing equal chemical
potentials for the two species, the SGMC switches identities (${\rm A} \to {\rm
B} \to {\rm A}$) to generate well-equilibrated configurations of the system on
the coexistence curve for $T<T_c$ and at the critical concentration, $x_c=1/2$,
for $T>T_c$. A finite-size scaling analysis of the concentration susceptibility
above $T_c$ and of the order parameter below $T_c$ is performed, varying the
number of particles from N=400 to 12800. The data are fully compatible with the
expected critical exponents of the three-dimensional Ising universality class.
  The equilibrium configurations from the SGMC runs are used as initial states
for microcanonical MD runs, from which transport coefficients are extracted.
Self-diffusion coefficients are obtained from the Einstein relation, while the
interdiffusion coefficient and the shear viscosity are estimated from
Green-Kubo expressions. As expected, the self-diffusion constant does not
display a detectable critical anomaly. With appropriate finite-size scaling
analysis, we show that the simulation data for the shear viscosity and the
mutual diffusion constant are quite consistent both with the theoretically
predicted behavior, including the critical exponents and amplitudes, and with
the most accurate experimental evidence.

Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanics. This important physical theory has been
generalized \cite{Tsallis1988} in 1988 by using the entropy $S_q =
\frac{1-\sum_i p_i^q}{q-1}$ (with $q \in \mathcal{R}$) instead of its
particular BG case $S_1=S_{BG}= -\sum_i p_i \ln p_i$. The theory which emerges
is usually referred to as {\it nonextensive statistical mechanics} and recovers
the standard theory for $q=1$. During the last two decades, this
$q$-generalized statistical mechanics has been successfully applied to a
considerable amount of physically interesting complex phenomena. A
conjecture\cite{Tsallis2005} and numerical indications available in the
literature have been, for a few years, suggesting the possibility of
$q$-versions of the standard central limit theorem by allowing the random
variables that are being summed to be strongly correlated in some special
manner, the case $q=1$ corresponding to standard probabilistic independence.
This is what we prove in the present paper for $1 \leq q<3$. The attractor, in
the usual sense of a central limit theorem, is given by a distribution of the
form $p(x) =C_q [1-(1-q) \beta x^2]^{1/(1-q)}$ with $\beta>0$, and normalizing
constant $C_q$. These distributions, sometimes referred to as $q$-Gaussians,
are known to make, under appropriate constraints, extremal the functional $S_q$
(in its continuous version). Their $q=1$ and $q=2$ particular cases recover
respectively Gaussian and Cauchy distributions.

introduce the Method of Hermitization, which solves this problem. Then, for
rotationally invariant ensembles, I derive a master equation for the average
density of eigenvalues in the complex plane, in the limit of infinitely large
matrices. This is achieved by resumming all the planar diagrams which appear in
the perturbative expansion of the hermitized Green function. Remarkably, this
resummation can be carried {\em explicitly} for any rotationally invariant
ensemble. I prove that in the limit of infinitely large matrices, the shape of
the eigenvalue distribution is either a disk or an annulus. This is the
celebrated ``Single-Ring'' Theorem. Which of these shapes is realized is
determined by the parameters (coupling constants) which determine the ensemble.
By varying these parameters a phase transition may occur between the two
possible shapes. I briefly discuss the universal features of this transition.
As the analysis of this problem relies heavily on summation of planar Feynman
diagrams, I take special effort at presenting a pedagogical exposition of the
diagrammatic method, which some readers may find useful.

how these continuums transform during the process of optimal complex

paradigm having its applications in low power computing, quantum computing,
nanotechnology, optical computing and DNA computing. The classical set of gates
such as AND, OR, and EXOR are not reversible. Recently, it has been shown how
to encode information in DNA and use DNA amplification to implement Fredkin
gates. Furthermore, in the past Fredkin gates have been constructed using DNA,
whose outputs are used as inputs for other Fredkin gates. Thus, it can be
concluded that arbitrary circuits of Fredkin gates can be constructed using
DNA. This paper provides the initial threshold to building of more complex
system having reversible sequential circuits and which can execute more
complicated operations. The novelty of the paper is the reversible designs of
sequential circuits using Fredkin gate. Since, Fredkin gate has already been
realized using DNA, it is expected that this work will initiate the building of
complex systems using DNA. The reversible circuits designed here are highly
optimized in terms of number of gates and garbage outputs. The modularization
approach that is synthesizing small circuits and thereafter using them to
construct bigger circuits is used for designing the optimal reversible

so that each block is separately encoded and decoded. As interleaving and
de-interleaving are performed within a block, the message-passing process
associated with an iterative decoder is limited to proceed within the
corresponding range. This paper presents a new turbo coding scheme that uses a
special interleaver structure and a multiple-round early termination test
involving both sign check and a CRC code. The new interleaver structure is
naturally suited for high speed parallel processing and the resulting coding
system offers new design options and tradeoffs that are not available to CTCs.
In particular, it becomes possible for the decoder to employ an efficient
inter-block collaborative decoding algorithm, passing the information obtained
from termination test proved blocks to other unproved blocks. It also becomes
important to have a proper decoding schedule. The combined effect is improved
performance and reduction in the average decoding delay (whence the required
computing power). A memory (storage) management mechanism is included as a
critical part of the decoder so as to provide additional design tradeoff
between performance and memory size. It is shown that the latter has a
modular-like effect in that additional memory units render enhanced performance
due not only to less forced early terminations but to possible increases of the
interleaving depth. Depending on the decoding schedule, the degree of
parallelism and other decoding resources available, the proposed scheme admits
a variety of decoder architectures that meet a large range of throughput and
performance demands.

Several physical properties and characteristics of these solutions are further

formation and evaporation of black holes. Taking Feynman's $+i\epsilon$
prescription, rather than than one of the more usual approaches, we calculated
the quantum amplitude (not just the probability density) for final weak-field
configurations following gravitational collapse to a black hole with subsequent
evaporation. What we have done is to find quantum amplitudes relating to a pure
state at late times following black-hole matter collapse. Such pure states are
then shown to be susceptible to a description in terms of coherent and squeezed
states - in practice, this description is not very different from that for the
well-known highly-squeezed final state of the relic radiation background in
inflationary cosmology. The simplest such collapse model involves Einstein
gravity with a massless scalar field. The Feynman approach involves making the
boundary-value problem for gravity and a massless scalar field well-posed. To
define this, let T be the proper-time separation, measured at spatial infinity,
between two space-like hypersurfaces on which initial (collapse) and final
(evaporation) data are posed. Then, in this approach, one rotates T by a
complex phase exp(-i\delta) into the lower half-plane. In an adiabatic
approximation, the resulting quantum amplitude may be expressed in terms of
generalised coherent states of the quantum oscillator, and a physical
interpretation is given. A squeezed-state representation, as above, then
follows.

small $m_A$. As a result, there is a natural interplay between the heavy,
neutral Higgs searches at the Tevatron and the region of parameter space
explored by CDMS. We show that if the lightest neutralino makes up the dark
matter of our universe, current limits from CDMS strongly constrain the
prospects of heavy, neutral MSSM Higgs discovery at the Tevatron (at 3 sigma
with 4 fb^-1 per experiment) unless $|\mu| \gsim$ 400 GeV. The limits of CDMS
projected for 2007 will increase this constraint to $|\mu| \gsim$ 800 GeV. On
the other hand, if CDMS does observe neutralino dark matter in the near future,
it will make the discovery of heavy, neutral MSSM Higgs bosons far more likely
at the Tevatron.

into account the relative momentum of the heavy-quark and antiquark in the

of magnitude larger than existing NRQCD factorization results. We investigate
this apparent theoretical discrepancy. We compute light-cone distribution
functions by making use of quarkonium wave functions from the Cornell potential

Ref. [A. E. Bondar and V. L. Chernyak, Phys. Lett. B 612, 215 (2005)] and yield
a similar cross section. However, when we subtract parts of the light-cone
distribution functions that correspond to corrections of relative-order alpha_s
in the NRQCD approach, we find that the cross section decreases by about a
factor of three. When we set certain renormalization factors Z_i in the
light-cone calculation equal to unity, we find a further reduction in the cross
section of about a factor of two. The resulting light-cone cross section is
similar in magnitude to the NRQCD factorization cross sections and shows only a
modest enhancement over the light-cone cross section in which the relative

of solutions only for the pure Einstein-Hilbert or Gauss-Bonnet Lagrangians,
but not for an arbitrary linear combination of them. Once these special cases
have been selected, the requirement of spherical symmetry is no longer relevant
since actually any solution of the pure Einstein or pure Gauss-Bonnet theories
can then be toroidally extended to higher dimensions. Depending on $p$ and the
spacetime dimension, the metric on $M_{D-p}$ may describe a black hole or a
spacetime with a conical singularity, so that the whole spacetime describes a
black or a cosmic $p$-brane, respectively. For the purely Gauss-Bonnet theory
it is shown that, if $M_{D-p}$ is four-dimensional, a new exotic class of black
hole solutions exists, for which spherical symmetry can be relaxed.
  Under the same assumptions, it is also shown that simple compactifications
acquire a similar structure for a wide class of theories among the Lovelock
family which accepts this toroidal extension.

that a thermodynamical analogue of the Gregory-Laflamme transition always

Andreev's Theorem also shows that the resulting polyhedron is unique, up to

circularly polarized real photons and longitudinally polarized nucleons at the

generalized to the case of virtual photons. This allows to establish a Q^2

Ultimately, the GDH Sum Rule can be related to the Bjorken and the Ellis-Jaffe

Kaye effect which occurs when a thin stream of a solution of polyisobutylene in
Decalin is poured into a dish of the fluid. As pouring proceeds, a small stream
of liquid occasionally leaps upward from the heap. This surprising effect,
which lasts only a second or so, is named after its first observer A. Kaye, who
could offer no explanation for this behaviour. Later, Collyer and Fischer
suggested from 250 frames per second cine recordings that the fluid must be
highly shear thinning as well as elastic and 'pituitous'. In addition, they
concluded that a rigid surface is required to back the reflected liquid stream.
While the words bouncing and reflection are associated with non-continuous and
elastic effects, we will show here that the Kaye effect is in fact a continuous
flow phenomenon. We show that the Kaye effect works for many common fluids,
including shampoos and liquid soaps. We reveal its physical mechanism
(formation, stability and disruption) through high-speed imaging. The
measurements are interpreted with a simple theoretical model including only the
shear thinning behaviour of the liquid; elastic properties of the liquid play
no role. We show that the Kaye effect can be stable and that it can be
directed. We even demonstrate a stable Kaye effect on a thin soap film
excluding the necessity of a rigid backing surface.

a very large depth of field, meaning that they can keep a small beam width over

previous applications of Dx to methods for analysis and simulation of proteins
are first reviewed, and their implications for understanding aspects of protein
function and protein evolution are discussed. Next, equations for Dx suggest
that k_{B}TDx should be interpreted as an allosteric free energy -- the free

interpretation leads to a thermodynamic model of allosteric transitions that
unifies existing perspectives on the relation between ligand binding and
changes in protein conformational distributions. The definition of Dx is used
to explore some interesting mathematical relations among commonly recognized
thermodynamic and biophysical quantities, such as the total free energy change
upon ligand binding, and ligand-binding affinities for individual protein
conformations. These results represent the beginnings of a theoretical
framework for considering the full protein conformational distribution in

to the indispensability of proteins for living cells is the fact that a given

by the proteins sequence of amino acids. Over the past several decades,
structural biologists have demonstrated that the array of structures that
proteins may adopt is quite astounding, and this has lead to a strong interest

review we consider a large body of recent work that attempts to illuminate this
structure-centric picture of protein evolution. Much of this work has focused
on the question of how completely new protein structures (i.e. new folds or
topologies) are discovered by protein sequences as they evolve. Pursuant to
this question of structural innovation has been a desire to describe and
understand the observation that certain types of protein structures are far
more abundant than others and how this uneven distribution of proteins
implicates on the process through which new shapes are discovered. We consider
a number of theoretical models that have been successful at explaining this
heterogeneity in protein populations and discuss the increasing amount of

divergence of protein sequences and structures from one another.

rough scatterer/absorber. The analysis is based on a recently developed theory
of quantum transport along random rough walls which is modified in order to
include leaky (absorbing) interfaces and, more importantly, the low-amplitude
high-aperture roughness. The calculations are focused on a regime when the
direct transitions into the continuous spectrum above the absorption threshold
dominate the depletion of neutrons from the gravitational states and are more
efficient than the processes involving the intermediate states. The theoretical
results for the neutron count are sensitive to the correlation radius (lateral
size) of surface inhomogeneities and to the ratio of the particle energy to the
absorption threshold in a weak roughness limit. The main impediment for
observation of the higher gravitational states is the ""overhang"" of the
particle wave functions which can be overcome only by use scatterers with
strong roughness. In general, the strong roughness with high amplitude is
preferable if one wants just to detect the individual gravitational states,
while the strong roughness experiments with small amplitude and high aperture
are preferable for the quantitative analysis of the data. We also discuss the
ways to further improve the accuracy of calculations and to optimize the

Hellmann potential, which represents the superposition of the attractive
Coulomb potential $-a/r$ and the Yukawa potential $b\exp (-\delta r)/r$ of
arbitrary strength $b$ and screening parameter $\delta $. Although the analytic
expressions for the energy eigenvalues $E_{n,l\text{}}$ yield quite accurate
results for a wide range of $n,\ell $ in the limit of very weak screening, the
results become gradually worse as the strength $b$ and the screening
coefficient $\delta $ increase. This is because that the expansion parameter is
not sufficiently small enough to guarantee the convergence of the expansion
series for the energy levels.

simple proofs of the Bell-Kochen-Specker (BKS) theorem in Hilbert spaces of
dimensions four and eight by making use of what has since been referred to as
the Mermin(-Peres) ""magic square"" and the Mermin pentagram, respectively. The
former is a $3 \times 3$ array of nine observables commuting pairwise in each
row and column and arranged so that their product properties contradict those
of the assigned eigenvalues. The latter is a set of ten observables arranged in
five groups of four lying along five edges of the pentagram and characterized
by similar contradiction. An interesting one-to-one correspondence between the
operators of the Mermin-Peres square and the points of the projective line over
the product ring ${\rm GF}(2) \otimes \rm{GF}(2)$ is established. Under this
mapping, the concept ""mutually commuting"" translates into ""mutually distant""
and the distinguishing character of the third column's observables has its
counterpart in the distinguished properties of the coordinates of the
corresponding points, whose entries are both either zero-divisors, or units.
The ten operators of the Mermin pentagram answer to a specific subset of points
of the line over GF(2)[$x$]/$<x^{3} - x>$. The situation here is, however, more
intricate as there are two different configurations that seem to serve equally
well our purpose. The first one comprises the three distinguished points of the
(sub)line over GF(2), their three ""Jacobson"" counterparts and the four points
whose both coordinates are zero-divisors; the other features the neighbourhood
of the point ($1, 0$) (or, equivalently, that of ($0, 1$)). Some other ring
lines that might be relevant for BKS proofs in higher dimensions are also
mentioned.

and quantum field theory is a natural framework that overcomes the problem of
""instantaneous collapse"" in entangled systems that exhibit nonlocalities. The
corresponding Bohmian interpretation can also be formulated in terms of MFT
beables, which alleviates the problem of instantaneous action at a distance by
using an ontology that differs from that in the standard Bohmian
interpretation. The appearance of usual single-time particle-positions and
fields is recovered by quantum measurements.

macroscopic samples by observing only the collective properties of the
ensembles? Using only a few experimentally feasible collective properties, we
establish an entanglement measure between two samples of spin-1/2 particles (as
representatives of two-dimensional quantum systems). This is a tight lower
bound for the average entanglement between all pairs of spins in general and is
equal to the average entanglement for a certain class of systems. We compute
the entanglement measures for explicit examples and show how to generalize the
method to more than two samples and multi-partite entanglement.

algorithm with ""bit queries"". The other is to use ""dubit queries"" on a duality
computer - a new computing model uses a quantum system's wave-particle duality,
which is able to achieve even greater computing power and better capability
than existent quantum computers we have been discussing. We discuss the
shortages and difficulties of both schemes as well.
