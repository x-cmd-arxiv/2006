  original (png) format as well as ps format for ps/pdf generation",,"10.1016/j.newast.2005.11.006",,"astro-ph",,"  Star formation rates on the galactic scale are described phenomenologically
by two distinct relationships, as emphasized recently by Elmegreen (2002). The
first of these is the Schmidt law, which is a power-law relation between the
star formation rate and the column density. The other relationship is that
there is a cutoff in the gas density below which star formation shuts off.
  The purpose of this paper is to argue that 1) these two relationships can be
accommodated by a single functional form of the Schmidt law, and 2) this
functional form is motivated by the hypothesis that star formation is a
critical phenomenon, and that as a corollary, 3) the existence of a sharp
cutoff may thus be an emergent property of galaxies, as was argued by Seiden
(1983), as opposed to the classical view that this cutoff is due to an
instability criterion.

integrating the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic equations of motion to

This study extends previous similar work by studying jets till $t\approx
10^4GM/c^3$ out to $r\approx 10^4GM/c^2$, by which the jet is super- fast
magnetosonic and moves at a lab-frame bulk Lorentz factor of $\Gamma\sim 10$
with a maximum terminal Lorentz factor of $\Gamma_\infty\lesssim 10^3$. The
radial structure of the Poynting-dominated jet is piece-wise self-similar, and
fits to flow quantities along the field line are provided. Beyond the \alf
surface at $r\sim 10$--$100GM/c^2$, the jet becomes marginally unstable to (at
least) current-driven instabilities. Such instabilities drive shocks in the jet
that limit the efficiency of magnetic acceleration and collimation. These
instabilities also induce jet substructure with $3\lesssim\Gamma\lesssim 15$.
The jet is shown to only marginally satisfy the necessary and sufficient
conditions for kink instability, so this may explain how astrophysical jets can
extend to large distances without completely disrupting. At large distance, the
jet angular structure is Gaussian-like (or uniform within the core with sharp
exponential wings) with a half-opening angle of $\approx 5^\circ$ and there is
an extended component out to $\approx 27^\circ$. Unlike in some hydrodynamic
simulations, the environment is found to play a negligible role in jet
structure, acceleration, and collimation as long as the ambient pressure of the
surrounding medium is small compared to the magnetic pressure in the jet.

2002kg reached a maximum brightness of $\mathrm{M_{V}=-9.6}$, much fainter than
normal type II SNe. The precursor of SN 2002kg is confirmed to be, as shown in
previous work, the LBV NGC2403-V37. Strong $\mathrm{Fe II}$ lines are observed
in the spectra of SN 2002kg, similar to both the LBV NGC2363-V1 and the type

Balmer emission lines, which at the observed resolution, appear similar to SN
2000ch. On the basis of the post-discovery photometric and spectroscopic
observations presented here we suggest that SN 2003gm is a similar event to SN

the haloes hosting the 2<z<3 sample will likely host the richest clusters of

host poor to rich clusters at z=0. We conclude that ULIRGs at z>1 signpost

an estimated accuracy dz/(1+z) ~ 0.001-0.04. These redshifts agree well with
the emission line redshifts for the 2 galaxies with Halpha emission. This
technique is particularly important for galaxies that are faint in the
rest-frame UV, as they are underrepresented in high redshift samples selected
in optical surveys and are too faint for optical spectroscopy. Furthermore, we
use the break, continuum shape, and equivalent width of Halpha together with
evolutionary synthesis models to constrain the age, star formation timescale,
dust content, stellar mass and star formation rate of the galaxies. Inclusion
of the NIR spectra in the stellar population fits greatly reduces the range of
possible solutions for stellar population properties. We find that the stellar
populations differ greatly among the three galaxies, ranging from a young dusty
starburst with a small break and strong emission lines to an evolved galaxy

mystery. Standard assumption is that the collisionless cold dark matter (CCDM)
particles are represented by some weakly interacting fundamental fields which
can not be associated with any standard quarks or leptons. However, recent
analyses of structure on galactic and sub-galactic scales have suggested
discrepancies and stimulated numerous alternative proposals including, e.g.
Self-Interacting dark matter, Self-Annihilating dark matter, Decaying dark
matter, to name just a few. We propose the alternative to the standard
assumption about the nature of DM particles (which are typically assumed to be
weakly interacting fundamental point -like particles, yet to be discovered).
Our proposal is based on the idea that DM particles are strongly interacting
composite macroscopically large objects which made of well known light quarks
(or even antiquarks). The required weakness of the DM particle interactions is
guaranteed by a small geometrical factor of the composite objects with a large
baryon charge rather than by a weak coupling constant of a new field. We argue
that the interaction between hadronic matter and composite dark objects does
not spoil the desired properties of the latter as cold matter. We also argue
that such a scenario does not contradict to the current observational data.
Rather, it has natural explanations of many observed data, such as
$\Omega_{DM}/ \Omega_{B}\sim 1$ or $511 KeV$ line from the bulge of our galaxy.
We also suggest that composite dark matter may modify the dynamics of structure
formation in the central overdense regions of galaxies. We also present a
number of other cosmological/astrophysical observations which indirectly
support the novel concept of DM nature.

times the Earth's mass) forms first, then accretes its massive envelope (100 or
more Earth masses) of gas. However, inward planet migration due to
gravitational interaction with the proto-stellar gas disk poses a difficulty in
this model. Core-sized bodies undergo rapid ""Type I"" migration; for typical
parameters their migration timescale is much shorter than their accretion
timescale. How, then, do growing cores avoid spiraling into the central star
before they ever get the chance to become gas giants? Here, we present a simple
model of core formation in a gas disk which is viscously evolving. As the disk
dissipates, accretion and migration timescales eventually become comparable. If
this happens while there is still enough gas left in the disk to supply a
jovian atmosphere, then a window of opportunity for gas giant formation opens.
We examine under what circumstances this happens, and thus, what predictions
our model makes about the link between proto-stellar disk properties and the
likelihood of forming giant planets.

is consistent with observed number of galaxies in clusters such as the Virgo

V_c^-3, down to the reliability limit, independent of the mass of the main

much smaller number of subhalos in this regime simply because of their limited

radiation-pressure-driven thermal instability. When the mass-accretion rate
exceeds the critical one, an inner region of the standard accretion disk bursts
to change to a slim disk state having a large scale height. That is, the inner
region of the disk becomes high temperature, and the thickness of the disk
increases due to the increase of the radiation pressure. As a result, we found
that the observed image of the disk during the burst strongly depends on the
inclination angle. That is, radiation from the innermost disk would be occulted
by the disk outer rim for high inclination angles($i \gtrsim 70^\circ$). We
also calculated the spectral energy distribution during thermal instability.
The Wien peak of the spectrum of high inclination angles becomes softer than
that of low inclination angles due to the geometrical thickness. From these
facts, even if the burst happens in black hole candidates, we may not observe
the burst when the inclination angle is large. We may suggest that numerous
luminous black hole candidates are still hidden in our Galaxy.

In total, more than 20 resolved OH rotational lines, with upper energy levels

from pure absorption, P-Cygni type to pure emission. We also present a large

cusp-like shape in their top parts, where the upflowing plasma loses its
buoyancy. The resulting bright features in intensity images correspond well (in
terms of brightness, size, and lifetime) to the observed umbral dots in the
central parts of sunspot umbrae. Most of the simulated umbral dots have a
horizontally elongated form with a central dark lane. Above the cusp, most
plumes show narrow upflow jets, which are driven by the pressure of the
piled-up plasma below. The large velocities and low field strengths in the
plumes are effectively screened from spectroscopic observation because the
surfaces of equal optical depth are locally elevated, so that spectral lines
are largely formed above the cusp. Our simulations demonstrate that nearly
field-free upflow plumes and umbral dots are a natural result of convection in
a strong, initially monolithic magnetic field.

This is the first interferometric imaging of molecular gas in the most luminous

center of the merger with a strong gas concentration toward the double nucleus.
The gas disk having a mass of ~3*10^9 Msun in the central 3 kpc rotates around
a point between the two nuclei that are 850 pc apart on the sky. The molecular
gas is warm and turbulent and shows spatial variation of the intensity ratio
between CO isotopomers. High-velocity molecular gas is discovered at the
galactic center. Its velocity in our line of sight is up to 420 km/s offset
from the systemic velocity of the galaxy; the terminal velocity is twice as
large as that due to the rotation of the main gas disk. The high-velocity gas
is most likely due to a molecular outflow from the gas disk, entrained by the
starburst-driven superwind in the galaxy. The molecular outflow is estimated to
have a rate of ~10 Msun/yr and to play a significant role in the dispersal or
depletion of molecular gas from the galactic center. A compact gas
concentration and steep velocity gradient are also found around each of the
twin nuclei. They are suggestive of a small gas disk rotating around each
nucleus. If these are indeed mini-disks, their dynamical masses are ~10^9 Msun

the emission from Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe). The proposed method is based on
the addition, on top of the basic set of MHD equations, of an extra equation
describing the evolution of the maximum energy of the emitting particles. This
equation takes into account adiabatic and synchrotron losses along streamlines
for the distribution of emitting particles and its formulation is such that it
is easily implemented in any numerical scheme for relativistic MHD. Application
to the axisymmetric simulations of PWNe, analogous to those described by Del
Zanna et al. (2004, A&A, 421, 1063), allows direct comparison between the
numerical results and observations of the inner structure of the Crab Nebula,
and similar objects, in the optical and X-ray bands. We are able to match most
of the observed features typical of PWNe, like the equatorial torus and the
polar jets, with velocities in the correct range, as well as finer emission
details, like arcs, rings and the bright knot, that turn out to arise mainly
from Doppler boosting effects. Spectral properties appear to be well reproduced
too: detailed spectral index maps are produced for the first time and show
softening towards the PWN outer borders, whereas spectral breaks appear in
integrated spectra. The emission details are found to strongly depend on both
the average wind magnetization (here approximately 2%), and on the magnetic

Despite the diversity of ingredients, which include atoms, molecules, electrons

(called 'universality classes') represented by canonical spin models1. One kind
of transition, the Mott transition2, occurs when the repulsive Coulomb
interaction between electrons is increased, causing wave-like electrons to
behave as particles. In two dimensions, the attractive behaviour responsible
for the superconductivity in high-transition temperature copper oxide3,4 and

class to which two-dimensional, repulsive electronic systems belongs remains
unknown. Here we present an observation of the critical phenomena at the
pressure-induced Mott transition in a quasi-two-dimensional organic conductor

two dimensions is not consistent with known universality classes, as the
observed collective behaviour has previously not been seen. This peculiarity

L)^{-2d}$, with $d=0.13(2)$. We find no surface order, in clear contrast with
the behavior of the S=1 chain, where exponentially localized end spins induce
finite surface correlations. The lack of surface order implies that end spins
do not exist in the strict sense. However, the system possesses a
logarithmically weakly delocalizing boundary excitation, which, for any chain
lengths attainable numerically or even experimentally, creates the illusion of
an end spin. This mode is responsible for the first gap, which vanishes
asymptotically as $\Delta_1 \approx (\pi v_S d)/(L\ln L)$, where $v_S$ is the
sound velocity and $d$ is the logarithmic decay exponent. For the half-integer

support universality. Those for the second gap are less conclusive, due to

dependent canonical transformation, which amounts to a change of the basic
(scalar) field of the model, brings the system to a description in terms of a
Klein-Gordon equation on a background that is now static, although subject to a
time dependent potential. The system is quantized by means of a natural choice
of annihilation and creation operators. The quantum time evolution is
considered and shown to be unitary, allowing both the Schr\""odinger and
Heisenberg pictures to be consistently constructed. This has to be contrasted
with previous treatments for which time evolution failed to be implementable as
a unitary transformation. Possible implications for both canonical quantum

potential. This model is known to provide spontaneous breaking of chiral
symmetry in the vacuum via the standard selfenergy loops for valence quarks.
For highly excited hadrons, where the typical momentum of valence quarks is
large, the loop contributions represent only a small correction to the
chiral-invariant classical contributions and asymptotically vanish.
Consequently the chiral symmetry violating Lorentz-scalar dynamical mass of
quarks vanishes. Then the conservation of the axial vector current in the
chiral limit requires, via the Goldberger-Treiman relation, that the valence
quarks decouple from the Goldstone boson. As a consequence, the whole hadron
decouples from the Goldstone boson as well, which implies that its axial

non-archimedean local field $F$. We show that certain representations of open,
compact-mod-centre subgroups of $G$, (the maximal simple types of Bushnell and
Kutzko) can be realized as concrete spaces. In the level zero case our result
is essentially due to Gelfand. This allows us, for a supercuspidal
representation $\pi$ of $G$, to compute a distinguished matrix coefficient of
$\pi$. By integrating, we obtain an explicit Whittaker function for $\pi$. We
use this to compute the epsilon factor of pairs, for supercuspidal
representations $\pi_1$, $\pi_2$ of $G$, when $\pi_1$ and the contragredient of
$\pi_2$ differ only at the `tame level' (more precisely, $\pi_1$ and
$\check{\pi}_2$ contain the same simple character). We do this by computing
both sides of the functional equation defining the epsilon factor, using the
definition of Jacquet, Piatetskii-Shapiro, Shalika. We also investigate the
behaviour of the epsilon factor under twisting of $\pi_1$ by tamely ramified
quasi-characters. Our results generalise the special case $\pi_1=\check{\pi}_2$
totally wildly ramified, due to Bushnell and Henniart.

sets is represented by a simple closed curve. The n curves subdivide the plane
into 2^n open connected regions, each of which represents the intersection of
its containing curves' sets. For example, two overlapping circles can divide
the plane into 4 regions representing {}, A, B, and A intersect B. Three
overlapping circles can also be used to represent the 2^3 ways in which 3 sets
can intersect.
  One of the primary questions related to Venn diagrams concerns which shapes
can be used for the curves. The previous examples used 2 and 3 circles, but a
4-set Venn diagram cannot be represented by 4 circles; instead, ellipses must
be used.
  In this paper, we consider Venn diagrams whose curves are the outlines of
polyominoes. In particular, we give examples of Venn diagrams where the curves
are rotations and translations of a single polyomino, so-called congruent
polyVenn diagrams. We also consider the problem of area-minimization (relative
to a scaling factor) and present examples of Venn polyominoes which minimize
area according to various constraints.
  At present, these examples do not generalize and so we develop an algorithm
that comes close to minimizing the area. The algorithm is simple and utilizes
symmetric chain decompositions of the Boolean lattice. We also provide
asymptotic results that relate the area required by the algorithm's diagrams to
the theoretical minimum area. We conclude by presenting some open problems
related to Venn polyominoes and other shape-constrained Venn diagrams.

matrix is called a quasi-information matrix (QUIM). The QUIM plays an important
role in evaluating the asymptotic covariance matrix of the estimators of the

two ways to estimate the information matrix: the estimated information matrix
and the observed one. Because the analytic form of the QUIM involves parameters
other than the variance components, for example, the third and fourth moments
of the random effects, the estimated QUIM is not available. On the other hand,
because of the dependence and nonnormality of the data, the observed QUIM is
inconsistent. We propose an estimator of the QUIM that consists partially of an
observed form and partially of an estimated one. We show that this estimator is
consistent and computationally very easy to operate. The method is used to
derive large sample tests of statistical hypotheses that involve the variance
components in a non-Gaussian mixed linear model. Finite sample performance of
the test is studied by simulations and compared with the delete-group jackknife

used for describing three-dimensional shapes. These models are based on a
Fourier expansion of a function defined on the unit sphere in terms of
spherical harmonic basis functions. In particular, it is demonstrated that the
uniform distribution on the sphere is optimal with respect to all $\Phi_p$
criteria proposed by Kiefer in 1974 and also optimal with respect to a
criterion which maximizes a $p$ mean of the $r$ smallest eigenvalues of the
variance--covariance matrix. This criterion is related to principal component
analysis, which is the common tool for analyzing this type of image data.
Moreover, discrete designs on the sphere are derived, which yield the same
information matrix in the spherical harmonic regression model as the uniform
distribution and are therefore directly implementable in practice. It is
demonstrated that the new designs are substantially more efficient than the
commonly used designs in three-dimensional shape analysis.

  Space-time Theory with Variable Scales","9 pages, 4 figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  It is proved by means of the dynamical effects of special relativity that
velocity caused by accelerating process is not a relative concept. The
influence of accelerating process should be considered in space-time theory.
Besides the Newtonian absolute space-time theory with invariable space-time
scales and the Einstein relative space-time theory with variable space-time
scales, there exists the third space-time theory, i.e., the absolute space-time
theory with variable space-time scales. At present, special relativity is
divided into two parts, kinematics and dynamics. In kinematics, force and
acceleration are not considered so that space and time becomes relative
concepts. This division is completely artificial and irrational. The rational
space-time theory should be established on the foundation of dynamics
consistently. The changing rules of space, time and mass with speed should be
dependent of accelerating processes and with absolute significance. The real
meaning of invariability principle of high speed should be that we can not make
the speed of an object speed with rest mass reach and exceed the speed of light
in vacuum by the method of accelerating object. It is proved that the
absolutely resting reference frame exists. In order to eliminate multifarious
space-time paradoxes in special relativity, and coincide with Big-bang
cosmology, the absolutely resting frame is necessary. A method is put forward
to look for the absolutely resting reference frame. The isotropy reference
frame of cosmic microwave background radiation can be regarded as the
absolutely resting reference frame actually at present.

appropriate probabilities can be treated as `generous' strategy: it provides
maximal accessible information about the state. Another extremity is the
so-called `Scrooge' ensemble, which is mostly stingy to share the information.
We introduce `lazy' ensembles which require minimal efforts to prepare the
density matrix by selecting pure states with respect to completely random
choice.
  We consider two parties, Alice and Bob, playing a kind of game. Bob wishes to
guess which pure state is prepared by Alice. His null hypothesis, based on the
lack of any information about Alice's intention, is that Alice prepares any
pure state with equal probability. Then, the average quantum state measured by
Bob turns out to be $\rho$, and he has to make a new hypothesis about Alice's
intention solely based on the information that the observed density matrix is
$\rho$. The arising `lazy' ensemble is shown to be the alternative hypothesis
which minimizes the Type I error.
